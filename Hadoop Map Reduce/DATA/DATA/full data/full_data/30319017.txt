30319017	the daisy chain or aspirations  by charlotte yonge     preface   no one can be more sensible than is the author that the present is an overgrown book of a nondescript class neither the tale for the young nor the novel for their elders but a mixture of both  begun as a series of conversational sketches the story outran both the original intention and the limits of the periodical in which it was commenced and such as it has become it is here presented to those who have already made acquaintance with the may family and may be willing to see more of them it would beg to be considered merely as what it calls itself a family chroniclea domestic record of home events large and small during those years of early life when the character is chiefly formed and as an endeavour to trace the effects of those aspirations which are a part of every youthful nature that the young should take one hint to think whether their hopes and upwardbreathings are truly upwards and founded in lowliness may be called the moral of the tale  for those who may deem the story too long and the characters too numerous the author can only beg their pardon for any tedium that they may have undergone before giving it up feb 22nd 1856      the daisy chain     part 1    chapter i         si douce est la margueritechaucer    miss winter are you busy do you want this afternoon can you take a good long walk  ethel my dear how often have i told you of your impetuosityyou have forgotten  very wellwith an impatient twisti beg your pardon goodmorning miss winter said a thin lank angular sallow girl just fifteen trembling from head to foot with restrained eagerness as she tried to curb her tone into the requisite civility  goodmorning ethel goodmorning flora said the prim middleaged daily governess taking off her bonnet and arranging the stiff little rolls of curl at the long narrow lookingglass the border of which distorted the countenance  goodmorning properly responded flora a pretty fair girl nearly two years older than her sister  will you began to burst from etheldreds lips again but was stifled by miss winters inquiry is your mamma pretty well today  oh very well said both at once she is coming to the reading and flora added papa is going to drive her out today  i am very glad and the baby  i do believe she does it on purpose whispered ethel to herself wriggling fearfully on the wide windowseat on which she had precipitated herself and kicking at the bar of the table by which manifestation she of course succeeded in deferring her hopes by a reproof which caused her to draw herself into a rigid melancholy attitude a sort of penance of decorum but a rapid motion of the eyelids a tendency to crack the joints of the fingers and an unquietness at the ends of her shoes betraying the restlessness of the digits therein contained  it was such a room as is often to be found in old country town houses the two large windows looking out on a broad oldfashioned street through heavy framework and panes of glass scratched with various names and initials the walls were painted blue the skirting almost a third of the height and so wide at the top as to form a narrow shelf the fireplace constructed in the days when fires were made to give as little heat as possible was ornamented with blue and white dutch tiles bearing marvellous representations of scripture history and was protected by a very tall green guard the chairs were much of the same date solid and heavy the seats in faded carpetwork but there was a sprinkling of lesser ones and of stools a piano a globe a large table in the middle of the room with three desks on it a small one and a light cane chair by each window and loaded bookcases flora began if you dont want this afternoon to yourself  ethel was on her feet and openmouthed oh miss winter if you would be so kind as to walk to cocksmoor with us  to cocksmoor my dear exclaimed the governess in dismay  yes yes but hear cried ethel it is not for nothing yesterday  no the day before interposed flora  there was a poor man brought into the hospital he had been terribly hurt in the quarry and papa says hell die he was in great distress for his wife has just got twins and there were lots of children before they want everythingfood and clothesand we want to walk and take it  we had a collection of clothes ready luckily said flora and we have a blanket and some tea and some arrowroot and a bit of bacon and mamma says she does not think it too far for us to walk if you will be so kind as to go with us  miss winter looked perplexed how could you carry the blanket my dear  oh we have settled that said ethel we mean to make the donkey a sumptermule so if you are tired you may ride home on her  but my dear has your mamma considered they are such a set of wild people at cocksmoor i dont think we could walk there alone  it is saturday said ethel we can get the boys  if you would reflect a little they would be no protection harry would be getting into scrapes and you and mary running wild  i wish richard was at home said flora  i know cried ethel mr ernescliffe will come i am sure he can walk so far now ill ask him  ethel had clapped after her the heavy door with its shining brass lock before miss winter well knew what she was about and the governess seemed annoyed ethel does not consider said she i dont think your mamma will be pleased  why not said flora  my deara gentleman walking with you especially if margaret is going  i dont think he is strong enough said flora but i cant think why there should be any harm papa took us all out walking with him yesterdaylittle aubrey and all and mr ernescliffe went  but my dear  she was interrupted by the entrance of a fine tall blooming girl of eighteen holding in her hand a pretty little maid of five goodmorning miss winter i suppose flora has told you the request we have to make to you  yes my dear margaret but did your mamma consider what a lawless place cocksmoor is  that was the doubt said margaret but papa said he would answer for it nothing would happen to us and mamma said if you would be so kind  it is unlucky began the governess but stopped at the incursion of some newcomers nearly tumbling over each other ethel at the head of them oh harry as the gathers of her frock gave way in the rude grasp of a twelveyearold boy miss winter tis all rightmr ernescliffe says he is quite up to the walk and will like it very much and he will undertake to defend you from the quarrymen  is miss winter afraid of the quarrymen hallooed harry shall i take a club  ill take my gun and shoot them valiantly exclaimed tom and while threats were passing among the boys margaret asked in a low voice did you ask him to come with us  yes he said he should like it of all things papa was there and said it was not too far for himbesides theres the donkey papa says it so we must go miss winter  miss winter glanced unutterable things at margaret and ethel began to perceive she had done something wrong flora was going to speak when margaret trying to appear unconscious of a certain deepening colour in her own cheeks pressed a hand on her shoulder and whispering ill see about it dont say any more please glided out of the room  whats in the wind said harry are many of your reefs out there ethel  harry can talk nothing but sailors language said flora and i am sure he did not learn that of mr ernescliffe you never hear slang from him  but arent we going to cocksmoor asked mary a blunt downright girl of ten  we shall know soon said ethel i suppose i had better wait till after the reading to mend that horrid frock  i think so since we are so nearly collected said miss winter and ethel seating herself on the corner of the windowseat with one leg doubled under her took up a shakespeare holding it close to her eyes and her brother norman who in age came between her and flora kneeling on one knee on the windowseat and supporting himself with one arm against the shutter leaned over her reading it too disregarding a tumultuous skirmish going on in that division of the family collectively termed the boys namely harry mary and tom until tom was suddenly pushed down and tumbled over into ethels lap thereby upsetting her and norman together and there was a general downfall and a loud scream the sphynx  youve crushed it cried harry dealing out thumps indiscriminately  no here tis said mary rushing among them and bringing out a green sphynx caterpillar on her fingertis not hurt  pax pax cried norman over all with the voice of an authority as he leaped up lightly and set tom on his legs again harry you had better do that again he added warningly be off out of this window and let ethel and me read in peace  heres the place said ethelcrispin crispians day how i do like henry v  it is no use to try to keep those boys in order sighed miss winter  saturnalia as papa calls saturday replied flora  is not your eldest brother coming home today said miss winter in a low voice to flora who shook her head and said confidentially he is not coming till he has passed that examination he thinks it better not  here entered with a baby in her arms a lady with a beautiful countenance of calm sweetness looking almost too young to be the mother of the tall margaret who followed her there was a general hush as she greeted miss winter the girls crowding round to look at their little sister not quite six weeks old  now margaret will you take her up to the nursery said the mother while the impatient speech was repeated mamma can we go to cocksmoor  you dont think it will be too far for you said the mother to miss winter as margaret departed  oh no not at all thank you that was notbut margaret has explained  yes poor margaret said mrs may smiling she has settled it by choosing to stay at home with me it is no matter for the others and he is going on monday so that it will not happen again  margaret has behaved very well said miss winter  she has indeed said her mother smiling well harry how is the caterpillar  theyve just capsized it mamma answered harry and mary is making all taut  mrs may laughed and proceeded to advise ethel and norman to put away henry v and find the places in their bibles or you will have the things mixed together in your heads said she  in the meantime margaret with the little babe tomorrow to be her godchild lying gently in her arms came out into the matted hall and began to mount the broad shallowstepped staircase protected by low stout balusters with a very thick flat and solid mahogany handrail polished by the boys constant riding up and down upon it she was only on the first step when the diningroom door opened and there came out a young man slight and delicatelooking with bright blue eyes and thicklycurling light hair acting nurse he said smiling what an odd little face it is i didnt think little white babies were so pretty well i shall always consider myself as the real godfatherthe other is all a sham  i think so said margaret but i must not stand with her in a draught and on she went while he called after her so we are to have an expedition today  she did not gainsay it but there was a little sigh of disappointment and when she was out of hearing she whispered oh lucky baby to have so many years to come before you are plagued with troublesome propriety  then depositing her little charge with the nurse and trying to cheer up a solemnlooking boy of three who evidently considered his deposition from babyhood as a great injury she tripped lightly down again to take part in the saturdays reading and catechising  it was pleasant to see that large family in the hush and reverence of such teaching the mothers gentle power preventing the outbreaks of restlessness to which even at such times the wild young spirits were liable margaret and miss winter especially rejoiced in it on this occasion the first since the birth of the baby that she had been able to preside under her though seemingly without her taking any trouble there was none of the smothered laughing at the little mistakes the fidgeting of the boys or harrys audacious impertinence to miss winter and no less glad was harry to have his mother there and be guarded from himself  the catechism was repeated and a comment on the sunday services read aloud the gospel was that on the taking the lowest place and when they had finished ethel said i like the verse which explains that          they who now sit lowest here         when their master shall appear         he shall bid them higher rise         and be highest in the skies   i did not think of that being the meaning of when he that bade thee cometh said norman thoughtfully  it seemed to be only our worldly advantage that was meant before said ethel  well it means that too said flora  i suppose it does said mrs may but the higher sense is the one chiefly to be dwelt on it is a lesson how those least known and regarded here and humblest in their own eyes shall be the highest hereafter  and margaret looked earnestly at her mother but did not speak  may we go mamma said mary  yes you threeall of you indeed unless you wish to say any more  the boys availed themselves of the permission norman tarried to put his books into a neat leather case and ethel stood thinking it means altogetherit is a lesson against ambition said she  true said her mother the love of eminence for its own sake  and in so many different ways said margaret  ay worldly greatness riches rank beauty said flora  all sorts of false flash and nonsense and liking to be higher than one ought to be said norman i am sure there is nothing lower or more mean and shabby than getting places and praise a fellow does not deserve  oh yes cried ethel but no one fit to speak to would do that  plenty of people do i can tell you said norman  then i hope i shall never know who they are exclaimed ethel but ill tell you what i was thinking of mamma caring to be clever and get on only for the sake of beating people  i think that might be better expressed  i know said ethel bending her brow with the fullness of her thoughti mean caring to do a thing only because nobody else can do itwanting to be first more than wanting to do ones best  you are quite right my dear ethel said her mother and i am glad you have found in the gospel a practical lesson that should be useful to you both i had rather you did so than that you read it in greek though that is very nice too she added smiling as she put her hand on a little greek testament in which ethel had been reading it within her english bible now go and mend that deplorable frock and if you dont dream over it you wont waste too much of your holiday  ill get it done in no time cried ethel rushing headlong upstairs twice tripping in it before she reached the attic where she slept as well as flora and marya large room in the roof the windows gay with birdcages and flowers a canary singing loud enough to deafen any one but girls to whom headaches were unknown plenty of books and treasures and a very fine view from the dormer window of the town sloping downwards and the river winding away with some heathy hills in the distance poking and peering about with her shortsighted eyes ethel lighted on a workbasket in rare disorder pulled off her frock threw on a shawl and sat down crosslegged on her bed stitching vigorously while meantime she spouted with great emphasis an ode of horace which norman having learned by heart she had followed his example it being her great desire to be even with him in all his studies and though eleven months younger she had never yet fallen behind him on saturday he showed her what were his tasks for the week and as soon as her rent was repaired she swung herself downstairs in search of him for this purpose she found him in the drawingroom a pretty pleasant roomits only fault that it was rather too low it had windows opening down to the lawn and was full of pretty things works and knickknacks ethel found the state of affairs unfavourable to her norman was intent on a book on the sofa and at the table sat mr ernescliffe hard at work with calculations and mathematical instruments ethel would not for the world that any one should guess at her classical studiesshe scarcely liked to believe that even her father knew of them and to mention them before mr ernescliffe would have been dreadful so she only shoved norman and asked him to come  presently he said  what have you here said she poking her head into the book oh no wonder you cant leave off ive been wanting you to read it all the week  she read over him a few minutes then recoiled i forgot mamma told me not to read those stories in the morning only five minutes norman  wait a bit ill come  she fidgeted till mr ernescliffe asked norman if there was a table of logarithms in the house  oh yes she answered dont you know norman in a brown book on the upper shelf in the diningroom dont you remember papas telling us the meaning of them when we had the grand bookdusting  he was conscious of nothing but his book however she found the logarithms and brought them to mr ernescliffe staying to look at his drawing and asking what he was making out he replied smiling at the impossibility of her understanding but she wrinkled her brown forehead hooked her long nose and spent the next hour in amateur navigation  market stoneborough was a fine old town the minster grand with the architecture of the time of henry iii stood beside a broad river and round it were the buildings of a convent made by a certain good bishop whichcote the nucleus of a grammar school which had survived the reformation and trained up many good scholars among them one of englands princely merchants nicholas randall whose effigy knelt in a niche in the chancel wall scarletcloaked whiteruffed and black doubletted a desk bearing an open bible before him and a twisted pillar of derbyshire spar on each side he was the founder of thirteen almshouses and had endowed two scholarships at oxford the object of ambition of the stoneborough boys every eighteen months  there were about sixty or seventy boarders and the town boys slept at home and spent their weekly holiday there on saturdaythe happiest day in the week to the may family when alone they had the company at dinner of norman and harry otherwise known by their school names of june and july given them because their elder brother had begun the series of months as may  some two hundred years back a dr thomas may had been headmaster but ever since that time there had always been an m d not a d d in the family owning a comfortable demesne of spacious garden and field enough for two cows still green and intact among modern buildings and improvements  the present dr may stood very high in his profession and might soon have made a large fortune in london had he not held fast to his home attachments he was extremely skilful and clever with a boyish character that seemed as if it could never grow older ardent sensitive and heedless with a quickness of sympathy and tenderness of heart that was increased rather than blunted by exercise in scenes of suffering  at the end of the previous summer holidays dr may had been called one morning to attend a gentleman who had been taken very ill at the swan inn  he was received by a little boy of ten years old in much grief explaining that his brother had come two days ago from london to bring him to school here he had seemed unwell ever since they met and last night had become much worse and extremely ill the doctor found him a youth of two or three and twenty suffering under a severe attack of fever oppressed and scarcely conscious so as quite to justify his little brothers apprehensions he advised the boy to write to his family but was answered by a look that went to his heartalan was all he had in the worldfather and mother were dead and their relations lived in scotland and were hardly known to them  where have you been living then  alan sent me to school at miss lawlers when my mother died and there i have been ever since while he has been these three years and a half on the african station  what is he in the navy  yes said the boy proudly lieutenant ernescliffe he got his promotion last week my father was in the battle of trafalgar and alan has been three years in the west indies and then he was in the mediterranean and now on the coast of africa in the atalantis you must have heard about him for it was in the newspaper how when he was mate he had the command of the santa isabel the slaver they captured  the boy would have gone on for ever if dr may had not recalled him to his brothers present condition and proceeded to take every measure for the welfare and comfort of the forlorn pair he learned from other sources that the ernescliffes were well connected the father had been a distinguished officer but had been ill able to provide for his sons indeed he died without ever having seen little hector who was born during his absence on a voyagehis last and alans first alan the elder by thirteen years had been like a father to the little boy showing judgment and selfdenial that marked him of a high cast of character he had distinguished himself in encounters with slave ships and in command of a prize that he had had to conduct to sierra leone he had shown great coolness and seamanship in several perilous conjunctures such as a sudden storm and an encounter with another slaver when his portuguese prisoners became mutinous and nothing but his steadiness and intrepidity had saved the lives of himself and his few english companions he was in fact as dr may reported pretty much of a hero he had not at the time felt the effects of the climate but owing to sickness and death among the other officers he had suffered much fatigue and pressure of mind and body immediately on his return had followed his examination and though he had passed with great credit and it had been at once followed by wellearned promotion his nervous excitable frame had been overtasked and the consequence was a long and severe illness  the swan inn was not forty yards from dr mays back gate and at every spare moment he was doing the part of nurse as well as doctor professionally obliged to alan ernescliffe for bringing him a curious exotic specimen of fever and requiting him by the utmost care and attention while for their own sakes he delighted in the two boys with all the enthusiasm of his warm heart before the first week was at an end they had learned to look on the doctor as one of the kindest friends it had been their lot to meet with and alan knew that if he died he should leave his little brother in the hands of one who would comfort him as a father  no sooner was young ernescliffe able to sit up than dr may insisted on conveying him to his own house as his recovery was likely to be tedious in solitude at the swan it was not till he had been drawn in a chair along the sloping garden and placed on the sofa to rest that he discovered that the time the good doctor had chosen for bringing a helpless convalescent to his house was two days after an eleventh child had been added to his family  mrs may was too sorry for the solitary youth and too sympathising with her husband to make any objection though she was not fond of strangers and had some anxieties she had the utmost dependence on margarets discretion but there was a chance of awkward situations which papa was not likely to see or guard against however all seemed to do very well and no one ever came into her room without some degree of rapture about mr ernescliffe the doctor reiterated praises of his excellence his principle his ability and talent his amusing talk the girls were always bringing reports of his perfections norman retracted his grumbling at having his evenings spoiled and the boys were bursting with the secret that he was teaching them to rig a little ship that was to astonish mamma on her first coming downstairs and to be named after the baby while blanche did all the coquetry with him from which margaret abstained the universal desire was for mamma to see him and when the time came she owned that papas swan had not turned out a goose  there were now no grounds for prolonging his stay but it was very hard to go and he was glad to avail himself of the excuse of remaining for the christening when he was to represent the absent godfather after that he must go he had written to his scottish cousins to offer a visit and he had a promise that he should soon be afloat again no place would ever seem to him so like home as market stoneborough he was quite like one of themselves and took a full share in the discussions on the babys name which as all the old family appellations had been used up was an open question the doctor protested against alice and edith which he said were the universal names in the present day the boys hissed every attempt of their sisters at a romantic name and then harry wanted it to be atalantis at last dr may announced that he should have her named dowsabel if they did not agree and mrs may advised all the parties concerned to write their choice on a slip of paper and little aubrey should draw two out of her bag trusting that atalantis dowsabel would not come out as harry confidently predicted  however it was even worse aubreys two lots were gertrude and margaret ethel and mary made a vehement uproar to discover who could have written margaret and at last traced it home to mr ernescliffe who replied that flora without saying why had desired him to set down his favourite name he was much disconcerted and did not materially mend the matter by saying it was the first name that came into his head     chapter ii        meadows trim with daisies piedmilton   ethels navigation lesson was interrupted by the dinnerbell that long table was a goodly sight few ever looked happier than dr and mrs may as they sat opposite to each other presenting a considerable contrast in appearance as in disposition she was a little woman with that smooth pleasant plumpness that seems to belong to perfect content and serenity her complexion fair and youthful her face and figure very pretty and full of quiet grace and refinement and her whole air and expression denoting a serene unruffled affectionate happiness yet with much authority in her mildnesswarm and open in her own family but reserved beyond it and shrinking from general society  the doctor on the contrary had a lank bony figure nearly six feet high and looking more so from his slightness a face sallow thin and strongly marked an aquiline nose highly developed forehead and peculiar temples over which the hair strayed in thin curling flakes his eyes were light coloured and were seldom seen without his nearsighted spectacles but the expressions of the mouth were everythingso varying so bright and so sweet were his smiles that showed beautiful white teethmoreover his hand was particularly well made small and delicate and it always turned out that no one ever recollected that dr may was plain who had heard his kindly greeting  the sons and daughters were divided in likeness to father and mother ethel was almost an exaggeration of the doctors peculiarities especially at the formed but unsoftened age of fifteen norman had his long nose sallow complexion and tall figure but was much improved by his mothers fine blue eyes and was a very pleasantlooking boy though not handsome little tom was a thin white delicate edition of his father and blanche contrived to combine great likeness to him with a great deal of prettiness of those that as nurse said favoured their mamma margaret was tall and blooming with the same calm eyes but with the brilliance of her fathers smile flora had greater regularity of feature and was fast becoming a very pretty girl while mary and harry could not boast of much beauty but were stout sturdy pictures of health harrys locks in masses of small tight yellow curls much given to tangling and matting unfit to be seen all the week till nurse put him to torture every saturday by combing them out so as at least to make him for once like she said a gentleman instead of a young lion  little aubrey was said by his papa to be like nothing but the full moon and there he shone on them by his mammas side announcing in language few could understand where he had been with papa  he has been a small doctor said his father beginning to cut the boiled beef as fast as if his hands had been moved by machinery he has been with me to see old mrs robins and she made so much of him that if i take him again hell be regularly spoiled  poor old woman it must have been a pleasure to her said mrs mayit is so seldom she has any change  who is she asked mr ernescliffe  the butchers old mother said margaret who was next to him she is one of papas pet patients because he thinks her desolate and illused  her sons bully her said the doctor too intent on carving to perceive certain deprecatory glances of caution cast at him by his wife to remind him of the presence of man and maidand that smart daughter is worse still she never comes to see the old lady but she throws her into an agitated state fit to bring on another attack a meek old soul not fit to contend with them  why do they do it said ethel  for the cause of all evil that daughter marries a grazier and wants to set up for gentility she comes and squeezes presents out of her mother and the whole family are distrusting each other and squabbling over the spoil before the poor old creature is dead it makes one sick i gave that mrs thorn a bit of my mind at last i could not stand the sight any longer madam said i youll have to answer for your mothers death as sure as my names dick maya harpy dressed up in feathers and lace  there was a great laugh and an entreaty to know whether this was really his addressethel telling him she knew he had muttered it to himself quite audibly for which she was rewarded by a pretended box on the ear it certainly was vain to expect order at dinner on saturday for the doctor was as bad as the boys and mrs may took it with complete composure hardly appearing sensible of the babel which would sometimes almost deafen its promoter papa and yet her interference was allpowerful as now when harry and mary were sparring over the salt with one gentle mary and one reproving glance they were reduced to quiescence  meanwhile dr may in a voice above the tumult was telling maggie as he always called his wife some piece of news about mr rivers who had bought abbotstoke grange and alan ernescliffe in much lower tones saying to margaret how he delighted in the sight of these home scenes and this free household mirth  it is the first time you have seen us in perfection said margaret with mamma at the head of the tableno not quite perfection either without richard  i am very glad to have seen it repeated alan what a blessing it must be to your brothers to have such a home  yes indeed said margaret earnestly  i cannot fancy any advantage in life equal to it your father and mother so entirely one with you all  margaret smiled too much pleased to speak and glanced at her mothers sweet face  you cant think how often i shall remember it or how rejoiced i he broke off for the noise subsided and his speech was not intended for the public ear so he dashed into the general conversation and catching his own name exclaimed whats that base proposal ethel  to put you on the donkey said norman  they want to see a sailor riding interposed the doctor  dr may cried the indignant voice of hector ernescliffe as his honest scottish face flushed like a turkey cock i assure you that alan rides like  like a horse marine said norman  hector and harry both looked furious but june was too great a man in their world for them to attempt any revenge and it was left for mary to call out why norman nonsense mr ernescliffe rode the new black kicking horse till he made it quite steady  made it steady no mary that is saying too much for it said mr ernescliffe  it has no harm in itcapital horsesplendid said the doctor i shall take you out with it this afternoon maggie  you have driven it several times said alan  yes i drove him to abbotstoke yesterdaynever started except at a fool of a woman with an umbrella and at the trainand well take care not to meet that  it is only to avoid the viaduct at halfpast four said mrs may and that is easily done  so you are bound for cocksmoor said the doctor i told the poor fellow you were going to see his wife and he was so thankful that it did ones heart good  is he better i should like to tell his wife said flora  the doctor screwed up his face a bad business he said he is a shade better today he may get through yet but he is not my patient i only saw him because i happened to be there when he was brought in and ward was not in the way  and whats his name  i cant telldont think i ever heard  we ought to know said miss winter it would be awkward to go without  to go roaming about cocksmoor asking where the man in the hospital lives said flora we cant wait till monday  ive done said norman ill run down to the hospital and find out may i mamma  without your pudding old fellow  i dont want pudding said norman slipping back his chair may i mamma  to be sure you may and norman with a hand on the back of ethels chair took a flying leap over his own that set all the glasses ringing  stop stop know what you are going after sir cried his father what will they know there of cocksmoor or the man whose wife has twins you must ask for the accident in number five  and oh norman come back in time said ethel  ill be bound im back before etheldred the unready wants me he answered bounding off with an elasticity that caused his mother to say the boy was made of indiarubber and then putting his head in by the window to say bythebye if theres any pudding owing to me that little chorister fellow of ours bill blake has got a lot of voracious brothers that want anything thats going tom and blanche might take it down to em im off hooray and he scampered headlong up the garden prolonging his voice into a tremendous shout as he got farther off leaving every one laughing and his mother tenderly observing that he was going to run a quarter of a mile and back and lose his only chance of pudding for the weekold bishop whichcotes rules contemplating no fare but daily mutton to be bought at a shilling per sheep a little private discussion ensued between harry and hector on the merits of the cakes at ballhatchets gate and old nellys pies which led the doctor to mourn over the loss of the tarts of the cranberries that used to grow on cocksmoor before it was inhabited and to be the delight of the scholars of stoneborough when he was one of themand then to enchant the boys by relations of ancient exploits especially his friend spencer climbing up and engraving a name on the top of the market cross now no moreswept away by the town council in a fit of improvement which had for the last twenty years enraged the doctor at every remembrance of it perhaps at this moment his wife could hardly sympathise when she thought of her boys emulating such deeds  papa said ethel will you lend me a pair of spectacles for the walk  and make yourself one ethel said flora  i dont carei want to see the view  it is very bad for you ethel further added her mother you will make your sight much shorter if you accustom your eyes to them  well mamma i never do wear them about the house  for a very good reason said margaret because you havent got them  no i believe harry stole them in the holidays  stole them said the doctor as if they werent my property unjustifiably appropriated by her  they were that pair that you never could keep on papa said ethelno use at all to you come do lend me them  im sure i shant let you wear them said harry i shant go if you choose to make yourself such an object  ah said the father the boys thought it time to put a stop to it when it came to a caricature of the little doctor in petticoats  yes in normans lexicon said ethel a capital likeness of you papa but i never could get him to tell me who drew it  nor did ethel know that that caricature had been the cause of the black eye that harry had brought home last summer harry returned to protest that he would not join the walk if she chose to be seen in the spectacles while she undauntedly continued her petition though answered that she would attract the attacks of the quarrymen who would take her for an attenuated owl  i wish you were obliged to go about without them yourself papa cried ethel and then you would know how tiresome it is not to see twice the length of your own nose  not such a very short allowance either said the doctor quaintly and therewith the dinner concluded there was apt to be a race between the two eldest girls for the honour of bringing down the baby but this time their father strode up three steps at once turned at the top of the first flight made his bow to them and presently came down with his little daughter in his arms nodded triumphantly at the sisters and set her down on her mothers lap  there maggie you are complete you old henandchicken daisy cant you take her portrait in the character margaret  with her pink cap and blanche and aubrey as they are now on each side said flora  margaret ought to be in the picture herself said ethel fetch the artist in normans lexicon harry  since he has hit off one of us so well said the doctor well im off i must see old southern youll be ready by three goodbye hen and chicken  and i may have the spectacles said ethel running after him you know i am an injured individual for mamma wont let me carry baby about the house because i am so blind  you are welcome to embellish yourself as far as i am concerned  a general dispersion ensued and only mrs may margaret and the baby remained  oh no sighed margaret you cant be the henandchicken daisy properly without all your chickens it is the first christening we ever had without our all being there  it was best not to press it my dear said her mother your papa would have had his thoughts turned to the disappointment again and it makes richard himself so unhappy to see his vexation that i believe it is better not to renew it  but to miss him for so long said margaret perhaps it is best for it is very miserable when papa is sarcastic and sharp and he cannot understand it and takes it as meaning so much more than it really does and grows all the more frightened and diffident i cannot think what he would do without you to encourage him  or you you good sister said her mother smiling if we could only teach him not to mind being laughed at and to have some confidence in himself he and papa would get on together  it is very hard cried margaret almost indignantly that papa wont believe it when he does his best  i dont think papa can bear to bring himself to believe that it is his best  he is too clever himself to see how other people can be slow said margaret and yetthe tears came into her eyesi cannot bear to think of his telling richard it was no use to think of being a clergyman and he had better turn carpenter at once just because he failed in his examination  my dear i wish you would forget that said mrs may you know papa sometimes says more than he means and he was excessively vexed and disappointed i know he was pleased with ritchies resolve not to come home again till he had passed and it is best that it should not be broken  the whole vacation studying so hard and this christening said margaret it is treating him as if he had done wrong i do believe mr ernescliffe thinks he hasfor papa always turns away the conversation if his name is mentioned i wish you would explain it mamma i cant bear that  if i can said mrs may rather pleased that margaret had taken on herself this vindication of her favourite brother her fathers expense but after all margaret i never feel quite sure that poor ritchie does exert himself to the utmost he is too desponding to make the most of himself  and the more vexed papa is the worse it grows said margaret it is provoking though how i do wish sometimes to give ritchie a jog when there is some stumblingblock that he sticks fast at dont you remember those sums and those declensions when he is so clear and sensible about practical matters tooanything but learningi cannot think whyand it is very mortifying  i dare say it is very good for us not to have our ambition gratified said her mother there are so many troubles worse than these failures that it only shows how happy we are that we should take them so much to heart  they are a very real trouble said margaret dont smile mamma only remember how wretched his schooldays were when papa could not see any difficulty in what to him was so hard and how all papas eagerness only stupified him the more  they are a comfort not to have that over again yet said the mother i often think there is more fear for norman i dread his talent and success being snares  there is no selfsufficiency about him said margaret i hope not and he is so transparent that it would be laughed down at the first bud but the universal good report and certainty of success and being so often put in comparison with richard is hardly safe i was very glad he heard what ethel said today  ethel spoke very deeply said margaret i was a good deal struck by itshe often comes out with such solid thoughts  she is an excellent companion for norman  the desire of being first said margaret i suppose that is a form of caring for oneself it set me thinking a good deal mamma how many forms of ambition there are the craving for rank or wealth or beauty are so clearly wrong that one does not question about them but i suppose as ethel said the caring to be first in attainments is as bad  or in affection said mrs may  in affectionoh mamma there is always some one person with whom one is first said margaret eagerly and then her colour deepening as she saw her mother looking at her she said hastily ritchiei never considered itbut i knowit is my great pleasureoh mamma  well my dear i do not say but that you are the first with richard and that you well deserve to be so but is the seeking to be the first even in that way safe is it not selfseeking again  well perhaps it is i know it is what makes jealousy  the only plan is not to think about ourselves at all said mrs may affection is round us like sunshine and there is no use in measuring and comparing we must give it out freely ourselves hoping for nothing again  oh mamma you dont mean that  perhaps i should have said bargaining for nothing again it will come of itself if we dont exact it but rivalry is the sure means of driving it away because that is trying to get oneself worshipped  i suppose then you have never thought of it said margaret smiling  why it would have been rather absurd said mrs may laughing to begin to torment myself whether you were all fond of me you all have just as much affection for me from beginning to end as is natural and whats the use of thinking about it no no margaret dont go and protest that you love me more than is natural as margaret looked inclined to say something very eager that would be in the style of regan and goneril it will be natural byandby that you should some of you love some one else better and if i cared for being first what should i do then  oh mamma but said margaret suddenly you are always sure of papa  in one way yes said mrs may but how do i know how long calm as she was she could not finish that sentence no margaret depend upon it the only security is not to think about ourselves at all and not to fix our mind on any affection on earth the least share of the love above is the fullness of all blessing and if we seek that first all these things will be added unto us and are she whispered more to herself than to margaret     chapter iii         wee modest crimsontipped flower      thoust met me in an evil hour      for i maun crush amang the stoure        thy slender stem      to spare thee now is past my power        thou bonnie gem                                burns   is this all the walking party exclaimed mr ernescliffe as miss winter flora and norman gathered in the hall  harry wont go because of ethels spectacles answered flora and mary and he are inseparable so they are gone with hector to have a shipwreck in the field  and your other sisters  margaret has rattedshe is going to drive out with mamma said norman as to etheldred the unready ill run up and hurry her  in a moment he was at her door oh norman come in is it time  i should think so youre keeping every one waiting  oh dear go on only just tell me the past participle of offero and ill catch you up  oblatus  oh yes how stupid the a long or short then thats right i had such a line in my head i was forced to write it down is not it a capital subject this time  the devotion of decius capital let me see said norman taking up a paper scribbled in pencil with latin verses oh you have taken up quite a different line from mine i began with mount vesuvius spouting lava like anything  but mount vesuvius didnt spout till it overthrew pompeii  murder cried norman i forgot its lucky you put me in mind i must make a fresh beginning there go my six best lines however it was an uncanny place fit for hobgoblins and shades and funny customers which will do as well for my purpose ha thats grand about its being so much better than the vana gloria triumphalisonly take care of the scanning there  if it was but english something like this           for what is equal to the fame          of forgetting self in the aim   thats not right but  ethel norman what are you about cried flora do you mean to go to cocksmoor today  oh yes cried ethel flying into vehement activity only ive lost my blueedged handkerchiefflora have you seen it  no but here is your red scarf  thank you there is a good flora and oh i finished a frock all but two stitches where is it gone go on all of you ill overtake you           purer than breath of earthly fame          is losing self in a glorious aim   is that better norman  youll drive us out of patience said flora tying the handkerchief round ethels throat and pulling out the fingers of her gloves which of course were inside out are you ready  oh my frock my frock there tisthree stitchesgo on and ill come said ethel seizing a needle and sewing vehemently at a little pink frock go on miss winter goes slowly up the hill and ill overtake you  come norman then it is the only way to make her come at all  i shall wait for her said norman go on flora we shall catch you up in no time and as flora went he continued never mind your aims and fames and trumpery english rhymes your verses will be much the best ethel i only went on a little about mount vesuvius and the landscape as alan described it the other day and decius taking a last look knowing he was to die i made him beg his horses pardon and say how they will both be remembered and their selfdevotion would inspire romans to all posterity and shout with a noble voice said norman repeating some of his lines correcting them as he proceeded  oh yes but oh dear ive done come along said ethel crumpling her work into a bundle and snatching up her gloves then as they ran downstairs and emerged into the street it is a famous subject  yes you have made a capital beginning if you wont break down somewhere as you always do with some frightful false quantity that you would get an imposition for if you were a boy i wish you were i should like to see old hoxtons face if you were to show him up some of these verses  ill tell you what norman if i was you i would not make decius flatter himself with the fame he was to getit is too like the stuff every one talks in stupid books i want him to sayromemy countrythe eaglesmust win if they donever mind what becomes of me  but why should he not like to get the credit of it as he did fame and glorythey are the spirit of life the reward of such a death  oh no no said ethel fame is coarse and vulgarblinder than ever they draw love or fortuneshe is only a personified newspaper trumpeting out all that is extraordinary without minding whether it is good or bad she misses the delicate and lovelyi wished they would give us a theme to write about her i should like to abuse her well  it would make a very good theme in a new line said norman but i dont give into it altogether it is the hope and the thought of fame that has made men great from first to last it is in every one that is not good for nothing and always will be the moving spirit of mans greatness  im not sure said ethel i think looking for fame is like wanting a reward at once i had rather people forgot themselves do you think arnold von winkelried thought about fame when he threw himself on the spears  he got it said norman  yes he got it for the good of other people not to please himself fame does those that admire it good not those that win it  but said norman and both were silent for some short interval as they left the last buildings of the town and began to mount a steep hill presently norman slackened his pace and driving his stick vehemently against a stone exclaimed it is no use talking ethel it is all a fight and a race one is always to try to be foremost thats the spirit of the thingthats what the great from first to last have struggled and fought and lived and died for  i know it is a battle i know it is a race the bible says so replied ethel but is not there the difference that here all may winnot only one one may do ones best not care whether one is first or last thats what our reading today said  that was against trumpery vanityfalse elevationnot what one has earned for oneself but getting into other peoples places that one never deserved that every one despises  of course that they do i say norman didnt you mean harvey anderson  instead of answering norman exclaimed it is pretension that is hatefultrue excelling is what ones life is for no no ill never be beat etheli never have been beat by any one except by you when you take pains he added looking exultingly at his sister and i never will be  oh norman  i mean of course while i have senses i would not be like richard for all the world  oh no no poor richard  he is an excellent fellow in everything else said norman i could sometimes wish i was more like himbut how he can be so amazingly slow i cant imagine that examination paper he broke down ini could have done it as easily as possible  i did it all but one question said ethel but so did he you know and we cant tell whether we should have it done well enough  i know i must do something respectable when first i go to oxford if i dont wish to be known as the man whose brother was plucked said norman  yes said ethel if papa will but let you try for the randall scholarship next year but he says it is not good to go to oxford so young  and i believe i had better not be there with richard added norman i dont like coming into contrast with him and i dont think he can like it poor fellow and it isnt his fault i had rather stay another year here get one of the open scholarships and leave the stoneborough ones for those who can do no better  in justice to norman we must observe that this was by no means said as a boast he would scarcely have thus spoken to any one but etheldred to whom as well as to himself it seemed mere matteroffact the others had in the meantime halted at the top of the hill and were looking back at the townthe great old minster raising its twin towers and long roof close to the river where rich green meadows spread over the valley and the town rising irregularly on the slope above plentifully interspersed with trees and gardens and one green space on the banks of the river speckled over with a flock of little black dots in rapid motion  here you are exclaimed flora i told them it was of no use to wait when you and norman had begun a dissertation  now mr ernescliffe i should like you to say cried ethel which do you think is the best the name of it or the thing her eloquence always broke down with any auditor but her brother or perhaps margaret  ethel said norman how is any one to understand you the argument is this ethel wants people to do great deeds and be utterly careless of the fame of them i say that love of glory is a mighty spring  a mighty one said alan but i think as far as i understand the question that ethel has the best of it  i dont mean that people should not serve the cause first of all said norman but let them have their right place and due honour  they had better make up their minds to do without it said alan remember          the world knows nothing of its greatest men   then it is a great shame said norman  but do you think it right said ethel to care for distinction it is a great thing to earn it but i dont think one should care for the outer glory  i believe it is a great temptation said alan the being overelated or overdepressed by success or failure in the eyes of the world independently of the exertion we have used  you call it a temptation said ethel  decidedly so  but one cant live or get on without it said norman  there they were cut short there was a plantation to be crossed with a gate that would not open and that seemed an effectual barrier against both miss winter and the donkey until by persuasive eloquence and great gallantry mr ernescliffe performed the wonderful feat of getting the former over the tall fence while norman conducted the donkey a long way round undertaking to meet them at the other side of the plantation  the talk became desultory as they proceeded for at least a mile along a carttrack through softtufted grass and heath and young firtrees it ended in a broad open moor stony and full of damp boggy hollows forlorn and desolate under the autumn sky here they met norman again and walked on along a very rough and dirty road the ground growing more decidedly into hills and valleys as they advanced till they found themselves before a small but very steep hillock one side of which was cut away into a slate quarry round this stood a colony of roughlybuilt huts of mud turf or large blocks of the slate many workmen were engaged in splitting up the slates or loading wagons with them rude wildlooking men at the sight of whom the ladies shrank up to their protectors but who seemed too busy even to spare time for staring at them  they were directed to john taylors house a low mud cottage very wretched looking and apparently so smoky that mr ernescliffe and norman were glad to remain outside and survey the quarry while the ladies entered  inside they found more cleanliness and neatness than they had expected but there was a sad appearance of poverty insufficient furniture and the cups and broken teapot on the table holding nothing but toast and water as a substitute for their proper contents the poor woman was sitting by the fire with one twin on her lap and the other on a chair by her side and a larger child was in the corner by the fire looking heavy and ill while others of different ages lounged about listlessly she was not untidy but very pale and she spoke in a meek subdued way as if the ills of life were so heavy on her that she had no spirit even to complain she thanked them for their gifts but languidly and did not visibly brighten when told that her husband was better  flora asked when the babes would be christened  i cant hardly tell misstis so far to go  i suppose none of the children can go to school i dont know their faces there said flora looking at a nice tall smoothhaired girl of thirteen or fourteen  no misstis so far i am sorry they should not for they always was used to it where we lived before and my oldest girl she can work very nicely i wish i could get a little place for her  you would hardly know what to do without her said miss winter  no maam but she wants better food than i can give her and it is a bad wild place for a girl to grow up it is not like what i was used to maam i was always used to keep to my school and to my churchbut it is a bad place to live in here  no one could deny it and the party left the cottage gravely alan and norman joined them having heard a grievous history of the lawlessness of the people from a foreman with whom they had met there seemed to be no visible means of improvement the parish church was stoneborough and there the living was very poor the tithes having been appropriated to the old monastery and since its dissolution having fallen into possession of a body that never did anything for the town the incumbent mr ramsden had small means and was not a high stamp of clergyman seldom exerting himself and leaving most of his parish work to the two under masters of the school mr wilmot and mr harrison who did all they had time and strength for and more too within the town itself there was no hope for cocksmoor  there would be a worthy ambition said etheldred as they turned their steps homeward let us propose that aim to ourselves to build a church on cocksmoor  how many years do you give us to do it in said norman  few or many i dont care ill never leave off thinking about it till it is done  it need not be long said flora if one could get up a subscription  a penny subscription said norman id rather have it my own doing  you agree then said ethel do you mr ernescliffe  i may safely do so he answered smiling miss winter looked at etheldred reprovingly and she shrank into herself drew apart and indulged in a reverie she had heard in books of girls writing poetry romance historygaining fifties and hundreds could not some of the myriads of fancies floating in her mind thus be made available she would compose publish earn moneysome day call papa show him her hoard beg him to take it and never owning whence it came raise the building spire and chancel pinnacle and buttress rose before her eyes and she and norman were standing in the porch with an orderly religious population blessing the unknown benefactor who had caused the news of salvation to be heard among them  they were almost at home when the sight of a crowd in the main street checked them norman and mr ernescliffe went forward to discover the cause and spoke to some one on the outskirtsthen mr ernescliffe hurried back to the ladies  theres been an accident he said hastilyyou had better go down the lane and in by the garden  he was gone in an instant and they obeyed in silence whence came ethels certainty that the accident concerned themselves in an agony of apprehension though without one outward sign of it she walked home they were in the gardenall was apparently as usual but no one was in sight ethel had been first but she held back and let miss winter go forward into the house the front door was openservants were standing about in confusion and one of the maids looking dreadfully frightened gave a cry oh missmisshave you heard  nowhat what has happened not mrs may exclaimed miss winter  oh maam it is all of them the carriage is overturned and  whos hurt mamma papa oh tell me cried flora  theres nurse and ethel flew up to her what is it oh nurse  my poor poor children said old nurse passionately kissing ethel harry and mary were on the stairs behind her clinging together  a stranger looked into the house followed by adams the stableman they are going to bring miss may in some one said  ethel could bear it no longer as if she could escape she fled upstairs into her room and falling on her knees hid her face on her bed  there were heavy steps in the house then a sound of hasty feet coming up to her norman dashed into the room and threw himself on a chair he was ghastly pale and shuddered all over  oh norman norman speak what is it he groaned but could not speak he rested his head against her and gasped she was terribly frightened ill call and she would have gone but he held her nonothey cant he was prevented from saying more by chattering teeth and deadly faintness she tried to support him but could only guide him as he sank till he lay at full length on the floor where she put a pillow under his head and gave him some water is itoh tell me are they much hurt oh try to say  they say margaret is alive said norman in gasps butand papahe stood upsatwalkedwas better  is he hurtmuch hurt  his arm and the tremor and fainting stopped him again  mamma whispered ethel but norman only pressed his face into the pillow  she was so bewildered as to be more alive to the present distress of his condition than to the vague horrors downstairs some minutes passed in silence norman lying still excepting a nervous trembling that agitated his whole frame again was heard the strange tread doors opening and shutting and suppressed voices and he turned his face upwards and listened with his hand pressed to his forehead as if to keep himself still enough to listen  oh what is the matter what is it cried ethel startled and recalled to the sense of what was passing  oh norman then springing up with a sudden thought mr ward oh is he there  yes said norman in a low hopeless tone he was at the place he said it  what  again normans face was out of sight  mamma ethels understanding perceived but her mind refused to grasp the extent of the calamity there was no answer save a convulsive squeezing of her hand  fresh sounds below recalled her to speech and action  where is she what are they doing for her what  theres nothing to be done shewhen they lifted her up she was  dead  dead  the boy lay with his face hidden the girl sat by him on the floor too much crushed for even the sensations belonging to grief neither moving nor looking after an interval norman spoke again the carriage turned right overher head struck on the kerb stone  did you see said ethel presently  i saw them lift her up he spoke at intervals as he could get breath and bear to utter the words and papahe was stunnedbut soon he sat up said he would go to herhe looked at herfelt her pulse and thensank down over her  and did you sayi cant rememberwas he hurt  the shuddering came again his armall twistedbroken and his voice sank into a faint whisper ethel was obliged to sprinkle him again with water but he wont die said she in a tone calm from its bewilderment  oh no no no  and margaret  they were bringing her home ill go and see oh whats the meaning of this exclaimed he scolding himself as sitting up he was forced to rest his head on his shaking hand  you are still faint dear norman you had better lie still and ill go and see  faintstuffhow horridly stupid but he was obliged to lay his head down again and ethel scarcely less trembling crept carefully towards the stairs but a dread of what she might meet came over her and she turned towards the nursery  the younger ones sat there in a frightened huddle mary was on a low chair by the infants cot blanche in her lap tom and harry leaning against her and aubrey almost asleep mary held up her finger as ethel entered and whispered hush dont wake baby for anything  the first true pang of grief shot through ethel like a dart stabbing and taking away her breath where are they she said how is papa who is with him  mr ward and alan ernescliffe said harry nurse came up just now and said they were setting his arm  where is he  on the bed in his dressingroom said harry  has he come to himselfis he better  they did not seem to know and ethel asked where to find flora with margaret she was told and she was thinking whether she could venture to seek her when she herself came fast up the stairs ethel and harry both darted out dont stop me said florathey want some handkerchiefs  what is not she in her own room  no said harry in mammas and then his face quivered all over and he turned away ethel ran after her sister and pulling out drawers without knowing what she sought begged to hear how papa and margaret were  we cant judge of margaretshe has moved and made a little moaningthere are no limbs broken but we are afraid for her head oh if papa could but  and papa  mr ward is with him nowhis arm is terribly hurt  but oh floraone momentis he sensible  hardly he does not take any noticebut dont keep me  can i do anything following her to the head of the stairs  no i dont see what you can do miss winter and i are with margaret theres nothing to do for her  it was a relief etheldred shrank from what she might have to behold and flora hastened down too busy and too useful to have time to think harry had gone back to his refuge in the nursery and ethel returned to norman there they remained for a long time both unwilling to speak or stir or even to observe to each other on the noises that came in to them as their door was left ajar though in those sounds they were so absorbed that they did not notice the cold of a frosty october evening or the darkness that closed in on them  they heard the poor babe crying one of the children going down to call nurse and nurse coming up then harry at the door of the room where the boys slept calling norman in a low voice norman now nearly recovered went and brought him into his sisters room and his tidings were that their fathers arm had been broken in two places and the elbow frightfully injured having been crushed and twisted by the wheel he was also a good deal bruised and though mr ward trusted there was no positive harm to the head he was in an unconscious state from which the severe pain of the operation had only roused him so far as to evince a few signs of suffering margaret was still insensible  the piteous sound of the babys wailing almost broke their hearts norman walked about the room in the dark and said he should go down he could not bear it but he could not make up his mind to go and after about a quarter of an hour to their great relief it ceased  next mary opened the door saying norman heres mr wilmot come to ask if he can do anythingmiss winter sent word that you had better go to him  how is baby asked harry  nurse has fed her and is putting her to bed she is quiet now said mary will you go down norman  where is he  in the drawingroom  norman paused to ask what he was to say  nothing said mary nobody can do anything make haste dont you want a candle  no thank you i had rather be in the dark come up as soon as you have seen him said etheldred  norman went slowly down with failing knees hardly able to conquer the shudder that came over him as he passed those rooms there were voices in the drawingroom and he found a sort of council there alan ernescliffe the surgeon and mr wilmot they turned as he came in and mr wilmot held out his hand with a look of affection and kindness that went to his heart making room for him on the sofa while going on with what he was saying then you think it would be better for me not to sit up with him  i should decidedly say so replied mr ward he has recognised mr ernescliffe and any change might excite him and lead him to ask questions the moment of his full consciousness is especially to be dreaded  but you do not call him insensible  no but he seems stunnedstupified by the shock and by pain he spoke to miss flora when she brought him some tea  and admirably she managed said alan ernescliffe i was much afraid of some answer that would rouse him but she kept her selfpossession beautifully and seemed to compose him in a moment  she is valuable indeedso much judgment and activity said mr ward i dont know what we should have done without her but we ought to have mr richardhas no one sent to him  alan ernescliffe and norman looked at each other  is he at oxford or at his tutors asked mr wilmot  at oxford he was to be there today was he not norman  what oclock is it is the post gonesevenno it is all safe said mr ward  poor norman he knew he was the one who ought to write but his icy trembling hand seemed to shake more helplessly than ever and a piteous glance fell upon mr wilmot  the best plan would be said mr wilmot for me to go to him at once and bring him home if i go by the mailtrain i shall get to him sooner than a letter could  and it will be better for him said mr ward he will feel it dreadfully poor boy but we shall all do better when we have him you can get back tomorrow evening  sunday said mr wilmot i believe there is a train at four  oh thank you sir said norman  since that is settled perhaps i had better go up to the doctor said alan i dont like leaving flora alone with him and he was gone  how fortunate that that youth is here said mr wilmothe seems to be quite taking richards place  and to feel it as much said mr ward he has been invaluable with his sailors resources and handiness  well what shall i tell poor richard asked mr wilmot  tell him there is no reason his father should not do very well if we can keep him from agitationbut theres the point he is of so excitable a constitution that his faculties being so far confused is the best thing perhaps that could be mr ernescliffe manages him very wellused to illness on that african coast and the doctor is very fond of him as to miss may one cant tell what to say about her yettheres no fracture at leastit must be a work of time to judge  flora at that moment halfopened the door and called mr ward stopping for a moment to say it was for nothing of any consequence mr wilmot and norman were left together norman put his hands over his face and groanedhis master looked at him with kind anxiety but did not feel as if it were yet time to speak of consolation  god bless and support you and turn this to your good my dear boy said he affectionately as he pressed his hand i hope to bring your brother tomorrow  thank you sir was all norman could say and as mr wilmot went out by the front door he slowly went up again and lingering on the landingplace was met by mr ward who told him to his relieffor the mere thinking of it renewed the faint sensationthat he had better not go to his fathers room  there was nothing to be done but to return to ethel and harry and tell them all with some humiliation at being helpless where flora was doing so much and to leave their father to be watched by a stranger if he had been wanted norman might have made the effort but being told that he would be worse than useless there was nothing for him but to give way  they sat together in ethels room till somewhere between eight and nine oclock when good old nurse having put her younger ones to bed came in search of them dear dear poor darlings said she as she found them sitting in the dark she felt their cold hands and made them all come into the nursery where mary was already and fondling them one by one as they passively obeyed her she set them down on their little old stools round the fire took away the high fender and gave them each a cup of tea harry and mary ate enough to satisfy her from a weary craving feeling and for want of employment norman sat with his elbow on his knee and a very aching head resting on his hand glad of drink but unable to eat ethel could be persuaded to do neither till she found old nurse would let her have no peace  the nurse sent them all to bed taking the two girls to their own room undressing them and never leaving them until mary was in a fair way of crying herself to sleepfor saying her prayers had brought the tears while ethel lay so wide awake that it was of no use to wait for her and then she went to the boys tucked them each in as when they were little children and saying bless your dear hearts bestowed on each of them a kiss which came gratefully to normans burning brow and which even harrys boyish manliness could not resist  flora was in margarets room too useful to be spared  so ended that dreadful saturday     chapter iv         they may not mar the deep repose        of that immortal flower      though only broken hearts are found        to watch her cradle by      no blight is on her slumbers found        no touch of harmful eye                                     lyra innocentium   such a strange sad sunday no going to church but all the poor children moving in awe and oppression about the house speaking under their breath as they gathered in the drawingroom into the study they might not go and when blanche would have asked why tom pressed her hand and shuddered  etheldred was allowed to come and look at margaret and even to sit in the room for a little while to take the place of miss winter but she was not sensible of sufficient usefulness to relieve the burden of fear and bewilderment in the presence of that still pale form and what was almost worse the sight of the familiar objects the chair by the fire the sofa the books the workbasket the lettercase the dressing things all these were too oppressive she sat crouched up with her face hidden in her hands and the instant she was released hastened back to norman she was to tell him that he might go into the room but he did not move and mary alone went in and out with messages  dr may was not to be visited for he was in the same halfconscious state apparently sensible only of bodily suffering though he answered when addressed and no one was trusted to speak to him but flora and ernescliffe  the rest wore through the day as best they might harry slept a good deal ethel read to herself and tried to get norman to look at passages which she liked mary kept the little ones from being troublesome and at last took them to peep behind the schoolroom blinds for richards coming  there was a simultaneous shout when at four oclock they caught sight of him and though at ethels exclamation of wonder mary and tom hung their heads at having forgotten themselves the association of gladness in seeing richard was refreshing the sense of being desolate and forsaken was relieved and they knew that now they had one to rely on and to comfort them  harry hastened to open the front door and richard with his small trim figure and fresh fair young face flushed though not otherwise agitated was among them almost devoured by the younger ones and dealing out quiet caresses to them as he caught from the words and looks of the others that at least his father and sister were no worse mr wilmot had come with him but only stayed to hear the tidings  can i see papa were richards first audible wordsall the rest had been almost dumb show  ethel thought not but took him to margarets room where he stood for many minutes without speaking then whispered to flora that he must go to the others she should call him ifand went down followed by ethel  tom and blanche had fallen into teasing tricks a sort of melancholy play to relieve the tedium they grew cross norman was roused to reprove sharply and blanche was beginning to cry but richards entrance set all at peacehe sat down among them and with soft voice and arm round blanche as she leaned against him made her good in a moment and she listened while he talked over with norman and ethel all they could bear to speak of  late in the day flora came into her fathers room and stood gazing at him as he lay with eyes closed breathing heavily and his brows contracted by pain she watched him with piteous looks as if imploring him to return to his children poor girl todays quiet after the last evenings bustle was hard to bear she had then been distracted from thought by the necessity of exertion but it now repaid itself and she knew not how to submit to do nothing but wait and watch  no change enquired alan ernescliffe looking kindly in her face  no replied she in a low mournful tone she only once said thank you  a voice which she did not expect asked inquiringly margaret and her heart beat as if it would take away her breath as she saw her fathers eyes intently fixed on her did you speak of her he repeated  yes dear papa said flora not losing presence of mind though in extreme fear of what the next question might be she is quiet and comfortable so dont be uneasy pray  let me hear he said and his whole voice and air showed him to be entirely roused there is injury what is it  he continued his inquiries till flora was obliged fully to explain her sisters condition and then he dismayed her by saying he would get up and go to see her much distressed she begged him not to think of it and appealed to alan who added his entreaties that he would at least wait for mr ward but the doctor would not relinquish his purpose and sent her to give notice that he was coming  mr ernescliffe followed her out of the room and tried to console her as she looked at him in despair  you see he is quite himself quite collected he said you heard now clear and coherent his questions were  cant it be helped do try to stop him till i can send to mr ward  i will try but i think he is in a state to judge for himself i do upon my word and i believe trying to prevent him would be more likely to do him harm than letting him satisfy himself i really think you need not be alarmed  but you know said flora coming nearer and almost gasping as she whispered and signed towards the door she is thereit is mammas room that will tell all  i believe he knows said alan it was that which made him faint after the accident for he had his perceptions fully at first i have suspected all day that he was more himself than he seemed but i think he could not bear to awaken his mind to understand it and that he was afraid to hear about heryour sister so that our mention of her was a great relief and did him good i am convinced he knows the rest only go on be calm as you have been and we shall do very well  flora went to prepare ethel eagerly undertook to send to mr ward and hastened from the room as if in a sort of terror shrinking perhaps from what might lead to an outburst of grief she longed to have seen her father but was frightened at the chance of meeting him when she had sent her message and told her brothers what was passing she went and lingered on the stairs and in the passage for tidings after what seemed a long time flora came out and hastened to the nursery giving her intelligence on the way  better than could be hoped he walked alone into the room and was quite calm and composed oh if this will not hurt him if the seeing baby was but over  does he want her  yes he would have come up here himself but i would not let him nurse do you hear papa wants baby let me have her  bless me miss flora you cant hold her while you are all of a tremble and he has been to miss margaret  yes nurse and he was only rather stiff and lame  did margaret seem to know him said ethel  she just answered in that dreamy way when he spoke to her he says he thinks it is as mr ward believes and that she will soon come to herself he is quite able to consider  and he knows all  i am sure he does he desired to see baby and he wants you nurse only mind you command yourselfdont say a word you can helpdo nothing to agitate him  nurse promised but the tears came so fast and sobs with them as she approached her masters room that flora saw no composure could be expected from her and taking the infant from her carried it in leaving the door open for her to follow when wanted ethel stood by listening there was silence at first then some sounds from the baby and her fathers voice soothing it in his wonted caressing phrases and tones so familiar that they seemed to break the spell drive away her vague terrors and restore her father her heart bounded and a sudden impulse carried her to the bedside at once forgetting all dread of seeing him and chance of doing him harm he lay holding the babe close to him and his face was not altered so that there was nothing in the sight to impress her with the need of caution and to the consternation of the anxious flora she exclaimed abruptly and vehemently papa should not she be christened  dr may looked up at ethel then at the infant yes he said at once then added feebly and languidly some one must see to it  there was a pause while flora looked reproachfully at her sister and ethel became conscious of her imprudence but in a few moments dr may spoke again first to the baby and then asking is richard here  yes papa  send him up presently wheres nurse  ethel retreated much alarmed at her rash measure and when she related it she saw that richard and mr ernescliffe both thought it had been a great hazard  papa wants you was a welcome sound to the ears of richard and brought a pink glow into his face he was never one who readily showed his feelings and there was no danger of his failing in selfcommand though grievously downcast not only at the loss of the tender mother who had always stood between him and his fathers impatience but by the dread that he was too dull and insignificant to afford any help or comfort in his fathers dire affliction  yet there was something in the gentle sad look that met him and in the low tone of the how dye do ritchie that drove off a thought of not being loved and when dr may further added youll see about it alli am glad you are come he knew he was of use and was encouraged and cheered that his father had full confidence and reliance in him and that his presence was a satisfaction and relief he could no longer doubt and this was a drop of balm beyond all his hopes for loving and admiring his father intensely and with depressed spirits and a low estimate of himself he had begun to fancy himself incapable of being anything but a vexation and burden  he sat with his father nearly all the evening and was to remain with him at night the rest were comforted by the assurance that dr may was still calm and did not seem to have been injured by what had passed indeed it seemed as if the violence and suddenness of the shock together with his state of suffering had deadened his sensations for there was far less agitation about him than could have been thought possible in a man of such strong warm affections and sensitive temperament  ethel and norman went up arminarm at bedtime  i am going to ask if i may wish papa goodnight said ethel shall i say anything about your coming  norman hesitated but his cheeks blanched he shuddered shook his head without speaking ran up after harry and waved her back when she would have followed  richard told her that she might come in and as she slowly advanced she thought she had never seen anything so ineffably mournful as the affectionate look on her fathers face she held his hand and venturedfor it was with difficulty she spoketo hope he was not in pain  better than it was thank you my dear he said in a soft weak tone then as she bent down to kiss his brow you must take care of the little ones  yes papa she could hardly answer and a large drop gathered slowly in each eye long in coming as if the heart ached too much for them to flow freely  are they all well  yes papa  and good he held her hand as if lengthening the interview  yes very good all day  a long deep sigh ethels two tears stood on her cheeks  my love to them all i hope i shall see them tomorrow god bless you my dear goodnight  ethel went upstairs saddened and yet soothed the calm silent sorrow too deep for outward tokens was so unlike her fathers usually demonstrative habits as to impress her all the more yet those two tears were followed by no more there was much strangeness and confusion in her mind in the newness of grief  she found poor flora spent with exertion under the reaction of all she had undergone lying on her bed sobbing as if her heart would break calling in gasps of irrepressible agony on mamma mamma yet with her face pressed down on the pillow that she might not be heard ethel terrified and distressed timidly implored her to be comforted but it seemed as if she were not even heard she would have fetched some one but whom alas alas it brought back the sense that no mother would ever soothe themmargaret papa both so ill nurse engaged with margaret ethel stood helpless and despairing and flora sobbed on so that mary awakened to burst out in a loud frightened fit of crying but in a few moments a step was at the door a knock and richard asked is anything the matter  he was in the room in a moment caressing and saying affectionate things with gentleness and fondling care like his mother and which recalled the days when he had been proud to be left for a little while the small nurse and guardian of the lesser ones mary was hushed in a moment and floras exhausted weeping was gradually soothed when she was able to recollect that she was keeping him from her father with kind goodnights he left ethel to read to her till she could sleep long did ethel read after both her sisters were slumbering soundly she went on in a sort of dreamy grief almost devoid of pain as if all this was too terrible to be true and she had imagined herself into a story which would give place at dawn to her ordinary life  at last she went to bed and slept till wakened by the return of flora who had crept down in her dressinggown to see how matters were going margaret was in the same state papa was asleep after a restless distressing night with much pain and some fever and whenever richard had begun to hope from his tranquillity that he was falling asleep he was undeceived by hearing an almost unconsciously uttered sigh of maggie my maggie and then the head turned wearily on the pillow as if worn out with the misery from which there was no escape towards morning the pain had lessened and as he slept he seemed much less feverish than they could have ventured to expect  norman looked wan and wretched and could taste no breakfast indeed harry reported that he had been starting and talking in his sleep half the night and had proceeded to groaning and crying out till when it could be borne no longer harry waked him and finished his nights rest in peace  the children were kept in the drawingroom that morning and there were strange steps in the house but only richard and mr ernescliffe knew the reason happily there had been witnesses enough of the overturn to spare any reference to dr maythe violent start of the horses had been seen and adams and mr ernescliffe agreed under their breath that the new black one was not fit to drive while the whole town was so used to dr mays headlong driving that every one was recollecting their own predictions of accidents there needed little to account for the disasterthe only wonder was that it had not happened sooner  i say announced harry soon after they were released again ive been in to papa his door was open and he heard me and called me he says he should like any of us to come in and see him hadnt you better go norman  norman started up and walked hastily out of the room but his hand shook so that he could hardly open the door and ethel seeing how it was with him followed him quickly as he dashed at full speed up the stairs at the top however he was forced to cling to the rail gasping for breath while the moisture started on his forehead  dear norman she said theres nothing to mind he looks just as usual you would not know there was anything the matter but he rested his head on his hand and looked as if he could not stir i see it wont do said etheldont tryyou will be better byandby and he has not asked for you in particular  i wont be beat by such stuff said norman stepping hastily forwards and opening the door suddenly he got through the greeting pretty well there was no need for him to speak he only gave his hand and looked away unable to bring himself to turn his eyes on his father and afraid of letting his own face be seen almost at the same moment nurse came to say something about margaret and he seized the opportunity of withdrawing his hand and hurrying away in good time for he was pale as death and was obliged to sit down on the head of the stairs and lean his head against etheldred  what does make me so ridiculous he exclaimed faintly but very indignantly  the first cure was the being forced to clear out of mr wards way which he could not effect without being seen and ethel though she knew that he would be annoyed was not sorry to be obliged to remain and tell what was the matter with him oh said mr ward turning and proceeding to the diningroom ill set that to rights in a minute if you will ask for a tumbler of hot water miss ethel  and armed with the cordial he had prepared ethel hunted up her brother and persuaded him after scolding her a little to swallow it and take a turn in the garden after which he made a more successful attempt at visiting his father  there was another room whither both norman and etheldred wished to go though they dared not hint at their desire at last richard came to them as they were wandering in the garden and with his usual stillness of manner shaded with additional seriousness said would you like to come into the study  etheldred put one hand into his norman took the other and soon they stood in that calm presence fair cold white and intensely stillthat face brought home to them the full certainty that the warm brightening look would never beam on them the soft blue eyes never guide check and watch them the smile never approve or welcome them to see her unconscious of their presence was too strange and sad and all were silent till as they left the room ethel looked out at blanche and aubrey in the garden they will never remember her oh why should it be  richard would fain have moralised and comforted but she felt as if she knew it all before and heard with languid attention she had rather read than talk and he sat down to write letters  there were no near relations to be sent for dr may was an only son and his wifes sister mrs arnott was in new zealand her brother had long been dead and his widow who lived in edinburgh was scarcely known to the may family of friends there were many fast bound by affection and gratitude and notes inquiries condolences and offers of service came in thickly and gave much occupation to flora richard and alan ernescliffe in turn no one from without could do anything for themthey had all the help they wanted in miss winter and in alan who was invaluable in sharing with richard the care of the doctor as well as in giving him the benefit of his few additional years experience and relieving him of some of his tasks he was indeed like one of themselves and a most valuable help and comforter mr wilmot gave them all the time he could and on this day saw the doctor who seemed to find some solace in his visit though saying very little  on this day the baby was to be baptized the usual stoneborough fashion was to collect all the christenings for the month into one sunday except those for such persons as thought themselves too refined to see their children christened before the congregation and who preferred an empty church and a weekday the little one had waited till she was nearly six weeks old for a christening sunday and since that had been missed she could not be kept unbaptized for another month so late in the day she was carried to church  richard had extremely gratified old nurse by asking her to represent poor margaret mrs hoxton stood for the other godmother and alan ernescliffe was desired to consider himself absolutely her sponsor not merely a proxy the younger children alone were to go with them it was too far off and the way lay too much through the town for it to be thought proper for the others to go ethel wished it very much and thought it nonsense to care whether people looked at her and in spite of miss winters seeming shocked at her proposing it had a great mind to persist she would even have appealed to her papa if flora had not stopped her exclaiming really ethel i think there never was a person so entirely without consideration as you are  much abashed ethel humbly promised that if she might go into papas room she would not say one word about the christening unless he should begin and to her great satisfaction he presently asked her to read the service to him flora came to the doorway of margarets room and listened when she had finished all were silent  how shall we how can we virtuously bring up our motherless little sister was the thought with each of the girls the answers were in one mind i trust we shall do well by her dear little thing i see on an emergency that i know how to act i never thought i was capable of being of so much use thanks to dear dear mammas training i shall manage i am sure and so they will all depend on me and look up to me how nice it was to hear dear papa say what he did about the comfort of my being able to look after margaret  in the other poor darling it is saddest of all for her because she knows nothing and will never remember her mamma but if margaret is but better she will take care of her and oh how we ought to tryand i such a naughty wild thingif i should hurt the dear little ones by carelessness or by my bad example oh what shall i do for want of some one to keep me in order if i should vex papa by any of my wrong ways  they heard the return of the others and the sisters both sprang up may we bring her to you said flora  yes do my dears  the sisters all came down together with the little one and flora put her down within the arm her father stretched out for her he gazed into the baby face which in its expressionless placidity almost recalled her mothers tranquil sweetness  gertrude margaret said flora and with a look that had more of tenderness than grief he murmured my daisy blossom my little maggie  might we said ethel when flora took her again might we take her to her godmother to see if she would notice her  he looked as if he wished it but said no i think not better not rouse her and sighed heavily then as they stood round his bed unwilling to go he added girls we must learn carefulness and thoughtfulness we have no one to take thought for us now  flora pressed the babe in her arms ethels two reluctant tears stood on her cheeks mary exclaimed ill try not to be naughty and blanche climbed up to kiss him saying i will be always good papa  daisypapas daisyyour vows are made whispered ethel gaining sole possession of the babe for a minute you have promised to be good and holy we have the keeping of you mammas precious flower her pearl of truth oh may god guard you to be an unstained jewel till you come back to her againand a blooming flower till you are gathered into the wreath that never fadesmy own sweet poor little motherless daisy     chapter v         through lawless camp through ocean wild      her prophet eye pursues her child      scans mournfully her poets strain      fears for her merchant loss alike and gain                                           lyra innocentium   dr may took the management of himself into his own hands and paid so little attention to mr wards recommendations that his sons and daughters were in continual dread of his choosing to do something that might cause injurious agitation  however he did not go further than margarets bedroom where he sat hour after hour his eyes fixed upon her as she continued in a state bordering on insensibility he took little notice of anything else and hardly spoke there were heavy sighs now and then but richard and flora one or other of whom were always watching him could hardly tell whether to ascribe them to the oppression of sorrow or of suffering their great fear was of his insisting on seeing his wifes face and it was a great relief that he never alluded to her except once to desire richard to bring him her ring richard silently obeyed and without a word he placed it on his little finger richard used to read the psalms to him in the morning before he was up and flora would bring little daisy and lay her by his side  to the last moment they dreaded his choosing to attend the funeral and flora had decided on remaining at home though trembling at the thought of what there might be to go through they tried to let him hear nothing about it but he seemed to know everything and when flora came into margarets room without her bonnet he raised his head and said i thought you were all going  the others arebut may i not stay with you and her papa  i had rather be alone my dears i will take care of her i should wish you all to be there  they decided that his wishes ought to be followed and that the patients must be entrusted to old nurse richard told flora who looked very pale that she would be glad of it afterwards and she had his arm to lean upon  the grave was in the cloister attached to the minster a smooth green square of turf marked here and there with small flat lozenges of stone bearing the date and initials of those who lay there and many of them recording former generations of mays to whom their descent from the headmaster had given a right of burial there dr hoxton mr wilmot and the surgeon were the only friends whom richard had asked to be with them but the minster was nearly full for there was a very strong attachment and respect for dr and mrs may throughout the neighbourhood and every ones feelings were strongly excited  in the midst of life we are in death there was a universal sound as of a sort of sob that etheldred never disconnected from those words yet hardly one tear was shed by the young things who stood as close as they could round the grave harry and mary did indeed lock their hands together tightly and the shoulders of the former shook as he stood bowing down his head but the others were still and quiet in part from awe and bewilderment but partly too from a sense that it was against her whole nature that there should be clamorous mourning for her the calm still day seemed to tell them the same the sun beaming softly on the gray arches and fresh grass the sky clear and blue and the trees that showed over the walls bright with autumn colouring all suitable to the serenity of a life unclouded to its last moment some of them felt as if it were better to be there than in their saddened desolate home  but home they must go and before going upstairs as flora and etheldred stood a moment or two with norman ethel said in a tone of resolution and of some cheerfulness well we have to begin afresh  yes said flora it is a great responsibility i do trust we may be enabled to do as we ought  and now margaret is getting better she will be our stay said ethel  i must go to her and flora went upstairs  i wish i could be as useful as flora said ethel but i mean to try and if i can but keep out of mischief it will be something  there is an object for all one does in trying to be a comfort to papa  thats no use said norman listlessly we never can  oh but norman he wont be always as he is nowi am sure he cares for us enough to be pleased if we do right and get on  we used to be so happy said norman  ethel hesitated a little and presently answered i dont think it can be right to lament for our own sakes so much is it  i dont want to do so said norman in the same dejected way  i suppose we ought not to feel it either norman only shook his head we ought to think of her gain you cant well i am glad for no more can i i cant think of her liking for papa and baby and all of us to be left to ourselves but thats not right of me and of course it all comes right where she is so i always put that out of my head and think what is to come next in doing and pleasing papa and learning  thats grown horrid said norman theres no pleasure in getting on nor in anything  dont you care for papa and all of us being glad norman as norman could not just then say that he did he would not answer  i wish said ethel disappointed but cheering up the next minute i do believe it is having nothing to do you will be better when you get back to school on monday  that is worst of all  you dont like going among the boys again but that must be done some time or other or shall i get richard to speak to dr hoxton to let you have another weeks leave  no no dont be foolish it cant be helped  i am very sorry but i think you will be better for it  she almost began to fancy herself unfeeling when she found him so much more depressed than she was herself and unable to feel it a relief to know that the time of rest and want of occupation was over she thought it lightminded though she could not help it to look forward to the daily studies where she might lose her sad thoughts and be as if everything were as usual but suppose she should be to blame where would now be the gentle discipline poor ethels feelings were not such as to deserve the imputation of levity when this thought came over her but her buoyant mind always seeking for consolation recurred to margarets improvement and she fixed her hopes on her  margaret was more alive to surrounding objects and when roused she knew them all answered clearly when addressed had even more than once spoken of her own accord and shown solicitude at the sight of her fathers bandaged helpless arm but he soon soothed this away he was more than ever watchful over her and could scarcely be persuaded to leave her for one moment in his anxiety to be at hand to answer when first she should speak of her mother a moment apprehended by all the rest almost as much for his sake as for hers  so clear had her perceptions been and so much more awake did she appear on this evening that he expected the inquiry to come every moment and lingered in her room till she asked the hour and begged him to go to bed  as he bent over her she looked up in his face and said softly dear papa  there was that in her tone which showed she perceived the truth and he knelt by her side kissing her but not daring to relax his restraint of feeling  dear papa she said again i hope i shall soon be better and be some comfort to you  my bestmy ownmy comfort he murmured all he could say without giving way  babyis she well  yes thank heaven she has not suffered at all  i heard her this morning i must see her tomorrow but dont stay dear dear papa it is late and i am sure you are not at all well your armis it very much hurt  it is nothing you need think about my dear i am much better than i could have imagined possible  and you have been nursing me all the time papa you must let me take care of you now do pray go to bed at once and get up late nurse will take good care of me goodnight dear papa  when dr may had left her and tried to tell richard how it had been the tears cut him short and had their free course but there was much of thankfulness for it might be looked on as the restoration of his daughter the worst was over and the next day he was able to think of other things had more attention to spare for the rest and when the surgeon came took some professional interest in the condition of his own arm inquired after his patients and even talked of visiting them  in the meantime margaret sent for her eldest brother begging him to tell her the whole and it was heard as calmly and firmly as it was told her bodily state lulled her mind and besides it was not new she had observed much while her faculties were still too much benumbed for her to understand all or to express her feelings her thoughts seemed chiefly occupied with her father she made richard explain to her the injury he had suffered and begged to know whether his constant attendance on her could do him harm she was much rejoiced when her brother assured her that nothing could be better for him and she began to say with a smile that very likely her being hurt had been fortunate she asked who had taken care of him before richards arrival and was pleased to hear that it was mr ernescliffe a visit from the little gertrude margaret was happily accomplished and on the whole the day was most satisfactoryshe herself declaring that she could not see that there was anything the matter with her except that she felt lazy and did not seem able to move  thus the next sunday morning dawned with more cheerfulness dr may came downstairs for the first time in order to go to church with his whole flock except the two margarets he looked very wan and shattered but they clustered gladly round him when he once more stood among them little blanche securing his hand and nodding triumphantly to mr ernescliffe as much as to say now i have him i dont want you  norman alone was missing but he was in his place at church among the boys again in returning he slipped out of the party and was at home the first and when this recurred in the afternoon ethel began to understand his motive the high street led past the spot where the accident had taken place though neither she nor any of the others knew exactly where it was except norman on whose mind the scene was branded indelibly she guessed that it was to avoid it that he went along what was called randalls alley his usual short cut to school  the sunday brought back to the children that there was no one to hear their hymns but richard was a great comfort watching over the little ones more like a sister than a brother ethel was ashamed of herself when she saw him taking thought for them tying blanches bonnet putting aubreys gloves on teaching them to put away their sunday toys as if he meant them to be as neat and precise as himself  dr may did not encounter the family dinner nor attempt a second going to church but blanche was very glorious as she led him down to drink tea and before going up again he had a conversation with alan ernescliffe who felt himself obliged to leave stoneborough early on the morrow  i can endure better to go now said he and i shall hear of you often hector will let me know and richard has promised to write  ay you must let us often have a line i should guess you were a letterwriting man  i have hitherto had too few friends who cared to hear of me to write much but the pleasure of knowing that any interest is taken in me here  well said the doctor mind that a letter will always be welcome and when you are coming southwards here are your old quarters we cannot lose sight of you anyway especiallyand his voice quiveredafter the help you gave my poor boys and girls in their distress  it would be the utmost satisfaction to think i had been of the smallest use said alan hiding much under these commonplace words  more than i know said dr may too much to speak of well we shall see you again though it is a changed place and you must come and see your goddaughterpoor childmay she only be brought up as her sisters were they will do their best poor things and so must i but it is sad work  both were too much overcome for words but the doctor was the first to continue as he took off his dimmed spectacles he seemed to wish to excuse himself for giving way saying with a look that would fain have been a smile the world has run so light and easy with me hitherto that you see i dont know how to bear with trouble all thinking and managing fell to my maggies share and i had as little care on my hands as one of my own boyspoor fellows i dont know how it is to turn out but of all the men on earth to be left with eleven children i should choose myself as the worst  alan tried to say somewhat of confidenceaffectiondaughters and broke down but it did as well as if it had been connected  yes yes said the doctor they are good children every one of them theres much to be thankful for if one could only pluck up heart to feel it  and you are convinced that margathat miss may is recovering  she has made a great advance today the head is right at least but the doctor looked anxious and spoke low as he said i am not satisfied about her yet that want of power over the limbs is more than the mere shock and debility as it seems to me though ward thinks otherwise and i trust he is right but i cannot tell yet as to the spine if this should not soon mend i shall have fleet to see her he was a fellowstudent of mine very clever and i have more faith in him than in any one else in that line  by all meansyes said alan excessively shocked but you will let me know how she goes onrichard will be so kind  we will not fail said dr may more and more touched at the sight of the young sailor struggling in vain to restrain his emotion you shall hear ill write myself as soon as i can use my hand but i hope she may be all right long before that is likely to be  your kindness alan attempted to say but began again feeling as i must then interrupting himself i beg your pardon tis no fit time nor fitbut youll let me hear  that i will said dr may and as alan hastily left the room he continued half aloud to himself poor boy poor fellow i see no wonder heaven grant i have not been the breaking of their two young hearts as well as my own maggie looked doubtfulas much as she ever did when my mind was set on a thing when i spoke of bringing him here but after all she liked him as much as the rest of us didshe could not wish it otherwisehe is one of a thousand and worthy of our margaret that he is and maggie thinks so if he gets on in his profession why then we shall see but the sigh of anguish of mind here showed that the wound had but been forgotten for one moment  pshaw what am i running on to im all astray for want of her my poor girl  mr ernescliffe set out before sunrise the boys were up to wish him goodbye and so were etheldred and mary and some one else for while the shaking of hands was going on in the hall there was a call mr ernthcliffe and over the balusters peeped a little rough curly head a face glowing with carnation deepened by sleep and a round plump bare arm and shoulder and down at alans feet there fell a construction of white and pink paper while a voice lisped out mr ernthcliffe theres a white rothe for you  an indignant miss blanche was heard behind and there was no certainty that any thanks reached the poor little heroine who was evidently borne off summarily to the nursery while ethel gave way to a paroxysm of suppressed laughter joined in more or less by all the rest and thus alan promising faithfully to preserve the precious token left dr mays door not in so much outward sorrow as he had expected  even their father laughed at the romance of the white rothe and declared blanche was a dangerous young lady but the story was less successful with miss winter who gravely said it was no wonder since blanches elder sister had been setting her the example of forwardness in coming down in this way after mr ernescliffe ethel was very angry and was only prevented from vindicating herself by remembering there was no peacemaker now and that she had resolved only to think of miss winters late kindness and bear with her tiresome ways  etheldred thought herself too sorrowful to be liable to her usual faults which would seem so much worse now but she found herself more irritable than usual and doubly heedless because her mind was preoccupied she hated herself and suffered more from sorrow than even at the first moment for now she felt what it was to have no one to tame her no eye over her she found herself going a tort et a travers all the morning and with no one to set her right since it was so the first day what would follow  mary was on the contrary so far subdued as to be exemplary in goodness and diligence and blanche was always steady flora was too busy to think of the schoolroom for the whole house was on her hands besides the charge of margaret while dr may went to the hospital and to sundry patients and they thought he seemed the better for the occupation as well as gratified and affected by the sympathy he everywhere met with from high and low  the boys were at school unseen except when at the dinner playhour norman ran home to ask after his father and sister but the most trying time was at eight in the evening when they came home that was wont to be the merriest part of the whole day the whole family collected papa at leisure and ready for talk or for play mamma smiling over her workbasket the sisters full of chatter the brothers full of fun all the tidings of the day discussed and nothing unwelcome but bedtime how different now the doctor was with margaret and though richard tried to say something cheerful as his brothers entered there was no response and they sat down on the opposite sides of the fire forlorn and silent till richard who was printing some letters on cardboard to supply the gaps in aubreys ivory alphabet called harry to help him but ethel as she sat at work could only look at norman and wish she could devise anything likely to gratify him  after a time flora came down and laying some sheets of closely written notepaper before her sister said here is dear mammas unfinished letter to aunt flora papa says we elder ones are to read it it is a description of us all and very much indeed we ought to learn from it i shall keep a copy of it  flora took up her work and began to consult with richard while ethel moved to normans side and kneeling so as to lean against his shoulder as he sat on a low cushion they read their mothers last letter by the firelight with indescribable feelings as they went through the subjects that had lately occupied them related by her who would never be among them again after much of this kind for her letters to mrs arnott were almost journals came   you say it is long since you had a portrait gallery of the chicken daisies and if i do not write in these leisure days you will hardly get it after i am in the midst of business again the new daisy is like margaret at the same agemay she continue like her pretty creature she can hardly be more charming than at present aubrey the moonfaced is far from reconciled to his disposition from babyhood he is a sober solemn gentleman backward in talking and with such a will of his own as will want much watching very different from blanche who is flora over again perhaps prettier and more fairylike unless this is only ones admiration for the buds of the present season none of them has ever been so winning as this little maid who even attracts dr hoxton himself and obtains sugarplums and kisses rather she than i says harry but notice is notice to the white mayflower and there is my anxietyi am afraid it is not wholesome to be too engaging ever to get a rebuff i hope having a younger sister and outgrowing baby charms may be salutary flora soon left off thinking about her beauty and the fit of vanity does less harm at five than fifteen my poor tom has not such a happy life as blanche he is often in trouble at lessons and bullied by harry at play in spite of his champion mary and yet i cannot interfere for it is good for him to have all this preparatory teasing before he goes into school he has good abilities but not much perseverance or energy and i must take the teaching of him into my own hands till his schooldays begin in hopes of instilling them the girlishness and timidity will be knocked out of him by the boys i suppose harry is too kind and generous to do more than tease him moderately and norman will see that it does not go too far it is a common saying that tom and mary made a mistake that he is the girl and she the boy for she is a rough merry creature the noisiest in the house always skirmishing with harry in defence of tom and yet devoted to him and wanting to do everything he does those two harry and mary are exactly alike except for harrys curly mane of lioncoloured wig the yellowhaired laddie is papas name for harry which he does not mind from him though furious if the girls attempt to call him so harry is the thorough boy of the family all spirit recklessness and mischief but so true and kind and noblehearted that one loves him the better after every freely confessed scrape i cannot tell you how grateful i am to my boy for his perfect confidence the thing that chiefly lessens my anxiety for him in his halfschool halfhome life which does not seem to me to work quite well with him there are two sons of mrs andersons at the school who are more his friends than i like and he is too easily led by the desire not to be outdone and to show that he fears nothing lately our sailorguest has inspired him with a vehement wish to go to sea i wish it was not necessary that the decision should be made so early in life for this fault is just what would make us most fear to send him into the world very young though in some ways it might not do amiss for him  so much for the younger bairns whom you never beheld dear flora the three whom you left when people used to waste pity on me for their being all babies together now look as if any pair of them were twins for norman is the tallest almost outgrowing his strength and ethels sharp face so like her papas makes her look older than flora norman and ethel do indeed take after their papa more than any of the others and are much alike there is the same brilliant cleverness the same strong feeling not easy of demonstration though impetuous in action but poor ethels old foibles her harumscarum nature quick temper uncouth manners and heedlessness of all but one absorbing object have kept her back and caused her much discomfort yet i sometimes think these manifest defects have occasioned a discipline that is the best thing for the character in the end they are faults that show themselves and which one can tell how to deal with and i have full confidence that she has the principle within her that will conquer them  if mournfully sighed ethel but her brother pointed on further  my great hope is her entire indifference to praisenot approval but praise if she has not come up to her own standard she works on not always with good temper but perseveringly and entirely unheeding of commendation till she has satisfied herself only thinking it stupid not to see the faults it is this independence of praise that i want to see in her brother and sister they justly earn it and are rightly pleased with it but i cannot feel sure whether they do not depend on it too much norman lives like all schoolboys a life of emulation and has never met with anything but success i do believe dr hoxton and mr wilmot are as proud of him as we are and he has never shown any tendency to conceit but i am afraid he has the love of being foremost and pride in his superiority caring for what he is compared with others rather than what he is himself   i know said norman i have done so but thats over i see what it is worth id give all the quam optimes i ever got in my life to be the help richard is to papa  you would if you were his age  not i im not the sort im not like her but are we to go on about the elders  oh yes dont let us miss a word there cant be anything but praise of them   your sweet goddaughter i almost feel as if i had spoken in disparagement of her but i meant no such thing dear girl it would be hard to find a fault in her since the childish love of admiration was subdued she is so solid and steady as to be very valuable with the younger ones and is fast growing so lovely that i wish you could behold her i do not see any vanity but there lies my dread not of beautyvanity but that she will find temptation in the being everywhere liked and sought after as to margaret my precious companion and friend you have heard enough of her to know her and as to telling you what she is like i could as soon set about describing her papa when i thought of not being spared to them this time it was happiness indeed to think of her at their head fit to be his companion with so much of his own talent as to be more up to conversation with him than he could ever have found his stupid old maggie it was rather a trial of her discretion to have mr ernescliffe here while i was upstairs and very well she seems to have come out of it poor richards last disappointment is still our chief trouble he has been working hard with a tutor all through the vacation and has not even come home to see his new sister on his way to oxford he had made a resolution that he would not come to us till he had passed and his father thought it best that it should be kept i hope he will succeed next time but his nervousness renders it still more doubtful with him it is the very reverse of norman he suffers too much for want of commendation and i cannot wonder at it when i see how much each failure vexes his father and richard little knows how precious is our perfect confidence in him how much more valuable than any honours he could earn you would be amused to see how little he is altered from the pretty little fair fellow that you used to say was so like my old portrait even the wavy rings of light glossy hair sit on his forehead just as you liked to twist them and his small trim figure is a fine contrast to normans long legs and arms which   there the letter broke off the playful affection of the last words making it almost more painful to think that the fond hand would never finish the sentence     chapter vi         a drooping daisy changed into a cup      in which her brighteyed beauty is shut up                                           wordsworth   so there you are up for the dayreally you look very comfortable said ethel coming into the room where margaret lay on her bed halfraised by pillows supported by a wooden frame  yes is not it a charming contrivance of richards it quite gives me the use of my hands said margaret  i think he is doing something else for you said ethel i heard him carpentering at six oclock this morning but i suppose it is to be a secret  and dont you admire her nightcap said flora  is it anything different said ethel peering closer oh i seeso she has a fine day nightcap is that your taste flora  partly said margaret and partly my own i put in all these little white puffs and i hope you think they do me credit wasnt it grand of me  she only despises you for them said flora  im very glad you could said ethel gravely but do you know it is rather like that horrid old lady in some book who had a paralytic stroke and the first thing she did that showed she had come to her senses was to write rosecoloured curtains for the doctors  well it was for the doctor said margaret and it had its effect he told me i looked much better when he found me trying it on  and did you really have the lookingglass and try it on cried ethel  yes really said flora dont you think one may as well be fit to be seen if one is ill it is no use to depress ones friends by being more forlorn and disconsolate than one can help  nonot disconsolate said ethel but the white puffinessand the hemmingand the glass  poor ethel cant get over it said margaret but ethel do you think there is nothing disconsolate in untidiness  you could be tidy without the little puffs your first bit of work too dont think im tiresome if they were an amusement to you i am sure i am very glad of them but i cant see the sense of them  poor little things said margaret laughing it is only my foible for making a thing look nice and ethel she added drawing her down close over her i did not think the trouble wasted if seeing me look fresher cheered up dear papa a moment  i spoke to papa about nurses proposal said margaret presently to flora and he quite agrees to it indeed it is impossible that anne should attend properly to all the children while nurse is so much engaged with me  i think so said flora and it does not answer to bring aubrey into the schoolroom it only makes mary and blanche idle and miss winter does not like it  then the question is who shall it be nurse has no one in view and only protests against one of the girls out of the school here  thats a great pity said flora dont you think we could make her take to jane white she is so very nice  i thought of her but it will never answer if we displease nurse besides i remember at the time anne came dear mamma thought there was danger of a girls having too many acquaintances especially taking the children out walking we cannot always be sure of sending her out with anne  do you remember said ethel there stopping  well said both sisters  dont you recollect flora that girl whose father was in the hospitalthat girl at cocksmoor  i do said flora she was a very nice girl i wonder whether nurse would approve of her  how old said margaret fourteen and tall such a clean cottage  the girls went on and margaret began to like the idea very much and consider whether the girl could be brought for inspection before nurse was prejudiced by hearing of her cocksmoor extraction at that moment richard knocked at the door and entered with tom helping him to bring a small shortlegged table such as could stand on the bed at the right height for margarets meals or employments  there were great exclamations of satisfaction and gratitude it was the very thing wanted only how could he have contrived it  dont you recognise it said he  oh i see it is the old drawingdesk that no one used and you have put legs to ithow famous you are the best contriver richard  then see you can raise it up for reading or writing heres a corner for your ink to stand flat and there it is down for your dinner  charming you have made it go so easily when it used to be so stiff theregive me my workbasket please ethel i mean to make some more white puffs  whats the matter now ethel said flora you look as if you did not approve of the table  i was only thinking it was as if she was settling herself to lie in bed for a very long time said ethel  i hope not said richard but i dont see why she should not be as comfortable as she can while she is there  i am sure i hope you will never be ill ethel said flora you would be horrid to nurse  she will know how to be grateful when she is said margaret  i say richard exclaimed ethel this is hospitalmeeting day so you wont be wanted to drive papa  no i am at your service do you want a walk  so it was determined that richard and ethel should walk together to cocksmoor  no two people could be much more unlike than richard and etheldred may but they were very fond of each other richard was sometimes seriously annoyed by ethels heedlessness and did not always understand her sublimities but he had a great deal of admiration for one who partook so much of his fathers nature and ethel had a due respect for her eldest brother gratitude and strong affection for many kindnesses a reverence for his sterling goodness and his exemption from her own besetting failings only a little damped by compassionate wonder at his deficiency in talent and by her vexation at not being always comprehended  they went by the road for the plantation gate was far too serious an undertaking for any one not in the highest spirits for enterprise on the way there was a good deal of that desultory talk very sociable and interesting that is apt to prevail between two people who would never have chosen each other for companions if they were not of the same family but who are nevertheless very affectionate and companionable ethel was anxious to hear what her brother thought of papas spirits and whether he talked in their drives  sometimes said richard it is just as it happens now and then he goes on just like himself and then at other times he will not speak for three or four miles  and he sighs said ethel those sighs are so very sad and long and deep they seem to have whole volumes in them as if there was such a weight on him  some people say he is not as much altered as they expected said richard  oh do they well i cant fancy any one feeling it more he cant leave off his old self of course but ethel stopped short  margaret is a great comfort to him said richard  that she is she thinks of him all day long and i dont think either of them is ever so happy as in the evening when he sits with her they talk about mamma then  it was just what richard could not do and he made some observation to change the subject but ethel returned to it so far as to beg to know how the arm was going on for she did not like to say anything about it to papa  it will be a long business i am afraid said richard indeed he said the other day he thought he should never have the free use of the elbow  and do you think it is very painful i saw the other day when aubrey was sitting on his knee and fidgeting he shrank whenever he even came towards it and yet it seemed as if he could not bear to put him down  yes it is excessively tender and sometimes gets very bad at night  ah said ethel theres a linehereround his eyes that there never used to be and when it deepens i am sure he is in pain or has been kept awake  you are very odd ethel how do you see things in peoples faces when you miss so much at just the same distance  i look after what i care about said ethel one sees more with ones mind than ones eyes the best sight is inside  but do you always see the truth said richard gravely  quite enough what is less common than the ordinary world said ethel  richard shook his head not quite satisfied but not sure enough that he entered into her meaning to question it  i wonder you dont wear spectacles was the result of his meditation and it made her laugh by being so inapposite to her own reflections but the laugh ended in a melancholy look dear mamma did not like me to use them she said in a low voice  thus they talked till they arrived at cocksmoor where poor mrs taylor inspirited by better reports of her husband and the hopes for her daughter was like another woman richard was very careful not to raise false expectations saying it all depended on miss may and nurse and what they thought of her strength and steadiness but these cautions did not seem capable of damping the hopes of the smoothhaired lucy who stood smiling and curtseying the twins were grown and improved and ethel supposed they would be brought to church on the next christening sunday but their mother looked helpless and hopeless about getting them so far and how was she to get gossips ethel began to grow very indignant but she was always shy of finding fault with poor people to their faces when she would not have done so to persons in her own station and so she was silent while richard hoped they would be able to manage and said it would be better not to wait another month for still worse weather and shorter days  as they were coming out of the house a big roughlooking uncivilised boy came up before them and called out i saybent you the young doctor up at stoneborough  i am dr mays son said richard while ethel startled clung to his arm in dread of some rudeness  grannys bad said the boy proceeding without further explanation to lead the way to another hovel though richard tried to explain that the knowledge of medicine was not in his case hereditary a poor old woman sat groaning over the fire and two children crouched halfclothed on the bare floor  richards gentle voice and kind manner drew forth some wonderful descriptionsher head was all of a goggle her legs all of a fur she felt as if some one was cutting right through her  well said richard kindly i am no doctor myself but ill ask my father about you and perhaps he can give you an order for the hospital  no no thank ye sir i cant go to the hospital i cant leave these poor children theyve no father nor mother sir and no one to do for them but me  what do you live on then said richard looking round the desolate hut  on sams wages sir thats that boy he is a good boy to me sir and his little sisters he brings it all he gets home to me riglar but tis but six shillings a week and they makes em take half of it out in goods and beer which is a bad thing for a boy like him sir  how old are you sam  sam scratched his head and answered nothing his grandmother knew he was the age of her black bonnet and as he looked about fifteen ethel honoured him and the bonnet accordingly while richard said he must be very glad to be able to maintain them all at his age and promising to try to bring his father that way since prescribing at second hand for such curious symptoms was more than could be expected he took his leave  a wretched place said richard looking round i dont know what help there is for the people theres no one to do any thing for them and it is of no use to tell them to come to church when it it so far off and there is so little room for them  it is miserable said ethel and all her thoughts during her last walk thither began to rush over her again not effaced but rather burned in by all that had subsequently happened she had said it should be her aim and effort to make cocksmoor a christian place such a resolve must not pass away lightly she knew it must be acted on but how what would her present meansone sovereigneffect her fancies rich and rare had nearly been forgotten of late but she might make them of use in timein time and here were hives of children growing up in heathenism suddenly an idea struck herrichard when at home was a very diligent teacher in the sundayschool at stoneborough though it was a thankless task and he was the only gentleman so engaged except the two clergymenthe other male teachers being a formal grave little baker and one or two monitors  richard said ethel ill tell you what suppose we were to get up a sundayschool at cocksmoor we could get a room and walk there every sunday afternoon and go to church in the evening instead  he was so confounded by the suddenness of the project that he did not answer till she had time for several exclamations and well richard  i cannot tell he said going to church in the evening would interfere with teatimeput out all the housemake the evening uncomfortable  the evenings are horrid now especially sundays said ethel  but missing two more would make them worse for the others  papa is always with margaret said ethel we are of no use to him besides these poor childrenare not they of more importance  and then what is to become of stoneborough school  i hate it exclaimed ethel then seeing richard shocked and finding she had spoken more vehemently than she intendedit is not as bad for you among the boys but while that committee goes on it is not the least use to try to teach the girls right oh the fusses about the books and ones way of teaching and fancy how mrs ledwich used us you know i went again last sunday for the first time and there i found that class of margarets that she had just managed to get into some degree of nice order taken so much pains with taught so well she had been telling me what to hear themthere it is given away to fanny anderson who is no more fit to teach than that stick and all margarets work will be undone no notice to usnot even the civility to wait and see when she gets better  if we left them now for cocksmoor would it not look as it we were affronted  ethel was slightly taken aback but only said papa would be very angry if he knew it  i am glad you did not tell him said richard  i thought it would only tease him said ethel and that he might call it a petty female squabble and when margaret is well it will come right if fanny anderson has not spoiled the girls in the meantime it is all mrs ledwichs doing how i did hate it when every one came up and shook hands with me and asked after margaret and papa only just out of curiosity  hush hush ethel whats the use of thinking such things  a silencethen she exclaimed but indeed richard you dont fancy that i want to teach at cocksmoor because it is disagreeable at stoneborough  no indeed  the rendering of full justice conveyed in his tone so opened ethels heart that she went on eagerlythe history of it is this last time we walked here that day i said and i meant it that i would never put it out of my head i would go on doing and striving and trying till this place was properly cared for and has a church and a clergyman i believe it was a vow richard i do believe it wasand if one makes one one must keep it there it is so i cant give money i have but one pound in the world but i have time and i would make that useful if you would help me  i dont see how was the answer and there was a fragment of a smile on richards face as if it struck him as a wild scheme that ethel should undertake single handed to evangelise cocksmoor  it was such a damper as to be most mortifying to an enthusiastic girl and she drew into herself in a moment  they walked home in silence and when richard warned her that she was not keeping her dress out of the dirt it sounded like a sarcasm on her projects and with a slightly pettish manner she raised the unfortunate skirt its crape trimmings greatly bespattered with ruddy mud then recollecting how mamma would have shaken her head at that very thing she regretted the temper she had betrayed and in a larmoyante voice sighed i wish i could pick my way better some people have the gift you have hardly a splash and im up to the ankles in mud  it is only taking care said richard besides your frock is so long and full cant you tuck it up and pin it  my pins always come out said ethel disconsolately crumpling the black folds into one hand while she hunted for a pin with the other  no wonder if you stick them in that way said richard oh youll tear that crape here let me help you dont you see make it go in and out that way give it something to pull against  ethel laughed thats the third thing you have taught meto thread a needle tie a bow and stick in a pin i never could learn those things of any one else they show but dont explain the theory  they met dr may at the entrance of the town very tired and saying he had been a long tramp all over the place and mrs hoxton had been boring him with her fancies as he took richards arm he gave the long heavy sigh that always fell so painfully on ethels ear  dear dear dear papa thought she my work must also be to do all i can to comfort him  her reflections were broken off dr may exclaimed ethel dont make such a figure of yourself those muddy ankles and petticoats are not fit to be seenthere now you are sweeping the pavement have you no medium one would think you had never worn a gown in your life before  poor ethel stepped on before with mudencrusted heels and her father speaking sharply in the weariness and soreness of his heart her draggletailed petticoats weighing down at once her missionary projects at cocksmoor and her tender visions of comforting her widowed father her heart was full to overflowing and where was the mother to hear her troubles  she opened the hall door and would have rushed upstairs but nurse happened to be crossing the hall miss ethel miss ethel you arent going up with them boots on i do declare you are just like one of the boys and your frock  ethel sat submissively down on the lowest step and pulled off her boots as she did so her father and brother came inthe former desiring richard to come with him to the study and write a note for him she hoped that thus she might have margaret to herself and hurried into her room margaret was alone maids and children at tea and flora dressing the room was in twilight with the red gleam of the fire playing cheerfully over it  well ethel have you had a pleasant walk  yesnooh margaret and throwing herself across the bottom of the bed she burst into tears  ethel dear what is the matter papa  nonoonly i draggled my frock and richard threw cold water and i am good for nothing oh if mamma was but here  darling ethel dear ethel i wish i could comfort you come a little nearer to me i cant reach you dear ethel what has gone wrong  everything said ethel noim too dirty to come on your white bed i forgot you wont like it added she in an injured tone  you are wet you are cold you are tired said margaret stay here and dress dont go up in the cold there sit by the fire pull off your frock and stockings and we will send for the others let me see you look comfortablethere now tell me who threw cold water  it was figurative cold water said ethel smiling for a moment i was only silly enough to tell richard my plan and its horrid to talk to a person who only thinks one highflying and nonsensicaland then came the dirt  but what was the scheme ethel  cocksmoor said ethel proceeding to unfold it  i wish we could said margaret it would be an excellent thing but how did richard vex you  i dont know said ethel only he thought it would not do perhaps he said right but it was coldly and he smiled  he is too soberminded for our flights said margaret i know the feeling of it ethel dear but you know if he did see that some of your plans might not answer it is no reason you should not try to do something at once you have not told me about the girl  ethel proceeded to tell the history there said margaret cheerfully there are two ways of helping cocksmoor already could you not make some clothes for the two grandchildren i could help you a little and then if they were well clothed you might get them to come to the sundayschool and as to the twins i wonder what the hire of a cart would be to bring the christening party it is just what richard could manage  yes said ethel but those are only little isolated individual things  but one must make a beginning  then margaret you think it was a real vow you dont think it silly of me said ethel wistfully  ethel dear i dont think dear mamma would say we ought to make vows except what the church decrees for us i dont think she would like the notion of your considering yourself pledged but i do think that after all you have said and felt about cocksmoor and being led there on that day it does seem as if we might be intended to make it our especial charge  oh margaret i am glad you say so you always understand  but you know we are so young that now we have not her to judge for us we must only do little things that we are quite sure of or we shall get wrong  thats not the way great things were done  i dont know ethel i think great things cant be good unless they stand on a sure foundation of little ones  well i believe richard was right and it would not do to begin on sunday but he was so tame and then my frock and the horrid deficiency in those little neatnesses  perhaps that is good for you in one way you might get very highflying if you had not the discipline of those little tiresome things correcting them will help you and keep your high things from being all romance i know dear mamma used to say so that the trying to conquer them was a help to you oh heres mary mary will you get ethels dressing things she has come home wetfooted and cold and has been warming herself by my fire  mary was happy to help and ethel was dressed and cheered by the time dr may came in for a hurried visit and report of his doings flora followed on her way from her room then all went to tea leaving margaret to have a visit from the little ones under charge of nurse two hours stay with her that precious time when she knew that sad as the talk often was it was truly a comfort to him it ended when ten oclock struck and he went downmargaret hearing the bell the sounds of the assembling servants the shutting of the door the stillness of prayertime the opening again the feet moving off in different directions then brothers and sisters coming in to kiss her and bid her goodnight nurse and flora arranging her for the night flora coming to sleep in her little bed in the corner of the room and lastly her fathers tender goodnight and melancholy look at her and all was quiet except the low voices and movements as richard attended him in his own room  margaret could think dear dear ethel how noble and high she is but i am afraid it is what people call a difficult dangerous age and the grander she is the greater danger of not managing her rightly if those high purposes should run only into romance like mine or grow out into eccentricities and unfemininesses what a grievous pity it would be and i so little older so much less clever with just sympathy enough not to be a wise restrainti am the person who has the responsibility and oh what shall i do mamma trusted to me to be a mother to them papa looks to me and i so unfit besides this helplessness but god sent it and put me in my place he made me lie here and will raise me up if it is good so i trust he will help me with my sisters  grant me to have a right judgment in all things and evermore to rejoice in thy holy comfort     chapter vii         something between a hindrance and a help                                     wordsworth   etheldred awoke long before time for getting up and lay pondering over her visions margaret had sympathised and therefore they did not seem entirely aerial to earn money by writing was her favourite plan and she called her various romances in turn before her memory to judge which might be brought down to sober pen and ink she considered till it became not too unreasonably early to get up it was dark but there was a little light close to the window she had no writingpaper but she would interline her old exercisebook down she ran and crouching in the schoolroom windowseat she wrote on in a trance of eager composition till norman called her as he went to school to help him to find a book  this done she went up to visit margaret to tell her the story and consult her but this was not so easy she found margaret with little daisy lying by her and tom sitting by the fire over his latin  oh ethel goodmorning dear you are come just in time  to take baby said ethel as the child was fretting a little  yes thank you she has been very good but she was tired of lying here and i cant move her about said margaret  oh margaret i have such a plan said ethel as she walked about with little gertrude but tom interrupted  margaret will you see if i can say my lesson and the thumbed latin grammar came across her just as dr mays door opened and he came in exclaiming latin grammar margaret this is really too much for you goodmorning my dears ha tommy take your book away my boy you must not inflict that on sister now theres your regular master richard in my room if it is fit for his ears yet what the little one here too  how is your arm papa said margaret did it keep you awake  not longit set me dreaming though and a very romantic dream it was worthy of ethel herself  what was it papa  oh it was an odd thing joining on strangely enough with one i had three or four and twenty years ago when i was a young man hearing lectures at edinburgh and courting he stopped and felt margarets pulse asked her a few questions and talked to the baby ethel longed to hear his dream but thought he would not like to go on however he did presently  the old dream was the night after a picnic on arthurs seat with the mackenzies mamma and aunt flora were there twas a regular boys dream a tournament or something of that nature where i was victor the queenyou know who she wasgiving me her tokena daisy chain  that is why you like to call us your daisy chain said ethel  did you write it in verse said margaret i think i once saw some verses like it in her desk  i was in love and threeandtwenty said the doctor looking drolly guilty in the midst of his sadness ay those fixed it in my memory perhaps my fancy made it more distinct than it really was an evening or two ago i met with them and that stirred it up i suppose last night came the tournament again but it was the melee a sense of being crushed down suffocated by the throng of armed knights and horsespain and woundsand i looked in vain through the opposing overwhelming host for mymy maggie well i got the worst of it my sword arm was brokeni fell was stifledcrushedin miseryall i could do was to grasp my tokenmy daisy chain and he pressed margarets hand as he said so and behold the tumult and despair were passed i lay on the grass in the cloisters and the daisy chain hung from the sky and was drawing me upwards thereit is a queer dream for a sober old country doctor i dont know why i told you dont tell any one again  and he walked away muttering for he told me his dreams talked of eating and drinking leaving margaret with her eyes full of tears and ethel vehemently caressing the baby  how beautiful said ethel  it has been a comfort to him i am sure said margaret  you dont think it ominous said ethel with a slight tremulous voice  more soothing than anything else it is what we all feel is it not that this little daisy bud is the link between us and heaven  but about him he was victor at firstvanquished the next time  i thinkif it is to have an interpretation though i am not sure we ought to take it so seriously it would only mean that in younger days people care for victory and distinction in this world like norman or as papa most likely did then but as they grow older they care less and others pass them and they know it does not signify for in our race all may win  but he has a great name how many people come from a distance to consult him he is looked upon too in other ways he can do anything with the corporation  margaret smiled all this does not sound grandit is not as if he had set up in london  oh dear i am so glad he did not  shall i tell you what mamma told me he said about it when uncle mackenzie said he ought he answered that he thought health and happy home attachments were a better provision for us to set out in life with than thousands  i am sure he was right said ethel earnestly then you dont think the dream meant being beaten only that our best things are not gained by successes in this world  dont go and let it dwell on your mind as a vision said margaret i think dear mamma would call that silly  an interruption occurred and ethel had to go down to breakfast with a mind floating between romance sorrow and high aspirations very unlike the actual world she had to live in first there was a sick man walking into the study and her father laying down his letters saying i must despatch him before prayers i suppose ive a great mind to say i never will see any one who wont keep to my days  i cant imagine why they dont said flora as he went he is always saying so but never acting on it if he would once turn one away the rest would mind  richard went on in silence cutting bread and butter  theres another ring said mary  yes he is caught now theyll go on in a stream i shall not keep margaret waiting for her breakfast i shall take it up  the morning was tiresome though dr may had two regular days for seeing poor people at his house he was too goodnatured to keep strictly to them and this day as flora had predicted there was a procession of them not soon got rid of even by his rapid queries and the talismanic figures made by his left hand on scraps of paper with which he sent them off to the infirmary ethel tried to read the children lingered about it was a trial of temper to all but tom who obtained richards attention to his lessons he liked to say them to his brother and was an incentive to learn them quickly that none might remain for miss winter when richard went out with his father if mamma had been there she would have had prayers but now no one had authority enough though they did at last even finish breakfast just as the gig came to the door dr may dismissed his last patient rang the bell in haste and as soon as prayers were over declared he had an appointment and had no time to eat there was a general outcry that it was bad enough when he was well and now he must not take liberties flora made him drink some tea and richard placed morsels in his way while he read his letters he ran up for a final look at margaret almost upset the staid miss winter as he ran down again called richard to take the reins and was off  it was french day always a trial to ethel m ballompre the master knew what was good and bad french but could not render a reason and ethel being versed in the principles of grammar from her latin studies chose to know the why and wherefore of his correctionsshe did not like to see her pages defaced and have no security against future errors while he thought her a troublesome pupil and was put out by her questions they wrangled miss winter was displeased and ethel felt injured  marys inability to catch the pronunciation and her hopeless dull look when she found that coeur must not be pronounced cour nor cur but something between to which her rosy english lips could never comeall this did not tease m ballompre for he was used to it  his mark for ethels lesson was de lhumeur  i am sorry said miss winter when he was gone i thought you had outgrown that habit of disputing over every phrase  i cant tell how a language is to be learned without knowing the reasons of ones mistakes said ethel  that is what you always say my dear it is of no use to renew it all but i wish you would control yourself now mary call blanche and you and ethel take your arithmetic  so flora went to read to margaret while blanche went lightly and playfully through her easy lessons and mary floundered piteously over the difficulties of compound long division ethels mind was in too irritated and tumultuous a state for her to derive her usual solace from cube root her sum was wrong and she wanted to work it right but miss winter who had little liking for the higher branches of arithmetic said she had spent time enough over it and summoned her to an examination such as the governess was very fond of and often practised ethel thought it useless and was teased by it and though her answers were chiefly correct they were given in an irritated tone it was of this kind           what is the date of the invention of paper         what is the latitude and longitude of otaheite         what are the component parts of brass         whence is cochineal imported   when this was over ethel had to fetch her mendingbasket and mary her book of selections the piece for todays lesson was the quarrel of brutus and cassius and marys dull droning tone was a trial to her ears she presently exclaimed oh mary dont murder it  murder what said mary opening wide her light blue eyes  that use of exaggerated language began miss winter  ive heard papa say it said ethel only wanting to silence miss winter in a cooler moment she would not have used the argument  all that a gentleman may say may not be a precedent for a young lady but you are interrupting mary  only let me show her i cant bear to hear her listen mary           what shall one of us          that struck the foremost   that is declaiming said miss winter it is not what we wish for in a lady you are neglecting your work and interfering  ethel made a fretful contortion and obeyed so it went on all the morning ethels eagerness checked by miss winters dry manner producing pettishness till ethel in a state between selfreproach and a sense of injustice went up to prepare for dinner and to visit margaret on the way  she found her sister picking a merino frock to pieces see here she said eagerly i thought you would like to make up this old frock for one of the cocksmoor children but what is the matter as ethel did not show the lively interest that she expected  oh nothing only miss winter is so tiresome  what was it  everything it was all horrid i was cross i know but she and m ballompre made me so and ethel was in the midst of the narration of her grievances when norman came in the school was half a mile off but he had not once failed to come home in the interval allowed for play after dinner to inquire for his sister  well norman you are out of breath sit down and rest what is doing at school are you dux of your class  yes said the boy wearily  what mark for the verses said ethel  quam bene  not optime  no they were tame dr hoxton said  what is harry doing said margaret  he is fourth in his form i left him at football  dinner said flora at the door what will you have margaret  ill fetch it said norman who considered it his privilege to wait on margaret at dinner when he had brought the tray he stood leaning against the bedpost musing suddenly there was a considerable clatter of fireirons and his violent start surprised margaret  ethel has been poking the fire she said as if no more was needed to account for their insecurity norman put them up again but a ringing sound betrayed that it was not with a firm touch and when a minute after he came to take her plate she saw that he was trying with effort to steady his hand  norman dear are you sure you are well  yes very well said he as if vexed that she had taken any notice  you had better not come racing home im not worth inquiries now i am so much better said she smiling  he made no reply but this was not consenting silence  i dont like you to lose your football she proceeded  i could not and he stopped short  it would be much better for you said she looking up in his face with anxious affectionate eyes but he shunned her glance and walked away with her plate  flora had been in such close attendance upon margaret that she needed some cheerful walks and though she had some doubts how affairs at home would go on without her she was overruled and sent on a long expedition with miss winter and mary while ethel remained with margaret  the only delay before setting out was that nurse came in saying if you please miss margaret there is a girl come to see about the place  the sisters looked at each other and smiled while margaret asked whence she came and who she was  her name is taylor and she comes from cocksmoor but she is a nice tidy stronglooking girl and she says she has been used to children  nurse had fallen into the trap most comfortably and seemed bent upon taking this girl as a choice of her own she wished to know if miss margaret would like to see her  if you please nurse but if you think she will do that is enough  yes miss but you should look to them things yourself if you please ill bring her up so nurse departed  charming cried ethel thats your capital management flora nurse thinks she has done it all herself  she is your charge though said flora coming from your own beloved cocksmoor  lucy taylor came in looking very nice and very shy curtseying low in extreme awe of the pale lady in bed margaret was much pleased with her and there was no more to be done but to settle that she should come on saturday and to let nurse take her into the town to invest her with the universal blackness of the household where the two margarets were the only white things  this arranged and the walking party set forth ethel sat down by her sisters bed and began to assist in unpicking the merino telling margaret how much obliged she was to her for thinking of it and how grieved at having been so ungrateful in the morning she was very happy over her contrivances cutting out under her sisters superintendence she had forgotten the mornings annoyance till margaret said i have been thinking of what you said about miss winter and really i dont know what is to be done  oh margaret i did not mean to worry you said ethel sorry to see her look uneasy  i like you to tell me everything dear ethel but i dont see clearly the best course we must go on with miss winter  of course said ethel shocked at her murmurs having even suggested the possibility of a change and having as well as all the others a great respect and affection for her governess  we could not get on without her even if i were well continued margaret and dear mamma had such perfect trust in her and we all know and love her so wellit would make us put up with a great deal  it is all my own fault said ethel only anxious to make amends to miss winter i wish you would not say anything about it  yes it does seem wrong even to think of it said margaret when she has been so very kind it is a blessing to have any one to whom mary and blanche may so entirely be trusted but for you  it is my own fault repeated ethel  i dont think it is quite all your own fault said margaret and that is the difficulty i know dear mamma thought miss winter an excellent governess for the little ones but hardly up to you and she saw that you worried and fidgeted each other so you know she used to keep the teaching of you a good deal in her own hands  i did not know that was the reason said ethel overpowered by the recollection of the happy mornings work she had often done in that very room when her mother had not been equal to the bustle of the whole schoolroom that watchful protecting guarding mothers love a shadow of providence had been round them so constantly on every side that they had been hardly conscious of it till it was lost to them  was it not like her said margaret but now my poor ethel i dont think it would be right by you or by miss winter to take you out of the schoolroom i think it would grieve her  i would not do that for the world  especially after her kind nursing of me and even with more reason it would not be becoming in us to make changes besides king etheldred said margaret smiling we all know you are a little bit of a sloven and as nurse says some one must be always after you and do you know even if i were well i had rather it was miss winter than me  oh no you would not be formal and preciseyou would not make me cross  perhaps you might make me so said margaret or i should let you alone and leave you a slattern we should both hate it so no dont make me your mistress ethel dearlet me be your sister and playfellow still as well as i can  you are you are i dont care half so much when i have got you  and will you try to bear with her and remember it is right in the main though it is troublesome  that i will i wont plague you again i know it is bad for you you look tired  pray dont leave off telling me said margaretit is just what i wish on my own account and i know it is comfortable to have a good grumble  if it does not hurt you but i am sure you are not easy noware you  only my back said margaret i have been sitting up longer than usual and it is tired will you call nurse to lay me flat again  the nursery was desertedall were out and ethel came back in trepidation at the notion of having to do it herself though she knew it was only to put one arm to support her sister while with the other she removed the pillows but ethel was conscious of her own awkwardness and want of observation nor had margaret entire trust in her still she was too much fatigued to wait so ethel was obliged to do her best she was careful and frightened and therefore slow and unsteady she trusted that all was right and margaret tried to believe so though still uneasy  ethel began to read to her and dr may came home she looked up smiling and asked where he had been but it was vain to try to keep him from reading her face he saw in an instant that something was amiss and drew from her a confession that her back was aching a little he knew she might have said a great dealshe was not in a comfortable positionshe must be moved she shook her headshe had rather waitthere was a dread of being again lifted by ethel that she could not entirely hide ethel was distressed dr may was angry and no wonder when he saw margaret suffer felt his own inability to help missed her who had been wont to take all care from his hands and was vexed to see a tall strong girl of fifteen with the full use of both arms and plenty of sense incapable of giving any assistance and only doing harm by trying  it is of no use said he ethel will give no attention to anything but her books ive a great mind to put an end to all the latin and greek she cares for nothing else  ethel could little brook injustice and much as she was grieving she exclaimed papa papa i do carenow dont i margaret i did my best  dont talk nonsense your best indeed if you had taken the most moderate care  i believe ethel took rather too much care said margaret much more harassed by the scolding than by the pain it will be all right presently never mind dear papa  but he was not only grieved for the present but anxious for the future and though he knew it was bad for margaret to manifest his displeasure he could not restrain it and continued to blame ethel with enough of injustice to set her on vindication whereupon he silenced her by telling her she was making it worse by selfjustification when margaret ought to be quiet margaret tried to talk of other things but was in too much discomfort to exert herself enough to divert his attention  at last flora returned and saw in an instant what was wanted margaret was settled in the right posture but the pain would not immediately depart and dr may soon found out that she had a headache of which he knew he was at least as guilty as etheldred could be  nothing could be done but keep her quiet and ethel went away to be miserable flora tried to comfort her by saying it was unfortunate but no doubt there was a knack and everyone could not manage those things margaret was easier now and as to papas anger he did not always mean all he said  but consolation came at bedtime margaret received her with open arms when she went to wish her goodnight my poor ethel she said holding her close i am sorry i have made such a fuss  oh you did not it was too bad of mei am grieved are you quite comfortable now  yes quite only a little headache which i shall sleep off it has been so nice and quiet papa took up george herbert and has been reading me choice bits i dont think i have enjoyed anything so much since i have been ill  i am glad of that but i have been unhappy all the evening i wish i knew what to do i am out of heart about everything  only try to mind and heed and you will learn it will be a step if you will only put your shoes side by side when you take them off  ethel smiled and sighed and margaret whispered dont grieve about me but put your clever head to rule your hands and you will do for home and cocksmoor too goodnight dearest  ive vexed papa sighed etheland just then he came into the room  papa said margaret heres poor ethel not half recovered from her troubles  he was now at ease about margaret and knew he had been harsh to another of his motherless girls  ah we must send her to the infantschool to learn this is my right hand and this is my left said he in his halfgay halfsad manner  i was very stupid said ethel  poor child said her papa she is worse off than i am if i have but one hand left she has two left hands  i do mean to try papa  yes you must ethel i believe i was hasty with you my poor girl i was vexed and we have no one to smooth us down i am sorry my dear but you must bear with me for i never learned her ways with you when i might we will try to have more patience with each other  what could ethel do but hang round his neck and cry till he said but tenderly that they had given margaret quite disturbance enough today and sent her to bed vowing to watch each little action lest she should again give pain to such a father and sister     chapter viii         tis not enough that greek or roman page       at stated hours his freakish thoughts engage       even in his pastimes he requires a friend       to warn and teach him safely to unbend       oer all his pleasures gently to preside       watch his emotions and control their tidecowper   the misfortunes of that day disheartened and disconcerted etheldred to do mischief where she most wished to do good to grieve where she longed to comfort seemed to be her fate it was vain to attempt anything for anyones good while all her warm feelings and high aspirations were thwarted by the awkward ungainly hands and heedless eyes that nature had given her nor did the following day saturday do much for her comfort by giving her the company of her brothers that it was normans sixteenth birthday seemed only to make it worse their father had apparently forgotten it and norman stopped blanche when she was going to put him in mind of it stopped her by such a look as the child never forgot though there was no anger in it in reply to ethels inquiry what he was going to do that morning he gave a yawn and stretch and said dejectedly that he had got some euripides to look over and some verses to finish  i am sorry this is the first time you ever have not managed so as to make a real holiday of your saturday  i could not help it and theres nothing to do said norman wearily  i promised to go and read to margaret while flora does her music said ethel i shall come after that and do my latin and greek with you  margaret would not keep her long saying she liked her to be with norman but she found him with his head sunk on his open book fast asleep at dinnertime harry and tom rushing in awoke him with a violent start  halloo norman that was a jump said harry as his brother stretched and pinched himself youll jump out of your skin some of these days if you dont take care  its enough to startle any one to be waked up with such a noise said ethel  then he ought to sleep at proper times said harry and not be waking me up with tumbling about and hallooing out and talking in his sleep half the night  talking in his sleep why just now you said he did not sleep said ethel  harry knows nothing about it said norman  dont i well i only know if you slept in school and were a junior you would get a proper good licking for going on as you do at night  and i think you might chance to get a proper good licking for not holding your tongue said norman which hint reduced harry to silence  dr may was not come home he had gone with richard far into the country and was to return to tea he was thought to be desirous of avoiding the family dinners that used to be so delightful harry was impatient to depart and when mary and tom ran after him he ordered them back  where can he be going said mary as she looked wistfully after him  i know said tom  where do tell me  only dont tell papa i went down with him to the playground this morning and there they settled it the andersons and axworthy and he are going to hire a gun and shoot peewits on cocksmoor  but they ought not should they said mary papa would be very angry  anderson said there was no harm in it but harry told me not to tell indeed anderson would have boxed my ears for hearing when i could not help it  but harry would not let him  ay harry is quite a match for harvey anderson though he is so much younger and he said he would not have me bullied  thats a good harry but i wish he would not go out shooting said mary  mind you dont tell  and wheres hector ernescliffe would not he go  no i like hector he did not choose to go though anderson teased him and said he was a poor scot and his brother didnt allow him tin enough to buy powder and shot if harry would have stayed at home he would have come up here and we might have had some fun in the garden  i wish he would we never have any fun now said mary but oh there he is as she spied hector peeping over the gate which led from the field into the garden it was the first time that he had been to dr mays since his brothers departure and he was rather shy but the joyful welcome of mary and tom took off all reluctance and they claimed him for a good game at play in the woodhouse mary ran upstairs to beg to be excused the formal walk and luckily for her miss winter was in margarets room margaret asked if it was very wet and dirty and hearing not very gave gracious permission and off went mary and blanche to construct some curious specimens of pottery under the superintendence of hector and tom there was a certain ditch where yellow mud was attainable whereof the happy children concocted marbles and vases which underwent a preparatory baking in the boys pockets that they might not crack in the nursery fire margaret only stipulated that her sisters should be well fenced in brown holland and when miss winter looked grave said poor things a little thorough play will do them a great deal of good  miss winter could not see the good of groping in the dirt and margaret perceived that it would be one of her difficulties to know how to follow out her mothers views for the children without vexing the good governess by not deferring to her  in the meantime norman had disconsolately returned to his euripides and ethel who wanted to stay with him and look out his words was ordered out by miss winter because she had spent all yesterday indoors miss winter was going to stay with margaret and ethel and flora coaxed norman to come with them just one mile on the turnpike road and back again he would be much fresher for his greek afterwards  he came but he did not enliven his sisters the three plodded on taking a diligent constitutional walk exchanging very few words and those chiefly between the girls flora gathered some hoary clematis and red berries and sought in the hedgesides for some crimson fairy baths to carry home and at the sight of the amusement margaret derived from the placing the beauteous little pezizas in a saucer of damp green moss so as to hide the brown sticks on which they grew ethel took shame to herself for want of perception of little attentions when she told norman so he answered theres no one who does see what is the right thing how horrid the room looks everything is nohow added he looking round at the ornaments and things on the tables which had lost their air of comfort and good taste it was not disorder and ethel could not see what he meant whats wrong said she  oh never mindyou cant do it dont tryyoull only make it worse it will never be the same as long as we live  i wish you would not be so unhappy said ethel  never mind again said norman but he put his arm round her  have you done your euripides can i help you will you construe it with me or shall i look out your words  thank you i dont mind that it is the verses i want some sense said norman running his fingers through his hair till it stood on end tis such a horrid subject coral islands as if there was anything to be said about them  dear me norman i could say ten thousand things only i must not tell you what mine are as yours are not done  no dont said norman decidedly  did you read the description of them in the quarterly i am sure you might get some ideas there shall i find it for you it is in an old number  well do thank you  he rested listlessly on the sofa while his sister rummaged in a chiffonier at last she found the article and eagerly read him the description of the strange forms of the coral animals and the beauties of their flowerlike feelers and branching fabrics it would once have delighted him but his first comment was nasty little brutes however the next minute he thanked her took the book and said he could hammer something out of it though it was too bad to give such an unclassical subject at dusk he left off saying he should get it done at night his senses would come then and he should be glad to sit up  only three weeks to the holidays said ethel trying to be cheerful but his assent was depressing and she began to fear that christmas would only make them more sad  mary did not keep toms secret so inviolably but that while they were dressing for tea she revealed to ethel where harry was gone he was not yet returned though his father and richard were come in and the sisters were at once in some anxiety on his account and doubt whether they ought to let papa know of his disobedience  flora and ethel who were the first in the drawingroom had a consultation  i should have told mamma directly said flora  he never did so sighed ethel things never went wrong then  oh yes they did dont you remember how naughty harry was about climbing the wall and making faces at mrs richardsons servants  and how ill i behaved the first day of last christmas holidays  she knew but i dont think she told papa  not that we knew of but i believe she did tell him everything and i think flora he ought to know everything especially now i never could bear the way the mackenzies used to have of thinking their parents must be like enemies and keeping secrets from them  they were always threatening each other ill tell mamma said flora and calling us telltales because we told our own dear mamma everything but it is not like that nowi neither like to worry papa nor to bring harry into disgracebesides tom and mary meant it for a secret  papa would not be angry with him if we told him it was a secret said ethel i wish harry would come in theres the dooroh it is only you  whom did you expect said richard entering  the sisters looked at each other and ethel after an interval explained their doubts about harry  he is come in said richard i saw him running up to his own room very muddy  oh im glad but do you think papa ought to hear it i dont know whats to be done tis the childrens secret said flora  it will never do to have him going out with those boys continually said ethelharvey anderson close by all the holidays  ill try what i can do with him said richard papa had better not hear it now at any rate he is very tired and sad this evening and his arm is painful again so we must not worry him with histories of naughtiness among the children  no said ethel decidedly i am glad you were there ritchie i never should have thought of one time being better than another  just like ethel said flora smiling  why should not you learn said richard gently  i cant said ethel in a desponding way  why not you are much sharper than most people and if you tried you would know those things much better than i do as you know how to learn history  it is quite a different sort of cleverness said flora recollect sir isaac newton or archimedes  then you must have both sorts said ethel for you can do things nicely and yet you learn very fast  take care ethel you are singeing your frock well i really dont think you can help those things said flora your short sight is the reason of it and it is of no use to try to mend it  dont tell her so said richard it cant be all short sightit is the not thinking i do believe that if ethel would think no one would do things so well dont you remember the beautiful perspective drawing she made of this room for me to take to oxford that was very difficult and wanted a great deal of neatness and accuracy so why should she not be neat and accurate in other things and i know you can read faces ethelwhy dont you look there before you speak  ah before instead of after when i only see i have said something malapropos said ethel  i must go and see about the children said flora if the tea comes while i am gone will you make it ritchie  flora despairs of me said ethel  i dont said richard have you forgotten how to put in a pin yet  no i hope not  well then see if you cant learn to make tea and bythebye ethel which is the next christening sunday  the one after next surely the first of december is mondayyes tomorrow week is the next  then i have thought of something it would cost eighteenpence to hire joliffes springcart and we might have mrs taylor and the twins brought to church in it should you like to walk to cocksmoor and settle it  oh yes very much indeed what a capital thought margaret said you would know how to manage  then we will go the first fine day papa does not want me  i wonder if i could finish my purple frocks but heres the tea now richard dont tell me to make it i should do something wrong and flora will never forgive you  richard would not let her off he stood over her counted her shovelfuls of tea and watched the water into the teapothe superintended her warming the cups and putting a drop into each saucer ah said ethel with a concluding sigh it makes one hotter than double equations  it was all right as flora allowed with a slightly superior smile she thought richard would never succeed in making a notable or elegant woman of ethel and it was best that the two sisters should take different lines flora knew that though clever and with more accomplishments she could not surpass ethel in intellectual attainments but she was certainly far more valuable in the house and had been proved to have just the qualities in which her sister was most deficient she did not relish hearing that ethel wanted nothing but attention to be more than her equal and she thought richard mistaken floras remembrance of their time of distress was less unmixedly wretched than it was with the others for she knew she had done wonders  the next day norman told ethel that he had got on very well with the verses and finished them off late at night he showed them to her before taking them to school on monday morning and ethel thought they were the best he had ever written there was too much spirit and poetical beauty for a mere schoolboy task and she begged for the foul copy to show it to her father i have not got it said norman the foul copy was not like these but when i was writing them out quite late it was all i dont know how floras music was in my ears and the room seemed to get larger and like an ocean cave and when the candle flickered twas like the green glowing light of the sun through the waves  as it says here said ethel  and the words all came to me of themselves in beautiful flowing latin just right as if it was anybody but myself doing it and they ran off my pen in red and blue and gold and all sorts of colours and fine branching zigzagging stars like what the book described only stranger came dancing and radiating round my pen and the candle i could hardly believe the verses would scan by daylight but i cant find a mistake do you try them again  ethel scanned i see nothing wrong she said but it seems a shame to begin scanning undines verses they are too pretty i wish i could copy them it must have been half a dream  i believe it was they dont seem like my own  did you dream afterwards  he shivered they had got into my head too much my ears sang like the roaring of the sea and i thought my feet were frozen on to an iceberg then came darkness and sea monsters and drowningit was too horrid and his face expressed all and more than all he said but tis a quarter to sevenwe must go said he with a long yawn and rubbing his eyes you are sure they are right ethel harry come along  ethel thought those verses ought to make a sensation but all that came of them was a quam optime and when she asked norman if no special notice had been taken of them he said in his languid way no only dr hoxton said they were better than usual  ethel did not even have the satisfaction of hearing that mr wilmot happening to meet dr may said to him your boy has more of a poet in him than any that has come in my way he really sometimes makes very striking verses  richard watched for an opportunity of speaking to harry which did not at once occur as the boy spent very little of his time at home and as if by tacit consent he and norman came in later every evening at last on thursday in the additional two hours leisure allowed to the boys when the studious prepared their tasks and the idle had some special diversion richard encountered him running up to his own room to fetch a newlyinvented instrument for projecting stones  ill walk back to school with you said richard i mean to run returned harry  is there so much hurry said richard i am sorry for it for i wanted to speak to you harry i have something to show you  his manner conveyed that it related to their mother and the sobering effect was instantaneous very well said he forgetting his haste ill come into your room  the awestruck shy yet sorrowful look on his rosy face showed preparation enough and richards only preface was to say it is a bit of a letter that she was in course of writing to aunt flora a description of us all the letter itself is gone but here is a copy of it i thought you would like to read what relates to yourself  richard laid before him the sheet of notepaper on which this portion of the letter was written and left him alone with it while he set out on the promised walk with ethel  they found the old woman granny hall looking like another creature smokedried and withered indeed but all briskness and animation  well be it you sir and the young lady  yes here we are come to see you again said richard i hope you are not disappointed that ive brought my sister this time instead of the doctor  no no sir ive done with the doctor for this while said the old woman to ethels great amusement he have done me a power of good and thank him for it heartily but the young lady is right welcome herebut tis a dirty walk for her  never mind that said ethel a little shyly i camewhere are your grandchildren  oh somewhere out among the blocks they gets out with the other children i cant be always after them  i wanted to know if these would fit them said ethel beginning to undo her basket  well pon my word if ever i see here stepping out to the door pollyjenny come in i say this moment come in ye bad girls or ill give you the stick ill break every bone of you that i will all which threats were bawled out in such a goodnatured triumphant voice and with such a delighted air that richard and ethel could not help laughing  after a few moments polly and jenny made their appearance extremely rough and ragged but compelled by their grandmother to duck down by way of courtesies and with finger in mouth they stood too shy to show their delight as the garments were unfolded granny talking so fast that ethel would never have brought in the stipulation that the frocks should be worn to school and church if richard in his mild but steady way had not brought the old woman to listen to it she was full of asseverations that they should go she took them to church sometimes herself when it was fine weather and they had clothes and they could say their catechiz as well as anybody already yes they should come that they should and next sunday ethel promised to be there to introduce them to the chief lady the president of the committee mrs ledwich and with a profusion of thanks they took leave  they found john taylor just come out of the hospital looking weak and ill as he smoked his pipe over the fire his wife bustling about at a great rate and one of the infants crying it seemed to be a great relief that they were not come to complain of lucy and there were many looks of surprise on hearing what their business really was mrs taylor thanked them and appeared not to know whether she was glad or sorry and her husband pipe in hand gazed at the young gentleman as if he did not comprehend the species since he could not be old enough to be a clergyman  richard hoped they would find sponsors by that time and there mrs taylor gave little hope it was a bad lotthere was no one she liked to ask to stand she said in a dismal voice but there her husband put in ill find some one if thats all my missus always thinks nobody cant do nothing  to be sure said the lamentable mrs taylor all the elder ones was took to church and im loath the little ones shouldnt but you see sir we are poor people and its a long way and they was set down in the gentlemans register book  but you know that is not the same mrs taylor surely lucy could have told you that when she went to school  no sir tis not the samei knows that but this is a bad place to live in  always the old song missus exclaimed her husband thank you kindly siryou have been a good friend to us and so was dr may when i was up to the hospital through the thick of his own troubles i believe you are in the right of it sir and thank you the children shall be ready and little jack too and ill find gossips and let em christened on sunday  i believe you will be glad of it said richard and he went on to speak of the elder children coming to school on sunday thus causing another whining from the wife about distance and bad weather and no one else going that way he said the little halls were coming but mrs taylor begun saying she disliked their company for the childrengranny let them get about so much and they said bad words the father again interfered perhaps mr wilmot who acted as chaplain at the hospital had been talking to him for he declared at once that they should come and richard suggested that he might see them home when he came from church then turning to the boy and girl told them they would meet their sister lucy and asked them if they would not like that  on the whole the beginning was not inauspicious though there might be a doubt whether old mrs hall would keep all her promises ethel was so much diverted and pleased as to be convinced she would richard was a little doubtful as to her power over the wild girls there could not be any doubt that john taylor was in earnest and had been worked upon just at the right moment but there was danger that the impression would not last and his wife in such a horrible whining dawdle said ethelthere will be no good to be done if it depends on her  richard made no answer and ethel presently felt remorseful for her harsh speech about a poor ignorant woman overwhelmed with poverty children and weak health  i have been thinking a great deal about what you said last time we took this walk said richard after a considerable interval  oh have you cried ethel eagerly and the black peaty pond she was looking at seemed to sparkle with sunlight  do you really mean it said richard deliberately  yes to be sure she said with some indignation  because i think i see a way to make a beginning but you must make up your mind to a great deal of trouble and dirty walks and you must really learn not to draggle your frock  well well but tell me  this is what i was thinking i dont think i can go back to oxford after christmas it is not fit to leave you while papa is so disabled  oh no he could not get on at all i heard him tell mr wilmot the other day that you were his right hand  ethel was glad she had repeated this for there was a deepening colour and smiling glow of pleasure on her brothers face such as she had seldom seen on his delicate but somewhat impassive features  he is very kind he said warmly no i am sure i cannot be spared till he is better able to use his arm and i dont see any chance of that just yet then if i stay at home friday is always at my own disposal while papa is at the hospital meeting  yes yes and we could go to cocksmoor and set up a school how delightful  i dont think you would find it quite so delightful as you fancy said richard the children will be very wild and ignorant and you dont like that at the national school  oh but they are in such need besides there will be no mrs ledwich over me it is just righti shant mind anything you are a capital ritchie for having thought of it  i dont thinkif i am ever to be what i wish that is if i can get through at oxfordi dont think it can be wrong to begin this if mr ramsden does not object  oh mr ramsden never objects to anything  and if mr wilmot will come and set us off you know we cannot begin without that or without my fathers fully liking it  oh there can be no doubt of that  this one thing ethel i must stipulate dont you go and tell it all out at once to him i cannot have him worried about our concerns  but howno one can question that this is right i am sure he wont object  stop ethel dont you see it cant be done for nothing if we undertake it we must go on with it and when i am away it will fall on you and flora well then it ought to be considered whether you are old enough and steady enough and if it can be managed for you to go continually all this way in this wild place there will be expense too  ethel looked wild with impatience but could not gainsay these scruples otherwise than by declaring they ought not to weigh against the good of cocksmoor  it will worry him to have to consider all this said richard and it must not be pressed upon him  no said ethel sorrowfully but you dont mean to give it up  you are always in extremes ethel all i want is to find a good time for proposing it  she fidgeted and gave a long sigh  mind said richard stopping short ill have nothing to do with it except on condition you are patient and hold your tongue about it  i think i can if i may talk to margaret  oh yes to margaret of course we could not settle anything without her help  and i know what she will say said ethel oh i am so glad and she jumped over three puddles in succession  and ethel you must learn to keep your frock out of the dirt  ill do anything if youll help me at cocksmoor     chapter ix         for the structure that we raise        time is with materials filled      our todays and yesterdays        are the blocks which we build       truly shape and fashion these        leave no yawning gaps between      think not because no man sees        such things will remain unseenlongfellow   when ethel came home burning with the tidings of the newlyexcited hopes for cocksmoor they were at once stopped by margaret eagerly saying is richard come in pray call him then on his entrance oh richard would you be so kind as to take this to the bank i dont like to send it by any one elseit is so much and she took from under her pillows a velvet bag so heavy that it weighed down her slender white hand  what he has given you the care of his money said ethel  yes i saw him turning something out of his waistcoatpocket into the drawer of the lookingglass and sighing in that very sad way he said his fees had come to such an accumulation that he must see about sending them to the bank and then he told me of the delight of throwing his first fee into dear mammas lap when they were just married and his old uncle had given up to him and how he had brought them to her ever since he said she had spoiled him by taking all trouble off his hands he looked at it as if it was so sorrowful to him to have to dispose of it that i begged him not to plague himself any more but let me see about it as dear mamma used to do so he said i was spoiling him too but he brought me the drawer and emptied it out here when he was gone i packed it up and i have been waiting to ask richard to take it all to the bank out of his sight  you counted it said richard  yestheres fiftyi kept seventeen towards the weeks expenses just see that it is right said margaret showing her neat packets  oh ritchie said ethel what can expense signify when all that has been kicking about loose in an open drawer what would not one of those rolls do  i think i had better take them out of your way said richard quietly am i to bring back the book to you margaret  yes do said margaret pray do not tease him with it and as her brother left the room she continued i wish he was better i think he is more oppressed now than even at first the pain of his arm going on so long seems to me to have pulled him down it does not let him sleep and by the end of the day he gets worn and fagged by seeing so many people and exerting himself to talk and think and often when there is something that must be asked i dont know how to begin for it seems as if a little more would be too much for him  yes richard is right said ethel mournfully it will not do to press him about our concerns but do you think him worse today  he did not sleep last night and he is always worse when he does not drive out into the country the fresh air and being alone with richard are a rest for him today is especially trying he does not think poor old mr southern will get through the evening and he is so sorry for the daughter  is he there now  yes he thought of something that might be an alleviation and he would go though he was tired i am afraid the poor daughter will detain him and he is not fit to go through such things now  no i hope he will soon come perhaps richard will meet him but oh margaret what do you think richard and i have been talking of and without perception of fit times and seasons ethel would have told her story but margaret too anxious to attend to her said hark was not that his step and dr may came in looking mournful and fatigued  well said he i was just too late he died as i got there and i could not leave the daughter till old mrs bowers came  poor thing said margaret he was a good old man  yes said dr may sitting wearily down and speaking in a wornout voice one cant lightly part with a man one has seen at church every sunday of ones life and exchanged so many friendly words with over his counter tis a strong bond of neighbourliness in a small place like this and as one grows old changes come heavierthe clouds return again after the rain thank you my dear as ethel fetched his slippers and placed a stool for his feet feeling somewhat ashamed of thinking it an achievement to have unbidden performed a small act of attention which would have come naturally from any of the others  papa you will give me the treat of drinking tea with me said margaret who saw the quiet of her room would suit him better than the bustle of the children downstairs thank you as he gave a smile of assent  that margaret could not be made to listen this evening was plain and all that ethel could do was to search for some books on schools in seeking for them she displayed such confusion in the chiffonier that flora exclaimed oh ethel how could you leave it so  i was in a hurry looking for something for norman ill set it to rights said ethel gulping down her dislike of being reproved by flora with the thought that mamma would have said the same  my dear cried flora presently jumping up what are you doing piling up those heavy books on the top of the little ones how do you think they will ever stand let me do it  no no flora and richard in a low voice gave ethel some advice which she received seated on the floor in a mood between temper and despair  he is going to teach her to do it on the principles of gravitation said flora  richard did not do it himself but by his means ethel without being in the least irritated gave the chiffonier a thorough dusting and settingtorights sorting magazines burning old catalogues and finding her own longlost undine at which she was so delighted that she would have forgotten all in proceeding to read it curled up on the floor amongst the heaps of pamphlets if another gentle hint from richard had not made her finish her task so well as to make flora declare it was a pleasure to look in and harry pronounce it to be all neat and shipshape  there was no speaking to margaret the next morningit was french dayand ethel had made strong resolutions to behave better and whether there were fewer idioms or that she was trying to understand instead of carping at the masters explanations they came to no battle flora led the conversation and she sustained her part with credit and gained an excellent mark  flora said afterwards to margaret i managed nicely for her i would not let m ballompre blunder upon any of the subjects ethel feels too deeply to talk of in good french and really ethel has a great talent for languages how fast she gets on with italian  that she does said margaret suppose you send her up florayou must want to go and draw or practice and she may do her arithmetic here or read to me  it was the second time margaret had made this proposal and it did not please flora who had learned to think herself necessary to her sister and liked to be the one to do everything for her she was within six weeks of seventeen and surely she need not be sent down again to the schoolroom when she had been so good a manager of the whole family she was fond of study and of accomplishments but she thought she might be emancipated from miss winter and it was not pleasant to her that a sister only eighteen months older and almost dependant on her should have authority to dispose of her time  i practise in the evening she said and i could draw here if i wished but i have some music to copy  margaret was concerned at the dissatisfaction though not understanding the whole of it you know dear flora she said i need not take up all your time now  dont regret that said flora i like nothing so well as waiting on you and i can attend to my own affairs very well here  ill tell you why i proposed it said margaret i think it would be a relief for ethel to escape from miss winters beloved friday questions  great nonsense they are said flora why dont you tell miss winter they are of no use  mamma never interfered with them said margaret she only kept ethel in her own hands and if you would be so kind as to change sometimes and sit in the schoolroom we could spare ethel without hurting miss winters feelings  well ill call ethel if you like but i shall go and practise in the drawingroom the old schoolroom piano is fit for nothing but mary to hammer upon  flora went away evidently annoyed and margarets conjectures on the cause of it were cut short by ethel running in with a slate in one hand and two books in the other the rest having all tumbled down on the stairs  oh margaret i am so glad to come to you miss winter has set mary to read to be or not to be and it would have driven me distracted to have stayed there i have got a most beautiful sum in compound proportion about a lion a wolf and a bear eating up a carcase and as soon as they have done it you shall hear me say my ancient geography and then we will do a nice bit of tasso and if we have any time after that i have got such a thing to tell youonly i must not tell you now or i shall go on talking and not finish my lessons  it was not till all were done that ethel felt free to exclaim now for what i have been longing to tell yourichard is going to but the fates were unpropitious aubrey trotted in expecting to be amused next came norman and ethel gave up in despair and after having affronted flora in the morning margaret was afraid of renewing the offence by attempting to secure ethel as her companion for the afternoon so not till after the walk could margaret contrive to claim the promised communication telling ethel to come and settle herself cosily by her  i should have been very glad of you last evening said she for papa went to sleep and my book was out of reach  oh i am sorry how i pity you poor margaret  i suppose i have grown lazy said margaret for i dont mind those things now i am never sorry for a quiet time to recollect and consider  it must be like the waiting in the dark between the slides of a magic lantern said ethel i never like to be quiet i get so unhappy  i am glad of resting and recollecting said margaret it has all been so like a dream that merry morning and then slowly waking to find myself here in dear mammas place and papa watching over me sometimes i think i have not half understood what it really is and that i dont realise that if i was up and about i should find the house without her  yes that is the aching part said ethel i am happy sitting on her bed here with you you are a little of her besides being my own dear pegtop you are very lucky to miss the mealtimes and the evenings  that is the reason i dont feel it wrong to like to have papa sitting with me all the evening said margaret though it may make it worse for you to have him away i dont think it selfish in me to keep him he wants quiet so much or to talk a little when it suits him we are too many now when he is tired  oh it is best said ethel nothing that you do is selfishdont talk of it dear margaret it will be something like old times when you come down again  but all this time you are not telling me what i want so much to hear said margaret about cocksmoor i am so glad richard has taken it up  that he has we are to go every friday and hire a room and teach the children once a week will do a great deal if we can but make them wish to learn it is a much better plan than mine for if they care about it they can come to school here on sunday  it is excellent said margaret and if he is at home till easter it will give it a start and put you in the way of it and get you through the short days and dark evenings when you could not so well walk home without him  yes and then we can all teach flora and mary and you when you are well again richard says it will be disagreeable but i dont think sothey are such unsophisticated people that granny hall is such a funny old woman and the whole place wants nothing but a little care to do very well  you must prepare for disappointments dear ethel  i know i know nothing is done without drawbacks but i am so glad to make some beginning  so am i do you know mamma and i were one day talking over those kind of things and she said she had always regretted that she had so many duties at home that she could not attend as much to the poor as she would like but she hoped now we girls were growing up we should be able to do more  did she was all ethel said but she was deeply gratified  ive been wanting to tell you i knew you would like to hear it it seems to set us to work so happily  i only wish we could begin said ethel but richard is so slow of course we cant act without papas consent and mr wilmots help and he says papa must not be worried about it he must watch for his own time to speak about it  yes said margaret  i knowi would not have it otherwise but what is tiresome is this richard is very good but he is so dreadfully hard to stir up and whats worse so very much afraid of papa that while he is thinking about opportunities they will all go by and then it will be easter and nothing done  he is not so much afraid of papa as he was said margaret he has felt himself useful and a comfort and papa is gentler and that has cheered him out of the desponding way that kept him back from proposing anything  perhaps said ethel but i wish it was you cant you you always know how to manage  no it is richards affair and he must do as he thinks fit dont sigh dear ethelperhaps he may soon speak and if not you can be preparing in a quiet way all the time dont you remember how dear mamma used to tell us that things hastily begun never turn out well  but this is not hasty ive been thinking about it these six weeks said ethel if one does nothing but think it is all no better than a vision i want to be doing  well you can be doinglaying a sound foundation said margaret the more you consider and the wiser you make yourself the better it will be when you do set to work  you mean by curing myself of my slovenly ways and impatient temper  i dont know that i was exactly thinking of that said margaret but that ought to be the way if we are not just the thing in our niche at home i dont think we can do much real good elsewhere  it would be hollow showgoodness said ethel yes that is true and it comes across me now and then what a horrid wretch i am to be wanting to undertake so much when i leave so much undone but do you know margaret theres no one such a help in those ways as richard though he is so precise he is never tiresome he makes me see things and do them neatly without plaguing me and putting me in a rage im not ready to bite off my own fingers or kick all the rattletraps over and leave them as i am when miss winter scolds me or nurse or even flora sometimes but it is as if i was gratifying him and his funny little old bachelor tidyisms divert me besides he teaches me the theory and never lays hold of my poor fingers and when they wont bend the wrong way calls them frogs  he is a capital master for you said margaret much amused and pleased for richard was her especial darling and she triumphed in any eulogy from those who ordinarily were too apt to regard his dullness with superior compassion  if he would only read our books and enter into poetry and delight in it but it is all nonsense to him said ethel i cant think how people can be so different but oh here he comes ritchie you should not come upon us before we are aware  what i should have heard no good of myself  great good said margaretshe was telling me you would make a neathanded woman of her in time  i dont see why she should not be as neat as other people said richard gravely has she been telling you our plan  and it was again happily discussed ethel satisfied by finding him fully set upon the design and margaret giving cordial sympathy and counsel when ethel was called away margaret said i am so glad you have taken it up not only for the sake of cocksmoor but of ethel it is good for her not to spend her high soul in dreams  i am afraid she does not know what she undertakes said richard  she does not but you will keep her from being turned back it is just the thing to prevent her energies from running to waste and her being so much with you and working under you is exactly what one would have chosen  by contraries said richard smiling that is what i was afraid of i dont half understand or follow her and when i think a thing nonsense i see you all calling it very fine and i dont know what to make of it  you are making yourself out more dull than you are said margaret affectionately  i know i am stupid and seem tame and cold said richard and you are the only one that does not care about it that is what makes me wish norman was the eldest if i were as clever as he i could do so much with ethel and be so much more to papa  no you would not you would have other things in your head you would not be the dear dear old ritchie that you are you would not be a calm cautious steady balance to the quicksilver heads some of us have got no no normans a very fine fellow a very dear fellow but he would not do half so well for our eldesthe is too easily up and down again  and i am getting into my old way of repining said richard i dont mind so much since my father has at least one son to be proud of and i can be of some use to him now  of the greatest and to all of us i am so glad you can stay after christmas and papa was pleased at your offering and said he could not spare you at all though he would have tried if it had been any real advantage to you  well i hope he will approve i must speak to him as soon as i can find him with his mind tolerably disengaged  the scene that ensued that evening in the magic lantern before margarets bed did not promise much for the freedom of her fathers mind harry entered with a resolute manner margaret i wanted to speak to you said he spreading himself out with an elbow on each arm of the chair i want you to speak to papa about my going to sea it is high time to see about iti shall be thirteen on the fourth of may  and you mean it seriously harry  yes of course i do really and truly and if it is to come to pass it is time to take measures dont you see margaret  it is time as you say answered margaret reflectingly and sadly surveying the bright boy rosy cheeked round faced and blue eyed with the childish gladsomeness of countenance that made it strange that his lot in life should be already in the balance  i know what you will all tell me that it is a hard life but i must get my own living some way or other and i should like that way the best said he earnestly  should you like to be always far from home  i should come home sometimes and bring such presents to mary and baby and all of you and i dont know what else to be margaret i should hate to be a doctori cant abide sick people and i couldnt write sermons so i cant be a clergyman and i wont be a lawyer i vow for harvey anderson is to be a lawyerso theres nothing left but soldiers and sailors and i mean to be a sailor  well harry you may do your duty and try to do right if you are a sailor and that is the point  ay i was sure you would not set your face against it now you know alan ernescliffe  if you were to be like him margaret found herself blushing and broke off  then you will ask papa about it  you had better do so yourself boys had better settle such serious affairs with their fathers without setting their sisters to interfere whats the matter harryyou are not afraid to speak to papa  only for one thing said harry margaret i went out to shoot peewits last saturday with two fellows and i cant speak to papa while thats on my mind  then you had better tell him at once  i knew you would say so but it would be like a girl and it would be telling of the two fellows  not at all papa would not care about them  you see said harry twisting a little i knew i ought not but they said i was afraid of a gun and that i had no money now i see that was chaff but i didnt then and norman wasnt there  i am so glad you have told me all this harry dear for i knew you had been less at home of late and i was almost afraid you were not going on quite well  thats what it is said harry i cant stand things at all and i cant go moping about as norman does i cant live without fun and now norman isnt here half the time it turns to something i am sorry for afterwards  but harry if you let yourself be drawn into mischief here for want of norman what would you do at sea  i should be an officer  i am afraid said margaret smiling that would not make much difference inside though it might outside you must get the selfcontrol and leave off being afraid to be said to be afraid  harry fidgeted i should start fresh and be out of the way of the andersons he said that anderson junior is a horrid fellowhe spites norman and he bullied me till i was big enough to show him that it would not doand though i am so much younger he is afraid of me he makes up to me and tries to get me into all the mischief that is going  and you know that and let him lead you oh harry  i dont let him lead me said harry indignantly but i wont have them say i cant do things  margaret laughed and harry presently perceived what she meant but instead of answering he began to boast there never was a may in disgrace yet and there never shall be  that is a thing to be very thankful for said margaret but you know there may be much harm without public disgrace i never heard of one of the andersons being in disgrace yet  noshabby fellows that just manage to keep fair with old hoxton and make a show said harry they look at translations and copy old stock verses oh it was such fun the other day what do you think norman must have been dreaming for he had taken to school by mistake richards old gradus that ethel uses and there were ever so many rough copies of hers sticking in it  poor ethel what consternation she would be in i hope no one found it out  why anderson junior was gaping about in despair for sense for his verseshe comes on that and slyly copies a whole set of her old ones done when shenorman i meanwas in the fifth form his subject was a river and hers babylon but altering a line or two it did just as well he never guessed i saw him and thought he had done it famously he showed them up and would have got some noted good mark but that by great good luck ethel had made two of her pentameters too short which he hadnt the wit to find out thinking all norman did must be right so he has shown up a girls versesisnt that rare cried harry dancing on his chair with triumph  i hope no one knows they were hers  bless you no said harry who regarded ethels attainments as something contraband dye think i could tell no thats the only pity that he cant hear it but after all i dont care for anything he does now i know he has shown up a girls verses  are these verses of poor ethels safe at home  yes i took care of that mind you dont tell anyone margaret i never told even norman  but all your schoolfellows arent like these you have hector ernescliffe  hes a nice fellow enough but he is little and down in the school twould be making a fourth form of myself to be after him the fact is margaret they are a low ungentlemanly lot just now about sixth and upper fifth form said harry lowering his voice into an anxious confidential tone and since norman has been less amongst them theyve got worse and you see now home is different and he isnt like what he was im thrown on them and i want to get out of it i didnt know that was it before but richard showed me what set me on thinking of it and i see she knew all about it  that she did there is a great deal in what you say harry but you know she thought nothing would be of real use but changing within if you dont get a root of strength in yourself your ship will be no better to you than schoolthere will be idle midshipmen as well as idle schoolboys  yes i know said harry but do you think papa will consent she would not have minded  i cant tell i should think he would but if any scheme is to come to good it must begin by your telling him of the going out shooting  harry sighed id have done it long ago if she was here he said i never did anything so bad before without telling and i dont like it at all it seems to come between him and me when i wish him goodnight  then harry pray do tell him youll have no comfort if you dont  i know i shant but then hell be so angry and do you know margaret twas worse than i told you for a covey of partridges got up and unluckily i had got the gun and i fired and killed one and that was regular poaching you know and when we heard some one coming how we did cut axthe other fellow i mean got it and cooked it in his bedroom and ate it for supper and he laughs about it but i have felt so horrid all the week suppose a keeper had got a summons  i can only say again the only peace will be in telling  yes but he will be so angry when that lot of fellows a year or two ago did something like it and shot some of the abbotstoke rabbits dont you remember how much he said about its being disgraceful and ordering us never to have anything to do with their gunnery and he will think it so very bad to have gone out on a lark just now oh i wish i hadnt done it  so do i indeed harry but i am sure even it he should be angry at first he will be pleased with your confessing  harry looked very reluctant and disconsolate and his sister did not wonder for dr mays way of hearing of a fault was never to be calculated on come harry said she if he is ever so angry though i dont think he will be do you think that will be half as bad as this load at your heart besides if you are not bold enough to speak to him do you think you can ever be brave enough for a sailor  i will said harry and the words were hardly spoken before his fathers hand was on the door he was taken by surprise at the moment of trial coming so speedily and had half a mind to retreat by the other door he was stayed by the reflection that margaret would think him a coward unfit for a sailor and he made up his mind to endure whatever might betide  harry here this is company i did not expect  harry has something to say to you papa  eh my boy what is it said he kindly  papa i have killed a partridge two fellows got me to hire a gun and go out shooting with them last saturday said harry speaking firmly and boldly now he had once begun we meant only to go after peewits but a partridge got up and i killed it  then came a pause harry stopped and dr may waited half expecting to hear that the boy was only brought to confession by finding himself in a scrape margaret spoke and he could not be happy till he had told you  is it so is that the whole said the doctor looking at his son with a keen glance between affection and inquiry as if only waiting to be sure the confession was free before he gave his free forgiveness  yes papa said harry his voice and lip losing their firmness as the sweetness of expression gained the day on his fathers face only that i knowtwas very wrongespecially nowand i am very sorryand i beg your pardon  the latter words came between sighs fast becoming sobs in spite of harrys attempts to control them as his father held out his arm and drew him close to him  thats mammas own brave boy he said in his earin a voice which strong feeling had reduced to such a whisper that even margaret could not hearshe only saw how harry sobbing aloud clung tighter and tighter to him till he said take care of my arm and harry sprang back at least a yard with such a look of dismay that the doctor laughed no harm done said he i was only a little in dread of such a young lion comeback harry and he took his hand it was a bad piece of work and it will never do for you to let yourself be drawn into every bit of mischief that is on foot i believe i ought to give you a good lecture on it but i cant do it after such a straightforward confession you must have gone through enough in the last week not to be likely to do it again  yes papathank you  i suppose i must not ask you any questions about it for fear of betraying the fellows said dr may half smiling  thank you papa said harry infinitely relieved and grateful and quite content for some space to lean in silence against the chair with that encircling arm round him while some talk passed between his father and margaret  what a world of thought passed through the boys young soul in that space first there was a thrill of intense burning love to his father scarcely less fondness to his sweet motherly sister a clinging feeling to every chair and table of that room which seemed still full of his mothers presence a numbering over of all the others with ardent attachment and a flinging from him with horror the notion of asking to be far away from that dearest father that loving home that arm that was round him anything rather than be without them in the dreary world but then came the remembrance of cherished visions the shame of relinquishing a settled purpose the thought of weary morrows with the tempters among his playmates and his home blank and melancholy and the roaming spirit of enterprise stirred again and reproached him with being a baby for fancying he could stay at home for ever he would come back again with such honours as allan ernescliffe had brought and oh if his father so prized them in a stranger what would it be in his own son come home to such a greeting as would make up for the parting harrys heart throbbed again for the boundless sea the tall ship and the wondrous foreign climes where he had so often lived in fancy should he could he speak was this the moment and he stood gazing at the fire oppressed with the weighty reality of deciding his destiny at last dr may looked in his face well what now boy you have your head full of somethingwhats coming next  out it came papa will you let me be a sailor  oh said dr may that is come on again is it i thought that you had forgotten all that  no papa said harry with the manly coolness that the sense of his determination gave himit was not a mere fancy and i have never had it out of my head i mean it quite in earnesti had rather be a sailor i dont wish to get away from latin and greek i dont mind them but i think i could be a better sailor than anything i know it is not all play but i am willing to rough it and i am getting so old it is time to see about it so will you consent to it papa  well theres some sense in your way of putting it said dr may you have it strong in your head then and you know tis not all fairweather work  that i do alan told me histories and ive read all about it but one must rough it anywhere and if i am ever so far away ill try not to forget whats right ill do my duty and not care for danger  well said my man but remember tis easier talking by ones own fireside than doing when the trial comes  and will you let me papa  ill think about it i cant make up my mind as quick as directly you know harry said his father smiling kindly but i wont treat it as a boys fancy for youve spoken in a manly way and deserve to be attended to now run down and tell the girls to put away their work for i shall come down in a minute to read prayers  harry went and his father sighed and mused thats a fine fellow so this is what comes of bringing sick sailors homeones own boys must be catching the infection little monkey he talks as wisely as if he were forty he is really set on it do you think margaret im afraid so  i think so said margaret i dont think he ever has it out of his mind  and when the roving spirit once lays hold of a lad he must have his wayhe is good for nothing else said dr may  i suppose a man may keep from evil in that profession as well as in any other said margaret  aha you are bit too are you said the doctor tis the husbandman and viper is it then his smile turned into a heavy sigh as he saw he had brought colour to margarets pale cheek but she answered calmly dear mamma did not think it would be a bad thing for him  i know said the doctor pausing but it never came to this with her  i wish he had chosen something else but and margaret thought it right to lay before her father some part of what he had said of the temptations of the school at stoneborough the doctor listened and considered at last he rose and said well ill set ritchie to write to ernescliffe and hear what he says what must be must be tis only asking me to give up the boy thats all and as he left the room his daughter again heard his sigh and halfuttered words oh maggie maggie     chapter x                                       a tale      would rouse adventurous courage in a boy      and make him long to be a mariner      that he might rove the mainsouthey   etheldred had the satisfaction of seeing the taylors at school on sunday but no halls made their appearance and on inquiry she was told please maam they said they would not come so ethel condemned granny hall as a horrid vile false hypocritical old creature it was no use having anything more to do with her  very well said richard then i need not speak to my father  ritchie now you know i meant no such thing  you know it is just what will happen continually  of course there will be failures but this is so abominable when they had those nice frocks and those two beautiful eighteenpenny shawls there are three shillings out of my pound thrown away  perhaps there was some reason to prevent them we will go and see  we shall only hear some more palavering i want to have no more to say to but here ethel caught herself up and began to perceive what a happiness it was that she had not the power of acting on her own impulses  the twins and their little brother of two years old were christened in the afternoon and flora invited the parents to drink tea in the kitchen and visit lucy while ethel and mary each carried a baby upstairs to exhibit to margaret  richard in the meantime had a conversation with john taylor and learned a good deal about the district and the number of the people at tea he began to rehearse his information and the doctor listened with interest which put ethel in happy agitation believing that the moment was come and richard seemed to be only waiting for the conclusion of a long tirade against those who ought to do something for the place when behold blanche was climbing on her fathers knee begging for one of his sunday stories  etheldred was cruelly disappointed and could not at first rejoice to see her father able again to occupy himself with his little girl the narration in his low tones roused her from her mood of vexation it was the story of david which he told in language scriptural and poetical so pretty and tender in its simplicity that she could not choose but attend ever and anon there was a glance towards harry as if he were secretly likening his own yellowhaired laddie to the shepherd boy ruddy and of a fair countenance  so tom and blanche he concluded can you tell me how we may be like the shepherdboy david  there arent giants now said tom  wrong is a giant said his little sister  right my white mayflower and what then  we are to fight said tom  yes and mind the giant with all his armour may be some great thing we have to do but what did david begin with when he was younger  the lion and the bear  ay and minding his sheep perhaps little things now you are little children may be like the lion and the bearso kill them offget rid of themcure yourself of whining or dawdling or whatever it be and mind your sheep well said he smiling sweetly in answer to the childrens earnest looks as they caught his meaning and if you do you will not find it near so hard to deal with your great giant struggle when it comes  ah thought ethel it suits me as well as the children i have a great giant on cocksmoor and here i am not allowed to attack him because perhaps i am not minding my sheep and letting my lion and my bear run loose about the house  she was less impatient this week partly from the sense of being on probation and partly because she in common with all the rest was much engrossed with harrys fate he came home every day at dinnertime with norman to ask if alan ernescliffes letter had come and at length mary and tom met them openmouthed with the news that margaret had it in her room  thither they hastened margaret held it out with a smile of congratulation here it is harry papa said you were to have it and consider it well and let him know when you had taken time you must do it soberly it is once for all  harrys impetuosity was checked and he took the letter quietly his sister put her hand on his shoulder would you mind my kissing you dear harry and as he threw his arms round her neck she whispered pray that you may choose right  he went quietly away and norman begged to know what had been alan ernescliffes advice  i can scarcely say he gave any direct advice said margaret he would not have thought that called for he said no doubt there were hardships and temptations more or less according to circumstances but weighing one thing with another he thought it gave as fair a chance of happiness as other professions and the discipline and regularity had been very good for himself as well as for many others he had known he said when a man is willing to go wrong there is much to help him but when he is resolved on doing right he need not be prevented  that is what you may say of anything said norman  just so and it answered papas question whether it was exposing harry to more temptation than he must meet with anywhere that was the reason it was such a comfort to have anyone to write to who understands it so well  yes and knows harrys nature  he said he had been fortunate in his captains and had led on the whole a happy life at sea and he thought if it was so with him harry was likely to enjoy it more being of a hardy adventurous nature and a sailor from choice not from circumstances  then he advised for it i did not think he would you know he will not let hector be a sailor  he told me he thought only a strong natural bent that way made it desirable and that he believed hector only wished it from imitation of him he said too long ago that he thought harry cut out for a sailor  a spirited fellow said norman with a look of saddened pride and approval not at all like one so near the same age he is up to anything afraid of nothing he can lick any boy in the school already it will be worse than ever without him  yes you will miss your constant follower he has been your shadow ever since he could walk but theres the clock i must not keep you any longer goodbye norman  harry gave his brother the letter as soon as they were outside the house and while he read it took his arm and guided him well said norman as he finished  it is all right said harry and the two brothers said no more there was something rising up in their throats at the thought that they had very few more walks to take together to bishop whichcotes school normans heart was very full at the prospect of another vacancy in his home and harrys was swelling between the ardour of enterprise and the thought of bidding goodbye to each familiar object and above all to the brother who had been his model and admiration from babyhood  june at length he broke out i wish you were going too i should not mind it half so much if you were  nonsense harry you want to be july after june all your life do you youll be much more of a man without me  that evening dr may called harry into his study to ask him if his mind was made up he put the subject fairly before him and told him not to be deterred from choosing what he thought would be for the best by any scruples about changing his mind we shall not think a bit the worse of you better now than too late  there was that in his face and tone that caused harry to say in a stifled voice i did not think you would care so much papa i wont go if you do  dr may put his hand on his shoulder and was silent harry felt a strange mixture of hope and fear joy and grief disappointment and relief you must not give it up on that account my dear he said at length i should not let you see this if it did not happen at a time when i cant command myself as i ought if you were an only son it might be your duty to stay being one of many tis nonsense to make a rout about parting with you if it is better for you it is better for all of us and we shall do very well when you are once fairly gone dont let that influence you for a moment  harry paused not that he doubted but he was collecting his energiesthen papa i choose the navy  then it is done harry you have chosen in a dutiful unselfish spirit and i trust it will prosper with you for i am sure your fathers blessingaye and your mothers too go with you now then after a pause go and call richard i want him to write to ernescliffe about that naval school you must take your leave of the whichcote foundation on friday i shall go and give dr hoxton notice tomorrow and get toms name down instead  and when the name of thomas may was set down dr hoxton expressed his trust that it would pass through the school as free from the slightest blemish as those of richard norman and harry may  now that harrys destiny was fixed ethel began to think of cocksmoor again and she accomplished another walk there with richard flora and mary to question granny hall about the childrens failure  the old womans reply was a tissue of contradictions the girls were idle hussies all contrary they plagued the very life out of her and she represented herself as using the most frightful threats if they would not go to school breaking every bone in their skin was the least injury she promised them till mary beginning to think her a cruel old woman took hold of her brothers coattails for protection  but i am afraid mrs hall said richard in that tone which might be either ironical or simple if you served them so they would never be able to get to school at all poor things  bless you sir dye think id ever lay a finger near them its only the way one must talk to children you see said she patronising his inexperience  perhaps they have found that out said richard granny looked much entertained and laughed triumphantly and shrewdly ay ay that they have the lassesthey be sharp enough for anything that they be why when i tell little jenny that theres the black man coming after her what does she do but she ups and says granny i know tis only the wind in the chimney  then i dont think it seems to answer said richard just suppose you were to try for once really punishing them when they wont obey you perhaps they would do it next time  why sir you see i dont like to take the stick to them theyve got no mother you see sir  mary thought her a kind grandmother and came out from behind her brother  i think it would be kinder to do it for once what do you think they will do as they grow older if you dont keep them in order when they are little  this was foresight beyond granny hall who began to expatiate on the troubles she had undergone in their service and the excellence of sam there was certainly a charm in her manners for ethel forgot her charge of ingratitude the other sisters were perfectly taken with her nor could they any of them help giving credence to her asseverations that jenny and polly should come to school next sunday  they soon formed another acquaintance a sharpfaced woman stood in their path with a little girl in her hand and arrested them with a low curtsey and not a very pleasant voice addressing herself to flora who was quite as tall as richard and appeared the person of most consequence  if you please miss i wanted to speak to you i have got a little girl here and i want to send her to school only i have no shoes for her  why surely if she can run about here on the heath she can go to school said flora  oh but there is all the other children to point at her the poor thing would be daunted you see miss if i could but get some friend to give her a pair of shoes id send her in a minute i want her to get some learning as i am always saying id never keep her away if i had but got the clothes to send her in i never lets her be running on the common like them halls as its a shame to see them in nice frocks as mrs hall got by going hypercriting about  what is your name said richard cutting her short  watts if you please sir we heard there was good work up here sir and so we came but id never have set foot in it if i had known what a dark heathenish place it is with never a gospel minister to come near it and a great deal more to the same purpose  mary whispered to flora something about having outgrown her boots but flora silenced her by a squeeze of the hand and the two friends of cocksmoor felt a good deal puzzled  at last flora said you will soon get her clothed if she comes regularly to school on sundays for she will be admitted into the club i will recommend her if she has a good character and comes regularly goodmorning mrs watts now we must go or it will be dark before we get home and they walked hastily away  horrid woman was ethels exclamation  but flora said innocent mary why would you not let me give the little girl my boots  perhaps i may if she is good and comes to school said flora  i think margaret ought to settle what you do with your boots said richard not much to floras satisfaction  it is the same she said if i approve margaret will not object  how well you helped us out flora said ethel i did not know in the least what to say  it will be the best way of testing her sincerity said flora and at least it will do the child good but i congratulate you on the promising aspect of cocksmoor  we did not expect to find a perfect place said ethel if it were it would be of no use to go to it  ethel could answer with dignity but her heart sank at the aspect of what she had undertaken she knew there would be evil but she had expected it in a more striking and less disagreeable form  that walk certainly made her less impatient though it did not relax her determination nor the guard over her lion and bear which her own good feeling aided by margarets council showed her were the greatest hindrances to her doing anything good and great  though she was obliged to set to work so many principles and reflections to induce herself to wipe a pen or to sit straight on her chair that it was like winding up a steamengine to thread a needle yet the work was being doneshe was struggling with her faults humbled by them watching them and overcoming them  flora meanwhile was sitting calmly down in the contemplation of the unexpected services she had rendered confident that her character for energy and excellence was established believing it herself and looking back on her childish vanity and love of domineering as long past and conquered she thought her grownup character had begun and was too secure to examine it closely     chapter xi         one thing is wanting in the beamy cup        of my young life one thing to be poured in      ay and one thing is wanting to fill up        the measure of proud joy and make it sinf w f   hopes that dr may would ever have his mind free seemed as fallacious as mammas old promise to margaret to make dolls clothes for her whenever there should be no live dolls to be worked for in the nursery  richard and ethel themselves had their thoughts otherwise engrossed the last week before the holidays was an important one there was an examination by which the standing of the boys in the school was determined and this time it was of more than ordinary importance as the randall scholarship of £100 a year for three years would be open in the summer to the competition of the first six boys richard had never come within six of the top but had been past at every examination by younger boys till his father could bear it no longer and now norman was too young to be likely to have much chance of being of the number there were eight decidedly his seniors and harvey anderson a small quickwitted boy half a year older who had entered school at the same time and had always been one step below him had in the last three months gained fast upon him  harry however meant norman to be one of the six and declared all the fellows thought he would be except andersens party mr wilmot in a call on ethel and flora told them that he thought their brother had a fair chance but he feared he was overworking himself and should tell the doctor so whenever he could catch him but this was difficult as there was a great deal of illness just then and he was less at home than usual  all this excited the home party but norman only seemed annoyed by talk about it and though always with a book in his hand was so dreamy and listless that flora declared that there was no fear of his doing too muchshe thought he would fail for want of trying  i mean to try said norman say no more about it pray  the great day was the 20th of december and ethel ran out as the boys went to school to judge of normans looks which were not promising no wonder said harry since he had stayed up doing euripides and cicero the whole length of a candle that had been new at bedtime but never mind ethel if he only beats anderson i dont care for anything else  oh it will be unbearable if he does not do try norman dear  never you mind  hell light up at the last moment said ethel consolingly to harry but she was very uneasy herself for she had set her heart on his surpassing harvey anderson no more was heard all day tom went at dinnertime to see if he could pick up any news but he was shy or was too late and gained no intelligence dr may and richard talked of going to hear the speeches and viva voce examination in the afternoonobjects of great interest to all stoneborough menbut just as they came home from a long days work dr may was summoned to the next town by an electric telegraph and as it was to a bad case he did not expect to be at home till the mailtrain came in at one oclock at night richard begged to go with him and he consented unwillingly to please margaret who could not bear to think of his fending for himself in the dark on the railroad  very long did the evening seem to the listening sisters eight and no tidings nine the boys not come tom obliged to go to bed by sheer sleepiness and ethel unable to sit still and causing flora demurely to wonder at her fidgeting so much it would be so much better to fix her attention to some employment while margaret owned that flora was right but watched and started at each sound almost as anxiously as ethel  it was ten when there was a sharp pull at the bell and down flew the sisters but old james was beforehand and harry was exclaiming dux james he is dux hurrah flossy ethel mary there stands the dux of stoneborough wheres papa  sent for to whitford but oh norman dux is he really  to be sure but i must tell margaret and up he rushed shouted the news to her but could not stay for congratulation broke toms slumber by roaring it in his ear and dashed into the nursery where nurse for once forgave him for waking the baby norman meanwhile followed his eager sisters into the drawingroom putting up his hand as if the light dazzled him and looking by no means as it he had just achieved triumphant success  ethel paused in her exultation but is it is it true norman  yes he said wearily making his way to his dark corner  but what was it for how is it  i dont know he answered  whats the matter said flora are you tired norman dear does your head ache  yes and the pain was evidently severe  wont you come to margaret said ethel knowing what was the greater suffering but he did not move and they forbore to torment him with questions the next moment harry came down in an ecstacy bringing in from the hall normans beautiful prize books and showing off their latin inscription  ah said he looking at his brother he is regularly done for he ought to turn in at once that everard is a famous fellow for an examiner he said he never had seen such a copy of verses sent up by a schoolboy and could hardly believe june was barely sixteen old hoxton says he is the youngest dux they have had these fifty years that he has known the school and mr wilmot said twas the most creditable examination he had ever known and that i might tell papa so what did possess that ridiculous old landlubber at whitford to go and get on the sicklist on this of all the nights of the year june how can you go on sitting there when you know you ought to be in your berth  i wish he was said flora but let him have some tea first  and tell us more harry said ethel oh it is famous i knew he would come light at last it is too delightful if papa was but here  isnt it you should have seen how anderson grinnedhe is only fourthdown below forder and cheviot and ashe  well i did not think norman would have been before forder and cheviot that is grand  it was the verses that did it said harry they had an hour to do themistocles on the hearth of admetus and there he beat them all to shivers twas all done smack smooth without a scratch in alcaics and cheviot heard wilmot saving twas no mere task but had poetry and all that sort of thing in it but i dont know whether that would have done if he had not come out so strong in the recitation they put him on in priams speech to achilles and he said itoh it was too bad papa did not hear him every one held their breath and listened  how you do go on muttered norman but no one heeded and harry continued he construed a chorus in sophocles without a blunder but what did the business was this i believe they asked all manner of outoftheway questionshistory and geography what no one expected and the fellows who read nothing they can help were thoroughly posed forder had not a word to say and the others were worse for cheviot thought queen elizabeths earl of leicester was simon de montfort and didnt know when that battle was beginning with an ewas it evesham or edgehill  o harry you are as bad yourself  but any one would know leicester because of kenilworth said harry and im not sixth form if papa had but been there every one was asking for him and wishing it for dr hoxton called methey shook hands with me and wished me joy of it and told me to tell my father how well norman had done  i suppose you looked so happy they could not help it said flora smiling at that honest beaming face of joy  ay said norman looking up they had something to say to him on his own score which he has forgotten  i should think not said harry why what dye think they said that i had gone on as well as all the mays and they trusted i should still and be a credit to my profession  oh harry why didnt you tell us  oh that is grand and as the two elder girls made this exclamation mary proceeded to a rapturous embrace get along mary you are throttling one mr everard inquired for my father and margaret and said hed call tomorrow and hoxton and wilmot kept on wishing he was there  i wish he had been said ethel he would have taken such delight in it but even if he could have gone he doubted whether it would not have made norman get on worse from anxiety  well cheviot wanted me to send up for him at dinnertime said harry for as soon as we sat down in the hall june turned off giddy and could not stay and looked so horrid we thought it was all over with him and he would not be able to go up at all  and cheviot thought you ought to send for papa  yes i knew he would not be in and so we left him lying down on the bench in the cloister till dinner was over  what a place for catching cold said flora  so cheviot said but i couldnt help it and when we went to call him afterwards he was all right wasnt it fun when the names were called over and may senior at the head i dont think it will be better when i am a postcaptain myself but margaret has not heard half yet  after telling it once in her room once in the nursery in whispers like gusts of wind and once in the pantry harry employed himself in writingnorman is dux in immense letters on pieces of paper which he disposed all over the house to meet the eyes of his father and richard on their return  ethels joy was sadly damped by normans manner he hardly spokeonly just came in to wish margaret goodnight and shrank from her affectionate sayings departing abruptly to his own room  poor fellow he is sadly overdone said she as he went  oh sighed ethel nearly ready to cry tis not like what i used to fancy it would be when he came to the head of the school  it will be different tomorrow said margaret trying to console herself as well as ethel think how he has been on the strain this whole day and long before doing so much more than older boys no wonder he is tired and worn out  ethel did not understand what mental fatigue was for her active vigorous spirit had never been tasked beyond its powers  i hope he will be like himself tomorrow said she disconsolately i never saw him rough and hasty before it was even with you margaret  no no ethel you arent going to blame your own norman for unkindness on this of all days in the year you know how it was you love him better just as i do for not being able to bear to stay in this room where  yes said ethel mournfully it was a great shame of me how could i dear norman how he does grievewhat love his must have been but yet margaret she said impatiently and the hot tears breaking out i cannotcannot bear it to have him not caring one bit for all of us i want him to triumph i cant without him  what ethel you who said you didnt care for mere distinction and praise dont you think dear mamma would say it was safer for him not to be delighted and triumphant  it is very tiresome said ethel nearly convinced but in a slightly petulant voice  and does not one love those two dear boys tonight said margaret norman not able to rejoice in his victory without her and harry in such an ecstacy with normans honours i dont think i ever was so fond of my two brothers  ethel smiled and drew up her head and said no boys were like them anywhere and papa would be delighted and so went to bed happier in her exultation and in hoping that the holidays would make norman himself again  nothing could be better news for dr may who had never lost a grain of the ancient schoolpartyloyalty that is part of the nature of the english gentleman he was a thorough stoneborough boy had followed the politics of the whichcote foundation year by year all his life and perhaps in his heart regarded no honour as more to be prized than that of dux and randall scholar harry was in his room the next morning as soon as ever he was stirring a welcome guestteased a little at first by his pretending to take it all as a sailors prank to hoax him and richard and then free to pour out to delighted ears the whole history of the examination and of every ones congratulations  norman himself was asleep when harry went to give this narration he came down late and his father rose to meet him as he entered my boy he said i had not expected this of you well done norman and the whole tone and gesture had a heartfelt approval and joy in them that ethel knew her brother was deeply thrilled by for his colour deepened and his lips quivered into something like a smile though he did not lift his eyes  then came richards warm greeting and congratulation he too showing himself as delighted as if the honours were his own and then dr may again in lively tones like old times laughing at norman for sleeping late and still not looking well awake asking him if he was quite sure it was not all a dream  well said norman i should think it was if it were not that you all believe it  harry had better go to sleep next said dr may and see what dreaming will make him if it makes dux of norman who knows but it may make drakes of him ha ethel          oh give us for our kings such queens           and for our ducks such drakes   there had not been such a merry breakfast for months there was the old confusion of voices the boys richard and the doctor had much to talk over of the school doings of this week and there was nearly as much laughing as in days past ethel wondered whether any one but herself observed that the voice most seldom heard was normans  the promised call was made by dr hoxton and mr everard an old friend and after their departure dr may came to margarets room with fresh accounts corroborating what harry had said of the clear knowledge and brilliant talent that norman had displayed to a degree that surprised his masters almost as much as the examiners the copy of verses dr may brought with him and construed them to margaret commenting all the way on their ease and the fullness of thought certainly remarkable in a boy of sixteen  they were then resigned to ethels keeping and she could not help imparting her admiration to their author with some apology for vexing him again  i dont want to be cross said norman whom these words roused to a sense that he had been churlish last night but i cannot help it i wish people would not make such a fuss about it  i dont think you can be well norman  nonsense theres nothing the matter with me  but i dont understand your not caring at all and not being the least pleased  it only makes it worse said norman i only feel as if i wanted to be out of the way my only comfortable time yesterday was on that bench in the cool quiet cloister i dont think i could have got through without that when they left me in peace till cheviot and harry came to rout me up and i knew it was all coming  ah you have overworked yourself but it was for something you have given papa such pleasure and comfort as you cant help being glad of that is very different from us foolish young ones and our trumpeting  what comfort can it be ive not been the smallest use all this time when he was ill i left him to ernescliffe and lay on the floor like an ass and if he were to ask me to touch his arm i should be as bad again a fine thing for me to have talked all that arrogant stuff about richard i hate the thought of it and as if to make arrows and barbs of it heres richard making as much of this as if it was a double first class he afraid to be compared with me indeed  norman indeed this is going too far we cant be as useful as the elder ones and when you know how papa was vexed about richard you must be glad to have pleased him  if i were he it would only make me miss her more i believe he only makes much of me that he may not disappoint me  i dont think so he is really glad and the more because she would have been so pleased he said it would have been a happy day for her and there was more of the glad look than the sorry one it was the glistening look that comes when he is watching baby or hearing margaret say pretty things to her you see it is the first bright morning we have had  yes said norman perhaps it was but i dont know i thought half of it was din  oh norman  and another thing ethel i dont feel as if i had fairly earned it forder or cheviot ought to have had it they are both more really good scholars than i am and have always been above me there was nothing i really knew better except those historical questions that no one reckoned on and not living at home with their sisters and books they had no such chance and it is very hard on them and i dont like it  well but you really and truly beat them in everything  ay by chance there were lots of places in construing where i should have broken down if i had happened to be set on in them it was only a wonder i did not in that chorus for i had only looked at it twice but everard asked me nothing but what i knew and now and then i get into a funny state when nothing is too hard for me and that was how it was yesterday evening generally i feel as dull as a post said norman yawning and stretching i could not make a nonsense hexameter this minute if i was to die for it  a sort of berserkar fury said ethel like that night you did the coralworm verses its very odd are you sure you are well dear norman  to which he answered with displeasure that he was as well as possible ordered her not to go and make any more fuss and left her hastily she was unhappy and far from satisfied she had never known his temper so much affected and was much puzzled but she was too much afraid of vexing him to impart her perplexity even to margaret however the next day sunday as she was reading to margaret after church her father came in and the first thing he said was i want to know what you think of norman  how do you mean said margaret in health or spirits  both said dr may poor boy he has never held up his head since october and at his age that is hardly natural he goes moping about has lost flesh and appetite and looks altogether out of older shooting up like a maypole too  mind and body said margaret while ethel gazed intently at her father wondering whether she ought to speak for margaret did not know half what she did nothing about the bad nights nor what he called the funny state  yes both i fancied it was only his rapid growth and the excitement of this examination and that it would go off but i think theres more amiss he was lounging about doing nothing when the girls were gone to school after dinner and i asked him to walk down with me to the almshouses he did not seem very willing but he went and presently as i had hold of his arm i felt him shivering and saw him turn as pale as a sheet as soon as i noticed it he flushed crimson and would not hear of turning back stoutly protesting he was quite well but i saw his hand was quivering even when i got into church why ethel you have turned as red as he did  then he has done it exclaimed ethel in a smothered voice  what do you mean speak ethel  he has gone past itthe place whispered she  the doctor made a sound of sorrowful assent as if much struck then said you dont mean he has never been there since  yes said ethel he has always gone round randalls alley or the garden he has said nothing but has contrived to avoid it  well said dr may after a pause i hoped none of us knew the exact spot  we dont he never told us but he was there  was he exclaimed her father i had no notion of that how came he there  he went on with mr ernescliffe and saw it all said ethel as her father drew out her words apparently with his eye and then came up to my room so faint that he was obliged to lie on the floor ever so long  fainthow long did it last said her father examining her without apparent emotion as if it had been an indifferent patient  i dont know things seemed so long that evening till after dark at least and it came on in the morningno the monday i believe it was your armfor talking of going to see you always brought it on till mr ward gave him a dose of brandyandwater and that stopped it  i wish i had known this before derangement of the nervous system no doubta susceptible boy like thati wonder what sort of nights he has been having  terrible ones said ethel i dont think he ever sleeps quietly till morning he has dreams and he groans and talks in his sleep harry can tell you all that  bless me cried dr may in some anger what have you all been thinking about to keep this to yourselves all this time  he could not bear to have it mentioned said ethel timidly and i didnt know that it signified so much does it  it signifies so much that i had rather have given a thousand pounds than have let him go on all this time to be overworked at school and wound up to that examination  oh dear i am sorry said ethel in great dismay if you had but been at home when cheviot wanted harry to have sent for youbecause he did not think him fit for it and ethel was much relieved by pouring out all she knew though her alarm was by no means lessened by the effect it produced on her father especially when he heard of the funny state  a fine state of things he said i wonder it has not brought on a tremendous illness by this time a boy of that sensitive temperament meeting with such a shocknever looked afterthe quietest and most knocked down of all and therefore the most neglectedhis whole system disorderedand then driven to school to be harassed and overworked if we had wanted to occasion brain fever we could not have gone a better way to set about it i should not wonder if health and nerves were damaged for life  oh papa papa cried ethel in extreme distress what shall i do i wish i had told you but  im not blaming you ethel you knew no better but it has been grievous neglect it is plain enough there is no one to see after you said the doctor with a low groan  we may be taking it in time said margarets soft voiceit is very well it has gone on no longer  three months is long enough said dr may  i suppose continued margaret it will be better not to let dear norman know we are uneasy about him  no no certainly not dont say a word of this to him i shall find harry and ask about these disturbed nights and then watch him trusting it may not have gone too far but there must be dreadful excitability of brain  he went away leaving margaret to comfort ethel as well as she could by showing her that he had not said the mischief was done putting her in mind that he was wont to speak strongly and trying to make her thankful that her brother would now have such care as might avert all evil results  but oh said ethel his success has been dearly purchased     chapter xii                          it hath do me mochil woe      yea hath it  use quod he this medicine       every daie this maie or that thou dine       go lokin in upon the freshe daisie       and though thou be for woe in poinct to die       that shall full gretly lessen thee of thy pine                                                    chaucer   that night norman started from what was not so much sleep as a trance of oppression and suffering and beheld his fathers face watching him attentively  papa whats the matter said he starting up is any one ill  no no one lie down again said dr may possessing himself of a hand with a burning spot in the palm and a throbbing pulse  but what made you come here have i disturbed any one have i been talking  only mumbling a little but you looked very uncomfortable  but im not illwhat are you feeling my pulse for said norman uneasily  to see whether that restless sleep has quickened it  norman scarcely let his father count for a moment before he asked what oclock is it  a little after twelve  what does make you stay up so late papa  i often do when my arm seems likely to keep me awake richard has done all i want  pray dont stay here in the cold said norman with feverish impatience as he turned upwards the cool side of his pillow goodnight  no hurry said his father still watching him  theres nothing the matter repeated the boy  do you often have such unquiet nights  oh it does not signify goodnight and he tried to look settled and comfortable  norman said his father in a voice betraying much grief it will not do to go on in this way if your mother was here you would not close yourself against her  norman interrupted him in a voice strangled with sobs it is no good saying iti thought it would only make it worse for you but thats it i cannot bear the being without her  dr may was glad to see that a gush of tears followed this exclamation as norman hid his face under the coverings  my poor boy said he hardly able to speak only one can comfort you truly but you must not turn from me you must let me do what i can for you though it is not the same  i thought it would grieve you more said norman turning his face towards him again  what to find my children feeling with me and knowing what they have lost surely not norman  and it is of no use added norman hiding his face again no one can comfort  there you are wrong said dr may with deep feeling there is much comfort in everything in everybody in kindness in all around if one can only open ones mind to it but i did not come to keep you awake with such talk i saw you were not quite well so i came up to see about you and now norman you will not refuse to own that something is the matter  i did not know it said norman i really believe i am well if i could get rid of these horrible nights i either lie awake tumbling and tossing or i get all sorts of unbearable dreams  ay when i asked master harry about you all the answer i could get was that he was quite used to it and did not mind it at all as if i asked for his sake how fast that boy sleepshe is fit for a midshipmans berth  but do you think there is anything amiss with me  i shall know more about that tomorrow morning come to my room as soon as you are up unless i come to you now i have something to read before i go to bed and i may as well try if it will put you to sleep  normans last sight that night was of the outline of his fathers profile and he was scarcely awake the next morning before dr may was there again  unwilling as he had been to give way it was a relief to relinquish the struggle to think himself well and to venture to lounge and dawdle rest his heavy head and stretch his inert limbs without fear of remark his father found him after breakfast lying on the sofa in the drawingroom with a greek play by his side telling ethel what words to look out  at it again exclaimed dr may carry it away ethel i will have no latin or greek touched these holidays  you know said norman if i dont sap i shall have no chance of keeping up  youll keep nowhere if you dont rest  it is only euripides and i cant do anything else said norman languidly  very likely i dont care you have to get well first of all and the greek will take care of itself go up to margaret i put you in her keeping while i am gone to whitford after that i dare say richard will be very glad to have a holiday and let you drive me to abbotstoke  norman rose and wearily walked upstairs while his sister lingered to excuse herself papa i did not think euripides would hurt himhe knows it all so well and he said he could not read anything else  just so ethel poor fellow he has not spirits or energy for anything his mind was forced into those classicalities when it wanted rest and now it has not spring enough to turn back again  do you think him so very ill  not exactly but theres low fever hanging about him and we must look after him well and i hope we may get him right i have told margaret about him i cant stop any longer now  norman found the baby in his sisters room and this was just what suited him the daisy showed a marked preference for her brothers and to find her so merry and good with him pleased and flattered him far more than his victory at school he carried her about danced her whistled to her and made her admire her pretty blue eyes in the glass more successfully till nurse carried her off but perhaps he had been sent up rather too soon for as he sat in the great chair by the fire he was teased by the constant coming and going all the petty cares of a large household transacted by margaretorders to butcher and cookharry racing in to ask to take tom to the rivertom who was to go when his lesson was done coming perpetually to try to repeat the same unhappy bit of as in proesenti each time in a worse whine  how can you bear it margaret said norman as she finally dismissed tom and laid down her accountbook taking up some delicate fancy work mercy heres another as enter a message about lamp oil in the midst of which mary burst in to beg margaret to get miss winter to let her go to the river with harry and tom  no indeed mary i could not think of such a thing you had better go back to your lessons and dont be silly as she looked much disposed to cry  no one but a tomboy would dream of it added norman and mary departed disconsolate while margaret gave a sigh of weariness and said as she returned to her work there i believe i have done i hope i was not cross with poor mary but it was rather too much to ask  i cant think how you can help being cross to every one said norman as he took away the books she had done with  i am afraid i am said margaret sadly it does get trying at times  i should think so this eternal worrying must be more than any one can bear always lying there too  it is only now and then that it grows tiresome said margaret i am too happy to be of some use and it is too bad to repine but sometimes a feeling comes of its being always the same as if a little change would be such a treat  arent you very tired of lying in bed  yes very sometimes i fancy but it is only fancy that i could move better if i was up and dressed it has seemed more so lately since i have been stronger  when do you think they will let you get up  theres the question i believe papa thinks i might be lifted to the sofa nowand oh how i long for itbut then mr ward does not approve of my sitting up even as i am doing now and wants to keep me flat papa thinks that of no use and likely to hurt my general health and i believe the end of it will be that he will ask sir matthew fleets opinion  is that the man he calls mat  yes you know they went through the university together and were at edinburgh and paris but they have never met since he set up in london and grew so famous i believe it would be a great treat to papa to have him and it would be a good thing for papa too i dont think his arm is going on righthe does not trust to mr wards treatment and i am sure some one else ought to see it  did you know margaret that he sits up quite late because he cannot sleep for it  yes i hear him moving about but dont tell him so i would not have him guess for the world that it kept me awake  and does it  why if i think he is awake and in pain i cannot settle myself to sleep but that is no matter having no exercise of course i dont sleep so much but i am very anxious about himhe looks so thin and gets so faggedand no wonder  ah mr everard told me he was quite shocked to see him and would hardly have known him and norman groaned from the bottom of his heart  well i shall hope much from sir matthews taking him in hand said margaret cheerfully he will mind him though he will not mr ward  i wish the holidays were over said norman with a yawn as expressive as a sigh  thats not civil on the third day said margaret smiling when i am so glad to have you to look after me so as to set flora at liberty  what can i do you any good said norman with a shade of his former alacrity  to be sure you can a great deal better not come near me otherwise for i make every one into a slave i want my morning reading nowthat book on advent there  shall i read it to you  thank you thats nice and i shall get on with babys frock  norman read but ere long took to yawning margaret begged for the book which he willingly resigned saying however that he liked it only he was stupid she read on aloud till she heard a succession of heavy breathings and saw him fast asleep and so he continued till waked by his fathers coming home  richard and ethel were glad of a walk for margaret had found them a pleasant errand their cocksmoor children could not go home to dinner between service and afternoon school and margaret had desired the cook to serve them up some broth in the back kitchen to which the brother and sister were now to invite them mary was allowed to take her boots to rebekah watts since margaret held that goodness had better be profitable at least at the outset and harry and tom joined the party  norman meantime was driving his fathera holiday preferment highly valued in the days when dr may used only to assume the reins when his spirited horses showed too much consciousness that they had a young hand over them or when the old hack took a fit of laziness now norman needed richards assurance that the bay was steady so far was he from being troubled with his ancient desire that the steed would rear right up on his hind legs  he could neither talk nor listen till he was clear out of the town and found himself master of the animal and even then the words were few and chiefly spoken by dr may until after going along about three miles of the turnpike road he desired norman to turn down a crosscountry lane  where does this lead  it comes out at abbotstoke but i have to go to an outlying farm  papa said norman after a few minutes i wish you would let me do my greek  is that what you have been pondering all this time what may not the bonus homerus slumber sometimes  it is not homer it is euripides i do assure you papa it is no trouble and i get much worse without it  well stop here the road grows so bad that we will walk and let the boy lead the horse to meet us at woodcote  norman followed his father down a steep narrow lane little better than a stony watercourse and began to repeat if you would but let me do my work ive got nothing else to do and now they have put me up i should not like not to keep my place  very likely buthollohow swelled this is said dr may as they came to the bottom of the valley where a stream rushed along coloured with a turbid creamy yellow making little whirlpools where it crossed the road and brawling loudly just above where it roared and foamed between two steep banks of rock crossed by a footbridge of planks guarded by a handrail of rough poles the doctor had traversed it and gone a few paces beyond when looking back he saw norman very pale with one foot on the plank and one hand grasping the rail he came back and held out his hand which norman gladly caught at but no sooner was the other side attained than the boy though he gasped with relief exclaimed this is too bad wait one moment please and let me go back  he tried but the first touch of the shaking rail and glance at the chasm disconcerted him and his father seeing his white cheeks and rigid lips said stop norman dont try it you are not fit he added as the boy came to him reluctantly  i cant bear to be such a wretch said he i never used to be i will notlet me conquer it and he was turning back but the doctor took his arm saying decidedly no i wont have it done you are only making it worse by putting a force on yourself but the farther norman was from the bridge the more displeased he was with himself and more anxious to dare it again theres no bearing it he muttered let me only run back ill overtake you i must do it if no one looks on  no such thing said the doctor holding him fast if you do youll have it all over again at night  thats better than to know i am worse than tom  i tell you norman it is no such thing you will recover your tone if you will only do as you are told but your nerves have had a severe shock and when you force yourself in this way you only increase the mischief  nerves muttered norman disdainfully i thought they were only fit for fine ladies  dr may smiled well will it content you if i promise that as soon as i see fit ill bring you here and let you march over that bridge as often as you like  i suppose i must be contented but i dont like to feel like a fool  you need not while the moral determination is sound  but my greek papa  at it againi declare norman you are the worst patient i ever had  norman made no answer and dr may presently said well let me hear what you have to say about it i assure you it is not that i dont want you to get on but that i see you are in great need of rest  thank you papa i know you mean it for my good but i dont think you do know how horrid it is i have got nothing on earth to do or care forthe school work comes quite easy to me and im sure thinking is worse and thennorman spoke vehementlynow they have put me up it will never do to be beaten and all the four others ought to be able to do it i did not want or expect to be dux but now i am you could not bear me not to keep my place and to miss the randall scholarship as i certainly shall if i do not work these whole holidays  norman i know it said his father kindly i am very sorry for you and i know i am asking of you what i could not have done at your ageindeed i dont believe i could have done it for you a few months ago it is my fault that you have been let alone to have an overstrain and pressure on your mind when you were not fit for it and i cannot see any remedy but complete freedom from work at the same time if you fret and harass yourself about being surpassed that is as you say much worse for you than latin and greek perhaps i may be wrong and study might not do you the harm i think it would at any rate it is better than tormenting yourself about next half year so i will not positively forbid it but i think you had much better let it alone i dont want to make it a matter of duty i only tell you this that you may set your mind at rest as far as i am concerned if you do lose your place i will consider it as my own doing and not be disappointed i had rather see you a healthy vigorous useful man than a poor puling nervous wretch of a scholar if you were to get all the prizes in the university  norman made a little murmuring sound of assent and both were silent for some moments then he said then you will not be displeased papa if i do read as long as i feel it does me no harm  i told you i dont mean to make it a matter of obedience do as you pleasei had rather you read than vexed yourself  i am glad of it thank you papa said norman in a much cheered voice  they had in the meantime been mounting a rising ground clothed with stunted wood and came out on a wide heath brown with dead bracken a hollow traced by the tops of leafless trees marked the course of the stream that traversed it and the inequalities of ground becoming more rugged in outlines and grayer in colouring as they receded till they were closed by a dark fir wood beyond which rose in extreme distance the grand mass of welsh mountain heads purpled against the evening sky except where the crowning peaks bore a veil of snow behind the sky was pure gold gradually shading into pale green and then into clear light wintry blue while the sun sitting behind two of the loftiest seemed to confound their outlines and blend them in one flood of soft hazy brightness dr may looked at his son and saw his face clear up his brow expand and his lips unclose with admiration  yes said the doctor it is very fine is it not i used to bring mamma here now and then for a treat because it put her in mind of her scottish hills well yours are the golden hills of heaven now my maggie he added hardly knowing that he spoke aloud normans throat swelled as he looked up in his face then cast down his eyes hastily to hide the tears that had gathered on his eyelashes  ill leave you here said dr may i have to go to a farmhouse close by in the hollow behind us theres a girl recovering from a fever ill not be ten minutes so wait here  when he came back norman was still where he had left him gazing earnestly and the tears standing on his cheeks he did not move till his father laid his hand on his shoulderthey walked away together without a word and scarcely spoke all the way home  dr may went to margaret and talked to her of normans fine character and intense affection for his mother the determined temper and quietly borne grief for which the doctor seemed to have worked himself into a perfect enthusiasm of admiration but lamenting that he could not tell what to do with himstudy or no study hurt him alikeand he dreaded to see health and spirits shattered for ever they tried to devise change of scene but it did not seem possible just at present and margaret besides her fears for norman was much grieved to see this added to her fathers troubles  at night dr may again went up to see whether norman whom he had moved into margarets former room were again suffering from fever he found him asleep in a restless attitude as if he had just dropped off and waking almost at the instant of his entrance he exclaimed is it you i thought it was mamma she said it was all ambition  then starting and looking round the room and at his father he collected himself and said with a slight smile i didnt know i had been asleep i was awake just now thinking about it papa ill give it up ill try to put next half out of my head and not mind if they do pass me  thats right my boy said the doctor  at least if cheviot and forder do for they ought i only hope anderson wont i can stand anything but that but that is nonsense too  you are quite right norman said the doctor and it is a great relief to me that you see the thing so sensibly  no i dont see it sensibly at all papa i hate it all the time and i dont know whether i can keep from thinking of it when i have nothing to do but i see it is wrong i thought all ambition and nonsense was gone out of me when i cared so little for the examination but now i see though i did not want to be made first i cant bear not to be first and thats the old story just as she used to tell me to guard against ambition so ill take my chance and if i should get put down why twas not fair that i should be put up and it is what i ought to be and serves me right into the bargain  well thats the best sort of sense your mothers sense said the doctor more affected than he liked to show no wonder she came to you in your dream norman my boy if you had come to such a resolution i was half in hopes you had some such notion when i came upon you on farview down  i think that sky did it said norman in a low voice it made me think of her in a different wayand what you said too  what did i say i dont remember  but norman could not repeat the words and only murmured golden hills it was enough  i see said the doctor you had dwelt on the blank here not taken home what it is to her  ay almost sobbed norman i never could beforethat made me after a long silence and then i know how foolish i was and how she would say it was wrong to make this fuss when you did not like it about my place and that it was not for the sake of my duty but of ambition i knew that but till i went to bed tonight i could not tell whether i could make up my mind so i would say nothing     chapter xiii         the days are sad it is the holy tide      when flowers have ceased to blow and birds to sing                                                f tennyson   it had been a hard struggle to give up all thoughts of study and norman was not at first rewarded for it but rather exemplified the truth of his own assertion that he was worse without it for when this sole occupation for his mind was taken away he drooped still more he would willingly have shown his father that he was not discontented but he was too entirely unnerved to be either cheerful or capable of entering with interest into any occupation if he had been positively ill the task would have been easier but the low intermittent fever that hung about him did not confine him to bed only kept him lounging listless and forlorn through the weary day not always able to go out with his father and on christmas day unfit even for church  all this made the want of his mother and the vacancy in his home still more evident and nothing was capable of relieving his sadness but his fathers kindness which was a continual surprise to him dr may was a parent who could not fail to be loved and honoured but as a busy man trusting all at home to his wife he had only appeared to his children either as a merry playfellow or as a stern paternal authority not often in the intermediate light of guiding friend or gentle guardian and it affected norman exceedingly to find himself a tall schoolboy watched and soothed with motherly tenderness and affection with complete comprehension of his feelings and delicate care of them his fathers solicitude and sympathy were round him day and night and this in the midst of so much toil pain grief and anxiety of his own that norman might well feel overwhelmed with the swelling inexpressible feelings of grateful affection  how could his father know exactly what he would likesay the very things he was thinkingsee that his depression was not wilful repiningfind exactly what best soothed him he wondered but he could not have said so to any one only his eye brightened and as his sisters remarked he never seemed half so uncomfortable when papa was in the room indeed the certainty that his father felt the sorrow as acutely as himself was one reason of his opening to him he could not feel that his brothers and sisters did so for outwardly their habits were unaltered their spirits not lowered their relish for things around much the same as before and this had given norman a sense of isolation with his father it was different norman knew he could never appreciate what the bereavement was to himhe saw its traces in almost every word and look and yet perceived that something sustained and consoled him though not in the way of forgetfulness now and then norman caught at what gave this comfort and it might be hoped he would do so increasingly though on this christmas day margaret felt very sad about him as she watched him sitting over the fire cowering with chilliness and headache while every one was gone to church and saw that the reading of the service with her had been more of a trouble than a solace  she tried to think it bodily ailment and strove hard not to pine for her mother to comfort them both and say the fond words of refreshing cheering pity that would have made all light to bear margarets home christmas was so spent in caring for brother father and children that she had hardly time to dwell on the sad change that had befallen herself  christmas was a season that none of them knew well how to meet blanche was overheard saying to mary that she wished it would not come and mary shaking her head and answering that she was afraid that was naughty but it was very tiresome to have no fun margaret did her best upstairs and richard downstairs by the help of prints and hymns to make the children think of the true joy of christmas and in the evening their father gathered them round and told them the stories of the shepherds and of the wise men till mary and blanche agreed as they went up to bed that it had been a very happy evening  the next day harry discomfited the schoolroom by bursting in with the news that louisa and fanny anderson were bearing down on the front door ethel and flora were obliged to appear in the drawingroom where they were greeted by two girls rather older than themselves a whole shower of inquiries for dr may for margaret and for the dear little baby were first poured out then came hopes that norman was well as they had not seen him at church yesterday  thank you he was kept at home by a bad headache but it is better today  we came to congratulate you on his successwe could not help itit must have been such a pleasure to you  that it was exclaimed ethel pleased at participation in her rejoicing we were so surprised  flora gave a glance of warning but ethels shortsighted eyes were beyond the range of correspondence and miss anderson continued it must have been a delightful surprise we could hardly believe it when harvey came in and told us every one thought forder was sure but they all were put out by the questions of general informationthose were all mr everards doing  mr everard was very much struck with normans knowledge and scholarship too said flora  so every one says it was all mr everards doing miss harrison told mamma but for my part i am very glad for the sake of stoneborough i like a town boy to be at the head  norman was sorry for forder and cheviot began ethel flora tried to stop her but louisa anderson caught at what she said and looked eagerly for more he felt said she only thinking of exalting her generous brother as if it was hardly right when they are so much his seniors that he could scarcely enjoy it  ah that is just what people say replied louisa but it must be very gratifying to you and it makes him certain of the randal scholarship too i suppose it is a great thing for him he must have worked very hard  yes that he has said flora he is so fond of study and that goes halfway  so is dear harvey how earnest he is over his books mamma sometimes says now harvey dear youll be quite stupified youll be ill i really shall get dr may to forbid you i suppose norman is very busy too it is quite the fashion for boys not to be idle now  poor norman cant help it said ethel piteously papa will not hear of his doing any latin or greek these whole holidays  he thinks he will come to it better again for entire rest said flora launching another look at her sister which again fell short  a great deal of polite inquiry whether they were uneasy about him followed mixed with a little boasting of dear harveys diligence  bythebye ethel it is you that are the great patroness of the wild cocksmoor childrenare not you  ethel coloured and mumbled and flora answered for her richard and ethel have been there once or twice you know our under nurserymaid is a cocksmoor girl  well mamma said she could not think how miss may could take one from thence the whole place is full of thieves and do you know bessie boulder has lost her gold pencilcase  has she said flora  and she had it on sunday when she was teaching her class  oh cried ethel vehemently surely she does not suspect any of those poor children  i only know such a thing never happened at school before said fanny and i shall never take anything valuable there again  but is she sure she lost it at school  oh yes quite certain she will not accuse any one but it is not comfortable and how those children do behave at church  poor things they have been sadly neglected said flora  they are quite spoiling the rest and they are such figures why dont you at least make them cut their hair you know it is the rule of the school  i know but half the girls in the first class wear it long  oh yes but those are the superior people that one would not be strict with and they dress it so nicely too now these are like little savages  richard thinks it might drive them away to insist at first said ethel we will try to bring it about in time  well mrs ledwich is nearly resolved to insist so you had better be warned ethel she cannot suffer such untidiness and rags to spoil the appearance of the school and i assure you it is quite unpleasant to the teachers  i wish they would give them all to me said ethel but i do hope mrs ledwich will have patience with them for they are only to be gained gently  the visitors took their leave and the two sisters began exclaimingethel at their dislike of her proteges and flora at what they had said of norman and you ethel how could you go and tell them we were surprised and norman thought it was hard on the other boys theyll have it all over the town that he got it unjustly and knows it as they say already it was partiality of mr everards  oh no no they never can be so bad cried ethel they must have understood better that it was his noble humility and generosity  they understand anything noble no indeed they think every one like their own beautiful brother i knew what they came for all the time they wanted to know whether norman was able to work these holidays and you told them the very thing they wanted to hear how they will rejoice with that harvey and make sure of the randall  oh no no cried ethel norman must get that  i dont think he will said flora losing all this time while they are working it cannot be helped of course but it is a great pity  i almost wish he had not been put up at all if it is to end in this way said ethel it is very provoking and to have them triumphing as they will theres no bearing it  norman certainly is not at all well poor fellow said flora and i suppose he wants rest but i wish papa would let him do what he can it would be much better for him than moping about as he is always doing now and the disappointment of losing his place will be grievous though now he fancies he does not care for it  i wonder when he will ever care for anything again all i read and tell him only seems to tease him though he tries to thank me  there is a strange apathy about him said flora but i believe it is chiefly for want of exertion i should like to rouse him if papa would let me i know i could by telling him how these andersons are reckoning on his getting down if he does i shall be ready to run away that i may never meet any one here again  ethel was very unhappy till she was able to pour all this trouble out to margaret and worked herself almost into crying about normans being passed by that harvey and his sisters exulting and papa being vexed and norman losing time and not caring  there you are wrong said margaret norman did care very much and it was not till he had seen clearly that it was a matter of duty to do as papa thought right and not agitate his mind about his chances of keeping up that he could bear to give up his work and she told ethel a little of what had passed  ethel was much struck but oh margaret it is very hard just to have him put up for the sake of being put down and pleasing the andersons  dear ethel why should you mind so much about the andersons may they not care about their brother as we do for ours  such a brother to care about said ethel  but i suppose they may like him the best said margaret smiling  i suppose they do said ethel grudgingly but still i cannot bear to see norman doing nothing and i know harvey anderson will beat him  surely you had rather he did nothing than made himself ill  to be sure but i wish it wasnt so  yes but ethel whose doing is his getting into this state  ethel looked grave it was wrong of me said she but then papa is not sure that greek would hurt him  not sure but he thinks it not wise to run the risk but ethel dear why are you so bent on his being dux at all costs  it would be horrid if he was not  dont you remember you used to say that outward praise or honour was not to be cared for as long as one did ones duty and that it might be a temptation  yes i know i did said ethel faltering but that was for oneself  it is harder i think to feel so about those we care for said margaret but after all this is just what will show whether our pride in norman is the right true loving pride or whether it is only the family vanity of triumphing over the andersons  ethel hung her head theres some of that she said but it is not all noi dont want to triumph over them nobody would do that  not outwardly perhaps but in their hearts  i cant tell said ethel but it is the being triumphed over that i cannot bear  perhaps this is all a lesson in humility for us said margaret it is teaching us whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted  ethel was silent for some little space then suddenly exclaimed and you think he will really be put down  margaret seemed to have been talking with little effect but she kept her patience and answered i cannot guess ethel but ill tell you one thingi think theres much more chance if he comes to his work fresh and vigorous after a rest than if he went on dulling himself with it all this time  with which ethel was so far appeased that she promised to think as little as she could of the andersons and a walk with richard to cocksmoor turned the current of her thoughts they had caught some more sundayschool children by the help of margarets broth but it was uphill work the servants did not like such guests in the kitchen and they were still less welcome at school  what do you think i heard ethel said flora the next sunday as they joined each other in the walk from school to church i heard miss graves say to miss boulder i declare i must remonstrate i undertook to instruct a national not a ragged school and then miss boulder shook out her fine watered silk and said it positively is improper to place ladies in contact with such squalid objects  ladies cried ethel a stationers daughter and a bankers clerks why do they come to teach at school at all  because our example makes it genteel said flora  i hope you did something more in hopes of making it genteel  i caught one of your ragged regiment with her frock gaping behind and pinned it up such rags as there were under it oh ethel  which was it  that merry irishlooking child i dont know her name  oh it is a real charming irish name una mcarthy i am so glad you did it flora i hope they were ashamed  i doubt whether it will do good we are sure of our station and can do anythingthey are struggling to be ladies  but we ought not to talk of them any more flora here we are almost at the churchyard  the tuesday of this week was appointed for the visit of the london surgeon sir matthew fleet and the expectation caused dr may to talk much to margaret of old times and the days of is courtship when it had been his favourite project that his friend and fellowstudent should marry flora mackenzie and there had been a promising degree of liking but mat had been obliged to be prudent and had ended by never marrying at all this the doctor as well as his daughters believed was for the sake of aunt flora and thus the girls were a good deal excited about his coming almost as much on his own account as because they considered him as the arbiter of margarets fate he only came in time for a seven oclock dinner and margaret did not see him that night but heard enough from her sisters when they came up to tell the history of their guest and of the first set dinner when flora had acted as lady of the house the dinner it appeared had gone off very well flora had managed admirably and the only mishap was some awkward carving of ethels which had caused the dish to be changed with norman as to the guest flora said he was very goodlooking and agreeable ethel abruptly pronounced i am very glad aunt flora married uncle arnott instead  i cant think why said flora i never saw a person of pleasanter manners  did they talk of old times said margaret  no said ethel that was the thing  you would not have them talk of those matters in the middle of dinner said flora  no again said ethel but papa has a waydont you know margaret how one can tell in a moment if it is company talk  what was the conversation about said margaret  they talked over some of their fellowstudents said flora  yes said ethel and then when papa told him that beautiful history of dr spencer going to take care of those poor emigrants in the fever what do you think he said yes spencer was always doing extravagant things fancy that to papa who can hardly speak of it without having to wipe his spectacles and who so longs to hear of dr spencer  and what did he say  nothing so flora and sir matthew got to pictures and all that sort of thing and it was all company talk after that  most entertaining in its kind said flora butoh norman as he enteredwhy they are not out of the diningroom yet  no they are talking of some new invention and most likely will not come for an hour  are you going to bed  papa followed me out of the diningroom to tell me to do so after tea  then sit down there and ill go and make some and let it come up with margarets come ethel goodnight norman is your head aching tonight  not much now i have got out of the diningroom  it would have been wiser not to have gone in said flora leaving the room  it was not the dinner but the man said norman it is incomprehensible to me how my father could take to him id as soon have harvey anderson for a friend  you are like me said ethel in being glad he is not our uncle  he presume to think of falling in love with aunt flora cried norman indignantly  why what is the matter with him asked margaret i cant find much ground for ethels dislike and flora is pleased  she did not hear the worst nor you either ethel said norman i could not stand the cold hard way he spoke of hospital patients i am sure he thinks poor people nothing but a study and rich ones nothing but a profit and his half sneers but what i hated most was his way of avoiding discussions when he saw he had said what would not go down with papa he did not honestly stand up to the point and argue it out but seemed to have no mind of his own and to be only talking to please papabut not knowing how to do it he understand my father indeed  normans indignation had quite revived him and margaret was much entertained with the conflicting opinions the next was richards when he came in late to wish her goodnight after he had been attending on sir matthews examination of his fathers arm he did nothing but admire the surgeons delicacy of touch and understanding of the case his view agreeing much better with dr mays own than that with mr wards dr may had never been entirely satisfied with the present mode of treatment and richard was much struck by hearing him say in answer to sir matthew that he knew his recovery might have been more speedy and less painful if he had been able to attend to it at first or to afford time for being longer laid up a change of treatment was now to be made likely soon to relieve the pain to be less tedious and troublesome and to bring about a complete cure in three or four months at latest in hearing such tidings there could be little thought of the person who brought them and margaret did not till the last moment learn that richard thought sir matthew very clever and sensible and certain to understand her case her last visitor was her father asleep margaret i thought i had better go to norman first in case he should be awake  was he  yes but his pulse is better tonight he was lying awake to hear what fleet thought of me i suppose richard told you  yes dear papa what a comfort it is  those fellows in london do keep up to the mark but i would not be there for something i never saw a man so altered however if he can only do for you as wellbut it is of no use talking about it i may trust you to keep yourself calm my dear  i am tryingindeed i am dear papa if you could help being anxious for methough i know it is worse for you for i only have to lie still and you have to settle for me but i have been thinking how well off i am able to enjoy so much and be employed all day long it is nothing to compare with that poor girl you told me of and you need not be unhappy for me i have some verses to say over to myself tonight           o lord my god do thou thy holy will                 i will lie still         i will not stir lest i forsake thine arm                 and break the charm         that lulls me clinging to my fathers breast                 in perfect rest   is not that comfortable  my childmy dear childi will say no more lest i should break your sweet peace with my impatience i will strive for the same temper my margaret bless you dearest goodnight  after a night spent in waking intervals of such thoughts margaret found the ordinary morning and the talk she could not escape somewhat oppressive her brothers and sisters disturbed her by their open expressions of hope and anxiety she dreaded to have the balance of tranquillity overset and then blamed herself for selfishness in not being as ready to attend to them as usual ethel and norman came up after breakfast their aversion by no means decreased by further acquaintance ethel was highly indignant at the tone in which he had exclaimed what may have you one as young as this on discovering the existence of the baby and when norman observed that was not so atrocious either she proceeded you did not hear the contemptuous compassionate tone when he asked papa what he meant to do with all these boys  im glad he has not to settle said norman  papa said harry was to be a sailor and he said it was a good way to save expenses of educationa good thing  no doubt said norman he thinks papa only wants to get rid of us or if not that it is an amiable weakness  but i cant see anything so shocking in this said margaret  it is not the words said norman the look and tone convey it but there are different opinions flora is quite smitten with him he talks so politely to her  and blanche said ethel the little affected pussycat made a set at him bridled and talked in her mincing voice with all her airs and made him take a great deal of notice of her  nurse here came to prepare for the surgeons visit  it was over and margaret awaited the judgment sir matthew had spoken hopefully to her but she feared to fasten hopes on what might have no meaning and could rely on nothing till she had seen her father who never kept back his genuine pinion and would least of all from her she found her spirits too much agitated to talk to her sisters and quietly begged them to let her be quite alone till the consultation was over and she lay trying to prepare herself to submit thankfully whether she might be bidden to resign herself to helplessness or to let her mind open once more to visions of joyous usefulness every step she hoped would prove to be her fathers approach and the longest hour of her life was that before he entered her room his face said that the tidings were good and yet she could not ask  well margaret i am glad we had him down he thinks you may get about again though it may be a long time first  does heoh papa and the colour spread over her face as she squeezed his hand very fast  he has known the use of the limbs return almost suddenly after even a year or two and dr may gave her the grounds of the opinion and an account of other like cases which he said had convinced him though my poor child he said i feared the harm i had done you was irremediable but thanks he turned away his face and the clasp of their hands spoke the rest  presently he told margaret that she was no longer to be kept prostrate but she was to do exactly as was most comfortable to her avoiding nothing but fatigue she might be lifted to the sofa the next day and if that agreed with her she might be carried downstairs  this in itself after she had been confined to her bed for three months was a release from captivity and all the brothers and sisters rejoiced as if she was actually on her feet again richard betook himself to constructing a readingframe for the sofa harry tormented miss winter by insisting on a holiday for the others and gained the day by an appeal to his father then declared he should go and tell mr wilmot the good news and norman quite enlivened took up his hat and said he would come too  in all his joy however dr may could not cease bewailing the alteration in his old friend and spent half the evening in telling margaret how different he had once been in terms little less measured than ethels i never saw such a change mat fleet was one of the most warm openhearted fellows in the world up to anything i can hardly believe he is the sameturned into a mere machine with a moving spring of selfinterest i dont believe he cares a rush for any living thing except for your sake margaret i wish i had never seen him again and only remembered him as he was at edinburgh as i remembered dear old spencer it is a grievous thing ruined entirely no doubt that london life must be tryingthe constant change and bewilderment of patients preventing much individual care and interest it must be very hardening no family ties either nothing to look to but pushing his way yes theres great excuse for poor mat i never knew fully till now the blessing it was that your dear mother was willing to take me so early and that this place was open to me with all its home connections and interests i am glad i never had anything to do with london  and when he was alone with norman he could not help saying norman my boy im more glad than ever you yielded to me about your greek these holidays and for the reason you did take care the love of rising and pushing never gets hold of you theres nothing that faster changes a man from his better self  meanwhile sir matthew fleet had met another old college friend in london and was answering his inquiries for the dick may of ancient times  poor may i never saw a man so thrown away with his talent and acuteness he might be the most eminent man of his day if he had only known how to use them but he was always the same careless softhearted fellow never knowing how to do himself any good and he is the same still not a day older nor wiser it was a fatal thing for him that there was that country practice ready for him to step into and even of that he does not make as good a thing as he might of course he married early and there he is left a widower with a house full of childrenscreaming babies and great tall sons growing up and he without a notion what he shall do with them as heedless as eversaving nothing of course i always knew it was what he would come to if he would persist in burying himself in that wretched little country town but i hardly thought after all he has gone through to find him such a mere boy still and yet he is one of the cleverest men i ever metwith such talent and such thorough knowledge of his profession that it does one good to hear him talk poor may i am sorry for him he might have been anything but that early marriage and country practice were the ruin of him     chapter xiv         to thee dear maid each kindly wile        was known that elder sisters know      to check the unseasonable smile        with warning hand and serious brow       from dream to dream with her to rove        like fairy nurse with hermit child      teach her to think to pray to love        make grief less bitter joy less wild                           lines on a monument at lichfield   sir matthew fleets visit seemed like a turningpoint with the may family rousing and giving them revived hopes norman began to shake off his extreme languor and depression the doctor was relieved from much of the wearing suffering from his hurt and his despondency as to margarets ultimate recovery had been driven away the experiment of taking her up succeeded so well that on sunday she was fully attired fit to receive company as she lay on the sofa there seemed an advance toward recovery much sweet coquetry was expended in trying to look her best for her father and her best was very well for though the brilliant bloom of health was gone her cheeks had not lost their pretty rounded contour and still had some rosiness while her large bright blue eyes smiled and sparkled a screen shut out the rest of the room making a sort of little parlour round the fire where sundry of the family were visiting her after coming home from church in the afternoon ethel was in a vehement state of indignation at what had that day happened at school did you ever hear anything like it when the point was to teach the poor things to be christians to turn them back because their hair was not regulation length  whats that who did said dr may coming in from his own room where he had heard a few words  mrs ledwich she sent back three of the cocksmoor children this morning it seems she warned them last sunday without saying a word to us  sent them back from church said the doctor  not exactly from church said margaret  it is the same in effect said ethel to turn them from school for if they did try to go alone the pewopeners would drive them out  it is a wretched state of things said dr may who never wanted much provocation to begin storming about parish affairs when i am churchwarden again ill see what can be done about the seats but its no sort of use while ramsden goes on as he does  now my poor children are done for said ethel they will never come again and its horrid papa there are lots of town children who wear immense long plaits of hair and mrs ledwich never interferes with them it is entirely to drive the poor cocksmoor ones awayfor nothing else and all out of fanny andersons chatter  ethel my dear said margaret pleadingly  didnt i tell you margaret how as soon as flora knew what mrs ledwich was going to do she went and told her this was the childrens only chance and if we affronted them for a trifle there would be no hope of getting them back she said she was sorry if we were interested for them but rules must not be broken and when flora spoke of all who do wear long hair unmolested she shuffled and said for the sake of the teachers as well as the other children rags and dirt could not be allowed and then she brought up the old story of miss boulders pencil though she has found it again and ended by saying fanny anderson told her it was a serious annoyance to the teachers and she was sure we should agree with her that something was due to voluntary assistants and subscribers  i am afraid there has been a regular set at them said margaret and perhaps they are troublesome poor things  as if schoolkeeping were for luxury said dr may it is the worst thing i have heard of mrs ledwich yet ones blood boils to think of those poor children being cast off because our fine young ladies are too grand to teach them the clergyman leaving his work to a set of conceited women and they turning their backs on ignorance when it comes to their door voluntary subscribers indeed ive a great mind ill be one no longer  oh papa that would not be fair began ethel but margaret knew he would not act on this squeezed her hand and silenced her  one thing ive said and ill hold to it continued dr may if they outvote wilmot again in your ladies committee ill have no more to do with them as sure as my names dick may it is a scandal the way things are done here  papa said richard who had all the time been standing silent ethel and i have been thinking if you approved whether we could not do something towards teaching the cocksmoor children and breaking them in for the sundayschool  what a bound ethels heart gave and how full of congratulation and sympathy was the pressure of margarets hand  what did you think of doing said the doctor ethel burned to reply but her sisters hand admonished her to remember her compact richard answered we thought of trying to get a room and going perhaps once or twice a week to give them a little teaching it would be little enough but it might do something towards civilising them and making them wish for more  how do you propose to get a room  i have reconnoitred and i think i know a cottage with a tolerable kitchen which i dare say we might hire for an afternoon for sixpence  ethel unable to bear it any longer threw herself forward and sitting on the ground at her fathers feet exclaimed oh papa papa do say we may  whats all this about said the doctor surprised  oh you dont know how i have thought of it day and night these two months  what ethel have a fancy for two whole months and the whole house not hear of it said her father with a rather provoking look of incredulity  richard was afraid of bothering you and wouldnt let me but do speak papa may we  i dont see any objection  she clasped her hands in ecstasy thank you thank you papa oh ritchie oh margaret cried she in a breathless voice of transport  you have worked yourself up to a fine pass said the doctor patting the agitated girl fondly as she leaned against his knee remember slow and steady  ive got richard to help me said ethel  sufficient guarantee said her father smiling archly as he looked up to his son whose fair face had coloured deep red you will keep the unready in order ritchie  he does said margaret he has taken her education into his hands and i really believe he has taught her to hold up her frock and stick in pins  and to know her right hand from her left eh ethel well you deserve some credit then suppose we ask mr wilmot to tea and talk it over  oh thank you papa when shall it be tomorrow  yes if you like i have to go to the towncouncil meeting and am not going into the country so i shall be in early  thank you oh how very nice  and what about cost do you expect to rob me  if you would help us said ethel with an odd shy manner we meant to make what we have go as far as may be but mine is only fifteen and sixpence  well you must make interest with margaret for the turnout of my pocket tomorrow  thank you we are very much obliged said the brother and sister earnestly that is more than we expected  ha dont thank too soon suppose tomorrow should be a blank day  oh it wont said ethel i shall tell norman to make you go to paying people  theres avarice said the doctor but look you here ethel if youll take my advice youll make your bargain for tuesday i have a note appointing me to call at abbotstoke grange on mr rivers at twelve oclock on tuesday what do you think of that ethel an old banker rich enough for his daughter to curl her hair in banknotes if i were you id make a bargain for him  if he had nothing the matter with him and i only got one guinea out of him  prudence well it may be wiser  ethel ran up to her room hardly able to believe that the mighty proposal was made and it had been so readily granted that it seemed as if richards caution had been vain in making such a delay that even margaret had begun to fear that the street of byandby was leading to the house of never now however it was plain that he had been wise opportunity was everything at another moment their father might have been harassed and oppressed and unable to give his mind to concerns which now he could think of with interest and richard could not have caught a more favourable conjuncture  ethel was in a wild state of felicity all that evening and the next day very unlike her brother who dismayed at the open step he had taken shrank into himself and in his shyness dreaded the discussion in the evening and would almost have been relieved if mr wilmot had been unable to accept the invitation so quiet and grave was he that ethel could not get him to talk over the matter at all with her and she was obliged to bestow all her transports and grand projects on flora or margaret when she could gain their ears besides conning them over to herself as an accompaniment to her lessons by which means she tried miss winters patience almost beyond measure but she cared notshe saw a gathering school and rising church which eclipsed all thought of present inattentions and gaucheries she monopolised margaret in the twilight and rhapsodised to her hearts content talking faster and faster and looking more and more excited margaret began to feel a little overwhelmed and while answering yes at intervals was considering whether ethel had not been flying about in an absent inconsiderate mood all day and whether it would seem unkind to damp her ardour by giving her a hint that she was relaxing her guard over herself before margaret had steeled herself ethel was talking of a story she had read of a place something like cocksmoor margaret was not ready with her recollection and ethel saying it was in a magazine in the drawingroom chiffonier declared she would fetch it  margaret knew what it was to expect her visitors to return in one moment and with a nowornever feeling she began ethel dear wait but ethel was too impetuous to attend ill be back in a twinkling she called out and down she flew in her speed whisking away without seeing it the basket with margarets knitting and all her notes and papers which lay scattered on the floor far out of reach vexing margaret at first and then making her grieve at her own impatient feeling  ethel was soon in the drawingroom but the right number of the magazine was not quickly forthcoming and in searching she became embarked in another story just then aubrey whose stout legs were apt to carry him into every part of the house where he was neither expected nor wanted marched in at the open door trying by dint of vehement gestures to make her understand in his imperfect speech something that he wanted very particularly troublesome she thought him more especially as she could not make him out otherwise than that he wanted her to do something with the newspaper and the fire she made a boat for him with an old newspaper a very hasty and frail performance and told him to sail it on the carpet and be mr ernescliffe going away and she thought him thus safely disposed of returning to her book and her search with her face to the cupboard and her book held up to catch the light she was soon lost in her story and thought of nothing more till suddenly roused by her fathers voice in the hall loud and peremptory with alarm aubrey put that down she looked and beheld aubrey brandishing a great flaming paperhe dropped it at the exclamationit fell burning on the carpet aubreys white pinafore ethel was springing up but in her cramped twisted position she could not do so quickly and even as he called her father strode by her snatched at aubreys merino frock which he crushed over the scarcely lighted pinafore and trampled out the flaming paper with his foot it was a moment of dreadful fright but the next assured them that no harm was done  ethel cried the doctor are you mad what were you thinking of  aubrey here recollecting himself enough to be frightened at his fathers voice and manner burst into loud cries the doctor pressed him closer on his breast caressed and soothed him ethel stood by pale and transfixed with horror her father was more angry with her than she had ever seen him and with reason as she knew as she smelled the singeing and saw a large burnt hole in aubreys pinafore while the front of his frock was scorched and brown dr mays words were not needed what could make you let him  i didnt see she faltered  didnt see didnt look didnt think didnt care thats it ethel tis very hard one cant trust you in a room with the child any more than the baby himself his frock perfect tinder he would have been burned to a cinder if i had not come in   aubrey roared afresh and dr may kissing and comforting him gathered him up in his left arm and carried him away looking back at the door to say theres no bearing it ill put a stop to all schools and greek if it is to lead to this and make you good for nothing  ethel was too much terrified to know where she was or anything but that she had let her little brother run into fearful peril and grievously angered her father she was afraid to follow him and stood still annihilated and in despair till roused by his return then with a stifled sob she exclaimed oh papa and could get no further for a gush of tears  but the anger of the shock of terror was over and dr may was sorry for her tears though still he could not but manifest some displeasure yes ethel he said it was a frightful thing and he could not but shudder again one moment later it is an escape to be for ever thankful forpoor little fellowbut ethel ethel do let it be a warning to you  oh i hopeill try sobbed ethel  you have said you would try before  i know i have said ethel choked if i could but  poor child said dr may sadly then looking earnestly at her ethel my dear i am afraid of its being with you asas it has been with me he spoke very low and drew her close to him i grew up thinking my inbred heedlessness a sort of grace so to say rather manlythe reverse of finikin i was spoiled as a boy and my maggie carried on the spoiling by never letting me feel its effects by the time i had sense enough to regret this as a fault i had grown too old for changing of ingrain longnurtured habitsperhaps i never wished it really you have seen and his voice was nearly inaudible what my carelessness has come tolet that suffice at least as a lesson that may spare youwhat your father must feel as long as he lives  he pressed his hand tightly on her shoulder and left her without letting her see his face shocked and bewildered she hurried upstairs to margaret she threw herself on her knees felt her arms round her and heard her kind soothing and then in broken words told how dreadful it had been and how kind papa had been and what he had said which was now the uppermost thought oh margaret margaret how very terrible it is and does papa really think so  i believe he does whispered margaret  how can he can he bear it said ethel clasping her hands oh it is enough to kill onei cant think why it did not  he bears it said margaret because he is so very good that help and comfort do come to him dear papa he bears up because it is right and for our sakes and he has a sort of rest in that perfect love they had for each other he knows how she would wish him to cheer up and look to the end and support and comfort are given to him i know they are but oh ethel it does make one tremble and shrink to think what he has been going through this autumn especially when i hear him moving about late at night and now and then comes a heavy groanwhenever any especial care has been on his mind  ethel was in great distress to have grieved him again said she and just as he seemed better and brighter everything i do turns out wrong and always will i cant do anything well by any chance  yes you can when you mind what you are about  but i never canim like him every one says so and he says the heedlessness is ingrain and cant be got rid of  ethel i dont really think he could have told you so  im sure he said ingrain  well i suppose it is part of his nature and that you have inherited it but margaret paused and ethel exclaimed  he said his was longnurtured yes margaret you guessed right and he said he could not change it and no more can i  surely ethel you have not had so many years you are fifteen instead of fortysix and it is more a womans work than a mans to be careful you need not begin to despair you were growing much better richard said so and so did miss winter  whats the use of it if in one moment it is as bad as ever and today of all days in the year just when papa had been so very very kind and given me more than i asked  do you know ethel i was thinking whether dear mamma would not say that was the reason you were so happy that perhaps you were thrown off your guard  i should not wonder if that was it said ethel thoughtfully you know it was a sort of probation that richard put me on i was to learn to be steady before he spoke to papa and now it seemed to be all settled and right and perhaps i forgot i was to be careful still  i think it was something of the kind i was a little afraid before and i wish i had tried to caution you but i did not like to seem unkind  i wish you had said ethel dear little aubrey oh if papa had not been there and i cannot think how as it was he could contrive to put the fire out with his one hand and not hurt himself margaret it was terrible how could i mind so little did you see how his frock was singed  yes papa showed it to me how can we be thankful enough one thing i hope that aubrey was well frightened poor little boy  i know i see now cried ethel he must have wanted me to make the fire blaze up as richard did one evening when we came in and found it low i remember aubrey clapping his hands and shouting at the flame but my head was in that unhappy story and i never had sense to put the things together and reflect that he would try to do it himself i only wanted to get him out of my way dear little fellow oh dear how bad it was of me all from being uplifted and my head turned as it used to be when we were happier oh i wish mr wilmot was not coming  ethel sat for a long time with her head hidden in margarets pillows and her hand clasped by her good elder sister at last she looked up and said oh margaret i am so unhappy i see the whole meaning of it now do you not when papa gave his consent at last i was pleased and set up and proud of my plans i never recollected what a silly foolish girl i am and how unfit i thought mr wilmot would think great things of itit was all wrong and selfsatisfied i never prayed at all that it might turn out well and so now it wont  dearest ethel i dont see that perhaps it will do all the better for your being humbled about it now if you were wild and high flying it would never go right  its hope is in richard said ethel  so it is said margaret  i wish mr wilmot was not coming tonight said ethel again it would serve me right if papa were to say nothing about it  ethel lingered with her sister till harry and mary came up with margarets tea and summoned her and she crept downstairs and entered the room so quietly that she was hardly perceived behind her boisterous brother she knew her eyes were in no presentable state and cast them down and shrank back as mr wilmot shook her hand and greeted her kindly  mr wilmot had been wont to come to tea whenever he had anything to say to dr or mrs may which was about once in ten or twelve days he was marys godfather and their most intimate friend in the town and he had often been with them both as friend and clergyman through their troubleno later than christmas day he had come to bring the feast of that day to margaret in her sickroom indeed it had been chiefly for the sake of the mays that he had resolved to spend the holidays at stoneborough taking the care of abbotstoke while his brother the vicar went to visit their father this was however the first time he had come in his old familiar way to spend an evening and there was something in the resumption of former habits that painfully marked the change  ethel on coming in found flora making tea her father leaning back in his great chair in silence richard diligently cutting bread and blanche sitting on mr wilmots knee chattering fast and confidentially flora made harry dispense the cups and called every one to their places ethel timidly glanced at her fathers face as he rose and came into the light she thought the lines and hollows were more marked than ever and that he looked fatigued and mournful and she felt cut to the heart but he began to exert himself and to make conversation not however about cocksmoor but asking mr wilmot what his brother thought of his new squire mr rivers  he likes him very much said mr wilmot he is a very pleasing person particularly kindhearted and gentle and likely to do a great deal for the parish they have been giving away beef and blankets at a great rate this christmas  what family is there asked flora  one daughter about ethels age is there with her governess he has been twice married and the first wife left a son who is in the dragoons i believe this girls mother was lord coshams daughter  so the talk lingered on without much interest or life it was rather keeping from saying nothing than conversation and no one was without the sensation that she was missing round whom all had been free and joyousnot that she had been wont to speak much herself but nothing would go on smoothly or easily without her so long did this last that ethel began to think her father meant to punish her by not beginning the subject that night and though she owned that she deserved it she could not help being very much disappointed  at length however her father began we wanted you to talk over a scheme that these young ones have been concocting you see i am obliged to keep richard at home this next termit wont do to have no one in the house to carry poor margaret we cant do without him anyway so he and ethel have a scheme of seeing what can be done for that wretched place cocksmoor  indeed said mr wilmot brightening and looking interested it is sadly destitute it would be a great thing if anything could be done for it you have brought some children to school already i think i saw some roughlooking boys who said they came from cocksmoor  this embarked the doctor in the history of the ladies being too fine to teach the poor cocksmoor girls which he told with kindling vehemence and indignation growing more animated every moment as he stormed over the wonted subject of the bad system of managementladies committee negligent incumbent insufficient clergy misappropriated titheswhile mr wilmot who had mourned over it within himself a hundred times already and was doing a curates work on sufferance with no pay and little but mistrust from mr ramsden and absurd false reports among the more foolish part of the town sat listening patiently glad to hear the doctor in his old strain though it was a hopeless matter for discussion and ethel dreaded that the lamentation would go on till bedtime and cocksmoor be quite forgotten  after a time they came safely back to the project and richard was called on to explain ethel left it all to him and he with rising colour and quiet unhesitating though diffident manner detailed designs that showed themselves to have been well matured mr wilmot heard cordially approved and as all agreed that no time was to be lost while the holidays lasted he undertook to speak to mr ramsden on the subject the next morning and if his consent to their schemes could be gained to come in the afternoon to walk with richard and ethel to cocksmoor and set their affairs in order all the time ethel said not a word except when referred to by her brother but when mr wilmot took leave he shook her hand warmly as if he was much pleased with her ah she thought if he knew how ill i have behaved it is all show and hollowness with me  she did not know that mr wilmot thought her silence one of the best signs for the plan nor how much more doubtful he would have thought her perseverance if he had seen her wild and vehement as it was he was very much pleased and when the doctor came out with him into the hall he could not help expressing his satisfaction in richards welljudged and sensiblydescribed project  ay ay said the doctor theres much more in the boy than i used to think hes a capital fellow and more like his mother than any of them  he is said mr wilmot there was a just wellweighed sense and soberness in his plans that put me in mind of her every moment  dr may gave his hand a squeeze full of feeling and went up to tell margaret she on the first opportunity told richard and made him happier than he had been for months not so much in mr wilmots words as in his fathers assent to and pleasure in them     chapter xv         pitch thy behaviour low thy projects high        so shalt thou humble and magnanimous be      sink not in spirit who aimeth at the sky        shoots higher much than he that means a tree          a grain of glory mixed with humbleness          cures both a fever and lethargicness                                              herbert   norman do you feel up to a long days work said dr may on the following morning i have to set off after breakfast to see old mrs gould and to be at abbotstoke grange by twelve then i thought of going to fordholm and getting miss cleveland to give us some luncheonthere are some poor people on the way to look at and that girl on farview hill and theres another place to call in at coming home youll have a good deal of sitting in the carriage holding whitefoot so if you think you shall be cold or tired dont scruple to say so and ill take adams to drive me  no thank you said norman briskly this frost is famous  it will turn to rain i expectit is too white said the doctor looking out at the window how will you get to cocksmoor good people  ethel wont believe it rains unless it is very bad said richard  norman set out with his father and prosperously performed the expedition arriving at abbotstoke grange at the appointed hour  ha said the doctor as the iron gates of ornamental scrollwork were swung back theres a considerable change in this place since i was here last well kept up indeed not a dead leaf left under the old walnuts and the grass looks as smooth as if they had a dozen gardeners rolling it every day  and the drive said norman more like a garden walk than a road but oh what a splendid cedar  isnt it i remember that as long as i remember anything all this fine rolling of turf and trimming up of the place does not make much difference to you old fellow does it you dont look altered since i saw you last when old jervis was letting the place go to rack and ruin so they have a new entrancevery handsome conservatoryflowersthe banker does things in style there as norman helped him off with his plaid wrap yourself up well dont get cold the sun is gone in and i should not wonder if the rain were coming after all ill not be longer than i can help  dr may disappeared from his sons sight through the conservatory where through the plateglass the exotics looked so fresh and perfumy that norman almost fancied that the scent reached him how much poor margaret would enjoy one of those camellias thought he and these people have bushels of them for mere show if i were papa i should be tempted to be like beautys father and carry off one how she would admire it  norman had plenty of time to meditate on the camellias and then to turn and speculate on the age of the cedar whether it could have been planted by the monks of stoneborough abbey to whom the grange had belonged brought from lebanon by a pilgrim perhaps and then he tried to guess at the longevity of cedars and thought of asking margaret the botanist of the family then he yawned moved the horse a little about opined that mr rivers must be very prosy or have some abstruse complaint considered the sky and augured rain buttoned another button of his rough coat and thought of miss clevelands dinner then he thought there was a very sharp wind and drove about till he found a sheltered place on the lee side of the great cedar looked up at it and thought it would be a fine subject for verses if mr wilmot knew of it and then proceeded to consider what he should make of them  in the midst he was suddenly roused by the deeptoned note of a dog and beheld a large black newfoundland dog leaping about the horse in great indignation rollo rollo called a clear young voice and he saw two ladles returning from a walk rollo at the first call galloped back to his mistress and was evidently receiving an admonition and promising good behaviour the two ladies entered the house while he lay down on the step with his lionlike paw hanging down watching norman with a brilliant pair of hazel eyes norman after a little more wondering when mr rivers would have done with his father betook himself to civil demonstrations to the creature who received them with dignity and presently after acknowledging with his tail various whispers of good old fellow and here old rollo having apparently satisfied himself that the young gentleman was respectable he rose and vouchsafed to stand up with his forepaws in the gig listening amiably to normans delicate flatteries norman even began to hope to allure him into jumping on the seat but a great bell rang and rollo immediately turned round and dashed off at full speed to some back region of the house so old fellow you know what the dinnerbell means thought norman i hope mr rivers is hungry too miss cleveland will have eaten up her whole luncheon if this old bore wont let my father go soon i hope he is desperately illtis his only excuse heigh ho i must jump out to warm my feet soon there theres a drop of rain well theres no end to it i wonder what ethel is doing about cocksmoor it is setting in for a wet afternoon and norman disconsolately put up his umbrella  at last dr may and another gentleman were seen in the conservatory and norman gladly proceeded to clear the seat but dr may called out jump out norman mr rivers is so kind as to ask us to stay to luncheon  with boyish shrinking from strangers norman privately wished mr rivers at jericho as he gave the reins to a servant and entered the conservatory where a kindly hand was held out to him by a gentleman of about fifty with a bald smooth forehead soft blue eyes and gentle pleasant face is this your eldest son said he turning to dr mayand the manner of both was as if they were already well acquainted no this is my second the eldest is not quite such a longlegged fellow said dr may and then followed the question addressed to norman himself where he was at school  at stoneborough said norman a little amused at the thought how angry ethel and harry would be that the paragraph of the county paper where n w may was recorded as prizeman and foremost in the examination had not penetrated even to abbotstoke grange or rather to its owners memory  however his father could not help adding he is the head of the schoola thing we stoneborough men think much of  this and mr riverss civil answer made norman so hot that he did not notice much in passing through a hall full of beautiful vases stuffed birds busts etc tastefully arranged and he did not look up till they were entering a handsome diningroom where a small square table was laid out for luncheon near a noble fire  the two ladies were there and mr rivers introduced them as his daughter and mrs larpent it was the most luxurious meal that norman had ever seen the plate the porcelain and all the appointments of the table so elegant and the viands all partaking of the christmas character and of a recherche delicate description quite new to him he had to serve as his fathers right hand and was so anxious to put everything as dr may liked it and without attracting notice that he hardly saw or listened till dr may began to admire a fine claude on the opposite wall and embarked in a picture discussion the doctor had much taste for art and had made the most of his opportunities of seeing paintings during his time of study at paris and in a brief tour to italy since that time few good pictures had come in his way and these were a great pleasure to him while mr rivers a regular connoisseur was delighted to meet with one who could so well appreciate them norman perceived how his father was enjoying the conversation and was much interested both by the sight of the first fine paintings he had ever seen and by the talk about their merits but the living things in the room had more of his attention and observation especially the young lady who sat at the head of the table a girl about his own age she was on a very small scale and seemed to him like a fairy in the airy lightness and grace of her movements and the blithe gladsomeness of her gestures and countenance form and features though perfectly healthful and brisk had the peculiar finish and delicacy of a miniature painting and were enhanced by the sunny glance of her dark soft smiling eyes her hair was in black silky braids and her dress with its gaiety of wellassorted colour was positively refreshing to his eye so long accustomed to the deep mourning of his sisters a little italian greyhound perfectly white was at her side making infinite variations of the line of beauty and grace with its elegant outline and slike tail as it raised its slender nose in hopes of a fragment of bread which she from time to time dispensed to it  luncheon over mr rivers asked dr may to step into his library and norman guessed that they had been talking all this time and had never come to the medical opinion however a good meal and a large fire made a great difference in his toleration and it was so new a scene that he had no objection to a prolonged waiting especially when mrs larpent said in a very pleasant tone will you come into the drawingroom with us  he felt somewhat as if he was walking in enchanted ground as he followed her into the large room the windows opening into the conservatory the whole air fragrant with flowers the furniture and ornaments so exquisite of their kind and all such a fit scene for the beautiful little damsel who with her slender dog by her side tripped on demurely and rather shyly but with a certain skipping lightness in her step a very tall overgrown schoolboy did norman feel himself for one bashful moment when he found himself alone with the two ladies but he was ready to be set at ease by mrs larpents goodnatured manner when she said something of rollos discourtesy he smiled and answered that he had made great friends with the fine old dog and spoke of his running off to the dinner at which little miss rivers laughed and looked delighted and began to tell of rollos perfections and intelligence norman ventured to inquire the name of the little italian and was told it was nipen because it had once stolen a cake much like the windspirit in feats on the fiord its beauty and tricks were duly displayed and a most beautiful australian parrot was exhibited mrs larpent taking full interest in the talk in so lively and gentle a manner and she and her pretty pupil evidently on such sisterlike terms that norman could hardly believe her to be the governess when he thought of miss winter  miss rivers took up some brown leaves which she was cutting out with scissors and shaping our holiday work said mrs larpent in answer to the inquiring look of normans eyes meta has been making a drawing for her papa and is framing it in leatherwork have you ever seen any  never and norman looked eagerly asking questions and watching while miss rivers cut out her ivy leaf and marked its veins and showed how she copied it from nature he thanked her saying i wanted to learn all about it for i thought it would be such nice work for my eldest sister  a glance of earnest interest from little metas bright eyes at her governess and mrs larpent in a kind soft tone that quite gained his heart asked is she the invalid  yes said norman new fancy work is a great gain to her  mrs larpents sympathetic questions and metas softening eyes gradually drew from him a great deal about margarets helpless state and her patience and capabilities and how every one came to her with all their cares and norman as he spoke mentally contrasted the life untouched by trouble and care led by the fair girl before him with that atmosphere of constant petty anxieties round her namesakes couch at years so nearly the same  how very good she must be said little meta quickly and softly and a tear was sparkling on her eyelashes  she is indeed said norman earnestly i dont know what papa would do but for her  mrs larpent asked kind questions whether his fathers arm was very painful and the hopes of its cure and he felt as if she was a great friend already thence they came to books norman had not read for months past but it happened that meta was just now reading woodstock with which he was of course familiar and both grew eager in discussing that and several others of one meta spoke in such terms of delight that norman thought it had been very stupid of him to let it lie on the table for the last fortnight without looking into it  he was almost sorry to see his father and mr rivers come in and hear the carriage ordered but they were not off yet though the rain was now only scotch mist mr rivers had his most choice little pictures still to display his beautiful early italian masters finished like illuminations and over these there was much lingering and admiring meta had whispered something to her governess who smiled and advanced to norman meta wishes to know if your sister would like to have a few flowers said she  no sooner said than done the door into the conservatory was opened and meta cutting sprays of beautiful geranium delicious heliotrope fragrant calycanthus deep blue tree violet and exquisite hothouse ferns perfect wonders to norman who at each addition to the bouquet exclaimed by turns oh thank you and how she will like it  her father reached a magnolia blossom from on high and the quick warm grateful emotion trembled in dr mays features and voice as he said it is very kind in you you have given my poor girl a great treat thank you with all my heart  margaret rivers cast down her eyes half smiled and shrank back thinking she had never felt anything like the lefthanded grasp so full of warmth and thankfulness it gave her confidence to venture on the one question on which she was bent her father was in the hall showing norman his greek nymph and lifting her eyes to dr mays face then casting them down she coloured deeper than ever as she said in a stammering whisper oh pleaseif you would tell medo you thinkis papa very ill  dr may answered in his softest most reassuring tones you need not be alarmed about him i assure you you must keep him from too much business he added smiling make him ride with you and not let him tire himself and i am sure you can be his best doctor  but do you think said meta earnestly looking updo you think he will be quite well again  you must not expect doctors to be absolute oracles said he i will tell you what i told himi hardly think his will ever be sound health again but i see no reason why he should not have many years of comfort and there is no cause for you to disquiet yourself on his accountyou have only to be careful of him  meta tried to say thank you but not succeeding looked imploringly at her governess who spoke for her thank you it is a great relief to have an opinion for we were not at all satisfied about mr rivers  a few words more and meta was skipping about like a sprite finding a basket for the flowersshe had another shake of the hand another grateful smile and thank you from the doctor and then as the carriage disappeared mrs larpent exclaimed what a very nice intelligent boy that was  particularly gentlemanlike said mr rivers very cleverthe head of the school as his father tells meand so modest and unassumingthough i see his father is very proud of him  oh i am sure they are so fond of each other said meta didnt you see his attentive ways to his father at luncheon and papa i am sure you must like dr may mr wilmots doctor as much as i said you would  he is the most superior man i have met with for a long time said mr rivers it is a great acquisition to find a man of such taste and acquirements in this country neighbourhood when there is not another who can tell a claude from a poussin i declare when once we began talking there was no leaving offi have not met a person of so much conversation since i left town i thought you would like to see him meta  i hope i shall know the miss mays some time or other  that is the prettiest little fairy i ever did see was dr mays remark as norman drove from the door  how goodnatured they are said norman i just said something about margaret and she gave me all these flowers how margaret will be delighted i wish the girls could see it all  so you got on well with the ladies did you  they were very kind to me it was very pleasant said norman with a tone of enjoyment that did his fathers heart good  i was glad you should come in such a curiosity shop is a sight and those pictures were some of them well worth seeing that was a splendid titian  that cast of the pallas of the parthenonhow beautiful it wasi knew it from the picture in smiths dictionary mr rivers said he would show me all his antiques if you would bring me again  i saw he liked your interest in them he is a good kindhearted dilettante sort of old man he has got all the talk of the literary cultivated society in london and must find it dullish work here  you liked him didnt you  he is very pleasant i found he knew my old friend benson whom i had not seen since we were at cambridge together and we got on that and other matters london people have an art of conversation not learned here and i dont know how the time slipped away but you must have been tolerably tired of waiting  not to signify said norman i only began to think he must be very ill i hope there is not much the matter with him  i cant say i am afraid there is organic disease but i think it may be kept quiet a good while yet and he may have a pleasant life for some time to come arranging his prints and petting his pretty daughter he has plenty to fall back upon  do you go there again  yes next week i am glad of it i shall like to have another look at that little madonna of hisit is the sort of picture that does one good to carry away in ones eye whay stop theres an old woman in here it is too late for fordholm but these cases wont wait  he went into the cottage and soon returned saying fine new blankets and a great kettle of soup and such praises of the ladies at the grange and at the next house it was the same story well tis no mockery now to tell the poor creatures they want nourishing food slices of meat and bottles of port wine rain down on abbotstoke  a far more talkative journey than usual ensued the discussion of the paintings and antiques was almost equally delightful to the father and son and lasted till about a mile from stoneborough they descried three figures in the twilight  ha how are you wilmot so you braved the rain ethel jump in called the doctor as norman drew up  i shall crowd youi shall hurt your arm papa thank you  no you wontjump intheres room for three threadpapers in one gig why wilmot your brother has a very jewel of a squire how did you fare  very well on the whole was mr wllmots answer while ethel scrambled in and tried to make herself small an art in which she was not very successful and norman gave an exclamation of horrified warning as she was about to step into the flowerbasket then she nearly tumbled out again in dismay and was relieved to find herself safely wedged in without having done any harm while her father called out to mr wilmot as they started i say you are coming back to tea with us  that cheerful tone and the kindness to herself were a refreshment and revival to ethel who was still sobered and shocked by her yesterdays adventure and by the sense of her fathers sorrowful displeasure expecting further to be scolded for getting in so awkwardly she did not venture to volunteer anything and even when he kindly said i hope you were prosperous in your expedition she only made answer in a very grave voice yes papa we have taken a very nice tidy room  what do you pay for it  fourpence for each time  well heres for you said dr may it is only two guineas today that banker at the grange beguiled us of our time but you had better close the bargain for him ethelhe will be a revenue for you for this winter at least  oh thank you papa was all ethel could say overpowered by his kindness and more repressed by what she felt so unmerited than she would have been by coldness she said few words and preferred listening to norman who began to describe their adventures at the grange  all her eagerness revived however as she sprang out of the carriage full of tidings for margaret and it was almost a race between her and norman to get upstairs and unfold their separate budgets  margarets lamp had just been lighted when they made their entrance norman holding the flowers on high  oh how beautiful how delicious for me where did you get them  from abbotstoke grange miss rivers sent them to you  how very kind what a lovely geranium and oh that fern i never saw anything so choice how came she to think of me  they asked me in because it rained and she was making the prettiest things leather leaves and flowers for picture frames i thought it was work that would just suit you and learned how to do it that made them ask about you and it ended by her sending you this nosegay  how very kind everybody is well ethel are you come home too  papa picked me up oh margaret we have found such a nice room a clean sanded kitchen  you never saw such a conservatory  and it is to be let to us for fourpence a time  the house is full of beautiful things pictures and statues only think of a real titian and a cast of the apollo  twenty children to begin with and richard is going to make some forms  mr rivers is going to show me all his casts  oh is he but only think how lucky we were to find such a nice woman mr wilmot was so pleased with her  norman found one story at a time was enough and relinquished the field contenting himself with silently helping margaret to arrange the flowers holding the basket for her and pleased with her gestures of admiration ethel went on with her history the first place we thought of would not do at all the woman said she would not take halfacrown a week to have a lot of children stabbling about as she called it so we went to another house and there was a very nice woman indeed mrs green with one little boy whom she wanted to send to school only it is too far she says she always goes to church at fordholm because it is nearer and she is quite willing to let us have the room so we settled it and next friday we are to begin papa has given us two guineas and that will pay for let me see a hundred and twentysix times and mr wilmot is going to give us some books and ritchie will print some alphabets we told a great many of the people and they are so glad old granny hall said well i never and told the girls they must be as good as gold now the gentlefolks was coming to teach them mr wilmot is coming with us every friday as long as the holidays last  ethel departed on her fathers coming in to ask margaret if she would like to have a visit from mr wilmot she enjoyed this very much and he sat there nearly an hour talking of many matters especially the cocksmoor scheme on which she was glad to hear his opinion at first hand  i am very glad you think well of it she said it is most desirable that something should be done for those poor people and richard would never act rashly but i have longed for advice whether it was right to promote ethels undertaking i suppose richard told you how bent on it she was long before papa was told of it  he said it was her great wish and had been so for a long time past  margaret in words more adequate to express the possession the project had gained of ethels ardent mind explained the whole history of it i do believe she looks on it as a sort of call said she and i have felt as if i ought not to hinder her and yet i did not know whether it was right at her age to let her undertake so much  i understand said mr wilmot but from what i have seen of ethel i should think you had decided rightly there seems to me to be such a spirit of energy in her that if she does not act she will either speculate and theorise or pine and prey on herself i do believe that hard homely work such as this schoolkeeping is the best outlet for what might otherwise run to extravagancemore especially as you say the hope of it has already been an incentive to improvement in home duties  that i am sure it has said margaret  moreover said mr wilmot i think you were quite right in thinking that to interfere with such a design was unsafe i do believe that a great deal of harm is done by prudent friends who dread to let young people do anything out of the common way and so force their aspirations to ferment and turn sour for want of being put to use  still girls are told they ought to wait patiently and not to be eager for selfimposed duties  i am not saying that it is not the appointed discipline for the girls themselves said mr wilmot if they would submit and do their best it would doubtless prove the most beneficial thing for them but it is a trial in which they often fail and i had rather not be in the place of such friends  it is a great puzzle said margaret sighing  ah i dare say you are often perplexed said her friend kindly  indeed i am there are so many little details that i cannot be always teasing papa with and yet which i do believe form the character more than the great events and i never know whether i act for the best and there are so many of us so many duties i cannot half attend to any lately i have been giving up almost everything to keep this room quiet for norman in the morning because he was so much harassed and hurt by bustle and confusion and i found today that things have gone wrong in consequence  you must do the best you can and try to trust that while you work in the right spirit your failures will be compensated said mr wilmot it is a hard trial  i like your understanding it said margaret smiling sadly i dont know whether it is silly but i dont like to be pitied for the wrong thing my being so helpless is what every one laments over but after all that is made up to me by the petting and kindness i get from all of them but it is the being mistress of the house and having to settle for every one without knowing whether i do right or wrong that is my trouble  i am not sure however that it is right to call it a trouble though it is a trial  i see what you mean said margaret i ought to be thankful i know it is an honour and i am quite sure i should be grieved if they did not all come to me and consult me as they do i had better not have complained and yet i am glad i did for i like you to understand my difficulties  and indeed i wish to enter into them and do or say anything in my power to help you but i dont know anything that can be of so much comfort as the knowledge that he who laid the burden on you will help you to bear it  yes said margaret pausing and then with a sweet look though a heavy sigh she said it is very odd how things turn out i always had a childish fancy that i would be useful and important but i little thought how it would be however as long as richard is in the house i always feel secure about the others and i shall soon be downstairs myself dont you think dear papa in better spirits  i thought so todayand here the doctor returned talking of abbotstoke grange where he had certainly been much pleased it was a lucky chance he said that they brought norman in it was exactly what i wanted to rouse and interest him and he took it all in so well that i am sure they were pleased with him i thought he looked a very lanky specimen of too much leg and arm when i called him in but he has such good manners and is so ready and understanding that they could not help liking him it was fortunate i had him instead of richardritchie is a very good fellow certainly but he had rather look at a steamengine any day than at raphael himself  norman had his turn byandby he came up after tea reporting that papa was fast asleep in his chair and the others would go on about cocksmoor till midnight if they were let alone and made up for his previous yielding to ethel by giving with much animation and some excitement a glowing description of the grange so graphic that margaret said she could almost fancy she had been there  oh margaret i wonder if you ever will i would give something for you to see the beautiful conservatory it is a real bower for a maiden of romance with its rich green fragrance in the midst of winter it is like a picture in a dream one could imagine it a fairy land where no care or grief or weariness could come all choice beauty and sweetness waiting on the creature within i can hardly believe that it is a real place and that i have seen it  though you have brought these pretty tokens that your fairy is as good as she is fair said margaret smiling     chapter xvi       evans   peace your tattlings what is fair william    william pulcher    quickly poulcats there are fairer things than poulcats sure    evans   i pray you have your remembrance child accusative             hing hang hog    quickly hang hog is latin for bacon i warrant you                                                    shakespeare   in a large family it must often happen that since every member of it cannot ride the same hobby nor at the same time their several steeds must sometimes run counter to each other and so ethel found it one morning when miss winter having a bad cold had given her an unwonted holiday  mr wilmot had sent a large parcel of books for her to choose from for cocksmoor but this she could not well do without consultation the multitude bewildered her she was afraid of taking too many or too few and the being brought to these practical details made her sensible that though her schemes were very grand and full for future doings they passed very lightly over the intermediate ground the paulo post fulurum was a period much more developed in her imagination than the future that the present was flowing into  where was her coadjutor richard writing notes for papa and not to be disturbed she had better have waited tranquilly but this would not suit her impatience and she ran up to margarets room there she found a great display of ivy leaves which norman who had been turning half the shops in the town upside down in search of materials was instructing her to imitate in leatherworka regular mania with him and apparently the same with margaret  in came ethel oh margaret will you look at these first truths do you think they would be easy enough shall i take some of the parables and miracles at once or content myself with the book about jane sparks  theres some very easy reading in jane sparks isnt there i would not make the little books from the new testament too common  take care that leaf has five points said norman  shall i bring you up jane sparks to see because then you can judge said ethel  there norman is that rightwhat a beauty i should like to look over them byandby dear ethel very much  ethel gazed and went away more put out than was usual with her when margaret has a new kind of fancy work she thought she cares for nothing else as if my poor children did not signify more than trumpery leather leaves she next met flora  oh flora see here what a famous parcel of books mr wilmot has sent us to choose from  all those said flora turning them over as they lay heaped on the drawingroom sofa what a confusion  see such a parcel of reading books i want to know what you think of setting them up with jane sparks as it is weekday teaching  you will be very tired of hearing those spelled over for ever they have some nicer books at the national school  what is the name of them do you see any of them here  no i dont think i do but i cant wait to look now i must write some letters you had better put them together a little if you were to sort them you would know what is there now what a mess they are in  ethel could not deny it and began to deal them out in piles looking somewhat more fitting but still felt neglected and aggrieved at no one being at leisure but harry who was not likely to be of any use to her  presently she heard the study door open and hoped but though it was richard who entered the room he was followed by tom and each held various books that boded little good to her miss winter had much to her own satisfaction been relieved from the charge of tom whose lessons richard had taken upon himself and thus ethel had heard so little about them for a long time past that even in her vexation and desire to have them over she listened with interest desirous to judge what sort of place tom might be likely to take in school  she did not perceive that this made richard nervous and uneasy he had a great dislike to spectators of latin lessons he never had forgotten an unlucky occasion some years back when his father was examining him in the georgics and he dull by nature and duller by confusion and timidity had gone on rendering word for wordenim for seges a crop lini of mud urit burns campum the field avenae a crop of pipe urit burns it when norman and ethel had first warned him of the beauty of his translation by an explosion of laughing when his father had shut the book with a bounce shaken his head in utter despair and told him to give up all thoughts of doing anythingand when margaret had cried with vexation since that time he had never been happy when any one was in earshot of a lesson but today he had no escapeharry lay on the rug reading and ethel sat forlorn over her books on the sofa tom however was bright enough declined his greek nouns irreproachably and construed his latin so well that ethel could not help putting in a word or two of commendation and auguring the third form do let him off the parsing ritchie said she coaxinglyhe has said it so well and i want you so much  i am afraid i must not said richard who to her surprise did not look pleased or satisfied with the prosperous translation but come tom you shant have many words if you really know them  tom twisted and looked rather cross but when asked to parse the word viribus answered readily and correctly  very well only two moreaffuit  third person singular praeter perfect tense of the verb affo affis affui affere gabbled off tom with such confidence that though ethel gave an indignant jump richard was almost startled into letting it pass and disbelieving himself he remonstrated in a somewhat hesitating voice did you find that in the dictionary said he i thought affui came from adsum  oh to be sure stupid fool of a word so it does said tom hastily i had forgotadsum ades affui adesse  richard said no more but proposed the word oppositus  adjective  ethel was surprised for she remembered that it was in this passage part of a passive verb which tom had construed correctly it was objected and she had thought this very creditable to him whereas he now evidently took it for opposite however on richards reading the line he corrected himself and called it a participle but did not commit himself further till asked for its derivation  from oppositor  hallo cried harry who hitherto had been abstracted in his book but now turned raised himself on his elbow and at the blunder shook his thick yellow locks and showed his teeth like a young lion  no now tom pay attention said richard resignedly if you found out its meaning you must have seen its derivation  oppositus said tom twisting his fingers and gazing first at ethel then at harry in hopes of being prompted then at the ceiling and floor the while he drawled out the word with a whine why oppositus from opposor  a poser aint it said harry  dont harry you distract him said richard come tom say at once whether you know it or notit is of no use to invent  from op and a mumble  what i dont hearop  tom again looked for help to harry who made a mischievous movement of his lips as if prompting and deceived by it he said boldly from oppossum  thats right let us hear him decline it cried harry in an ecstasy oppossum opottis opposse or ohpottery  harry said richard in a gentle reasonable voice i wish you would be so kind as not to stay if you cannot help distracting him  and harry who really had a tolerable share of forbearance and consideration actually obeyed contenting himself with tossing his book into the air and catching it again while he paused at the door to give his last unsolicited assistance decline oppossum you say ill tell you how opossum reposes up a gum tree opotyoui will says the oposse of yankees come out to ketch him opossum poses them and declines in opotesse by any manner of means of opottingdidodum was quite oppositumoppotitu in fact quite contrairy  richard with the gravity of a victim heard this sally of schoolboy wit which threw ethel back on the sofa in fits of laughing and declaring that the opossum declined not that he was declined but in the midst of the disturbance thus created tom stepped up to her and whispered do tell me ethel  indeed i shant said she why dont you say fairly if you dont know  he was obliged to confess his ignorance and richard made him conjugate the whole verb opponor from beginning to end in which he wanted a good deal of help  ethel could not help saying how did you find out the meaning of that word tom if you didnt look out the verb  idont know drawled tom in the voice half sullen half piteous which he always assumed when out of sorts  it is very odd she said decidedly but richard took no notice and proceeded to the other lessons which went off tolerably well except the arithmetic where there was some great misunderstanding into which ethel did not enter for some time when she did attend she perceived that tom had brought a right answer without understanding the working of the sum and that richard was putting him through it she began to be worked into a state of dismay and indignation at toms behaviour and richards calm indifference which made her almost forget jane sparks and long to be alone with richard but all the world kept coming into the room and going out and she could not say what was in her mind till after dinner when seeing richard go up into margarets room she ran after him and entering it surprised margaret by not beginning on her books but saying at once ritchie i wanted to speak to you about tom i am sure he shuffled about those lessons  i am afraid he does said richard much concerned  what do you mean that it is often so  much too often said richard but i have never been able to detect him he is very sharp and has some underhand way of preparing his lessons that i cannot make out  did you know it margaret said ethel astonished not to see her sister looked shocked as well as sorry  yes said margaret ritchie and i have often talked it over and tried to think what was to be done  dear me why dont you tell papa it is such a terrible thing  so it is said margaret but we have nothing positive or tangible to accuse tom of we dont know what he does and have never caught him out  i am sure he must have found out the meaning of that oppositum in some wrong wayif he had looked it out he would only have found opposite nothing but opponor could have shown him the rendering which he made  thats like what i have said almost every day said richard but there we arei cant get any further  perhaps he guesses by the context said margaret  it would be impossible to do so always said both the latin scholars at once  well i cant think how you can take it so quietly said ethel i would have told papa the first moment and put a stop to it i have a great mind to do so if you wont  ethel ethel that would never do exclaimed margaret pray dont papa would be so dreadfully grieved and angry with poor tom  well so he deserves said ethel  you dont know what it is to see papa angry said richard  dear me richard cried ethel who thought she knew pretty well what his sharp words were im sure papa never was angry with me without making me love him more and at least want to be better  you are a girl said richard  you are higher spirited and shake off things faster said margaret  why what do you think he would do to tom  i think he would be so very angry that tom who you know is timid and meek would be dreadfully frightened said richard  thats just what he ought to be frightened out of these tricks  i am afraid it would frighten him into them still more said richard and perhaps give him such a dread of my father as would prevent him from ever being open with him  besides it would make papa so very unhappy added margaret of course if poor dear tom had been found out in any positive deceit we ought to mention it at once and let him be punished but while it is all vague suspicion and of what papa has such a horror of it would only grieve him and make him constantly anxious without perhaps doing tom any good  i think all that is expediency said ethel in her bluff abrupt way  besides said richard we have nothing positive to accuse him of and if we had it would be of no use he will be at school in three weeks and there he would be sure to shirk even if he left it off here every one does and thinks nothing of it  richard cried both sisters shocked you never did  no we didnt but most others do and not bad fellows either it is not the way of boys to think much of those things  it is meanit is dishonourableit is deceitful cried ethel  i know it is very wrong but youll never get the general run of boys to think so said richard  then tom ought not to go to school at all till he is well armed against it said ethel  that cant be helped said richard he will get clear of it in time when he knows better  i will talk to him said margaret and indeed i think it would be better than worrying papa  well said ethel of course i shant tell because it is not my business but i think papa ought to know everything about us and i dont like your keeping anything back it is being almost as bad as tom himself  with which words as flora entered ethel marched out of the room in displeasure and went down resolved to settle jane sparks by herself  ethel is out of sorts today said flora whats the matter  we have had a discussion said margaret she has been terribly shocked by finding out what we have often thought about poor little tom and she thinks we ought to tell papa her principle is quite right but i doubt  i know exactly how ethel would do it cried flora blurt out all on a sudden papa tom cheats at his lessons then there would be a tremendous uproar papa would scold tom till he almost frightened him out of his wits and then find out it was only suspicion  and never have any comfort again said margaret he would always dread that tom was deceiving him and then think it was all for want ofoh no it will never do to speak of it unless we find out some positive piece of misbehaviour  certainly said flora  and it would do tom no good to make him afraid of papa said richard  ethels rule is right in principle said margaret thoughtfully that papa ought to know all without reserve and yet it will hardly do in practice one must use discretion and not tease him about every little thing he takes them so much to heart that he would be almost distracted and with so much business abroad i think at home he should have nothing but rest and as far as we can freedom from care and worry anything wrong about the children brings on the grief so much that i cannot bear to mention it  richard and flora agreed with her admiring the spirit which made her in her weakness and helplessness bear the whole burden of family cares alone and devote herself entirely to spare her father he was indeed her first object and she would have sacrificed anything to give him ease of mind but perhaps she regarded him more as a charge of her own than as in very truth the head of the family she had the government in her hands and had never been used to see him exercise it much in detail she did not know how much her mother had referred to him in private and had succeeded to her authority at a time when his health and spirits were in such a state as to make it doubly needful to spare him it was no wonder that she sometimes carried her consideration beyond what was strictly right and forgot that he was the real authority more especially as his impulsive nature sometimes carried him away and his sound judgment was not certain to come into play at the first moment so that it required some moral courage to excite displeasure so easy of manifestation and of such courage there was perhaps a deficiency in her character nor had she yet detected her own satisfaction in being the first with every one in the family  ethel was put out as flora had discovered and when she was downstairs she found it out and accused herself of having been cross to margaret and unkind to tomof wishing to be a telltale but still though displeased with herself she was dissatisfied with margaret it might be right but it did not agree with her notions she wanted to see every one uncompromising as girls of fifteen generally do she had an intense disgust and loathing of underhand ways could not bear to think of toms carrying them on and going to a place of temptation with them uncorrected and she looked up to her father with the reverence and enthusiasm of one like minded  she was vexed on another score norman came home from abbotstoke grange without having seen miss rivers but with a fresh basket of choice flowers rapturous descriptions of mr riverss prints and a present of an engraving in shading such as to give the effect of a cast of a very fine head of alexander nothing was to be thought of but a frame for thisolive bay laurel everything appropriate to the conqueror margaret and norman were engrossed in the subject and to ethel who had no toleration for fancy work who expected everything to be either useful and intellectual this seemed very frivolous she heard her father say how glad he was to see norman interested and occupied and certainly though it was only in leather leaves it was better than drooping and attending to nothing she knew too that margaret did it for his sake but said ethel to herself it was very odd that people should find amusement in such things margaret always had a turn for them but it was very strange in norman  then came the pang of finding out that this was aggravated by the neglect of herself she called it all selfishness and felt that she had had an uncomfortable unsatisfactory day with everything going wrong     chapter xvii         gently supported by the ready aid        of loving hands whose little work of toil      her grateful prodigality repaid        with all the benediction of her smile          she turned her failing feet          to the softly cushioned seat        dispensing kindly greetings all the time                                              r m milnes   three great events signalised the month of january the first was the opening of the school at cocksmoor whither a cart transported half a dozen forms various books and three dozen plumbuns margarets contribution in order that the school might begin with eclat there walked mr wilmot richard and flora with mary in a jumping capering state of delight and ethel not knowing whether she rejoiced she kept apart from the rest and hardly spoke for this long probation had impressed her with a sense of responsibility and she knew that it was a great work to which she had set her handa work in which she must persevere and in which she could not succeed in her own strength  she took hold of floras hand and squeezed it hard in a fit of shyness when they came upon the hamlet and saw the children watching for them and when they reached the house she would fain have shrank into nothing there was a swelling of heart that seemed to overwhelm and stifle her and the effect of which was to keep her standing unhelpful when the others were busy bringing in the benches and settling the room  it was a tidy room but it seemed very small when they ranged the benches and opened the door to the sevenandtwenty children and the four or five women who stood waiting ethel felt some dismay when they all came pushing in without order or civility and would have been utterly at a loss what to do with her scholars now she had got them if richard and flora had not marshalled them to the benches  rough heads torn garments staring vacant eyes and mouths gaping in shy rudenessit was a sight to disenchant her of visions of pleasure in the work she had set herself it was well that she had not to take the initiative  mr wilmot said a few simple words to the mothers about the wish to teach their children what was right and to do the best at present practicable and then told the children that he hoped they would take pains to be good and mind what they were taught then he desired all to kneel down he said the collect prevent us o lord in all our doings and then the lords prayer  ethel felt as if she could bear it better and was more up to the work after this next the children were desired to stand round the room and mr wilmot tried who could say the catechismthe two biggest a boy and a girl had not an idea of it and the boy looked foolish and grinned at being asked what was his name one child was tolerably perfect and about half a dozen had some dim notions three were entirely ignorant of the lords prayer and many of the others did not by any means pronounce the words of it jane and fanny taylor rebekah watts and mrs greens little boy were the only ones who by their own account used morning and evening prayers though on further examination it appeared that polly and jenny hall and some others were accustomed to repeat the old rhyme about matthew mark luke and john and una mcarthy and her little brother fergus said something that nobody could make out but which mr wilmot thought had once been an ave maria  some few of the children could read and several more knew their letters the least ignorant were selected to form a first class and mr wilmot promised a prayerbook to the first who should be able to repeat the catechism without a mistake and a bible to the first who could read a chapter in it  then followed a setting of tasks varying from a verse of a psalm or the first answer in the catechism down to the distinction between a b and c all to be ready by next tuesday when weather permitting a second lesson was to be given afterwards a piece of advice of margarets was followed and flora read aloud to the assembly the story of margaret fletcher to some this seemed to give great satisfaction especially to una but ethel was surprised to see that many and those not only little ones talked and yawned they had no power of attention even to a story and the stillness was irksome to such wild colts it was plain that it was time to leave off and there was no capacity there which did not find the conclusion agreeable when the basket was opened and ethel and mary distributed the buns with instructions to say thank you  the next tuesday some of the lessons were learned unas perfectly the big ignorant boy came no more and some of the children had learned to behave better while others behaved worse ethel began to know what she was about richards gentleness was eminently successful with the little girls impressing good manners on them in a marvellous way and marys importance and happiness with alphabet scholars some bigger than herself were edifying cocksmoor was fairly launched  the next memorable day was that of margarets being first carried downstairs she had been willing to put it off as long as she could dreading to witness the change belowstairs and feeling too that in entering on the family room without power of leaving it she was losing all quiet and solitude as well as giving up that monopoly of her father in his evenings which had been her great privilege  however she tried to talk herself into liking it and was rewarded by the happy commotion it caused though dr may was in a state of excitement and nervousness at the prospect of seeing her on the stairs and his attempts to conceal it only made it worse till margaret knew she should be nervous herself and wished him out of sight and out of the house till it was over for without him she had full confidence in the coolness and steadiness of richard and by him it was safely and quietly accomplished she was landed on the sofa richard and flora settling her and the others crowding round and exclaiming while the newness of the scene and the change gave her a sense of confusion and she shut her eyes to recover her thoughts but opened them the next instant at her fathers exclamation that she was overcome smiled to reassure him and declared herself not tired and to be very glad to be among them again but the bustle was oppressive and her cheerful manner was an effort she longed to see them all gone and flora found it out sent the children for their walk and carried off ethel and the brothers  dr may was called out of the room at the same time and she was left alone she gazed round her at the room where four months before she had seen her mother with the babe in her arms the children clustered round her her father exulting in his henandchicken daisies herself full of bright undefined hope radiant with health and activity and her one trouble such that she now knew the force of her mothers words that it only proved her happiness it was not till that moment that margaret realised the change found her eyes filling with tears as she looked round and saw the familiar furniture and ornaments  they were instantly checked as she heard her father returning but not so that he did not perceive them and exclaim that it had been too much for her oh noit was only the first time said margaret losing the sense of the painful vacancy in her absorbing desire not to distress her father and thinking only of him as she watched him standing for some minutes leaning on the mantelshelf with his hand shading his forehead  she began to speak as soon as she thought he was ready to have his mind turned away how nicely ritchie managed he carried me so comfortably and easily it is enough to spoil me to be so deftly waited on  im glad of it said dr may i am sure the change is better for you but he came and looked at her still with great solicitude  ritchie can take excellent care of me she continued most anxious to divert his thoughts you see it will do very well indeed for you to take harry to school  i should like to do so i should like to see his master and to take norman with me said the doctor it would be just the thing for him nowwe would show him the dockyard and all those matters and such a thorough holiday would set him up again  he is very much better  much betterhe is recovering spirits and tone very fast that leafwork of yours came at a lucky time i like to see him looking out for a curious fern in the hedgerowsthe pursuit has quite brightened him up  and he does it so thoroughly said margaret ethel fancies it is rather frivolous of him i believe but it amuses me to see how men give dignity to what women make trifling he will know everything about the leaves hunts up my botany books and has taught me a hundred times more of the construction and wonders of them than i ever learned  ay said the doctor he has been talking a good deal to me about vegetable chemistry he would make a good scientific botanist if he were to be nothing else i should be glad if he sticks to it as a pursuittis pretty work and i should like to have gone further with it if i had ever had time for it  i dare say he will said margaret it will be very pleasant if he can go with you how he would enjoy the british museum if there was time for him to see it have you said anything to him yet  no i waited to see how you were as it all depends on that  i think it depends still more on something else whether norman is as fit to take care of you as richard is  thats another point theres nothing but what he could manage now but i dont like saying anything to him i know he would undertake anything i wished without a word and then perhaps dwell on it in fancy and force himself till it would turn to a perfect misery and upset his nerves again im sorry for it i meant him to have followed my trade but hell never do for that however he has wits enough to make himself what he pleases and i dare say he will keep at the head of the school after all  how very good he has been in refraining from restlessness  its beautiful said dr may with strong emotion poor boy i trust hell not be disappointed and i dont think he will but ive promised him i wont be annoyed if he should lose his placeso we must take especial care not to show any anxiety however for this matter margaret i wish you would sound him and see whether it would be more pleasure or pain only mind you dont let him think that i shall be vexed if he feels that he cant make up his mind i would not have him fancy that for more than i can tell  this consultation revived the spirits of both and the others returning found margaret quite disposed for companionship if to her the evening was sad and strange like a visit in a dream to some old familiar haunt finding all unnatural to the rest it was delightful the room was no longer dreary now that there was a centre for care and attentions and the party was no longer broken upthe sense of comfort cheerfulness and homegathering had returned and the pleasant evening household gossip went round the table almost as it used to do dr may resumed his old habit of skimming a club book and imparting the cream to the listeners and flora gave them some music a great treat to margaret who had long only heard its distant sounds  margaret found an opportunity of talking to norman and judged favourably he was much pleased at the prospect of the journey and of seeing a ship so as to have a clearer notion of the scene where harrys life was to be spent and though the charge of the arm was a drawback he did not treat it as insurmountable  a few days attendance in his fathers room gave him confidence in taking richards place and accordingly the third important measure was decided on namely that he and his father should accompany harry to the naval school and be absent three nights some relations would be glad to receive them in london and alan ernescliffe who was studying steam navigation at woolwich volunteered to meet them and go with them to portsmouth  it was a wonderful event norman and harry had never been beyond whitford in their lives and none of the young ones could recollect their papas ever going from home for more than one night dr may laughed at margaret for her anxiety and excitement on the subject and was more amused at overhearing richards precise directions to norman over the packing up  ay ritchie said the doctor as he saw his portmanteau locked and the key given to norman you may well look grave upon it you wont see it look so tidy when it comes back again and i believe you are thinking it will be lucky if you see it at all  there was a very affectionate leavetaking of harry who growing rather softhearted thought it needful to be disdainful scolded mary and blanche for lugging off his figurehead and assured them they made as much work about it as if he was going to sea at once then to put an end to any more embraces he marched off to the station with tom and nearly caused the others to be too late by the search for him that ensued  in due time dr may and norman returned looking the better for the journey there was first to tell of harrys school and its master and alan ernescliffes introduction of him to a nicelooking boy of his own age then they were eloquent on the wonders of the dockyard the victory the block machinery and londonwhile dr may went to transact some business norman had been with alan at the british museum and though he had intended to see half london besides there was no tearing him away from the elgin marbles and nothing would serve him but bringing dr may the next morning to visit the ninevite bulls norman further said that whereas papa could never go out of his house without meeting people who had something to say to him it was the same elsewhere six acquaintances he had met unexpectedly in london and two at portsmouth  so the conversation went on all the evening to the great delight of all it was more about things than people though flora inquired after mr ernescliffe and was told he had met them at the station had been everywhere with them and had dined at the mackenzies each day how was he looking ethel asked and was told pretty much the same as when he went away and on a further query from flora it appeared that an old naval friend of his fathers had hopes of a ship and had promised to have him with him and thereupon warm hopes were expressed that harry might have a berth in the same  and when is he coming here again papa said ethel  eh oh i cant tell i say isnt it high time to ring  when they went up at night every one felt that half the say had not been said and there were fresh beginnings on the stairs norman triumphantly gave the key to richard and then called to ethel i say wont you come into my room while i unpack  oh yes i should like it very much  ethel sat on the bed rolled up in a cloak while norman undid his bag announcing at the same time well ethel papa says i may get to my euripides tomorrow if i please and only work an hour at a time  oh i am so glad then he thinks you quite well  yes i am quite well i hope ive done with nonsense  and how did you get on with his arm  very wellhe was so patient and told me how to manage you heard that sir matthew said it had got much better in these few weeks oh here it is theres a present for you  oh thank you from you or from papa  this is mine papa has a present for every one in his bag he said at last that a man with eleven children hadnt need to go to london very often  and you got this beautiful lyra innocentium for me how very kind of you norman it is just what i wished for such lovely bindingand those embossed edges to the leaves oh they make a pattern as they open i never saw anything like it  i saw such a one on miss riverss table and asked ernescliffe where to get one like it see heres what my father gave me  bishop kens manual that is in readiness for the confirmation  look i begged him to put my name though he said it was a pity to do it with his left hand i didnt like to wait so i asked him at least to write n w may and the date  and he has added prov xxiii 24 25 let me look it out she did so and instead of reading it aloud looked at norman full of congratulation  how it ought to make one and there norman broke off from the fullness of his heart  im glad he put both verses said ethel presently how pleased with you he must be  a silence while brother and sister both gazed intently at the crooked characters till at last ethel with a long breath resumed her ordinary tone and said how well he has come to write with his left hand now  yes did you know that he wrote himself to tell ernescliffe sir matthews opinion of margaret  no did he  do you know ethel said norman as he knelt on the floor and tumbled miscellaneous articles out of his bag it is my belief that ernescliffe is in love with her and that papa thinks so  dear me cried ethel starting up that is famous we should always have margaret at home when he goes to sea  but mind ethel for your life you must not say one word to any living creature  oh no i promise you i wont norman if youll only tell me how you found it out  what first put it in my head was the first evening while i was undoing the portmanteau my father leaned on the mantelshelf and sighed and muttered poor ernescliffe i wish it may end well i thought he forgot that i was there so i would not seem to notice but i soon saw it was that he meant  how cried ethel eagerly  oh i dont knowby alans way  tell mei want to know what people do when they are in love  nothing particular said norman smiling  did you hear him inquire for her how did he look  i cant tell that was when he met us at the station before i thought of it and i had to see to the luggage but ill tell you one thing ethel when papa was talking of her to mrs mackenzie at the other end of the room all his attention went away in an instant from what he was saying and once when harry said something to me about her he started and looked round so earnestly  oh yesthats like people in books and did he colour  no i dont recollect that he did said norman but i observed he never asked directly after her if he could help it but always was trying to lead in some roundabout way to hearing what she was doing  did he call her margaret  i watched but to me he always said your sister and if he had to speak of her to papa he said miss may and then you should have seen his attention to papa i could hardly get a chance of doing anything for papa  oh sure of it cried ethel clasping her hands but poor man how unhappy he must have been at having to go away when she was so ill  ay the last time he saw her was when he carried her upstairs  oh dear i hope he will soon come here again  i dont suppose he will papa did not ask him  dear me norman why not isnt papa very fond of him why shouldnt he come  dont you see ethel that would be of no use while poor margaret is no better if he gained her affections it would only make her unhappy  oh but she is much better she can raise herself up now without help and sat up ever so long this morning without leaning back on her cushions she is getting wellyou know sir matthew said she would  yes but i suppose papa thinks they had better say nothing till she is quite well  and when she is how famous it will be  then theres another thing he is very poor you know  i am sure papa doesnt care about people being rich  i suppose alan thinks he ought not to marry unless he could make his wife comfortable  look hereit would be all very easy she should stay with us and be comfortable here and he go to sea and get lots of prize money  and thats what you call domestic felicity said norman laughing  he might have her when he was at home said ethel  no no that would never do said norman do you think ernescliffes a man that would marry a wife for her father to maintain her  why papa would like it very much he is not a mercenary father in a book  hey whats that said a voice ethel little expected contraband talk at contraband times whats this  did you hear papa said ethel looking down  only your last words as i came up to ask norman what he had done with my pocketbook mind i ask no impertinent questions but if you have no objection i should like to know what gained me the honour of that compliment  norman said ethel interrogatively and blushing in emulation of her brother who was crimson  ill find it said he rushing off with a sort of nod and sign that conveyed to ethel that there was no help for it  so with much confusion she whispered into her papas ear that norman had been telling her something he guessed about mr ernescliffe  her father at first smiled a pleased amused smile ah ha so master june has his eyes and ears open has he a fine bit of gossip to regale you with on his return  he told me to say not one word said ethel  rightmind you dont said dr may and ethel was surprised to see how sorrowful his face became at the same moment norman returned still very red and said ive put out the pocketbook papa i think i should tell you i repeated what perhaps you did not mean me to hearyou talked to yourself something of pitying ernescliffe the doctor smiled again at the boys highminded openness which must have cost an effort of selfhumiliation i cant say little pitchers have long ears to a maypole like you norman said he i think i ought rather to apologise for having inadvertently tumbled in among your secrets i assure you i did not come to spy you  oh no no no no repeated ethel vehemently then you didnt mind our talking about it  of course not as long as it goes no further it is the use of sisters to tell them ones private sentiments is not it norman  and do you really think it is so papa ethel could not help whispering  im afraid it is said dr may sighing then as he caught her earnest eyes the more i see of alan the finer fellow i think him and the more sorry i am for him it seems presumptuous almost wrong to think of the matter at all while my poor margaret is in this state and if she were well there are other difficulties which would perhaps prevent his speaking or lead to long years of waiting and wearing out hope  money said ethel  ay though i so far deserve your compliment miss that should be foolish enough if she were but well to give my consent tomorrow because i could not help it yet one cant live fortysix years in this world without seeing it is wrong to marry without a reasonable dependenceand there wont be much among eleven of you it makes my heart ache to think of it come what may as far as i can see and without her to judge the only comfort is that poor margaret herself knows nothing of it and is at peace so far it will be ordered for them anyhow goodnight my dear  ethel sought her room with graver deeper thoughts of life than she had carried upstairs     chapter xviii         saw ye never in the meadows        where your little feet did pass      down below the sweet white daisies        growing in the long green grass       saw you never lilac blossoms        or acacia white and red      waving brightly in the sunshine        on the tall trees over head                            hymns for children c f a   my dear child what a storm you have had how wet you must be exclaimed mrs larpent as meta rivers came bounding up the broad staircase at abbotstoke grange  oh no i am quite dry feel  are you sure said mrs larpent drawing her darling into a luxurious bedroom lighted up by a glowing fire and full of pretty things here come and take off your wet things my dear and bellairs shall bring you some tea  im dry im warm said meta tossing off her plumy hat as she established herself with her feet on the fender but where do you think i have been you have so much to hear but firstthree guesses where we were in the rain  in the stoneborough cloisters that you wanted to see my dear you did not keep your papa in the cold there  no no we never got there at all guess again  at mr edward wilmots  no  could it have been at dr mays really then you must tell me  there you deserve a good long story beginning at the beginning said meta clapping her hands wasnt it curious as we were coming up the last hill we met some girls in deep mourning with a lady who looked like their governess i wondered whether they could be dr mays daughters and so it turned out they were  presently there began to fall little square lumps neither hail nor snow nor rain it grew very cold and rain came on it would have been great fun if i had not been afraid papa would catch cold and he said we would canter on to the inn but luckily there was dr may walking up the street and he begged us to come into his house i was so glad we were tolerably wet and dr may said something about hoping the girls were at home well when he opened the drawingroom door there was the poor daughter lying on the sofa  poor girl tell me of her  oh you must go and see her you wont look at her without losing your heart papa liked her so muchsee if he does not talk of her all the evening she looks the picture of goodness and sweetness only think of her having some of the maidenhair and cape jessamine still in water that we sent her so long ago she shall have some flowers every three days well dr may said there is one at least that is sure to be at home she felt my habit and said i must go and change it and she called to a little thing of six telling her to show me the way to flora she smiled and said she wished she could go herself but flora would take care of me little blanche came and took hold of my hand chattering away up we went up two staircases and at the top of the last stood a girl about seventeen so pretty such deep blue eyes and such a complexion thats flora little blanche said flora this is miss rivers and shes wet and margaret says you are to take care of her  so that was your introduction  yes we got acquainted in a minute she took me into her roomsuch a room i believe bellairs would be angry if she had such a one all up in the roof no fire no carpet except little strips by the beds there were three beds flora used to sleep there till miss may was ill and now she dresses there yet i am sure they are as much ladies as i am  you are an only daughter my dear and a petted one said mrs larpent smiling there are too many of them to make much of as we do of our meta  i suppose so but i did not know gentlewomen lived in such a way said meta there were nice things about a beautiful inlaid workbox of floras and a rosewood desk and plenty of books and a greek book and dictionary were spread open i asked flora if they were hers and she laughed and said no and that ethel would be much discomposed that i had see them ethel keeps up with her brother normanonly fancy and he at the head of the school how clever she must be  but my dear were you standing in your wet things all this time  no i was trying on their frocks but they trailed on the ground upon me so she asked if i would come and sit by the nursery fire till my habit was dry and there was a dear little goodhumoured baby so fair and pretty she is not a bit shy will go to anybody but they say she likes no one so well as her brother norman  so you had a regular treat of babynursing  that i had i could not part with her the darling flora thought we might take her down and i liked playing with her in the drawingroom and talking to miss may till the fly came to take us home i wanted to have seen ethel but only think papa has asked dr may to bring flora some day how i hope he will  little meta having told her story and received plenty of sympathy proceeded to dress and while her maid braided her hair a musing fit fell upon her i have seen something of life today thought she i had thought of the great difference between us and the poor but i did not know ladies lived in such different ways i should be very miserable without bellairs or without a fire in my room i dont know what i should do if i had to live in that cold shabby den and do my own hair yet they think nothing of it and they are cultivated and ladylike is it all fancy and being brought up to it i wonder if it is right yet dear papa likes me to have these things and can afford them i never knew i was luxurious before and yet i think i must be one thing i do wish and that is that i was of as much use as those girls i ought to be i am a motherless girl like them and i ought to be everything to papa just as miss may is even lying on the sofa there and only two years older than i am i dont think i am of any use at all he is fond of me of course dear papa and if i died i dont know what would become of him but thats only because i am his daughterhe has only george besides to care for but really and truly he would get on as well without me i never do anything for him but now and then playing to him in the evening and that not always i am afraid when i want to be about anything else he is always petting me and giving me all i want but i never do anything but my lessons and going to the school and the poor people and that is all pleasure i have so much that i never miss what i give away i wonder whether it is all right leonora and agatha have not so much money to do as they please withthey are not so idolised george said when he was angry that papa idolises me but they have all these comforts and luxuries and never think of anything but doing what they like they never made me consider as these mays do i should like to know them more i do so much want a friend of my own age it is the only want i have i have tried to make a friend of leonora but i cannot she never cares for what i do if she saw these mays she would look down on them dear mrs larpent is better than any one but then she is so much older flora may shall be my friend ill make her call me meta as soon as she comes when will it be the day after tomorrow  but little meta watched in vain dr may always came with either richard or the groom to drive him and if meta met him and hoped he would bring flora next time he only answered that flora would like it very much and he hoped soon to do so  the truth was it was no such everyday matter as meta imagined the larger carriage had been broken and the only vehicle held only the doctorhis charioteerand in a very minute appendage behind a small son of the gardener to open gates and hold the horse  the proposal had been one of those general invitations to be fulfilled at any time and therefore easily set aside and dr may though continually thinking he should like to take his girls to abbotstoke never saw the definite time for so doing and flora herself though charmed with miss rivers and delighted with the prospect of visiting her only viewed it as a distant prospect  there was plenty of immediate interest to occupy them at home to say nothing of the increasing employment that cocksmoor gave to thoughts legs and needles there was the commencement of the halfyear when toms schoolboy life was to begin and when it would be proved whether norman were able to retain his elevation  margaret had much anxiety respecting the little boy about to be sent into a scene of temptation her great confidence was in richard who told her that boys did many more wrong things than were known at home and yet turned out very well and that tom would be sure to right himself in the end richard had been blameless in his whole school course but though never partaking of the other boys evil practices he could not form an independent estimate of character and his tone had been a little hurt by sharing the school public opinion of morality he thought stoneborough and its temptations inevitable and only wished to make the best of it margaret was afraid to harass her father by laying the case before him all her brothers had gone safely through the school and it never occurred to her that it was possible that if her father knew the bias of toms disposition he might choose for the present at least some other mode of education  she talked earnestly to tom and he listened impatiently there is an age when boys rebel against female rule and are not yet softened by the chivalry of manhood and tom was at this time of life he did not like to be lectured by a sister secretly disputed her right and proud of becoming a schoolboy had not the generous deference for her weakness felt by his elder brothers he was all the time peeling a stick as if to show that he was not attending and he raised up his shoulder pettishly whenever she came to a mention of the religious duty of sincerity she did not long continue her advice and much disappointed and concerned tried to console herself with hoping that he might have heeded more than he seemed to do  he was placed tolerably high in the school and norman who had the first choice of fags took him instead of hector ernescliffe who had just passed beyond the part of the school liable to be fagged he said he liked school looked bright when he came home in the evenings and the sisters hoped all was right  every one was just now anxiously watching norman especially his father who strove in vain to keep back all manifestation of his earnest desire to see him retain his post resolutely did the doctor refrain from asking any questions when the boys came in but he could not keep his eyes from studying the face to see whether it bore marks of mental fatigue and from following him about the room to discover whether he found it necessary as he had done last autumn to spend the evening in study it was no small pleasure to see him come in with his hand full of horsechestnut and hazelbuds and proceed to fetch the microscope and botany books throwing himself eagerly into the study of the wonders of their infant forms searching deeply into them with margaret and talking them over with his father who was very glad to promote the pursuitone in which he had always taken great interest  another night dr may was for a moment disturbed by seeing the schoolbooks put out but norman had only some notes to compare and while he did so he was remarking on floras music and joining in the conversation so freely as to prove it was no labour to him in truth he was evidently quite recovered entirely himself again except that he was less boyish he had been very lively and full of merry nonsense but his ardour for play had gone off with his high spirits and there was a manliness of manner and tone of mind that made him appear above his real age  at the end of a fortnight he volunteered to tell his father that all was right i am not afraid of not keeping my place he said you were quite right papa i am more up to my work than i was ever before and it comes to me quite fresh and pleasant i dont promise to get the randall scholarship if forder and cheviot stay on but i can quite keep up to the mark in school work  thats right said dr may much rejoiced are you sure you do it with ease and without its haunting you at night  oh yes quite sure i cant think what has made dr hoxton set us on in such easy things this time it is very lucky for me for one gets so much less time to oneself as dux  what with keeping order  ay said norman i fancy they think they may take liberties because i am new and young i must have my eye in all corners of the hall at once and do my own work by snatches as i can  can you make them attend to you  why yes pretty well when it comes to the pointwill you or will you not cheviot is a great help too and has all the weight of being the eldest fellow amongst us  but still you find it harder work than learning you had rather have to master the dead language than the live tongues  a pretty deal said norman then added one knows what to be at with the dead better than with the living they dont make parties against one i dont wonder at it it was very hard on some of those great fellows to have me set before them but i do not think it is fair to visit it by putting up the little boys to all sorts of mischief  shameful said the doctor warmly but never mind norman keep your temper and do your own duty and you are man enough to put down such petty spite  i hope i shall manage rightly said norman but i shall be glad if i can get the randall and get away to oxford school is not what it used to be and if you dont think me too young  no i dont certainly not trouble has made a man of you norman and you are fitter to be with men than boys in the meantime if you can be patient with these fellows youll be of great use where you are if there had been any one like you at the head of the school in my time it would have kept me out of no end of scrapes how does tom get on he is not likely to fall into this set i trust  i am not sure said norman he does pretty well on the whole some of them began by bullying him and that made him cling to cheviot and ernescliffe and the better party but lately i have thought anderson junior rather making up to him and i dont know whether they dont think that tempting him over to them would be the surest way of vexing me i have an eye over him and i hope he may get settled into the steadier sort before next half  after a silence norman said papa there is a thing i cant settle in my own mind suppose there had been wrong things done when older boys and excellent ones too were at the head of the school yet they never interfered do you think i ought to let it go on  certainly not or why is power given to you  so i thought said norman i cant see it otherwise i wish i could for it will be horrid to set about it and theyll think it a regular shame in me to meddle oh i know what i came into the study for i want you to be so kind as to lend me your pocket greek testament i gave harry my little one  you are very welcome what do you want it for  norman coloured i met with a sermon the other day that recommended reading a bit of it every day and i thought i should like to try now the confirmation is coming one can always have some quiet by getting away into the cloister  bless you my boy while you go on in this way i have not much fear but that youll know how to manage  normans rapid progress affected another of the household in an unexpected way  margaret my dear i wish to speak to you said miss winter reappearing when margaret thought every one was gone out walking she would have said i am very sorry for itso ominous was the commencementand her expectations were fulfilled when miss winter had solemnly seated herself and taken out her netting i wished to speak to you about dear ethel said the governess you know how unwilling i always am to make any complaint but i cannot be satisfied with her present way of going on  indeed said margaret i am much grieved to hear this i thought she had been taking great pains to improve  so she was at one time i would not by any means wish to deny it and it is not of her learning that i speak but of a hurried careless way of doing everything and an irritability at being interfered with  margaret knew how miss winter often tried ethels temper and was inclined to take her sisters part ethels time is so fully occupied she said  that is the very thing that i was going to observe my dear her time is too much occupied and my conviction is that it is hurtful to a girl of her age  this was a new idea to margaret who was silent longing to prove miss winter wrong and not have to see poor ethel pained by having to relinquish any of her cherished pursuits  you see there is that cocksmoor said miss winter you do not know how far off it is my dear much too great a distance for a young girl to be walking continually in all weathers  thats a question for papa thought margaret  besides continued miss winter those children engross almost all her time and thoughts she is working for them preparing lessons running after them continually it takes off her whole mind from her proper occupations unsettles her and i do think it is beyond what befits a young lady of her age  margaret was silent  in addition said miss winter she is at every spare moment busy with latin and greek and i cannot think that to keep pace with a boy of normans age and ability can be desirable for her  it is a great deal said margaret but  i am convinced that she does more than is right continued miss winter she may not feel any ill effects at present but you may depend upon it it will tell on her byandby besides she does not attend to anything properly at one time she was improving in neatness and orderly habits now you surely must have seen how much less tidy her hair and dress have been  i have thought her hair looking rather rough said margaret disconsolately  no wonder said miss winter for flora and mary tell me she hardly spends five minutes over it in the morning and with a book before her the whole time if i send her up to make it fit to be seen i meet with looks of annoyance she leaves her books in all parts of the schoolroom for mary to put away and her table drawer is one mass of confusion her lessons she does well enough i own though what i should call much too fast but have you looked at her work lately  she does not work very well said margaret who was at that moment though miss winter did not know it regathering a poor childs frock that ethel had galloped through with more haste than good speed  she works a great deal worse than little blanche said miss winter and though it may not be the fashion to say so in these days i consider good needlework far more important than accomplishments well then margaret i should wish you only just to look at her writing  and miss winter opened a french exercisebook certainly containing anything but elegant specimens of penmanship ethels best writing was an upright disjointed niggle looking more like greek than anything else except where here and there it made insane efforts to become runninghand and thereby lost its sole previous good quality of legibility while the lines waved about the sheet in almost any direction but the horizontal the necessity she believed herself under of doing what harry called writing with the end of her nose and her always holding her pen with her fingers almost in the ink added considerably to the difficulty of the performance this being at her best the worst may be supposed to be indescribable when dashed off in a violent hurry and considerably garnished with blots margaret thought she had seen the worst and was sighing at being able to say nothing for it when miss winter confounded her by turning a leaf and showing it was possible to make a still wilder combination of scramble niggle scratch and crookednessand this was supposed to be an amended edition miss winter explained that ethel had in an extremely short time performed an exercise in which no fault could be detected except the writing which was pronounced to be too atrocious to be shown up to m ballompre on being desired to write it over again she had obeyed with a very bad grace and some murmurs about cocksmoor and produced the second specimen which in addition to other defects had some elisions from arrant carelessness depriving it of its predecessors merits of being good french  miss winter had been so provoked that she believed this to be an effect of ill temper and declared that she should certainly have kept ethel at home to write it over again if it had not so happened that dr may had proposed to walk part of the way with her and richard and the governess was unwilling to bring her into disgrace with him margaret was so grateful to her for this forbearance that it disposed her to listen the more patiently to the same representations put in what miss winter fancied different forms margaret was much perplexed she could not but see much truth in what miss winter said and yet she could not bear to thwart ethel whom she admired with her whole heart and that dry experience and prejudiced preciseness did not seem capable of entering into her sisters thirst for learning and action when miss winter said ethel would grow up odd eccentric and blue margaret was ready to answer that she would be superior to every one and when the governess urged her to insist on cocksmoor being given up she felt impatient of that utter want of sympathy for the good work  all that evening margaret longed for a quiet time to reflect but it never came till she was in bed and when she had made up her mind how to speak to ethel it was five times harder to secure her alone even when margaret had her in the room by herself she looked wild and eager and said she could not stay she had some thucydides to do  wont you stay with me a little while quietly said margaret we hardly ever have one of our talks  i didnt mean to vex you dear margaret i like nothing so well only we are never alone and ive no time  pray do spare me a minute ethel for i have something that i must say to you and i am afraid you wont like itso do listen kindly  oh said ethel miss winter has been talking to you i know she said she would tell you that she wants me to give up cocksmoor you arent dreaming of it margaret  indeed dear ethel i should be very sorry but one thing i am sure of that there is something amiss in your way of going on  did she show you that horrid exercise  yes  well i know it was baddish writing but just listen margaret we promised six of the children to print them each a verse of a hymn on a card to learn ritchie did three and then could not go on for the book that the others were in was lost till last evening and then he was writing for papa so i thought i would do them before we went to cocksmoor and that i should squeeze time out of the morning but i got a bit of sophocles that was so horridly hard it ate up all my time and i dont understand it properly now i must get norman to tell me and that ran in my head and made me make a mistake in my sum and have to begin it again then just as i thought i had saved time over the exercise comes miss winter and tells me i must do it over again and scolds me besides about the ink on my fingers she would send me up at once to get it off and i could not find nurse and her bottle of stuff for it so that wasted ever so much more time and i was so vexed that really and truly my hand shook and i could not write any better  no i thought it looked as if you had been in one of your agonies  and she thought i did it on purpose and that made me angry and so we got into a dispute and away went all the little moment i might have had and i was forced to go to cocksmoor as a promise breaker  dont you think you had better have taken pains at first  well so i did with the sense but i hadnt time to look at the writing much  you would have made better speed if you had  oh yes i know i was wrong but it is a great plague altogether really margaret i shant get thucydides done  you must wait a little longer please ethel for i want to say to you that i am afraid you are doing too much and that prevents you from doing things well as you were trying to do last autumn  you are not thinking of my not going to cocksmoor cried ethel vehemently  i want you to consider what is to be done dear ethel you thought last autumn a great deal of curing your careless habits now you seem not to have time to attend you can do a great deal very fast i know but isnt it a pity to be always in a hurry  it isnt cocksmoor that is the reason said ethel  no you did pretty well when you began but you know that was in the holidays when you had no latin and greek to do  oh but margaret they wont take so much time when i have once got over the difficulties and see my way but just now they have put norman into such a frightfully difficult play that i can hardly get on at all with it and theres a new kind of greek verses too and i dont make out from the book how to manage them norman showed me on saturday but mine wont be right when ive got over that i shant be so hurried  but norman will go on to something harder i suppose  i dare say i shall be able to do it  perhaps you might but i want you to consider if you are not working beyond what can be good for anybody you see norman is much cleverer than most boys and you are a year younger and besides doing all his work at the head of the school his whole business of the day you have cocksmoor to attend to and your own lessons besides reading all the books that come into the house now isnt that more than is reasonable to expect any head and hands to do properly  but if i can do it  but can you dear ethel arent you always racing from one thing to another doing them by halves feeling hunted and then growing vexed  i know i have been cross lately said ethel but its the being so bothered  and why are you bothered isnt it that you undertake too much  what would you have me do said ethel in an injured unconvinced voice not give up my children  no said margaret but dont think me very unkind if i say suppose you left off trying to keep up with norman  oh margaret margaret and her eyes filled with tears we have hardly missed doing the same every day since the first latin grammar was put into his hands  i know it would be very hard said margaret but ethel continued in a piteous tone a little sentimental from hie haec hoc up to alcaics and beta thukididou we have gone on together and i cant bear to give it up im sure i can  stop ethel i really doubt whether you can do you know that norman was telling papa the other day that it was very odd dr hoxton gave them such easy lessons  ethel looked very much mortified  you see said margaret kindly we all know that men have more power than women and i suppose the time has come for norman to pass beyond you he would not be cleverer than any one if he could not do more than a girl at home  he has so much more time for it said ethel  thats the very thing now consider ethel his work after he goes to oxford will be doing his very utmostand you know what an utmost that is if you could keep up with him at all you must give your whole time and thoughts to it and when you had done soif you could get all the honours in the universitywhat would it come to you cant take a firstclass  i dont want one said ethel i only cant bear not to do as norman does and i like greek so much  and for that would you give up being a useful steady daughter and sister at home the sort of woman that dear mamma wished to make you and a comfort to papa  ethel was silent and large tears were gathering  you own that that is the first thing  yes said ethel faintly  and that it is what you fail in most  yes  then ethel dearest when you made up your mind to cocksmoor you knew those things could not be done without a sacrifice  yes but i didnt think it would be this  margaret was wise enough not to press her and she sat down and sighed pitifully presently she said margaret if you would only let me leave off that stupid old french and horrid dull reading with miss winter i should have plenty of time for everything and what does one learn by hearing mary read poetry she cant understand  you work dont you but indeed ethel dont say that i can let you leave off anything i dont feel as if i had that authority if it be done at all it must be by papas consent and if you wish me to ask him about it i will only i think it would vex miss winter and i dont think dear mamma would have liked greek and cocksmoor to swallow up all the little common ladylike things  ethel made two or three great gulps margaret must i give up everything and forget all my latin and greek  i should think that would be a great pity said margaret if you were to give up the versemaking and the trying to do as much as norman and fix some time in the dayhalf an hour perhapsfor your greek i think it might do very well  thank you said ethel much relieved im glad you dont want me to leave it all off i hope norman wont be vexed she added looking a little melancholy  but norman had not by any means the sort of sentiment on the subject that she had of course you know ethel said he it must have come to this some time or other and if you find those verses too hard and that they take up too much of your time you had better give them up  ethel did not like anything to be said to be too hard for her and was very near pleading she only wanted time but some recollection came across her and presently she said i suppose it is a wrong sort of ambition to want to learn more in ones own way when one is told it is not good for one i was just going to say i hated being a woman and having these tiresome little triflesmy dutyinstead of learning which is yours norman  im glad you did not said norman for it would have been very silly of you and i assure you ethel it is really time for you to stop or you would get into a regular learned lady and be good for nothing i dont mean that knowing more than other people would make you so but minding nothing else would  this argument from norman himself did much to reconcile ethels mind to the sacrifice she had made and when she went to bed she tried to work out the question in her own mind whether her eagerness for classical learning was a wrong sort of ambition to know what other girls did not and whether it was right to crave for more knowledge than was thought advisable for her she only bewildered herself and went to sleep before she had settled anything but that she knew she must make all give way to papa first and secondly to cocksmoor  meanwhile margaret had told her father all that had passed he was only surprised to hear that ethel had kept up so long with norman and thought that it was quite right that she should not undertake so much agreeing more entirely than margaret had expected with miss winters view that it would be hurtful to body as well as mind  it is perfectly ridiculous to think of her attempting it he said i am glad you have put a stop to it  i am glad i have said margaret and dear ethel behaved so very well if she had resisted it would have puzzled me very much i must have asked you to settle it but it is very odd papa ethel is the one of them all who treats me most as if i had real authority over her she lets me scold her asks my leave never seems to recollect for a moment how little older i am and how much cleverer she is i am sure i never should have submitted so readily and that always makes it more difficult to me to direct her i dont like to take upon me with her because it seems wrong to have her obeying me as if she were a mere child  she is a fine creature said dr may emphatically it just shows the fact the higher the mind the readier the submission but you dont mean that you have any difficulty with the others  oh no no flora never could need any interference especially from me and mary is a thorough good girl i only meant that ethel lays herself out to be ruled in quite a remarkable way i am sure though she does love learning her real love is for goodness and for you papa  ethel would have thought her sacrifice well paid for had she seen her fathers look of mournful pleasure     chapter xix         o ruthful scene when from a nook obscure      his little sister doth his peril see      all playful as she sate she grows demure      she finds full soon her wonted spirits flee      she meditates a prayer to set him free                                           shenstone   the setting sun shone into the great west window of the school at stoneborough on its bare walls the masters desks the forms polished with use and the square inky hacked and hewed chests carved with the names of many generations of boys  about six or eight little boys were clearing away the books or papers that they or those who owned them as fags had left astray and a good deal of talk and laughing was going on among them ha exclaimed one here has harrison left his book behind him that he was showing us the gladiators in and standing by the third masters desk he turned over a page or two of smiths antiquities exclaiming it is full of picturesheres an old man blowing the bellows  let me see cried tom may precipitating himself across the benches and over the desk with so little caution that there was an outcry and to his horror he beheld the ink spilled over mr harrisons book while there august youve been and done it youll catch it resounded on all sides  what good will staring with your mouth open do exclaimed edward anderson the eldest present here a bit of blottingpaper this moment  tom dreadfully frightened handed a sheet torn from an old papercase that he had inherited from harry saying despairingly it wont take it out will it  no little stupid head but dont you see im stopping it from running down the edges or soaking in he wont be the wiser till he opens it again at that place  when he does he will said the bewildered tom  let him it wont tell tales  hes coming cried another boy he is close at the door  anderson hastily shut the book over the blottingpaper which he did not venture to retain in his hand dragged tom down from the desk and was apparently entirely occupied with arranging his own box when mr harrison came in tom crouched behind the raised lid quaking in every limb conscious he ought to confess but destitute of resolution to do so and in a perfect agony as the master went to his desk took up the book and carried it away so unconscious that larkins a great wag only waited till his back was turned to exclaim ha old fellow you dont know what youve got there  hallo may junior will you never leave off staring you wont see a bit farther for it said edward anderson shaking him by the ear come to your senses and know your friends  hell open it gasped tom  so he will but id bet ninety to one it is not at that page or if he does it wont tell tales unless indeed he happened to see you standing there crouching and shaking thats the right way to bring him upon you  but suppose he opens it and knows who was in school  what then dye think we cant stand by each other and keep our own counsel  but the blottingpapersuppose he knows that  there was a laugh all round at this as if harrison knew everyones blottingpaper  yes but harry used to write his name all over hisseeand draw union jacks on it  if he did the date is not there do you think the ink is going to say march 2nd why should not july have done it last half  july would have told if he had said larkins thats no go  ay thats the waythe mays are all like girlscant keep a secretnot one of them there ive done more for you than ever one of them would have doneown itand he strode up to tom and grasped his wrists to force the confession from him  butbut hell ask when he finds it out  let him we know nothing about it dont be coming the good boy over me like your brothers that wont doi know whose eyes are not too shortsighted to read upside down  tom shrank and looked abject clinging to the hope that mr harrison would not open the book for weeks months or years  but the next morning his heart died within him when he beheld the unfortunate piece of blottingpaper displayed by mr harrison with the inquiry whether any one knew to whom it belonged and what made it worse was that his sight would not reach far enough to assure him whether harrys name was on it and he dreaded that norman or hector ernescliffe should recognise the nautical designs however both let it pass and no one through the whole school attempted to identify it one danger was past but the next minute mr harrison opened his smiths antiquities at the page where stood the black witness tom gazed round in despair he could not see his brothers face but edward anderson from the second form returned him a glance of contemptuous encouragement  this book said mr harrison was left in school for a quarter of an hour yesterday when i opened it again it was in this condition do any of you know how it happened a silence and he continued who was in school at this time anderson junior can you tell me anything of it  no sir  you know nothing of it  no sir  cold chills crept over tom as mr harrison looked round to refresh his memory larkins do you know how this happened  no sir said larkins boldly satisfying his conscience because he had not seen the manner of the overthrow  ernescliffe were you there  no sir  toms timid heart fluttered in dim hope that he had been overlooked as mr harrison paused then said remember it is concealment that is the evil not the damage to the book i shall have a good opinion ever after of a boy honest enough to confess may junior i saw you he added hopefully and kindly dont be afraid to speak out if you did meet with a mischance  tom coloured and turned pale anderson and larkins grimaced at him to remind him that they had told untruths for his sake and that he must not betray them it was the justification he wanted he was relieved to fancy himself obliged to tell the direct falsehood for which a long course of petty acted deceits had paved the way for he was in deadly terror of the effects of truth  no sir he could hardly believe he had said the words or that they would be so readily accepted for mr harrison had only the impression that he knew who the guilty person was and would not tell and therefore put no more questions to him but after a few more vain inquiries was baffled and gave up the investigation  tom thought he should have been very unhappy he had always heard that deceit was a heavy burden and would give continual stings but he was surprised to find himself very comfortable on the whole and able to dismiss repentance as well as terror his many underhand ways with richard had taken away the tenderness of his conscience though his knowledge of what was right was clear and he was quite ready to accept the feeling prevalent at stoneborough that truth was not made for schoolboys  the axiom was prevalent but not universal and parties were running high norman may who as head boy had in playhours the responsibility and almost the authority of a master had taken higher ground than was usual even with the welldisposed and felt it his duty to check abuses and malpractices that his predecessors had allowed his friend cheviot and the rightminded set maintained his authority with all their might but harvey anderson regarded his interference as vexatious always took the part of the offenders and opposed him in every possible way thus gathering as his adherents not only the idle and mischievous but the weak and mediocre and among this set there was a positive bitterness of feeling to may and all whom they considered as belonging to him  in shielding tom may and leading him to deceive the younger anderson had gained a conquestin him the mays had fallen from that pinnacle of truth which was a standing reproach to the average stoneborough codeand from that time he was under the especial patronage of his friend he was taught the most ingenious arts of saying a lesson without learning it and of showing up other peoples tasks whispers and signs were directed to him to help him out of difficulties and he was sought out and put forward whenever a forbidden pleasure was to be enjoyed by stealth these were his stimulants under a heavy bondage he was teased and frightened bullied and tormented whenever it was the fancy of ned anderson and his associates to make his timidity their sport he was scorned and illtreated and driven by bodily terror into acts alarming to his conscience dangerous in their consequences and painful in the perpetration and yet among all his sufferings the little coward dreaded nothing so much as truth though it would have set him free at once from this wretched tyranny  excepting on holidays and at hours when the townboys were allowed to go home there were strict rules confining all except the sixth form to their bounds consisting of two large courts and an extensive field bordered by the river and the road on the opposite side of the bridge was a turnpike gate where the keeper exposed stalls of various eatables very popular among the boys chiefly because they were not allowed to deal there gingerbeer could also be procured and there were suspicions that the bottles so called contained something contraband  august said norman as they were coming home from school one evening did i see you coming over the bridge  tom would not answer  so you have been at ballhatchets gate i cant think what could take you there if you want tarts i am sure poor old bettys are just as good what made you go there  nothing said tom  well mind you dont do it again or i shall have to take you in hand which i shall be very sorry to do that man is a regular bad character and neither my father nor dr hoxton would have one of us have anything to do with him as you know  tom was in hopes it was over but norman went on i am afraid you are getting into a bad way why wont you mind what i have told you plenty of times before that no good comes of going after ned anderson and axworthy and that set what were you doing with them today but receiving no answer he went on you always sulk when i speak to you i suppose you think i have no right to row you but i do it to save you from worse you cant never be found out this startled tom but norman had no suspicion if you go on you will get into some awful scrape and papa will be grieved i would not for all the world have him put out of heart about you think of him tom and try to keep straight tom would say nothing only reflecting that his elder brother was harder upon him than any one else would be and norman grew warmer if you let anderson junior get hold of you and teach you his tricks youll never be good for anything he seems goodnatured now but he will turn against you as he did with harry i know how it is and you had better take my word and trust to me and straightforwardness when you get into a mess  im in no scrape said tom so doggedly that norman lost patience and spoke with more displeasure you will be then if you go out of bounds and run andersons errands and shirk work youd better take care it is my place to keep order and i cant let you off for being my brother so remember if i catch you going to ballhatchets again you may make sure of a licking  so the warning closedtom more alarmed at the aspect of right which he fancied terrific and norman with some compunction at having lost temper and threatened when he meant to have gained him by kindness  norman recollected his threat with a qualm of dismay when at the end of the week as he was returning from a walk with cheviot tom darted out of the gatehouse he was flying across the bridge with something under his arm when norman laid a detaining hand on his collar making a sign at the same time to cheviot to leave them  what are you doing here said norman sternly marching tom into the field so youve been there again whats that under your jacket  onlyonly what i was sent for and he tried to squeeze it under the flap  what is it a bottle  onlyonly a bottle of ink  norman seized it and gave tom a fierce angry shake but the indignation was mixed with sorrow oh tom tom these fellows have brought you a pretty pass who would have thought of such a thing from us  tom cowered but felt only terror  speak truth said norman ready to shake it out of him is this for anderson junior  under those eyes flashing with generous sorrowful wrath he dared not utter another falsehood but andersons threats chained him and he preferred his thraldom to throwing himself on the mercy of his brother who loved him he would not speak  i am glad it is not for yourself said norman but do you remember what i said in case i found you there again  oh dont dont cried the boy i would never have gone if they had not made me  made you said norman disdainfully how  they would have thrashed methey pinched my fingers in the boxthey pulled my earsoh dont  poor little fellow said norman but it is your own fault if you wont keep with me or ernescliffe of course they will bully you but i must not let you offi must keep my word tom cried sobbed and implored in vain i cant help it he said and now dont howl i had rather no one knew it it will soon be over i never thought to have this to do to one of us tom roared and struggled till releasing him he said there that will do stop bellowing i was obliged and i cant have hurt you much have i he added more kindly while tom went on crying and turning from him it is nothing to care about i am sure look up and he pulled down his hands say you are sorryspeak the truthkeep with me and no one shall hurt you again  very different this from toms chosen associates but he was still obdurate sullen and angry and would not speak nor open his heart to those kind words after one more i could not help it tom youve no business to be sulky norman took up the bottle opened it smelled and tasted and was about to throw it into the river when tom exclaimed oh dont dont what will they do to me give it to me  did they give you the money to pay for it  yes let me have it  how much was it  fourpence  ill settle that and the bottle splashed in the river now then tom dont brood on it any more heres a chance for you of getting quit of their errands if you will keep in my sight ill take care no one bullies you and you may still leave off these disgraceful tricks and do well  but toms evil spirit whispered that norman had beaten him that he should never have any diversion again and that anderson would punish him and there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing that his perverse silence really distressed his brother  if you will go on in this way i cant help it but youll be sorry some day said norman and he walked thoughtfully on looking back to see whether tom was following as he did slowly meditating on the way how he should avert his tyrants displeasure  norman stood for a moment at the door surveying the court then walked up to a party of boys and laid his hand on the shoulder of one holding a silver fourpence to him anderson junior said he theres your money i am not going to let stoneborough school be turned into a gin palace i give you notice it is not to be now you are not to bully may junior for telling me he did not i found him out  leaving anderson to himself he looked for tom but not seeing him he entered the cloister for it was the hour when he was used to read there but he could not fix his mind he went to the bench where he had lain on the examination day and kneeling on it looked out on the green grass where the graves were mother mother he murmured have i been harsh to your poor little tender sickly boy i couldnt help it oh if you were but here we are all going wrong what shall i do how should tom be kept from this evilit is ruining him mean false cowardly sullenall that is worstand your sonoh mother and all i do only makes him shrink more from me it will break my fathers heart and you will not be there to comfort him  norman covered his face with his hands and a fit of bitter grief came over him but his sorrow was now not what it had been before his fathers resignation had tempered it and soon it turned to prayer resolution and hope  he would try again to reason quietly with him when the alarm of detection and irritation should have gone off and he sought for the occasion but alas tom had learned to look on all reproof as rowing and considered it as an additional injury from a brother who according to the anderson view should have connived at his offences and turned a deafened ear and dogged countenance to all he said the foolish boy sought after the andersons still more and norman became more dispirited about him greatly missing harry that constant companion and follower who would have shared his perplexities and removed half of them in his own part of the school by the influence of his high courageous and truthful spirit  in the meantime richard was studying hard at home with greater hopefulness and vigour than he had ever thrown into his work before suppose ethel had once said to him that when you are a clergyman you could be curate of cocksmoor when there is a church there  when said richard smiling at the presumption of the scheme and yet it formed itself into a sort of definite hope perhaps they might persuade mr ramsden to take him as a curate with a view to cocksmoor and this prospect vague as it was gave an object and hope to his studies every one thought the delay of his examination favourable to him and he now read with a determination to succeed dr may had offered to let him read with mr harrison but richard thought he was getting on pretty well with the help norman gave him for it appeared that ever since normans return from london he had been assisting richard who was not above being taught by a younger brother while on the other hand norman much struck by his humility would not for the world have published that he was fit to act as his elders tutor  one evening when the two boys came in from school tom gave a great start and pulling mary by the sleeve whispered how came that book here  it is mr harrisons  yes i know but how came it here  richard borrowed it to look out something and ethel brought it down  a little reassured tom took up an exciting storybook and ensconced himself by the fire but his agonies were great during the ensuing conversation  norman ethel was exclaiming in delight do you know this book  smith yes it is in the school library  theres everything in it that one wants i do believe here is such an account of ancient galleysi never knew how they managed their banks of rowers beforeoh and the greek houseslook at the pictures too  some of them are the same as mr riverss gems said norman standing behind her and turning the leaves in search of a favourite  oh what did i see is that ink said flora from the opposite side of the table  yes didnt you hear said ethel mr harrison told ritchie when he borrowed it that unluckily one day this spring he left it in school and some of the boys must have upset an inkstand over it but though he asked them all round each denied it how i should hate for such things to happen and it was a prizebook too  while ethel spoke she opened the marked page to show the extent of the calamity and as she did so mary exclaimed dear me how funny why how did harrys blottingpaper get in there  tom shrank into nothing set his teeth and pinched his fingers ready to wish they were on marys throat more especially as the words made some sensation richard and margaret exchanged looks and their father who had been reading sharply raised his eyes and said harrys blottingpaper how do you know that mary  it is harrys said she all unconscious because of that anchor up in one corner and the union jack in the other dont you see ethel  yes said ethel nobody drew that but harry  ay and there are his buttons said mary much amused and delighted with these relics of her beloved harry dont you remember one day last holidays papa desired harry to write and ask mr ernescliffe what clothes he ought to have for the naval school and all the time he was writing the letter he was drawing sailors buttons on his blottingpaper i wonder how ever it got into mr harrisons book  poor marys honest wits did not jump to a conclusion quite so fast as other peoples and she little knew what she was doing when as a great discovery she exclaimed i know harry gave his papercase to tom thats the way it got to school  tom exclaimed his father suddenly and angrily where are you going  to bed muttered the miserable tom twisting his hands a dead silence of consternation fell on all the room mary gazed from one to the other mystified at the effect of her words frightened at her fathers loud voice and at toms trembling confusion the stillness lasted for some moments and was first broken by flora as if she had caught at a probability some one might have used the first blottingpaper that came to hand  come here tom said the doctor in a voice not loud but trembling with anxiety then laying his hand on his shoulder look in my face tom hung his head and his father put his hand under his chin and raised the pale terrified face dont be afraid to tell us the meaning of this if any of your friends have done it we will keep your secret look up and speak out how did your blottingpaper come there  tom had been attempting his former system of silent sullenness but there was anger at mary and fear of his father to agitate him and in his impatient despair at thus being held and questioned he burst out into a violent fit of crying  i cant have you roaring here to distress margaret said dr may come into the study with me  but tom who seemed fairly out of himself would not stir and a screaming and kicking scene took place before he was carried into the study by his brothers and there left with his father mary meantime dreadfully alarmed and perceiving that in some way she was the cause had thrown herself upon margaret sobbing inconsolably as she begged to know what was the matter and why papa was angry with tomhad she made him so  margaret caressed and soothed her to the best of her ability trying to persuade her that if tom had done wrong it was better for him it should be known and assuring her that no one could think her unkind nor a telltale then dismissing her to bed and mary was not unwilling to go for she could not bear to meet tom again only begging in a whisper to ethel that if dear tom had not done it she would come and tell her  i am afraid there is no hope of that sighed ethel as the door closed on mary  after all said flora he has not said anything if he has only done it and not confessed that is not so badit is only the usual fashion of boys  has he been asked did he deny it said ethel looking in normans face as if she hardly ventured to put the question and she only received sorrowful signs as answers at the same moment dr may called him no one spoke margaret rested her head on the sofa and looked very mournful richard stood by the fire without moving limb or feature flora worked fast and ethel leaned back on an armchair biting the end of a paperknife  the doctor and norman came back together i have sent him up to bed said dr may i must take him to harrison tomorrow morning it is a terrible business  has he confessed it said margaret  i can hardly call such a thing a confessioni wormed it out bit by biti could not tell whether he was telling truth or not till i called norman in  but he has not said anything more untrue  yes he has though said dr may indignantly he said ned anderson put the paper there and had been taking up the ink with ittwas his doingthen when i came to crossexamine him i found that though anderson did take up the ink it was tom himself who knocked it downi never heard anything like iti never could have believed it  it must all be ned andersons doing cried flora they are enough to spoil anybody  i am afraid they have done him a great deal of harm said norman  and what have you been about all the time exclaimed the doctor too keenly grieved to be just i should have thought that with you at the head of the school the child might have been kept out of mischief but there have you been going your own way and leaving him to be ruined by the very worst set of boys  normans colour rose with the extreme pain this unjust accusation caused him and his voice though low was not without irritation i have tried i have not done as much as i ought perhaps but  no i think not indeed interrupted his father sending a boy there brought up as he had been without the least tendency to deceit  here no one could see normans burning cheeks and brow bent downwards in the effort to keep back an indignant reply without bursting out in exculpation and richard looked up while the three sisters all at once began oh no no papaand left margaret to finishpoor little tom had not always been quite sincere  indeed and why was i left to send him to school without knowing it the place of all others to foster deceit  it was my fault papa said margaret  and mine put in richard and she continued ethel told us we were very wrong and i wish we had followed her advice it was by far the best but we were afraid of vexing you  every one seems to have been combined to hide what they ought not said dr may though speaking to her much more softly than to norman to whom he turned angrily again pray how came you not to identify this paper  i did not know it said norman speaking with difficulty he ought never to have been sent to school said the doctorthat tendency was the very worst beginning  it was a great pity i was very wrong said margaret in great concern  i did not mean to blame you my dear said her father affectionately i know you only meant to act for the best but and he put his hand over his face and then came the sighing groan which pained margaret ten thousand times more than reproaches and which in an instant dispersed all the indignation burning within norman though the pain remained at his fathers thinking him guilty of neglect but he did not like at that moment to speak in selfjustification  after a short space dr may desired to hear what were the deceptions to which margaret had alluded and made norman tell what he knew of the affair of the blotted book ethel spoke hopefully when she had heard it well do you know i think he will do better now you see edward made him conceal it and he has been going on with it on his mind and in that boys power ever since but now it is cleared up and confessed he will begin afresh and do better dont you think so norman dont you papa  i should have more hope if i had seen anything like confession or repentance said dr may but that provoked me more than alli could only perceive that he was sorry to be found out and afraid of punishment  perhaps when he has recovered the first fright he will come to his better self said margaret for she guessed what indeed was the case that the doctors anger on this first shock of the discovery of the fault he most abhorred had been so great that a fearful cowering spirit would be completely overwhelmed and as there had been no sorrow shown for the fault there had been none of that softening and relenting that won so much love and confidence  every one felt that talking only made them more unhappy they tried to return to their occupations and so passed the time till night then as richard was carrying margaret upstairs norman lingered to say papa i am very sorry you should think i neglected tom i dare say i might have done better for him but indeed i have tried  i am sure you have norman i spoke hastily my boyyou will not think more of it when a thing like this comes on a man he hardly knows what he says  if harry were here said norman anxious to turn from the real loss and grief as well as to talk away that feeling of being apologised to it would all do better he would make a link with tom but i have so little naturally to do with the second form that it is not easy to keep him in sight  yes yes i know that very well it is no ones fault but my own i should not have sent him there without knowing him better but you see how it is normani have trusted to her till i have grown neglectful and it is well if it is not the ruin of him  perhaps he will take a turn as ethel says answered norman cheerfully goodnight papa  i have a blessing to be thankful for in you at least murmured the doctor to himself what other young fellow of that age and spirit would have borne so patiently with my injustice not i i am sure a fine father i show myself to these poor childrenneglect helplessness temperoh maggie  margaret had so bad a headache the next day that she could not come downstairs the punishment was they heard a flogging at the time and an imposition so long that it was likely to occupy a large portion of the playhours till the end of the halfyear his father said and norman silently agreed a very good thing it will keep him out of mischief but margaret only wished she could learn it for him and took upon herself all the blame from beginning to end she said little to her father for it distressed him to see her grieved he desired her not to dwell on the subject caressed her called her his comfort and support and did all he could to console her but it was beyond his power her sisters by listening to her only made her worse dear dear papa she exclaimed how kind he is but he can never depend upon me againi have been the ruin of my poor little tom  well said richard quietly i cant see why you should put yourself into such a state about it  this took margaret by surprise have not i done very wrong and perhaps hurt tom for life  i hope not said richard you and i made a mistake but it does not follow that tom would have kept out of this scrape if we had told my father our notion  it would not have been on my conscience said margarethe would not have sent him to school  i dont know that said richard at any rate we meant to do right and only made a mistake it was unfortunate but i cant tell why you go and make yourself ill by fancying it worse than it is the boy has done very wrong but people get cured of such things in time and it is nonsense to fret as if he were not a mere child of eight years old you did not teach him deceit  no but i concealed itpapa is disappointed when he thought he could trust me  well i suppose no one could expect never to make mistakes said richard in his sober tone  selfsufficiency exclaimed margaret that has been the root of all do you know ritchie i believe i was expecting that i could always judge rightly  you generally do said richard no one else could do half what you do  so you have said papa and all of you till you have spoilt me i have thought it myself ritchie  it is true said richard  but then said margaret i have grown to think much of it and not like to be interfered with i thought i could manage by myself and when i said i would not worry papa it was half because i liked the doing and settling all about the children myself oh if it could have been visited in any way but by poor toms faults  well said richard if you felt so it was a pity though i never should have guessed it but you see you will never feel so again and as tom is only one and there are nine to govern it is all for the best  his deliberate commonsense made her laugh a little and she owned he might be right it is a good lesson against my love of being first but indeed it is difficultpapa can so little bear to be harassed  he could not at first but now he is strong and well it is different  he looks terribly thin and worn still sighed margaret so much older  ay i think he will never get back his young looks but except his weak arm he is quite well  and then hishis quick way of speaking may do harm  yes that was what i feared for tom said richard and there was the mistake i see it now my father always is right in the main though he is apt to frighten one at first and it is what ought to be that he should rule his own house but now margaret it is silly to worry about it any morelet me fetch baby and dont think of it  and margaret allowed his reasonableness and let herself be comforted after all richards solid soberness had more influence over her than anything else     chapter xx         think how simple things and lowly        have a part in natures plan      how the great hath small beginnings        and the child will be a man      little efforts work great actions        lessons in our childhood taught      mould the spirit of that temper        whereby blessed deeds are wrought      cherish then the gifts of childhood        use them gently guard them well      for their future growth and greatness        who can measure who can tell                                     moral songs   the first shock of toms misdemeanour passed away though it still gave many an anxious thought to such of the family as felt responsible for him  the girls were busily engaged in preparing an easter feast for cocksmoor mr wilmot was to examine the scholars and buns and tea were provided in addition to which ethel designed to make a present to every onea great task considering that the cocksmoor funds were reserved for absolute necessaries and were at a very low ebb so that twentyfive gifts were to be composed out of nothing  there was a grand turnout of drawers of rubbish all over margaret raising such a cloud of dust as nearly choked her what cannot rubbish and willing hands effect envelopes and wafer boxes were ornamented with pictures bags needlecases and pincushions beautiful balls tippets both of list and gay print and even sunbonnets and pinafores were contrived to the supreme importance and delight of mary and blanche who found it as good or better than play and ranged their performances in rows till the room looked like a bazaar to provide for boys was more difficult but richard mended old toys and repaired the frames of slates and normans contribution of halfacrown bought mugs marbles and penny knives and there were even hopes that something would remain for bodkins to serve as nozzles to the bellows which were the pride of blanches heart  never were easter gifts the source of more pleasure to the givers especially when the nursery establishment met dr hoxton near the pastrycooks shop and he bestowed on blanche a packet of variegated sugarplums all of which she literally poured out at ethels feet saying i dont want them only let me have one for aubrey because he is so little all the rest are for the poor children at cocksmoor  after this margaret declared that blanche must be allowed to buy the bodkin and give her bellows to jane taylor the only cocksmoor child she knew and to whom she always destined in turn every gift that she thought most successful  so blanche went with flora to the toyshop and there fell in love with a little writingbox that so eclipsed the bellows that she tried to persuade flora to buy it for jane taylor to be kept till she could write and was much disappointed to hear that it was out of the question just then a carriage stopped and from it stepped the pretty little figure of meta rivers  oh how do you do how delightful to meet you i was wondering if we should little blanche too kissing her and heres mrs larpentmrs larpentmiss flora may how is miss may  this was all uttered in eager delight and flora equally pleased answered the inquiries i hope you are not in a hurry proceeded meta i want your advice you know all about schools dont you i am come to get some easter presents for our children and i am sure you can help me  are the children little or big asked flora  oh all sorts and sizes i have some books for the great sensible ones and some stockings and shoes for the tiresome stupid ones but there are some dear little pets that i want nice things for theretheres a doll that looks just fit for little curlyheaded annie langley dont you think so mrs larpent  the price of the doll was a shilling and there were quickly added to it boxes of toys elaborate beadwork pincushions polished blue and green boxes the identical writingcaseeven a small noahs ark meta hardly asked the prices which certainly were not extravagant since she had nearly twenty articles for little more than a pound  papa has given me a benefaction of £5 for my schoolgifts said she is not that charming i wish you would come to the feast now do it is on easter tuesday wont you come  thank you i am afraid we cant i should like it very much  you never will come to me you have no compassion  we should enjoy coming very much perhaps in the summer when margaret is better  could not she spare any of you well i shall talk to papa and make him talk to dr may mrs larpent will tell you i always get my way dont i goodbye see if i dont  she departed and flora returned to her own business but blanches interest was gone dazzled by the more lavish gifts she looked listlessly and disdainfully at bodkins three for twopence i wish i might have bought the writingbox for janet taylor why does not papa give us money to get pretty things for the children said she as soon as they came out  because he is not so rich as miss riverss papa  flora was interrupted by meeting the misses anderson who asked was not that carriage mr riverss of abbotstoke grange  yes we like miss rivers very much said flora resolved to show that she was acquainted  oh do you visit her i knew he was a patient of dr may flora thought there was no need to tell that the only call had been owing to the rain and continued she has been begging us to come to her school feast but i do not think we can manage it  oh indeed the grange is very beautiful is it not  very said flora goodmorning  flora had a little uneasiness in her conscience but it was satisfactory to have put down louisa anderson who never could aspire to an intimacy with miss rivers her little sister looked upwhy flora have you seen the grange  no but papa and norman said so  and blanche showed that the practical lesson on the pomps of the world was not lost on her by beginning to wish they were as rich as miss rivers flora told her it was wrong to be discontented but the answer was i dont want it for myself i want to have pretty things to give away  and her mind could not be turned from the thought by any attempt of her sister even when they met dr may coming out of the hospital blanche renewed the subject she poured out the catalogue of miss riverss purchases making appealing attempts at looking under his spectacles into his eyes and he perfectly understood the tenor of her song  i have had a sight too of little maidens preparing easter gifts said he  have you papa what were they were they as nice as miss riverss  i dont know but i thought they were the best sort of gifts for i saw that plenty of kind thought and clever contrivance went to them ay and some little selfdenial too  papa you look as if you meant something but ours are nothing but nasty old rubbish  perhaps some fairy or something better has brought a wand to touch the rubbish blanche for i think that the maidens gave what would have been worthless kept but became precious as they gave it  do you mean the list of our flannel petticoats papa that mary has made into a tippet  perhaps i meant marys own time and pains as well as the tippet would she have done much good with them otherwise  no she would have played oh then you like the presents because they are our own making i never thought of that was that the reason you did not give us any of your sovereigns to buy things with  perhaps i want my sovereigns for the eleven gaping mouths at home blanche but would not it be a pity to spoil your pleasure you would have lost all the chattering and laughing and buzzing i have heard round margaret of late and i am quite sure miss rivers can hardly be as happy in the gifts that cost her nothing as one little girl who gives her sugarplums out of her own mouth  blanche clasped her papas hand tight and bounded five or six times they are our presents not yours said she yes i see i like them better now  ay ay said the doctor seeing miss riverss must not take the shine out of yours my little maids for if you cant give much you have the pleasure of giving the best of all your labour of love then thinking on and speaking to flora the longer i live the more i see the blessing of being born in a state of life where you cant both eat your cake and give it away  flora never was at ease in a conversation with her father she could not follow him and did not like to show it she answered aside from the mark you would not have blanche underrate miss rivers  no indeed she is as good and sweet a creature as ever came across memost kind to margaret and loving to all the world i like to see one whom care and grief have never set their grip upon most likely she would do like ethel if she had the opportunity but she has not  so she has not the same merit said flora  we dont talk of merit i mean that the power of sacrifice is a great advantage the habit of small sacrifice that is made necessary in a large family is a discipline that onlychildren are without and so with regard to wealth i think people are to be pitied who can give extensively out of such abundance that they can hardly feel the want  in effect they can do much more said flora  i am not sure of that they can of course but it must be at the cost of personal labour and sacrifice i have often thought of the words silver and gold have i none but such as i have give i thee and such as we have it is that does the good the gold if we have it but at any rate the personal influence the very proof of sincerity shown by the exertion and selfdenial tells far more than money lightly come by lightly spent  do you mean that a person who maintained a whole school would do less good than one who taught one child  if the rich person take no pains and leave the school to take care of itselfnay if he only visit it now and then and never let it inconvenience him has he the least security that the scholars are obtaining any real good from it if the teacher of the one child is doing his utmost he is working for himself at least  suppose we could build say our church and school on cocksmoor at once and give our superintendence besides  if things were ripe for it the means would come as it is it is a fine field for ethel and richard i believe it will be the making of them both i am sure it is training ethel or making her train herself as we could never have done without it but here come in and see old mrs robins a visit from you will cheer her up  flora was glad of the interruption the conversation was uncomfortable to her she almost fancied her papa was moralising for their good but that he carried it too far for wealthy people assuredly had it in their power to do great things and might work as hard themselves besides it was finer in them there was so much eclat in their stooping to charity but her knowledge of his character would not allow her to think for a moment that he could say aught but from the bottom of his heartno it was one of his onesided views that led him into paradox it was just like papa and so there was no need to attend to it it was one of his enthusiasms he was so very fond of ethel probably because of her likeness to himself flora thought ethel put almost too forwardthey all helped at cocksmoor and ethel was very queer and unformed and could do nothing by herself the only thing flora did keep in her mind was that her papa had spoken to her as if she were a woman compared with ethel  little blanche made her report of the conversation to mary that it was so nice and now she did not care about miss riverss fine presents at all for papa said what one made oneself was better to give than what one bought and papa said too that it was a good thing not to be rich for then one never felt the miss of what one gave away  margaret who overheard the exposition thought it so much to blanches credit that she could not help repeating it in the evening after the little girl was gone to bed when mr wilmot had come in to arrange the programme for cocksmoor so the little fit of discontent and its occasion the meeting with meta rivers were discussed  yes said mr wilmot those riverses are openhanded they really seem to have so much money that they dont know what to do with it my brother is ready to complain that they spoil his parish it is all meant so well and they are so kindhearted and excellent that it is a shame to find fault and i tell charles and his wife that their grumbling at such a squire proves them the most spoiled of all  indiscriminate liberality asked the doctor i should guess the old gentleman to be rather soft  thats one thing the parish is so small and there are so few to shower all this bounty on and they are so utterly unused to country people they seem to think by laying out money they can get a show set of peasants in rustic cottages just as they have their fancy cows and poultryall that offends the eye out of the way  making it a matter of taste said the doctor  im sure i would said norman aside to ethel whats the use of getting oneself disgusted  one must not begin with showing dislike began ethel or  ayyou like rags dont you but hush  that is just what i should expect of mr rivers said dr may he has cultivated his taste till it is getting to be a disease but his daughter has no lack of wit  perhaps not charles and mary are very fond of her but she is entirely inexperienced and that is a serious thing with so much money to throw about she pays people for sending their children to school and keeping their houses tidy and there is so much given away that it is enough to take away all independence and motive for exertion the people speculate on it and take it as a right byandby there will be a reactionshe will find out she is imposed upon take offence and for the rest of her life will go about saying how ungrateful the poor are  it is a pity good people wont have a little commonsense said dr may but theres something so bewitching in that little girl that i cant give her up i verily believe she will right herself  i have scarcely seen her said mr wilmot she has won papas heart by her kindness to me said margaret smiling you see her beautiful flowers she seems to me made to lavish pleasures on others wherever she goes  oh yes they are most kindhearted said mr wilmot it is only the excess of a virtue that could be blamed in them and they are most valuable to the place she will learn experience in timei only hope she will not be spoiled  flora felt as if her father must be thinking his mornings argument confirmed and she was annoyed but she thought there was no reason why wealth should not be used sensibly and if she were at the head of such an establishment as the grange her charity should be so well regulated as to be the subject of general approbation  she wanted to find some one else on her side and as they went to bed she said to ethel dont you wish we had some of this superfluity of the riverses for poor cocksmoor  i wish we had anything for cocksmoor heres a great hole in my boot and nurse says i must get a new pair that is sevenandsixpence gone i shall never get the first pound made up towards building  and pounds seem nothing to them said flora  yes but if they dont manage right with them ill tell you flora i got into a fit of wishing the other day it does seem such a grievous pity to see those children running to waste for want of daily teaching and jenny hall had forgotten everything i was vexed and thought it was all no use while we could not do more but just then i began to look out the texts ritchie had marked for me to print for them to learn and the first was be thou faithful over a few things and i will make thee ruler over many things and then i thought perhaps we were learning to be faithful with a few things i am sure what they said tonight showed it was lucky we have not more in our hands i should do wrong for ever with the little we have if it were not for ritchie and margaret by the time we have really got the money together for the school perhaps i shall have more sense  got the money as if we ever could  oh yes we shall and will it need not be more than £70 ritchie says and i have twelve shillings for certain put out from the money for hire of the room and the books and clothes and in spite of these horrid boots i shall save something out of this quarter halfacrown at least and i have another plan besides  but flora had to go down to margarets room to bed flora was always ready to throw herself into the present and liked to be the most useful person in all that went forward so that no thoughts of greatness interfered with her enjoyment at cocksmoor  the house seemed wild that easter monday morning ethel mary and blanche flew about in all directions and in spite of much undoing of their own arrangements finished their preparations so much too early that at halfpast eleven mary complained that she had nothing to do and that dinner would never come  many were the lamentations at leaving margaret behind but she answered them by talking of the treat of having papa all to herself for he had lent them the gig and promised to stay at home all the afternoon with her  the first division started on foot directly after dinner the real council of education as norman called them namely mr wilmot richard ethel and mary flora the other member waited to take care of blanche and aubrey who were to come in the gig with the cakes teakettles and prizes driven by norman tom and hector ernescliffe were invited to join the party and many times did mary wish for harry  supremely happy were the young people as they reached the common and heard the shout of tumultuous joy raised by their pupils who were on the watch for them all was now activity everybody tripped into mrs greens house while richard and ethel ran different ways to secure that the fires were burning which they had hired to boil their kettles with the tea in them  then when the kitchen was so full that it seemed as if it could hold no more some kind of order was produced the children were seated on their benches and while the mothers stood behind to listen mr wilmot began to examine as well as he could in so crowded an audience  there was progress yes there was only three were as utterly rude and idealess as they used to be at christmas glimmerings had dawned on most and oneuna mcarthywas fit to come forward to claim mr wilmots promise of a prayerbook she could really read and say the catechismher irish wit and love of learning had outstripped all the restand she was the pride of ethels heart fit now to present herself on equal terms with the stoneborough set as far as her sense was concernedthough alas neither present nor exhortation had succeeded in making her anything in looks but a picturesque tatterdemalion her sandy elf locks streaming over a pair of eyes so dancing and gracieuses that it was impossible to scold her  with beating heart as if her own success in life depended for ever on the way her flock acquitted themselves ethel stood by mr wilmot trying to read answers coming out of the dull mouths of her children and looking exultingly at richard whenever some good reply was made especially when una answered an unexpected question it was too delightful to hear how well she remembered all the history up to the flood and how prettily it came out in her irish accent that made up for all the atrocious stupidity of others who after being told every time since they had begun who gave their names now chose to forget  in the midst while the assembly were listening with admiration to the reading of the scholar next in proficiency to una a boy who could read words of five letters without spelling there was a fresh squeezing at the door and the crowd opening as well as it could in came flora and blanche while normans head was seen for a moment in the doorway  floras whisper to ethel was her first discovery that the closeness and the heat of the room was nearly overpowering her excitement had made all be forgotten could not a window be opened  mrs green interferedit had been nailed up because her husband had the rheumatiz  wheres aubrey asked mary  with norman norman said he would not let him go into the blackhole so he has got him out of doors ethel we must come out you dont know what an atmosphere it is blanche go out to norman  flora flora you dont consider said ethel in an agony  yes yes it is not at all cold let them have their presents out of doors and eat their buns  richard and mr wilmot agreed with flora and the party were turned out ethel did own when she was in the open air that it had been rather hot  normans face was a sight as he stood holding aubrey in his arms to gratify the childs impatience the stifling den the uncouth aspect of the children the head girl so very ragged a specimen thoroughly revolted his somewhat fastidious disposition this was ethels delight to this she made so many sacrifices this was all that her time and labour had effected he did not wish to vex her but it was more than he could stand  however ethel was too much engrossed to look for sympathy it was a fine spring day and on the open space of the common the arrangements were quickly made the children stood in a long line and the baskets were unpacked flora and ethel called the names mary and blanche gave the presents and assuredly the grins courtesies and pulls of the forelock they elicited could not have been more hearty for any of miss riverss treasures the buns and the kettles of tea followedit was perfect delight to entertainers and entertained except when marys dignity was cruelly hurt by normans authoritatively taking a kettle out of her hands telling her she would be the death of herself or somebody else and reducing her to the mere rank of a bun distributor which blanche and aubrey could do just as well while he stalked along with a grave and resigned countenance filling up the cups held out to him by timidlooking children mary next fell in with granny hall who had gone into such an ecstasy over blanche and aubrey that blanche did not know which way to look and aubrey in some fear that the old woman might intend to kiss him returned the compliments by telling her she was ugly up in her face at which she laughed heartily and uttered more vehement benedictions  finally the three best children boys and girls were to be made fit to be seen and recommended by mr wilmot to the sundayschool and penny club at stoneborough and this being proclaimed and the children selected the assembly dispersed mr wilmot rejoicing ethel and richard by saying well really you have made a beginning there is an improvement in tone among those children that is more satisfactory than any progress they may have made  ethels eyes beamed and she hurried to tell flora richard coloured and gave his quiet smile then turned to put things in order for their return  will you drive home richard said norman coming up to him  dont you wish it said richard who had many minor arrangements to make and would have preferred walking home independently  no thank you i have a headache and walking may take it off said norman taking off his hat and passing his fingers through his hair  a headache againi am sorry to hear it  it is only that suffocating den of yours my head ached from the moment i looked into it how can you take ethel into such a hole richard it is enough to kill her to go on with it for ever  it is not so every day said the elder brother quietly it is a warm day and there was an unusual crowd  i shall speak to my father exclaimed norman with somewhat of the supercilious tone that he had now and then been tempted to address to his brother it is not fit that ethel should give up everything health and all to such a set as these they look as if they had been picked out of the gutterdirt squalor everything disgusting and summer coming on too and that horrid place with no window to open it is utterly unbearable  richard stooped to pick up a heavy basket then smiled and said you must get over such things as these if you mean to be a clergyman norman  whatever i am to be it does not concern the girls being in such a place as this i am surprised that you could suffer it  there was no answerrichard was walking off with his basket and putting it into the carriage norman was not pleased with himself but thought it his duty to let his father know his opinion of ethels weekly resort all he wished was to avoid ethel herself not liking to show her his sentiments and he was glad to see her put into the gig with aubrey and mary  they rushed into the drawingroom full of glee when they came home all shouting their news together and had not at first leisure to perceive that margaret had some tidings for them in return mr rivers had been there with a pressing invitation to his daughters schoolfeast and it had been arranged that flora and ethel should go and spend the day at the grange and their father come to dine and fetch them home in the evening margaret had been much pleased with the manner in which the thing was done when dr may who seemed reluctant to accept the proposal that related to himself was called out of the room mr rivers had in a most kind manner begged her to say whether she thought it would be painful to him or whether it might do his spirits good she decidedly gave her opinion in favour of the invitation mr rivers gained his point and she had ever since been persuading her father to like the notion and assuring him it need not be made a precedent for the renewal of invitations to dine out in the town he thought the change would be pleasant for his girls and had therefore consented  oh papa papa thank you cried ethel enraptured as soon as he came into the room how very kind of you how i have wished to see the grange and all norman talks about oh dear i am so glad you are going there too  why what should you do with me said dr may who felt and looked depressed at this taking up of the world again  oh dear i should not like it at all without you it would be no fun at all by ourselves i wish flora would come home how pleased she will be papa i do wish you would look as if you didnt mind it i cant enjoy it if you dont like going  i shall when i am there my dear said the doctor affectionately putting his arm around her as she stood by him it will be a fine days sport for you  but cant you like it beforehand papa  not just this minute ethel said he with his bright sad smile all i like just now is my girls not being able to do without me but well do the best we can so your flock acquitted themselves brilliantly who is your senior wrangler  ethel threw herself eagerly into the history of the examination and had almost forgotten the invitation till she heard the front door open then it was not she but margaret who told floraethel could not as she said enjoy what seemed to sadden her father flora received it much more calmly it will be very pleasant said she it was very kind of papa to consent you will have richard and norman margaret to be with you in the evening  and as soon as they went upstairs ethel began to write down the list of prizes in her school journal while flora took out the best evening frocks to study whether the crape looked fresh enough  the invitation was a convenient subject of conversation for norman had so much to tell his sisters of the curiosities they must look for at the grange that he was not obliged to mention cocksmoor he did not like to mortify ethel by telling her his intense disgust and he knew he was about to do what she would think a great injury by speaking to his father on the subject but he thought it for her real welfare and took the first opportunity of making to his father and margaret a most formidable description of ethels blackhole it quite alarmed margaret but the doctor smiled saying ay ay i know the face norman puts on if he looks into a cottage  well said norman with some mortification all i know is that my head ached all the rest of the day  very likely but your head is not ethels and there were twice as many people as the place was intended to hold  a stuffy hole full of peatsmoke and with a window that cant open at the best of times  peatsmoke is wholesome said dr may looking provoking  you dont know what it is papa or you would never let ethel spend her life there it is poisonous  ill take care of ethel said dr may walking off and leaving norman in a state of considerable annoyance at being thus treated he broke out into fresh exclamations against the horrors of cocksmoor telling margaret she had no idea what a den it was  but norman it cant be so very bad or richard would not allow it  richard is deluded said norman but if he chooses to run after dirty brats why should he take ethel there  my dear norman you know it is all ethels doing  yes i know she has gone crazy after them and given up all her greek for it it is past endurance said norman who had worked himself up into great indignation  well but surely norman it is better they should do what they can for those poor creatures than for ethel to learn greek  i dont know that let those who are fit for nothing else go and drone over a b c with ragged children if they like it is just their vocation but there is an order in everything margaret and minds of a superior kind are intended for higher purposes not to be wasted in this manner  i dont know whether they are wasted said margaret not quite liking normans tone though she had not much to say to his arguments  not wasted not in doing what any one can do i know what youll say about the poor i grant it but high ability must be given for a purpose not to be thrown away it is commonsense that some one must be meant to do the dirty work  i see what you mean norman but i dont quite like that to be called by such a name i think she hesitated dont you think you dislike such things more than  any one must abominate dirt and slovenliness i know what you mean my father thinks tis all nonsense in me but his profession has made him insensible to such things and he fancies every one else is the same now margaret am i unreasonable  i am sure i dont know dear norman said margaret hesitating and feeling it her duty to say something i dare say it was very disagreeable  and you think too that i made a disturbance for nothing  no indeed i dont nor does dear papa i have no doubt he will see whether it is proper for ethel all i think he meant is that perhaps your not being well last winter has made you a little more sensitive in such things  norman paused and coloured he remembered the pain it had given him to find himself incapable of being of use to his father and that he had resolved to conquer the weakness of nerve of which he was ashamed but he did not like to connect this with his fastidious feelings of refinement he would not own to himself that they were over nice and at the bottom of all this justification rankled richards saying that he who cared for such things was unfit for a clergyman normans secret thought was it was all very well for those who could only aspire to parish work in wretched cottagespeople who could distinguish themselves were more useful at the university forming minds and opening new discoveries in learning  was norman quite proof against the consciousness of daily excelling all his competitors his superiority had become even more manifest this easter when cheviot and forder the two elder boys whom he had outstripped left the school avowedly because it was not worth while for them to stay since they had so little chance of the randall scholarship norman had now only to walk over the course no one even approaching him but harvey anderson  meta rivers always said that fine weather came at her call and so it didglowing sunshine streaming over the shaven turf and penetrating even the solid masses of the great cedar  the carriage was sent for the misses may and at two oclock they arrived flora extremely anxious that ethel should comport herself discreetly and ethel full of curiosity and eagerness the only drawback her fears that her papa was doing what he disliked she was not in the least shy and did not think about her manner enough to be troubled by the consciousness that it had a good deal of abruptness and eagerness and that her short sight made her awkward meta met them with outstretched hands and a face beaming with welcome i told you i should get my way she said triumphantly and after her warm greeting she looked with some respect at the face of the miss may who was so very clever it certainly was not what she expected not at all like either of the four sisters she had already seenbrown sallow and with that sharp long nose and the eager eyes and brow a little knit by the desire to see as far as she could it was pleasanter to look at flora  ethel left the talk chiefly to florathere was wonder and study enough farther in the grounds and garden and when mrs larpent tried to enter into conversation with her she let it drop two or three times while she was peering hard at a picture and trying to make out its subject however when they all went out to walk to church ethel lighted up and talked admired and asked questions in her quick eager way which interested mrs larpent greatly the governess asked after norman and no more was wanted to produce a volume of histories of his successes till flora turned as she walked before with meta saying why ethel you are quite overwhelming mrs larpent  but some civil answer convinced ethel that what she said was interesting and she would not be stopped in her account of their anxieties on the day of the examination flora was pleased that meta catching some words begged to hear more and flora gave an account of the matter soberer in terms but quietly setting norman at a much greater distance from all his competitors  after church came the feast in the school it was a large commodious building meta declared it was very tiresome that it was so good inside it was so ugly she should never rest till papa had built her a real beauty they found mr and mrs charles wilmot in the school with a very nice welldressed set of boys and girls andbut there is no need to describe the roastbeef and plumpudding the feast ate merrily and ethel was brilliantly happy waiting on the children and so was sunnyhearted meta flora was too busy in determining what the riverses might be thinking of her and her sister to give herself up to the enjoyment  ethel found a small boy looking ready to cry at an untouched slice of beef she examined him whether he could cut it and at last discovered that as had been the case with one or two of her own brothers at the same age meat was repugnant to him in her vehement manner she flew off to fetch him some pudding and hurrying up as she thought to mr charles wilmot who had been giving it out she thrust her plate between him and the dish and had begun her explanation when she perceived it was a stranger and she stood utterly discomfited not saying i beg your pardon but only blushing awkward and confused as he spoke to her in a goodnatured hospitable manner which showed her it must be mr rivers she obtained her pudding and turning hastily retreated  meta said mr rivers as his daughter came out of the school with him for open and airy as it was the numbers and the dinner made him regard it as norman had viewed the cocksmoor room was that one of the miss mays  yes papa ethel the third the clever one  i thought she must be one of them from her dress but what a difference between her and the others  mr rivers was a great admirer of beauty and meta brought up to be the same was disappointed but consoled herself by admiring flora ethel after the awkwardness was over thought no more of the matter but went on in full enjoyment f the feast the eating finished the making of presents commenced and choice ones they were the smiles of meta and of the children were a pretty sight and ethel thought she had never seen anything so like a beneficent fairy mr and mrs wilmot said their words of counsel and encouragement and by five oclock all was over  oh i am sorry said meta easter wont come again for a whole year and it has been so delightful how that dear little annie smiled and nursed her doll i wish i could see her show it to her mother oh how nice it is i am so glad papa brought me to live in the country i dont think anything can be so charming in all the world as seeing little children happy  ethel could not think how the wilmots could have found it in their heart to regret the liberality of this sweet damsel on whom she began to look with normans enthusiastic admiration  there was time for a walk round the grounds meta doing the honours to flora and ethel walking with mrs larpent both pairs were very good friends and the two sisters admired and were charmed with the beauty of the gardens and conservatoriesethel laying up a rich store of intelligence for margaret but still she was not entirely happy her papa was more and more on her mind he had looked dispirited at breakfast he had a long hard days work before him and she was increasingly uneasy at the thought that it would be a painful effort to him to join them in the evening her mind was full of it when she was conducted with flora to the room where they were to dress and when flora began to express her delight her answer was only that she hoped it was not very unpleasant to papa  it is not worth while to be unhappy about that ethel if it is an effort it will be good for him when he is once here i know he will enjoy it  yes i should think he wouldi hope he will he must like you to have such a friend as miss rivers how pretty she is  now ethel it is high time to dress pray make yourself look nicedont twist up your hair in that anyhow fashion  ethel sighed then began talking fast about some hints on schoolkeeping which she had picked up for cocksmoor  floras glossy braids were in full order while ethel was still struggling to get her plait smooth and was extremely beholden to her sister for taking it into her own hands and doing the best with it that its thinness and roughness permitted and then flora pinched and pulled and arranged ethels frock in vain attempts to make it sit like her ownthose sharp high bones resisted all attempts to disguise them never mind flora it is quite tidy i am sure theredo let me be in peace you are like old nurse  so those are all the thanks i get  well thank you very much dear flora you are a famous person how i wish margaret could see that lovely mimosa  and ethel do take care pray dont poke and spy when you come into the room and dont frown when you are trying to see i hope you wont have anything to help at dinner take care how you manage  ill try said ethel meekly though a good deal tormented as flora went on with half a dozen more injunctions closed by metas coming to fetch them little meta did not like to show them her own bedroomshe pitied them so much when she thought of the contrast she would have liked to put floras arm through hers but she thought it would look neglectful of ethel so she only showed the way downstairs ethel forgot all her sisters orders for there stood her father and she looked most earnestly at his face it was cheerful and his voice sounded well pleased as he greeted meta then resumed an animated talk with mr rivers ethel drew as near him as she could she had a sense of protection and could open to full enjoyment when she saw him bright at the first pause in the conversation the gentlemen turned to the young ladies mr rivers began talking to flora and dr may after a few pleasant words to meta went back to ethel he wanted her to see his favourite pictureshe led her up to them made her put on his spectacles to see them better and showed her their special merits mr rivers and the others joined them ethel said little except a remark or two in answer to her papa but she was very happyshe felt that he liked to have her with him and meta too was struck by the soundness of her few sayings and the participation there seemed to be in all things between the father and daughter  at dinner ethel went on pretty well she was next to her father and was very glad to find the dinner so grand that no sidedish fell to her lot to be carved there was a great deal of pleasant talk such as the girls could understand though they did not join much in it except that now and then dr may turned to ethel as a reference for names and dates to make up for silence at dinner there was a most confidential chatter in the drawingroom flora and meta on one side hand in hand calling each other by their christian names mrs larpent and ethel on the other flora dreaded only that ethel was talking too much and revealing too much in how different style they lived then came the gentlemen dr may begging mr rivers to show ethel one of his prints when ethel stooped more than ever as if her eyelashes were feelers but she was in transports of delight and her embarrassment entirely at an end in her admiration as she exclaimed and discussed with her papa and by her hearty appreciation made mr rivers for the time forget her plainness music followed flora played nicely meta like a welltaught girl ethel went on musing over the engravings the carriage was announced and so ended the day in normans fairyland ethel went home leaning hard against her papa talking to him of raphaels madonnas and looking out at the stars and thinking how the heavenly beauty of those faces that in the prints she had been turning over seemed to be connected with the glories of the darkblue sky and glowing stars as one star differeth from another star in glory murmured she that was the lesson today papa and when she felt him press her hand she knew he was thinking of that last time she had heard the lesson when he had not been with her and her thoughts went with his though not another word was spoken  flora hardly knew when they ceased to talk she had musings equally engrossing of her own she saw she was likely to be very intimate with meta rivers and she was roaming away into schemes for not letting the intercourse drop and hopes of being admitted to many a pleasure as yet little within her reachparties balls london itself and above all the satisfaction of being admired the certainty that mr rivers thought her pretty and agreeable had gratified her all the evening and if he with his refined taste thought so what would others think her only fear was that ethels awkwardness might make an unfavourable impression but at least she said to herself it was anything but vulgar awkwardness  their reflections were interrupted by the fly stopping it was at a little shop in the outskirts of the town and dr may explained that he wanted to inquire for a patient he went in for a moment then came back to desire that they would go home for he should be detained some little time no one need sit up for himhe would let himself in  it seemed a comment on ethels thoughts bringing them back to the present hour that daily work of homely mercy hoping for nothing again was surely the true way of doing service     chapter xxi       watchman how if he will not stand     dogberry why then take no note of him but let him go                                           much ado about nothing   dr may promised margaret that he would see whether the blackhole of cocksmoor was all that norman depicted it and accordingly he came home that way on tuesday evening the next week much to the astonishment of richard who was in the act of so mending the window that it might let in air when open and keep it out when shut neither of which purposes had it ever yet answered  dr may walked in met his daughters look of delight and surprise spoke cheerfully to mrs green a hospital acquaintance of his like half the rest of the country and made her smile and curtsey by asking if she was not surprised at such doings in her house then looked at the children and patted the head that looked most fit to pat inquired who was the best scholar and offered a penny to whoever could spell copper teakettle which being done by three merry mortals and having made him extremely popular he offered ethel a lift and carried her off between him and adams on whom he now depended for driving him since richard was going to oxford at once  it was possible to spare him now dr mays arm was as well as he expected it ever would be he had discarded the sling and could use his hand again but the arm was still stiff and weakhe could not stretch it out nor use it for anything requiring strength it soon grew tired with writing and his daughters feared that it ached more than he chose to confess when they saw it resting in the breast of his waistcoat driving he never would have attempted again even if he could and he had quite given up carvinghe could better bear to sit at the side than at the bottom of the dinnertable  means of carrying margaret safely had been arranged by richard and there was no necessity for longer delaying his going to oxford but he was so unwillingly spared by all as to put him quite into good spirits ethel was much concerned to lose him from cocksmoor and dreaded hindrances to her going thither without his escort but she had much trust in having her father on her side and meant to get authority from him for the propriety of going alone with mary  she did not know how norman had jeopardised her projects but the danger blew over dr may told margaret that the place was clean and wholesome and though more smoky than might be preferred there was nothing to do any one in health any harm especially when the walk there and back was over the fresh moor he lectured ethel herself on opening the window now that she could and advised norman to go and spend an hour in the school that he might learn how pleasant peatsmoke wasa speech norman did not like at all the real touchstone of temper is ridicule on a point where we do not choose to own ourselves fastidious and if it and been from any one but his father norman would not have so entirely kept down his irritation  richard passed his examination successfully and dr may wrote himself to express his satisfaction nothing went wrong just now except little tom who seemed to be justifying richards fears of the consequence of exciting his fathers anger at home he shrank and hesitated at the simplest question if put by his father suddenly and the appearance of cowardice and prevarication displeasing dr may further rendered his tone louder and frightened tom the more giving his manner an air of sullen reserve that was most unpleasant at school it was much the samehe kept aloof from norman and threw himself more into the opposite faction by whom he was shielded from all punishment except what they chose themselves to inflict on him  normans post as head of the school was rendered more difficult by the departure of his friend cheviot who had always upheld his authority harvey anderson did not openly transgress for he had a character to maintain but it was well known throughout the school that there was a wide difference between the boys and that anderson thought it absurd superfluous and troublesome in may not to wink at abuses which appeared to be licensed by long standing when edward anderson axworthy and their set broke through rules it was with the understanding that the second boy in the school would support them if he durst  the summer and the cricket season brought the battle of ballhatchets house to issue the cricket ground was the field close to it and for the last two or three years there had been a frequent custom of despatching juniors to his house for tarts and gingerbeer bottles norman knew of instances last year in which this had led to serious mischief and had made up his mind that at whatever loss of popularity it was his duty to put a stop to the practice  he was an ardent cricketer himself and though the game did not in anticipation seem to him to have all the charms of last year he entered into it with full zest when once engaged but his eye was on all parts of the field and especially on the corner by the bridge and the boys knew him well enough to attempt nothing unlawful within the range of that glance however the constant vigilance was a strain too great to be always kept up and he had reason to believe he was eluded more than once  at last came a capture something like that of tom one which he could not have well avoided making the victim was george larkins the son of a clergyman in the neighbourhood a wild merry varlet who got into mischief rather for the sake of the fun than from any bad disposition  his look of consternation was exaggerated into a most comical caricature in order to hide how much of it was real  so you are at that trick larkins  there that bet is lost exclaimed larkins i laid hill halfacrown that you would not see me when you were mooning over your verses  well i have seen you and now  come you would not thrash a fellow when you have just lost him halfacrown single misfortunes never come alone they say so theres my money and my credit gone to say nothing of ballhatchets gingerbeer  the boy made such absurd faces that norman could hardly help laughing though he wished to make it a serious affair you know larkins i have given out that such things are not to be it is a melancholy fact  ay so you must make an example of me said larkins pretending to look resigned better call all the fellows together hadnt you and make it more effective it would be grateful to ones feelings you know and june added he with a ridiculous confidential air if youll only lay it on soft ill take care it makes noise enough great cry little wool you know  come with me said norman ill take care you are example enough what did you give for those articles  fifteenpence halfpenny rascally dear isnt it but the old rogue makes one pay double for the risk you are making his fortune you have raised his prices fourfold  ill take care of that  why where are you taking me back to him  i am going to gratify your wish to be an example  a gibbet a gibbet cried larkins im to be turned off on the spot where the crime took placea warning to all beholders only let me send home for old neptunes chain if you please sirif you hang me in the combined watchchains of the school i fear they would give way and defeat the purposes of justice  they were by this time at the bridge come in said norman to his follower as he crossed the entrance of the little shop the first time he had ever been there a little cringing shrivelled old man stood up in astonishment  mr may can i have the pleasure sir  mr ballhatchet you know that it is contrary to the rules that there should be any traffic with the school without special permission  yes sirjust nothing sironly when the young gentlemen come here sirim an old man sir and i dont like not to oblige a young gentleman sir pleaded the old man in a great fright  very likely said norman but i am come to give you fair notice i am not going to allow the boys here to be continually smuggling spirits into the school  spirits bless you sir i never thought of no sich a thing tis nothing in life but gingerbeervery cooling drink sir of my wifes making she had the receipt from her grandmother up in leicestershire wont you taste a bottle sir and he hastily made a cork bounce and poured it out  that of course was genuine but norman was up to him in schoolboy phrase  give me yours larkins  no pop ensued larkins enjoying the detection put his hands on his knees and looked wickedly up in the old mans face to see what was coming  bless me it is a little flat i wonder how that happened ill be most happy to change it sir wife whats the meaning of mr larkinss gingerpop being so flat  it is very curious gingerbeer indeed mr ballhatchet said norman and since it is liable to have such strange properties i cannot allow it to be used any more at the school  very well siras you please sir you are the first gentleman as has objected sir  and once for all i give you warning added norman that if i have reason to believe you have been obliging the young gentlemen the magistrates and the trustees of the road shall certainly hear of it  you would not hurt a poor man sir as is drove to ityou as has such a name for goodness  i have given you warning said norman the next time i find any of your bottles in the school fields your licence goes now there are your goods give mr larkins back the fifteenpence i wonder you are not ashamed of such a charge  having extracted the money norman turned to leave the shop larkins triumphant ha theres harrison as the tutor rode by and they touched their caps how he stared my eyes june youll be had up for dealing with old ball and he went into an ecstasy of laughing youve settled him i believe well is justice satisfied  it would be no use thrashing you said norman laughing as he leaned against the parapet of the bridge and pinched the boys ear theres nothing to be got out of you but chaff  larkins was charmed with the compliment  but ill tell you what larkins i cant think how a fellow like you can go and give in to these sneaking underhand tricks that make you ashamed to look one in the face  it is only for the fun of it  well i wish you would find your fun some other way come larkins recollect yourself a littleyou have a home not so far off how do you think your father and mother would fancy seeing you reading the book you had yesterday or coming out of ballhatchets with a bottle of spirits called by a false name  larkins pinched his fingers home was a string that could touch him but it seemed beneath him to own it at that moment a carriage approached the boys whole face lighted up and he jumped forward our own he cried there she is  she was of course his mother and norman though turning hastily away that his presence might prove no restraint saw the boy fly over the door of the open carriage and could have sobbed at the thought of what that meeting was  who was that with you asked mrs larkins when she had obtained leave to have her boy with her while she did her shopping  that was may senior our dux  was it i am very glad you should be with him my dear george he is very kind to you i hope  he is a jolly good fellow said larkins sincerely though by no means troubling himself as to the appropriateness of the eulogy nor thinking it necessary to explain to his mother the terms of the conversation  it was not fruitless larkins did avoid mischief when it was not extremely inviting was more amenable to may senior and having been put in mind by him of his home was not ashamed to bring the thought to the aid of his eyes when on sunday during a long sermon of mr ramsdens he knew that axworthy was making the grimace which irresistibly incited him to make a still finer one  and ballhatchet was so much convinced of that there young may being in earnest that he assured his persuasive customers that it was as much as his licence was worth to supply them  evil and insubordination were more easily kept under than norman had expected when he first made up his mind to the struggle firmness had so far carried the day and the power of manful assertion of the right had been proved contrary to cheviots parting auguries that he would only make himself disliked and do no good  the whole of the school was extremely excited this summer by a proceeding of mr tomkins the brewer who suddenly closed up the footway called randalls alley declaring that there was no right of passage through a certain field at the back of his brewery not only the school but the town was indignant and the mays especially so it had been the doctors way to school forty years ago and there were recollections connected with it that made him regard it with personal affection norman too could not bear to lose it he had not entirely conquered his reluctance to pass that spot in the high street and the loss of the alley would be a positive deprivation to him almost every native of stoneborough felt strongly the encroachment of the brewer and the boys of course carried the sentiment to exaggeration  the propensity to public speaking perhaps added to the excitement for norman may and harvey anderson for once in unison each made a vehement harangue in the schoolcourtandersons a fine specimen of the village hampden style about britons never suffering indignities and freeborn englishmen swelling at injuries  that they do my hearty interjected larkins pointing to an inflamed eye that had not returned to its right dimensions however anderson went on unmoved by the under titter and demonstrated to the full satisfaction of all the audience that nothing could be more illegal and unfounded than the brewers claims  then came a great outburst from norman with all his fathers headlong vehemence the way was the right of the town the walk had been trodden by their forefathers for generations pastit had been made by the good old generoushearted man who loved his town and townspeople and would have heard with shame and anger of a stranger a new inhabitant a grasping radical caring as radicals always did for no rights but for their own chance of unjust gains coming here to stoneborough to cut them off from their own path he talk of liberalism and the rights of the poor he who cut off randalls poor old creatures in the almshouses from their short way and then came some stories of his oppression as a poorlaw guardian which greatly aggravated the wrath of the speaker and audience though otherwise they did not exactly bear on the subject  what would old nicholas randall say to these nineteenthcentury doings finished norman  down with them cried a voice from the throng probably larkinss but there was no desire to investigate it was the universal sentiment down with it hurrah well have our footpath open again down with the fences britons never shall be slaves as larkins finally ejaculated  thats the way to bring it to bear said harvey anderson see if he dares to bring an action against us hurrah  yes thats the way to settle it said norman lets have it down it is an oppressive arbitrary shameful proceeding and well show him we wont submit to it  carried along by the general feeling the whole troop of boys dashed shouting up to the barricade at the entrance of the field and levelled it with the ground a handkerchief was fastened to the top of one of the stakes and waved over the brewhouse wall and some of the boys were for picking up stones and dirt and launching them over in hopes of spoiling the beer but norman put a stop to this and brought them back to the schoolyard still in a noisy state of exultation  it cooled a little byandby under the doubt how their exploit would be taken at home norman found it already known and his father half glad half vexed enjoying the victory over tomkins yet a little uneasy on his sons behalf what will dr hoxton say to the dux said he i didnt know he was to be dux in mischief as well as out of it  you cant call it mischief papa to resent an unwarranted encroachment of our rights by such an old ruffian as that ones blood is up to think of the things he has done  he richly deserves it no doubt said the doctor and yet i wish you had been out of the row if there is any blame you will be the first it will light on  i am glad of it that is but just anderson and i seem to have stirred it upif it wanted stirringfor it was in every fellow there indeed i had no notion it was coming to this when i began  oratory said the doctor smiling ha norman think a little another time my boy before you take the law into your own hands or what is worse into a lot of hands you cant control for good though you may excite them to harm  dr hoxton did not come into school at the usual hour and in the course of the morning sent for may senior to speak to him in his study  he looked very broad awful and dignified as he informed him that mr tomkins had just been with him to complain of the damage that had been done and he appeared extremely displeased that the dux should have been no check on such proceedings  i am sorry sir said norman but i believe it was the general feeling that he had no right to stop the alley and therefore that it could not be wrong to break it down  whether he has a right or not is not a question to be settled by you so i find that you whose proper office it is to keep order have been inflaming the mischievous and aggressive spirit amongst the others i am surprised at you i thought you were more to be depended upon may in your position  norman coloured a good deal and simply answered i am sorry sir  take care then that nothing of the kind happens again said dr hoxton who was very fond of him and did not find fault with him willingly  that the first inflammatory discourse had been made by anderson did not appear to be knownhe only came in for the general reprimand given to the school  it was reported the following evening just as the town boys turned out to go to their homes that old tomkins had his fence up five times higher than before  have at him again say i exclaimed axworthy what business has he coming stopping up ways that were made before he was born  we shall catch it from the doctor if we do said edward anderson he looked in no end of a rage yesterday when he talked about the credit of the school  who cares for the credit of the school said the elder anderson we are out of the school nowwe are townsmenstoneborough boyscitizens not bound to submit to injustice no no the old rogue knew it would not stand if it was brought into court so he brings down old hoxton on us insteada dirty trick he deserves to be punished for  and there was a general shout and yell in reply  anderson said norman you had better not excite them again they are ripe for mischief it will go further than it did yesterdaydont you see  anderson could not afford to get into a scrape without may to stand before him and rather sulkily he assented  it is of no use to rave about old tomkins proceeded norman in his style of popular oratory if it is illegal some one will go to law about it and we shall have our alley again we have shown him our mind once and that is enough if we let him alone now he will see tis only because we are ordered not for his sake it would be just putting him in the right and maybe winning his cause for him to use any more violence theres law for you anderson so now no more about itlet us all go home like rational fellows august wheres august  tom was not visiblehe generally avoided going home with his brother and norman having seen the boys divide into two or three little parties as their roads lay homewards found he had an hour of light for an expedition of his own along the bank of the river he had taken up botany with much ardour and sharing the study with margaret was a great delight to both there was a report that the rare yellow bogbean grew in a meadow about a mile and a half up the river and thither he was bound extremely enjoying the summer evening walk as the fresh dewy coolness sunk on all around and the noises of the town were mellowed by distance and the suns last beams slanted on the green meadows and the mayflies danced and dragonflies darted and fish rose or leaped high in the air or showed their spotted sides and opened and shut their gills as they rested in the clear water and the evening breeze rustled in the tall reeds and brought fragrance from the freshmown hay  it was complete enjoyment to norman after his days study and the rule and watch over the unruly crowd of boys and he walked and wandered and collected plants for margaret till the sun was down and the grasshoppers chirped clamorously while the fernowl purred and the beetle hummed and the skimming swallows had given place to the softwinged bat and the large white owl floating over the fields as it moused in the long grass  the summer twilight was sobering every tint when as norman crossed the cricketfield he heard in the distance a loud shout he looked up and it seemed to him that he saw some black specks dancing in the forbidden field and something like the waving of a flag but it was not light enough to be certain and he walked quickly home  the front door was fastened and while he was waiting to be let in mr harrison walked by and called out you are late at home tonightit is halfpast nine  i have been taking a walk sir  a goodnight was the answer as he was admitted every one in the drawingroom looked up and exclaimed as he entered wheres tom  what he is not come home  no was he not with you  i missed him after school i was persuaded he was come home i have been to look for the yellow bogbean there margaret had not i better go and look for him  yes do said dr may the boy is never off ones mind  a sort of instinctive dread directed normans steps down the open portion of randalls alley and voices growing louder as he came nearer confirmed his suspicions the fence at this end was down and on entering the field a gleam of light met his eye on the grounda cloud of smoke black figures were flitting round it pushing brands into red places and feeding the bonfire  what have you been doing exclaimed norman you have got yourselves into a tremendous scrape  a peal of laughter and shout of randall and stoneborough for ever was the reply  august may junior tom answer me is he here asked norman not solicitous to identify any one  but gruff voices broke in upon them there they are nothing like em for mischief  come young gentlemen said a policeman be off if you please we dont want to have none of you at the station tonight  a general hurryskurry ensued norman alone strong in innocence walked quietly away and as he came forth from the darkness of the alley beheld something scouring away before him in the direction of home it popped in at the front door before him but was not in the drawingroom he strode upstairs called but was not answered and found under the bedclothes a quivering mass consisting of tom with all his clothes on fully persuaded that it was the policeman who was pursuing him     chapter xxii         oh life without thy chequered scene      of right and wrong of weal and woe      success and failure could a ground      for magnanimity be found                                    wordsworth   dr may was called for late the next day friday and spent some time in one of the houses near the river it was nearly eight oclock when he came away and he lingered looking towards the school in hopes of a walk home with his boys  presently he saw norman coming out from under the archway his cap drawn over his face and step gesture and manner betraying that something was seriously wrong he came up almost to his father without seeing him until startled by his exclamation normanwhy norman whats the matter  normans lips quivered and his face was palehe seemed as if he could not speak  wheres tom said the doctor much alarmed has he got into disgrace about this business of tomkins that boy  he has only got an imposition interrupted norman no it is not thatit is myselfand it was only with a gulp and struggle that he brought out the words i am turned down in the school  the doctor started back a step or two aghast whathowspeak norman what have you done  nothing said norman recovering in the desire to reassure his fathernothing  thats right said the doctor breathing freely whats the meaning of ita misunderstanding  yes said norman with bitterness it is all andersons doinga word from him would have set all straightbut he would not i believe from my heart he held his tongue to get me down that he might have the randall  well see you righted said the doctor eagerly come tell me the whole story norman is it about this unlucky business  yes the townfellows were all up about it last evening when we came out of school anderson senior himself began to put them up to having the fence down again yes that he didi remember his very wordsthat tomkins could not bring it into court and so set old hoxton at us well i told them it would not dothought i had settled themsaw them off homeyes simpson and benson and grey up the high street and the others their way i only left axworthy going into a shop when i set off on my walk what could a fellow do more how was i to know that that axworthy would get them together again and take them to this affairpull up the stakessaw them downfor they were hard to get downshy all sorts of things over into the courthoot at old tomkinss man when he told them to be offand make a bonfire of the sticks at last  and harvey anderson was there  nonot he he is too sharpborn and bred attorney as he ishe talked them up to the mischief when my back was turned and then sneaked quietly home quite innocent and out of the scrape  but dr hoxton can never entertain a suspicion that you had anything to do with it  yes he does though he thinks i incited them and tomkins and the policeman declare i was there in the midst of the rowand not one of these fellows will explain how i came at the last to look for tom  not tom himself  he did try to speak poor little fellow but after the other affair his word goes for nothing and so it seems does mine i did think hoxton would have trusted me  and did not he exclaimed dr may  he did not in so many words accuse me ofofbut he told me he had serious charges brought against memr harrison had seen me at ballhatchets setting an example of disregard to rulesand again mr harrison saw me coming in at a late hour last night i know he did i said and i explained where i had been and they asked for proofs i could hardly answer from surprise at their not seeming to believe me but i said you could answer for my having come in with the flowers for my sister  to be sure i willill go this instant he was turning  it is of no use papa tonight dr hoxton has a dinnerparty  he is always having parties i wish he would mind them less and his business more you disbelieved but ill see justice done you norman the first thing tomorrow well  well then i said old ballhatchet could tell that i crossed the bridge at the very time they were doing this pretty piece of work for he was sitting smoking in his porch when i went home and would you believe it the old rascal would not remember who passed that evening it is all his malice and revengenothing else  whywhat have you been doing to him  norman shortly explained the gingerbeer story and adding cheviot told me i should get nothing but illwill and so i haveall those town fellows turn against me now and though they know as well as possible how it was they wont say a word to right me just out of spite because i have stopped them from all the mischief i could  well then  they asked me whethersince i allowed that i had been there at lasti had dispersed the boys i said no i had no time then they desired to know who was there and that i had not seen it was all dark and there had not been a moment and if i guessed it was no affair of mine to say so they ordered me down and had up ned anderson and one or two more who were known to have been in the riot and then they consulted a good while and sent for me mr wilmot was for me i am sure but harrison was against me dr hoxton sat there and made me one of his addresses he said he would not enter on the question whether i had been present at the repetition of the outrage as he called it but what was quite certain was that i had abused my authority and influence in the school i had been setting a bad example and breaking the rules about ballhatchet and so far from repressing mischief i had been the foremost in it making inflammatory harangues leading them to commit violence the first time and the next if not actually taking part in it personally at any rate not preventing it in short he said it was clear i had not weight enough for my postit was some excuse i had been raised to it so youngbut it was necessary to show that proficiency in studies did not compensate for disregard of discipline and so he turned me down below the first six so theres another may in disgrace  it shall not lastit shall not last my boy said dr may pressing normans arm ill see you righted dr hoxton shall hear the whole story i am not for fathers interfering in general but if ever there was a case this is why it is almost actionableinjuring your whole prospects in life and all because he will not take the trouble to make an investigation it is a crying shame  every fellow in the school knows how it was said norman and plenty of them would be glad to tell if they had only the opportunity but he asked no one but those two or three worst fellows that were at the fire and they would not tell on purpose the school will go to destruction nowtheyll get their way and all i have been striving for is utterly undone  you setting a bad example dr hoxton little knows what you have been doing it is a mockery as i have always said to see that old fellow sit wrapped up in his pomposity eating his good dinners and knowing no more what goes on among his boys than this umbrella but he will listen to meand well make those boys confess the wholeay and have up ballhatchet himself to say what your traffic with him was and we will see what old hoxton says to you then norman  dr may and his son felt keenly and spoke strongly there was so much of sympathy and fellowfeeling between them that there was no backwardness on normans part in telling his whole trouble with more confidence than schoolboys often show towards their fathers and dr may entered into the mortification as if he were still at school they did not go into the house but walked long up and down the garden working themselves up into if possible stronger indignation and concerting the explanation for tomorrow when dr may meant to go at once to the headmaster and make him attend to the true version of the story appealing to harvey anderson himself larkins and many others for witnesses there could be hardly a doubt that norman would be thus exculpated but if dr hoxton would not see things in their true light dr may was ready to take him away at once rather than see him suffer injustice  still though comforted by his fathers entire reliance norman was suffering severely under the sense of indignity and grieved that dr hoxton and the other masters should have believed him guiltythat name of may could never again boast of being without reproach to be in disgrace stung him to the quick even though undeservedly and he could not bear to go in meet his sisters and be pitied theres no need they should know of it said he when the minster clock pealing ten obliged them to go indoors and his father agreed they bade each other goodnight with the renewal of the promise that dr hoxton should be forced to hear normans vindication the first thing tomorrow harvey anderson be disappointed of what he meanly triumphed in and norman be again in his post at the head of the school in more honour and confidence than ever putting down evil and making stoneborough what it ought to be  as dr may lay awake in the summers morning meditating on his address to dr hoxton he heard the unwelcome sound of a ring at the bell and in a few minutes a note was brought to him  tell adams to get the gig readyill let him know whether he is to go with me  and in a few minutes the doctor opened normans door and found him dressed and standing by the window reading what up already norman i came to tell you that our affairs must wait till the afternoon it is very provoking for hoxton may be gone out but mr lakes son at groveswood has an attack on the head and i must go at once it is a couple of dozen miles off or more i have hardly ever been there and it may keep me all day  shall you go in the gig shall i drive you said norman looking rather blank  thats what i thought of if you like it i thought you would sooner be out of the way  thank youyes papa shall i come and help you to finish dressing  yes do thank you it will hasten matters only first order in some breakfast what makes you up so early have not you slept  not muchit has been such a hot night  and you have a headache well we will find a cure for that before the day is over i have settled what to say to old hoxton  before another quarter of an hour had passed they were driving through the deep lanes the long grass thickly laden with morning dew which beaded the webs of the spiders and rose in clouds of mist under the influence of the suns rays there was stillness in the air at first then the morning sounds the labourer going forth the world wakening to life the opening houses the children coming out to school in spite of the tumult of feeling norman could not but be soothed and refreshed by the new and fair morning scene and both minds quitted the school politics as dr may talked of past enjoyment of walks or drives home in early dawn the more delicious after a sad watch in a sickroom and told of the fair sights he had seen at such unwonted hours  they had far to go and the heat of the day had come on before they entered the place of their destination it was a woodland village built on a nook in the side of the hill sloping greenly to the river and shut in by a white gate which seemed to gather all in one the little oldfashioned church its yard shaded with trees and enclosed by long white rails the parsonage covered with climbing plants and in the midst of a gay garden and one or two cottages the woods cast a cool shadow and in the meadows by the river rose cocks of newmade hay there was an air of abiding serenity about the whole place save that there stood an old man by the gate evidently watching for the physicians carriage and where the sun fell on that parsonagehouse was a bedroom window wide open with the curtains drawn  thank heaven you are come sir said the old man he is fearfully bad  norman knew young lake who had been a senior boy when he first went to school was a randall scholar and had borne an excellent character and highly distinguished himself at the university and now by all accounts he seemed to be dyingin the height of honour and general esteem dr may went into the house the old man took the horse and norman lingered under the trees in the churchyard watching the white curtains now and then puffed by the fitful summer breeze as he lay on the turf in the shade under the influence of the gentle sadness around resting mind and body from the tossing tumultuous passionate sensations that had kept him restless and miserable through the hot night  he waited longone hour two hours had passed away but he was not impatient and hardly knew how long the time had been before his father and mr lake came out of the house together and after they parted dr may summoned him he of course asked first for the patient not quite so hopeless as at first and the reasons for having been kept so long were detailed with many circumstances of the youths illness and the parents resignation by which dr may was still too deeply touched to have room in his mind for anything besides  they were more than halfway home and a silence had succeeded the conversation about the lake family when norman spoke  papa i have been thinking about it and i believe it would be better to let it alone if you please  not apply to dr hoxton exclaimed his father  well i think not i have been considering it and it does hardly seem to me the right thing you see if i had not you close at hand this could never be explained and it seems rather hard upon anderson who has no father and the other fellows who have theirs farther off  right norman that is what my father before me always said and the way i have always acted myself much better let a few trifles go on not just as one would wish than be for ever interfering but i really think this is a case for it and i dont think you ought to let yourself be influenced by the fear of any partyspirit  it is not only that papai have been thinking a good deal today and there are other reasons of course i should wish dr hoxton to know that i spoke the truth about that walk and i hope you will let him know as i appealed to you but on cooler thoughts i dont believe dr hoxton could seriously suspect me of such a thing as that and it was not on that ground that i am turned down but that i did not keep up sufficient discipline and allowed the outrage as he calls it now you know that is after a fashion true if i had not gone on like an ass the other day and incited them to pull down the fences they would not have done it afterwards and perhaps i ought to have kept on guard longer it was my fault and we cant deny it  dr may made a restless reluctant movement well well i suppose it wasbut it was just as much harvey andersonsand is he to get the scholarship because he has added meanness to the rest  he was not dux said norman with a sigh it was more shabby than i thought was even in him but i dont know that the feeling about him is not one reason there has always been a rivalry and bitterness between us two and if i were to get the upper hand now by means not in the usual course such as the fellows would think ill of it would be worse than ever and i should always feel guilty and ashamed to look at him  overrefining norman muttered dr may  besides dont you remember when his father died how glad you and everyone were to get him a nomination and it was said that if he gained a scholarship it would be such a relief to poor mrs anderson now he has this chance it does seem hard to deprive her of it i should not like to know that i had done so  whew the doctor gave a considering whistle  you could not make it straight papa without explaining about the dealing with ballhatchet and that would be unfair to them all even the old rogue himself for i promised to say nothing about former practices as long as he did not renew them  well i dont want to compromise you norman you know your own ground best but i dont like it at all you dont know the humiliation of disgrace those who have thought highly of you now thinking you changedi dont know how to bear it for you  i dont mind anything while you trust me said norman eagerly not much i mean except mr wilmot you must judge papa and do as you please  no you must judge norman your confidence in me ought not to be a restraint it has always been an understood thing that what you say at home is as if it had not been said as regards my dealings with the masters  i know papa well ill tell you what brought me to this i tumbled about all night in a rage when i thought how they had served me and of hoxtons believing it all and how he might only half give in to your representation and then i gloried in andersons coming down from his height and being seen in his true colours so it went on till morning came and i got up you know you gave me my mothers little thomas a kempis i always read a bit every morning today it was of four things that bring much inward peace and what do you think they were       be desirous my son to do the will of another         rather than thine own      choose always to have less rather than more      seek always the lowest place and to be inferior         to everyone      wish always and pray that the will of god may be         wholly fulfilled in thee   i liked them the more because it was just like her last reading with us and like that letter well then i wondered as i lay on the grass at groveswood whether she would have thought it best for me to be reinstated and i found out that i should have been rather afraid of what you might say when she had talked it over with you  dr may smiled a little at the simplicity with which this last was said but his smile ended in one of his heavy sighs so you took her for your counsellor my boy that was the way to find out what was right  well there was something in the place and in watching poor lakes windows that made me not able to dwell so much on getting on and having prizes and scholarships i thought that caring for those had been driven out of me and you know i never felt as if it were my right when i was made dux but now i find it is all come back it does not do for me to be first i have been what she called elated and been more peremptory than need with the lower boys and gone on in my old way with richard and so i suppose this disgrace has come to punish me i wish it were not disgrace because of our name at school and because it will vex harry so much but since it is come considering all things i suppose i ought not to struggle to justify myself at other peoples expense  his eyes were so dazzled with tears that he could hardly see to drive nor did his father speak at first i cant say anything against it norman but i am sorry and one thing more you should consider if dr hoxton should view this absurd business in the way he seems to do it will stand in your way for ever in testimonials if you try for anything else  do you think it will interfere with my having a confirmation ticket  why no i should not thinksuch a boyish escapade could be no reason for refusing you one  very well then it had better rest if there should be any difficulty about my being confirmed of course we will explain it  i wish every one showed themselves as well prepared half muttered the doctor then after long musing well norman i give up the scholarship poor mrs anderson wants it more than we do and if the boy is a shabby fellow the more he wants a decent education but what do you say to this i make hoxton do you full justice and reinstate you in your proper place and then i take you away at oncesend you to a tutoranything till the end of the long vacation  thank you said norman pausing i dont know papa i am very much obliged to you but i think it would hardly do you would be uncomfortable at seeming to quarrel with dr hoxton and it would be hardly creditable for me to go off in anger  you are right i believe said dr may you judge wisely though i should not have ventured to ask it of you but what is to become of the discipline of the school is that all to go to the dogs  i could not do anything with them if i were restored in this way they would be more set against me it is bad enough as it is but even for my own peace i believe it is better to leave it alone all my comfort in school is over i know and he sighed deeply  it is a most untoward business said the doctor i am very sorry your schooldays should be cloudedbut it cant be helped and you will work yourself into a character again you are full young and can stay for the next randall  norman felt as if while his father looked at him as he now did the rest of the world were nothing to him but perhaps the driving past the school brought him to a different mind for he walked into the house slowly and dejectedly  he told his own story to ethel in the garden not without much difficulty so indignant were her exclamations and it was impossible to make her see that his fathers interference would put him in an awkward position among the boys she would argue vehemently that she could not bear mr wilmot to think ill of him that it was a great shame of dr hoxton and that it was dreadful to let such a boy as harvey anderson go unpunished i really do think it is quite wrong of you to give up your chance of doing good and leave him in his evil ways that was all the comfort she gave norman and she walked in to pour out a furious grumbling upon margaret  dr may had been telling the elder ones and they were in conversation after he had left themmargaret talking with animation and flora sitting over her drawing uttering reluctant assents has he told you poor fellow asked margaret  yes said ethel was there ever such a shame  that is just what i say observed flora i cannot see why the andersons are to have a triumph over all of us  i used to think harvey the best of the two said ethel now i think he is a great deal the worst taking advantage of such a mistake as this how will he ever look norman in the face  really said margaret i see no use in aggravating ourselves by talking of the andersons  i cant think how papa can consent proceeded flora i am sure if i were in his place i should not  papa is so much pleased with dear normans behaviour that it quite makes up for all the disappointment said margaret besides he is very much obliged to him in one way he would not have liked to have to battle the matter with dr hoxton he spoke of normans great good judgment  yes norman can persuade papa to anything said flora  yes i wish papa had not yielded said ethel it would have been just as noble in dear norman and we should not have the apparent disgrace  perhaps it is best as it is after all said flora  why how do you mean said ethel  i think very likely things might have come out now dont look furious ethel indeed i cant help it but really i dont think it is explicable why norman should wish to hush it up unless there were something behind  flora cried ethel too much shocked to bring out another word  if you are unfortunate enough to have such suspicions said margaret quietly i think it would be better to be silent  as if you did not know norman stammered ethel  well said flora i dont wish to think so you know i did not hear norman himself and when papa gives his vehement accounts of things it always puzzles us of the coolerminded sort  it is as great a shame as ever i heard cried ethel recovering her utterance who would you trust if not your own father and brother  yes yes said flora not by any means wishing to displease her sisters if there is such a thing as an excess of generosity it is sure to be among ourselves i only know it does not suit me it will make us all uncomfortable whenever we meet the andersons or mr wilmot or any one else and as to such tenderness to harvey anderson i think it is thrown away  thrown away on the object perhaps said margaret but not in norman  to be sure broke out ethel better be than seem oh dear i am sorry i was vexed with dear old june when he told me i had rather have him now than if he had gained everything and every one was praising himthat i had harvey anderson is welcome to be dux and randall scholar for what i care while norman iswhile he is just what we thought of the last time we read that gospelyou know margaret  he isthat he is said margaret and indeed it is most beautiful to see how what has happened has brought him at once to what she wished when perhaps otherwise it would have been a work of long time  ethel was entirely consoled flora thought of the words tete exaltee and considered herself alone to have sober sense enough to see things in a true lightnot that she went the length of believing that norman had any underhand motives but she thought it very discreet in her to think a prudent father would not have been satisfied with such a desire to avoid investigation  dr may would not trust himself to enter on the subject with dr hoxton in conversation he only wrote a note                                   june 16th  dear dr hoxton  my son has appealed to me to confirm his account of himself on thursday evening last i therefore distinctly state that he came in at halfpast nine with his hands full of plants from the river and that he then went out again by my desire to look for his little brother                                yours very truly                                    r may   a long answer came in return disclaiming all doubt of normans veracity and explaining dr hoxtons grounds for having degraded him there had been misconduct in the school he said for some time past and he did not consider that it was any very serious reproach to a boy of normans age that he had not had weight enough to keep up his authority and had been carried away by the general feeling it had been necessary to make an example for the sake of principle and though very sorry it should have fallen on one of such high promise and general good conduct dr hoxton trusted that it would not be any permanent injury to his prospects as his talents had raised him to his former position in the school so much earlier than usual  the fact was said dr may that old hoxton did it in a passion feeling he must punish somebody and now finding theres no uproar about it he begins to be sorry i wont answer this note ill stop after church tomorrow and shake hands and that will show we dont bear malice  what mr wilmot might think was felt by all to affect them more nearly ethel wanted to hear that he declared his complete conviction of normans innocence and was disappointed to find that he did not once allude to the subject she was only consoled by margarets conjecture that perhaps he thought the headmaster had been hasty and could not venture to say sohe saw into peoples characters and it was notorious that it was just what dr hoxton did not  tom had spent the chief of that saturday in reading a novel borrowed from axworthy keeping out of sight of every one all sunday he avoided norman more scrupulously than ever and again on monday that day was a severe trial to norman the taking the lower place and the sense that excel as much as ever he might in his studies it would not avail to restore him to his former place were more unpleasant when it came to the point than he had expected  he saw the cold manner so different from the readiness with which his tasks had always been met certain as they were of being well done he found himself among the common herd whom he had passed so triumphantly and for a little while he had no heart to exert himself  this was conquered by the strong will and selfrebuke for having merely craved for applause but in the playground he found himself still alonethe other boys who had been raised by his fall shrank from intercourse with one whom they had injured by their silence and the andersons who were wont to say the mays carried every tale home and who still almost expected interference from dr may hardly believed their victory secure and the younger one at least talked spitefully and triumphed in the result of mays meddling and troublesome over strictness such prigs always come to a downfall was the sentiment  norman found himself left out of everything and stood dispirited and weary on the bank of the river wishing for harry wishing for cheviot wishing that he had been able to make a friend who would stand by him thinking it could not be worse if he had let his father reinstate himand a sensation of loneliness and injustice hung heavy at his heart  his first interruption was a merry voice i say june theres no end of river crayfish under that bank and larkinss droll face was looking up at him from that favourite position half stooping his hands on his knees his expression of fun trying to conceal his real anxiety and sympathy  norman turned and smiled and looked for the crayfish and at the same time became aware of hector ernescliffe watching for an opportunity to say i have a letter from alan he knew they wanted as far as little boys ventured to seek after one so much their elder to show themselves his friends and he was grateful he roused himself to hear about alans news and found it was importanthis great friend captain gordon had got a ship and hoped to be able to take him and this might lead to harrys going with him then norman applied himself to the capture of crayfish and larkins grew so full of fun and drollery that the hours of recreation passed off less gloomily than they had begun  if only his own brother would have been his adherent but he saw almost nothing of tom day after day he missed him he was off before him in going and returning from school and when he caught a sight of his face it looked harassed pale and miserable stealing anxious glances after him yet shrinking from his eye but at the same time norman did not see him mingling with his former friends and could not make out how he disposed of himself to be thus continually shunned by his own brother even when the general mass were returning to ordinary terms became so painful that norman was always on the watch to seek for one more conversation with him  he caught him at last in the evening just as they were going home tom why are you running away come with me said he authoritatively and tom obeyed in trembling  norman led the way to the meads tom said he do not let this go on why do you serve me in this way you surely need not turn against me he said with pleading melancholy in his voice  it was not needed tom had flung himself upon the grass and was in an agony of crying even before he had finished the words  tom tom what is the matter have they been bullying you again look up and tell mewhat is it you know i can stand by you still if youll only let me and norman sat by him on the grass and raised his face by a sort of force but the kind words only brought more piteous sobs it was a long time before they diminished enough to let him utter a word but norman went on patiently consoling and inquiring sure at least that here had broken down the sullenness that had always repelled him  at last came the words oh i cannot bear it it is all my doing  whathowyou dont mean this happening to me it is not your doing augustwhat fancy is this  oh yes it is said tom his voice cut short by gasps the remains of the sobs they would not hear me i tried to tell them how you told them not and sent them home i tried to tell about ballhatchetbutbut they wouldntthey said if it had been harry they would have attendedbut they would not believe me oh if harry was but here  i wish he was said norman from the bottom of his heart but you see tom if this sets you on always telling truth i shant think any great harm done  a fresh burst oh they are all so glad they say such things and the mays were never in disgrace before oh norman norman  never mind about that began norman  but you would mind broke in the boy passionately if you knew what anderson junior and axworthy say they say it serves you right and they were going to send me to old ballhatchets to get some of his stuff to drink confusion to the mouth of june and all pragmatical meddlers and when i said i could not go they vowed if i did not i should eat the corks for them and anderson junior called me names and licked me look there he showed a dark blueandred stripe raised on the palm of his hand i could not write well for it these three days and hawes gave me double copies  the cowardly fellows exclaimed norman indignantly but you did not go  no anderson senior stopped them he said he would not have the ballhatchet business begin again  that is one comfort said norman i see he does not dare not to keep order but if youll only stay with me august ill take care they dont hurt you  oh june june and he threw himself across his kind brother i am so very sorry oh to see you put downand hear them and you to lose the scholarship oh dear oh dear and be in disgrace with them all  but tom do cheer up it is nothing to be in such distress at papa knows all about it and while he does i dont care half so much  oh i wishi wish  you see tom said norman after all though it is very kind of you to be sorry for not being able to get me out of this scrape the thing one wants you to be sorry about is your own affair  i wish i had never come to school i wish anderson would leave me alone it is all his fault a meanspirited skulking bullying  hush hush tom he is bad enough but now you know what he is you can keep clear of him for the future now listen you and i will make a fresh start and try if we cant get the mays to be looked on as they were when harry was here let us mind the rules and get into no more mischief  youll keep me from ned anderson and axworthy whispered tom  yes that i will and youll try and speak the truth and be straightforward  i will i will said tom worn out in spirits by his long bondage and glad to catch at the hope of relief and protection  then let us come home and tom put his hand into his brothers as a few weeks back would have seemed most unworthy of schoolboy dignity  thenceforth tom was devoted to norman and kept close to him sure that the instant he was from under his wing his former companions would fall on him to revenge his defection but clinging to him also from real affection and gratitude indolence and timidity were the true root of what had for a time seemed like a positively bad disposition beneath there was a warm heart and sense of right which had been almost stifled for the time in the desire from moment to moment to avoid present trouble or fear under normans care his better self had freer scope he was guarded from immediate terror and kept from the suggestions of the worse sort of boys as much as was in his brothers power and the looks they cast towards him and the sly torments they attempted to inflict by no means invited him back to them the lessons where he had a long inveterate habit of shuffling came under normans eye at the same time he always prepared them in his presence instead of in the most secret manner possible and with all andersons expeditious modes of avoiding the making them of any use norman sat by and gave such help as was fair and just showed him how to learn and explained difficulties and the ingenuity hitherto spent in eluding learning being now directed to gaining it he began to make real progress and find satisfaction in it the comfort of being good dawned upon him once more but still there was much to contend with he had acquired such a habit of prevarication that if by any means taken by surprise his impulse was to avoid giving a straightforward answer and when he recollected his sincerity the truth came with the air of falsehood moreover he was an arrant coward and provoked tricks by his manifest and unreasonable terrors it was no slight exercise of patience that norman underwent but this was the interest he had made for himself and the recovery of the boys attachment and his improvement though slow were a present recompense  ernescliffe larkins and others of the boys held fast to him and after the first excitement was past all the rest returned to their former tone he was decidedly as much respected as ever and at the same time regarded with more favour than when his strictness was resented and as for the discipline of the school that did not suffer anderson felt that for his own credit he must not allow the rules to be less observed than in mays reign and he enforced them upon the reluctant and angry boys with whom he had been previously making common cause dr hoxton boasted to the undermasters that the school had never been in such good order as under anderson little guessing that this was but reaping the fruits of a past victory or that every boy in the whole school gave the highest place in their esteem to the deposed dux  to anderson normans cordial manner and ready support were the strangest part of all only explained by thinking that he deemed it as he tried to do himself merely the fortune of war and was sensible of no injury  and for norman himself when the first shock was over and he was accustomed to the change he found the cessation of vigilance a relief and carried a lighter heart than any time since his mothers death his sisters could not help observing that there was less sadness in the expression of his eyes that he carried his head higher walked with freedom and elasticity of step tossed and flourished the daisy till she shouted and crowed while margaret shrank at such freaks and though he was not much of a laugher himself contributed much sport in the way of bright apposite sayings to the home circle  it was a very unexpected mode of cure for depression of spirits but there could be no question that it succeeded and when a few saturdays after he drove dr may again to groveswood to see young mr lake who was recovering he brought margaret home a whole pile of botanical curiosities and drew his father into an animated battle over natural and linnaean systems which kept the whole party merry with the pros and cons every evening for a week     chapter xxiii         oh the goldenhearted daisies        witnessed there before my youth      to the truth of things with praises        of the beauty of the truthe b browning   margaret see here  the doctor threw into her lap a letter which made her cheeks light up  mr ernescliffe wrote that his fathers friend captain gordon having been appointed to the frigate alcestis had chosen him as one of his lieutenants and offered a nomination as naval cadet for his brother he had replied that the navy was not hectors destination but as captain gordon had no one else in view had prevailed on him to pass on the proposal to harry may  alan wrote in high terms of his captain declaring that he esteemed the having sailed with him as one of the greatest advantages he had ever received and adding that for his own part dr may needed no promise from him to be assured that he would watch over harry like his own brother it was believed that the alcestis was destined for the south american station  a three years business said dr may with a sigh but the thing is done and this is as good as we can hope  far better said margaret what pleasure it must have given him dear harry could not sail under more favourable circumstances  no i would trust to ernescliffe as i would to richard it is kindly done and i will thank him at once where does he date from  from portsmouth he does not say whether he has seen harry  i suppose he waited for my answer suppose i enclose a note for him to give to harry there will be rapture enough and it is a pity he should not have the benefit of it  the doctor sat down to write while margaret worked and mused perhaps on outfits and new shirtsperhaps on harrys lionlocks beneath a blue cap and gold band or perchance on the coral shoals of the pacific  it was one of the quiet afternoons when all the rest were out and which the doctor and his daughter especially valued when they were able to spend one together without interruption soon however a ring at the door brought an impatient exclamation from the doctor but his smile beamed out at the words miss rivers they were great friends in fact on terms of some mutual sauciness though meta was as yet far less at home with his daughters and came in looking somewhat shy  ah your congeners are gone out was the doctors reception you must put up with our sober selves  is flora gone far asked meta  to cocksmoor said margaret i am very sorry she has missed you  shall i be in your way said meta timidly papa has several things to do and said he would call for me here  good luck for margaret said dr may  so they are gone to cocksmoor said meta how i envy them  you would not if you saw the place said dr may i believe norman is very angry with me for letting them go near it  ah but they are of real use there  and miss meta is obliged to take to envying the blackhole of cocksmoor instead of being content with the eglantine bowers of abbotstoke i commiserate her said the doctor  if i did any good instead of harm at abbotstoke  harm exclaimed margaret  they went on very well without me said meta but ever since i have had the class they have been getting naughtier and noisier every sunday and last sunday the prettiest of allthe one i liked best and had done everything forshe began to mimic meheld up her finger as i did and made them all laugh  well that is very bad said margaret but i suppose she was a very little one  no a quick clever one who knew much better about nine years old she used to be always at home in the week dragging about a great baby and we managed that her mother should afford to stay at home and send her to school it seemed such a pity her cleverness should be wasted  the doctor smiled ah depend upon it the tyrantbaby was the best disciplinarian  meta looked extremely puzzled  papa means said margaret that if she was inclined to be conceited the being teased at home might do her more good than being brought forward at school  i have done everything wrong it seems said meta with a shade of what the french call depit i thought it must be right and goodbut it has only done mischief and now papa says they are an ungrateful set and that if it vexes me i had better have no more to do with them  it does not vex you so much as that i hope said margaret  oh i could not bear that said meta but it is so different from what i thought  ah you had an arcadia of good little girls in straw hats such as i see in blanches little books said the doctor all making the young lady an oracle and doing wrongif they do it at allin the simplest way just for an example to the others  dr may how can you know so well but do you really think it is their fault or mine  do you think me a conjurer  well but what do you think  what do mr and mrs charles wilmot think  i know mrs wilmot thinks i spoil my class she spoke to me about making favourites and sometimes has seemed surprised at things which i have done last sunday she told me she thought i had better have a steadier class and i know whom she will give methe great big stupid ones at the bottom of the first class i do believe it is only out of goodnature that she does not tell me not to teach at all i have a great mind i will not i know i do nothing but harm  what shall you say if i tell you i think so too asked the doctor  oh dr may you dont really now does he miss may i am sure i only want to do them good i dont know what i can have done  margaret made her perceive that the doctor was smiling and she changed her tone and earnestly begged to be told what they thought of the case for if she should show her concern at home her father and governess would immediately beg her to cease from all connection with the school and she did not feel at all convinced that mrs wilmot liked to have her there feeling injured by the implied accusation of mismanagement yet with a sense of its truth used to be petted and new to rebuffs yet with a sincere wish to act rightly she was much perplexed by this her first reverse and had come partly with the view of consulting flora though she had fallen on other counsellors  margaret our adviser general said the doctor what do you say put yourself in the place of mrs charles wilmot and say shall miss rivers teach or not  i had rather you would papa  not ii never kept school  well then i being mrs wilmot should certainly be mortified if miss rivers deserted me because the children were naughty i think i think i had rather she came and asked me what she had better do  and you would answer teach for fear of vexing her said meta  i should and also for the sake of letting her learn to teach  the point where only trial shows ones ignorance said dr may  but i dont want to do it for my own sake said meta i do everything for my own sake already  for theirs then said the doctor if teaching will not come by nature you must serve an apprenticeship if you mean to be of service in that line perhaps it was the gift that the fairies omitted  but will it do any good to them  i cant tell but i am sure it would do them harm for you to give it up because it is disagreeable  well said meta with a sigh ill go and talk to mrs wilmot i could not bear to give up anything that seems right just now because of the confirmation  margaret eagerly inquired and it appeared that the bishop had given notice for a confirmation in august and that mr wilmot was already beginning to prepare his candidates whilst mr ramsden always tardy never gave notice till the last moment possible the hope was expressed that harry might be able to profit by this opportunity and harrys prospects were explained to meta then the doctor recollecting something that he wished to say to mr rivers began to ask about the chance of his coming before the time of an engagement of his own  he said he should be here at about halfpast four said meta he is gone to the station to inquire about the trains do you know what time the last comes in  at nine fortyfive said the doctor  that is what we were afraid of it is for bellairs my maid her mother is very ill and she is afraid she is not properly nursed it is about five miles from the milbury station and we thought of letting her go with a dayticket to see about her she could go in the morning after i am up but i dont know what is to be done for she could not get back before i dress for dinner  margaret felt perfectly aghast at the cool tone especially after what had passed  it would be quite impossible said the doctor even going by the eight oclock train and returning by the last she would only have two hours to spareshort enough measure for a sick mother  papa means to give her whatever she wants for any nurse she may get  is there no one with her mother now  a sons wife who they think is not kind poor bellairs was so grateful for being allowed to go home i wonder if i could dress for once without her  do you know old crabbe said the doctor  the dear old man at abbotstoke oh yes of course  there was a very sad case in his family the mother was dying of a lingering illness when the son met with a bad accident the only daughter was a ladysmaid and could not be spared though the brother was half crazy to see her and there was no one to tend them but a wretch of a woman paid by the parish the poor fellow kept calling for his sister in his delirium and at last i could not help writing to the mistress  did she let her come said meta her cheek glowing  as a great favour she let her set out by the mail train after dressing her for a ball with orders to return in time for her toilette for an evening party the next day  oh i remember said margaret her coming here at five in the morning and your taking her home  and when we got to abbotstoke the brother was dead that parish nurse had not attended to my directions and i do believe was the cause of it the mother had had a seizure and was in the most precarious state  surely she stayed  it was as much as her place was worth said the doctor and her wages were the chief maintenance of the family so she had to go back to dress her mistress while the old woman lay there wailing after betsy she did give warning then but before the month was out the mother was dead  meta did not speak and dr may presently rose saying he should try to meet mr rivers in the town and went out meta sat thoughtful and at last sighing said i wonder whether bellairss mother is so very ill i have a great mind to let susan try to do my hair and let bellairs stay a little longer i never thought of that  i do not think you will be sorry said margaret  yes i shall for if my hair does not look nice papa will not be pleased and there is aunt leonora coming how odd it will be to be without bellairs i will ask mrs larpent  oh yes said margaret you must not think we meant to advise but papa has seen so many instances of distress from servants not spared to their friends in illness that he feels strongly on the subject  and i really might have been as cruel as that woman said meta well i hope mrs bellairs may be better and able to spare her daughter i dont know what will become of me without her  i think it will have been a satisfaction in one way said margaret  in what way  dont you remember what you began by complaining of that you could not be of use now i fancy this would give you the pleasure of undergoing a little personal inconvenience for the good of another  meta looked half puzzled half thoughtful and margaret who was a little uneasy at the style of counsel she found herself giving changed the conversation  it was a memorable one to little miss rivers opening out to her as did almost all her meetings with that family a new scope for thought and for duty the code to which she had been brought up taught that servants were the machines of their employers convenience goodnature occasioned much kindliness of manner and intercourse and every luxury and indulgence was afforded freely but where there was any want of accordance between the convenience of the two parties there was no question the master must be the first object the servants remedy was in their own hands  amiable as was mr rivers this merely from indulgence and want of reflection was his principle and his daughter had only been acting on it though she did not know it till the feelings that she had never thought of were thus displayed before her these were her first practical lessons that life was not meant to be passed in pleasing ourselves and being goodnatured at small cost  it was an effort meta was very dependent never having been encouraged to be otherwise and bellairs was like a necessary of life in her estimation but strength of principle came to aid her naturally kindhearted feeling and she was pleased by the idea of voluntarily undergoing a privation so as to test her sincerity  so when her father told her of the inconvenient times of the trains and declared that bellairs must give it up she answered by proposing to let her sleep a night or two there gaily promised to manage very well and satisfied him  her maids grateful looks and thanks recompensed her when she made the offer to her and inspirited her to an energetic coaxing of mrs larpent who being more fully aware than her father of the needfulness of the ladysmaid and also very anxious that her darling should appear to the best advantage before the expected aunt lady leonora langdale was unwilling to grant more than one night at the utmost  meta carried the day and her last assurance to bellairs was that she might stay as long as seemed necessary to make her mother comfortable  thereupon meta found herself more helpful in some matters than she had expected but at a loss in others susan with all mrs larpents supervision could not quite bring her dress to the air that was so peculiarly graceful and becoming and she often caught her papas eye looking at her as if he saw something amiss and could not discover what it was then came aunt leonora always very kind to meta but the dread of the rest of the household whom she was wont to lecture on the proper care of her niece miss rivers was likely to have a considerable fortune and lady leonora intended her to be a very fashionable and much admired young lady under her own immediate protection  the two cousins leonora and agatha talked to her the one of her balls the other of her musicpatronised her and called her their good little cousinwhile they criticised the stiff set of those unfortunate plaits made by susan and laughed as if it was an unheardof concession at bellairss holiday  nevertheless when honoured miss received a note begging for three days longer grace till a niece should come in whom bellairs could place full confidence she took it on herself to return free consent lady leonora found out what she had done and reproved her telling her it was only the way to make those people presume and mrs larpent was also taken to task but decidedly meta did not regret what she had done though she felt as if she had never before known how to appreciate comfort when she once more beheld bellairs stationed at her toilette table  meta was asked about her friends she could not mention any one but mrs charles wilmot and the misses may  physicians daughters oh said lady leonora  and she proceeded to exhort mr rivers to bring his daughter to london or its neighbourhood where she might have masters and be in the way of forming intimacies suited to her connections  mr rivers dreaded londonnever was well there and did not like the trouble of movingwhile meta was so attached to the grange that she entreated him not to think of leaving it and greatly dreaded her aunts influence lady leonora did indeed allow that the grange was a very pretty place her only complaint was the want of suitable society for meta she could not bear the idea of her growing accustomedfor want of something betterto the vicars wife and the pet doctors daughters  flora had been long desirous to effect a regular call at abbotstoke and it was just now that she succeeded mrs charles wilmots little girl was to have a birthday feast at which mary blanche and aubrey were to appear flora went in charge of them and as soon as she had safely deposited them and appointed mary to keep aubrey out of mischief she walked up to the grange not a whit daunted by the report of the very fine ladies who were astonishing the natives of abbotstoke  she was admitted and found herself in the drawingroom with a quick livelylooking lady whom she perceived to be lady leonora and who instantly began talking to her very civilly flora was never at a loss and they got on extremely well her ease and selfpossession without forwardness telling much to her advantage meta came in delighted to see her but of course the visit resulted in no really intimate talk though it was not without effect flora declared lady leonora langdale to be a most charming person and lady leonora on her side asked meta who was that very elegant conversible girl flora may was the delighted answer now that the aunt had committed herself by commendation and she did not retract it she pronounced flora to be something quite out of the common way and supposed that she had had unusual advantages  mr rivers took care to introduce to his sisterinlaw dr may who would fain have avoided it but ended by being in his turn pleased and entertained by her brilliant conversation which she put forth for him as her instinct showed her that she was talking to a man of high ability a perfect gentleman she saw him to be and making out some mutual connections far up in the family tree of the mackenzies she decided that the may family were an acquisition and very good companions for her niece at present while not yet come out so ended the visit with this great triumph for meta who had a strong belief in aunt leonoras power and infallibility and yet had not consulted her about bellairs nor about the school question  she had missed one sundays school on account of her aunts visit but the resolution made beside margarets sofa had not been forgotten she spent her saturday afternoon in a call on mrs wilmot ending with a walk through the village she confessed her ignorance apologised for her blunders and put herself under the direction which once she had fancied too strict and harsh to be followed  and on sunday she was content to teach the stupid girls and abstain from making much of the smoothfaced engaging set she thought it very dull work but she could feel that it was something not done to please herself and whereas her father had feared she would be dull when her cousins were gone he found her more joyous than ever  there certainly was a peculiar happiness about margaret rivers her vexations were but ripples rendering the sunny course of her life more sparkling and each exertion in the way of goodness was productive of so much present joy that the steps of her ladder seemed indeed to be of diamonds  her ladderfor she was indeed mounting upwards she was very earnest in her confirmation preparation most anxious to do right and to contend with her failings but the struggle at present was easy and the hopes joys and incentives shone out more and more upon her in this blithe stage of her life  she knew there was a dark side but hope and love were more present to her than was fear happy those to whom such young days are granted     chapter xxiv         it is the generous spirit who when brought      among the tasks of real life hath wrought      upon the plan that pleased his childish thought      whose high endeavours are an inward light      making the path before him always bright                                           wordsworth   the holidays had commenced about a week when harry now duly appointed to h m s alcestis was to come home on leave as he proudly expressed it  a glad troop of brothers and sisters with the doctor himself walked up to the station to meet him and who was happiest when from the window was thrust out the rosy face with the gold band mary gave such a shriek and leap that two passengers and one guard turned round to look at her to the extreme discomfiture of flora and norman evidenced by one by a grave mary mary by the other by walking off to the extreme end of the platform and trying to look as if he did not belong to them in which he was imitated by his shadow tom  sailor already rather than schoolboy harry cared not for spectators his bound from the carriage and the hug between him and mary would have been worthy of the return from the voyage the next greeting was for his father and the sisters had had their share by the time the two brothers thought fit to return from their calm walk on the platform  grand was it to see that party return to the townthe naval cadet with his arm linked in marys and aubrey clinging to his hand and the others walking behind admiring him as he turned his bright face every moment with some glad question or answer how was margaret oh so much better she had been able to walk across the room with normans arm round herthey hoped she would soon use crutchesand she sat up more and the baby more charming than everfour teethwould soon walksuch a darling then came my dirk the ship our berth papa do ask mr ernescliffe to come here i know he could get leave  mr ernescliffe you used to call him alan said mary  yes but that is all over now you forget what we do on board captain gordon himself calls me mr may  some laughed others were extremely impressed  ha theres ned anderson coming cried mary now let him see you harry  what matters ned anderson to me said harry and with an odd mixture of shamefacedness and cordiality he marched full up to his old schoolfellow and shook hands with him as if able in the plenitude of his officership to afford plenty of goodhumoured superiority tom had meantime subsided out of all view but poor harrys exultation had a fall  well graciously inquired mr may and how is harvey  oh very well we are expecting him home tomorrow  where has he been  to oxford about the randall  harry gave a disturbed wondering look round on seeing edwards air of malignant satisfaction he saw nothing that reassured him except the quietness of normans own face but even that altered as their eyes met before another word could be said however the doctors hand was on harrys shoulder  you must not keep him now ned said hehis sister has not seen him yet  and he moved his little procession onwards still resting on harrys shoulder while a silence had fallen on all and even the young sailor ventured no question only toms lips were quivering and ethel had squeezed normans hand poor harry he muttered this is worst of all i wish we had written it to him  so do i now but we always trusted it would come right oh if i were but a boy to flog that edward  hush ethel remember what we resolved  they were entering their own garden where beneath the shade of the tuliptree margaret lay on her couch her arms were held out and harry threw himself upon her but when he rose from her caress norman and tom were gone  what is this he now first ventured to ask  come with me said dr may leading the way to his study where he related the whole history of the suspicion that norman had incurred he was glad that he had done so in private for harrys indignation and grief went beyond his expectations and when at last it appeared that harvey anderson was actually randallscholar after opening his eyes with the utmost incredulity and causing it to be a second time repeated he gave a gulp or two turned very red and ended by laying his head on the table and fairly sobbing and crying aloud in spite of dirk uniform and manhood  harry why harry my boy we should have prepared you for this said the doctor affectionately we have left off breaking our hearts about it i dont want any comfort now for having gold instead of glitter though at first i was as bad as you  oh if i had but been there said harry combating unsuccessfully with his tears  ah so we all said norman and all your word would have cleared himthat is if you had not been in the thick of the mischief ha july should not you have been on the top of the wall  i would have stood by him at least would not i have given axworthy and anderson two such black eyes as they could not have shown in school for a week they had better look out cried harry savagely  what an officer in her majestys service eh mr may  dont papa dont oh i thought it would have been so happy when i came home to see norman randallscholar oh now i dont care for the ship nor anything again harrys face went down on the table  come come harry said dr may pulling off the spectacles that had become very dewy dont let us make fools of ourselves or they will think we are dying for the scholarship  i dont care for the scholarship but to have june turned downand disgrace  what i care for harry is having june what he is and that i know better now  he is he ishe is june himself and no mistake cried harry with vehemence  the prime of the year is not it said the doctor smiling as he stroked down the blue sleeve as if he thought that generous july did not fall far short of it  that he is exclaimed harry i have never met one fellow like him  it will be a chance if you ever do said dr may that is better than scholarships  it should have been both said harry  norman thinks the disappointment has been very good for him said the doctor  perhaps it made him what he is now all success is no discipline you know  harry looked as if he did not know  perhaps you will understand better byandby but this i can tell you harry that the patient bearing of his vexation has done more to renew normans spirits than all his prosperity see if if has not i believe it is harder to every one of us than to him to ethel especially it is a struggle to be in charity with the andersons  in charity repeated harry papa you dont want us to like a horrid sneaking meanspirited pair like those that have used norman in that shameful way  no certainly not i only want you to feel no more personal anger than if it had been cheviot or some indifferent person that had been injured  i should have hated them all the same cried harry  if it is all the same and it is the treachery you hate i ask no more said the doctor  i cant help it papa i cant if i were to meet those fellows do you think i could shake hands with them if i did not lick ned all down minster street he might think himself lucky  well harry i wont argue any more i have no right to preach forbearance your brothers example is better worth than my precept shall we go back to margaret or have you anything to say to me  harry made no positive answer but pressed close to his father who put his arm round him while the curly head was laid on his shoulder presently he said with a great sigh theres nothing like home  was that what you wanted to say asked dr may smiling as he held the boy more closely to him  no but it will be a long time before i come back they think we shall have orders for the pacific  you will come home our real lion said the doctor how much you will have to tell  yes said harry but oh it is very different from coming home every night not having any one to tell a thing to  do you want to say anything now  i dont know i told you in my letter about the halfsovereign  ay never mind that  and there was one night i am afraid i did not stand by a little fellow that they bullied about his prayers perhaps he would have gone on if i had helped him  does he sail with you  no he was at school if i had told him that he and i would stand by each otherbut he looked so foolish and began to cry i am sorry now  weak spirits have much to bear said the doctor and you stronger ones who dont mind being bullied are meant i suppose to help them as norman has been doing by poor little tommy  it was thinking of normanthat made me sorry i knew there was something else but you see i forget when i dont see you and margaret every day  you have one always near my boy  i know but i cannot always recollect and there is such a row at night on board i cannot think or attend as i ought murmured harry  yes your life sleeping at home in quiet has not prepared you for that trial said the doctor but others have kept upright habits under the same you knowand god helps those who are doing their best  harry sighed  i mean to do my best he added and if it was not for feeling bad i should like it i do like itand his eye sparkled and his smile beamed though the tear was undried  i know you do said dr may smiling and for feeling bad my harry i fear you must do that by sea or land as long as you are in this world god be thanked that you grieve over the feeling but he is ready to aid and knows the trial and you will be brought nearer to him before you leave us  margaret wrote about the confirmation am i old enough  if you wish it harry under these circumstances  i suppose i do said harry uneasily twirling a button  but then if ive got to forgive the andersons  we wont talk any more of that said the doctor here is poor mary reconnoitring to know why i am keeping you from her  then began the scampering up and down the house round and round the garden visiting every pet or haunt or contrivance mary and harry at the head blanche and tom in full career after them and aubrey stumping and scrambling at his utmost speed far behind  not a word passed between norman and harry on the school misadventure but after the outbreak of the latter he treated it as a thing forgotten and brought all his high spirits to enliven the family party richard too returned later on the same day and though not received with the same uproarious joy as harry the elder section of the family were as happy in their way as what blanche called the middleaged the daisy was brought down and the eleven were again all in the same room though there were suppressed sighs from some who reflected how long it might be before they could again assemble  tea went off happily in the garden with much laughing and talking pity to leave such good company said the doctor unwillingly rising at lastbut i must go to the unioni promised ward to meet him there  oh let me walk with you cried harry  and me cried other voices and the doctor proposed that they should wait for him in the meads and extend the walk after the visit richard and ethel both expressing their intention of adhering to margaretthe latter observing how nice it would be to get rid of everybody and have a talk  what have we been doing all this time said dr may laughing  chattering not conversing said ethel saucily  ay the cocksmoor board is going to sit said dr may  what is a board inquired blanche who had just come down prepared for her walk  richard margaret and ethel when they sit upon cocksmoor said dr may  but margaret never does sit on cocksmoor papa  only allegorically blanche said norman  but i dont understand what is a board pursued blanche  mr may in his ship was normans suggestion  poor blanche stood in perplexity what is it really  something wooden headed continued the provoking papa  a board is all wooden not only its head said blanche  exactly so especially at stoneborough said the doctor  it is what papa is when he comes out of the councilroom added ethel  or what every one is while the girls are rigging themselves sighed harry ha heres pollynow we only want flora  and my stethoscope has any one seen my stethoscope exclaimed the doctor beginning to rush frantically into the study diningroom and his own room but failing quietly took up a book and gave up the search which was vigorously pursued by richard flora and mary until the missing article was detected where aubrey had left it in the nook on the stairs after using it for a trumpet and a telescope  ah now my goods will have a chance said dr may as he took it and patted richards shoulder i have my best right hand and margaret will be saved endless sufferings  papa  ay poor dear dont i see what she undergoes when nobody will remember that useful proverb a place for everything and everything in its place i believe one use of her brains is to make an inventory of all the things left about the drawingroom but beyond it it is past her power  yes said flora rather aggrieved i do the best i can but when nobody ever puts anything into its place what can i do singlehanded so no one ever goes anywhere without first turning the house upside down for their property and aubrey and now even baby are always carrying whatever they can lay hands on into the nursery i cant bear it and the worst of it is that she added finishing her lamentation after the others were out at the door papa and ethel have neither of them the least shame about it  no no flora that is not fair exclaimed margaretbut flora was gone  i have shame sighed ethel walking across the room disconsolately to put a book into a shelf  and you dont leave trainants as you used said margaret that is what i meant  i wish i did not said ethel i was thinking whether i had better not make myself pay a forfeit suppose you keep a book for me margaret and make a mark against me at everything i leave about and if i pay a farthing for each it will be so much away from cocksmoor so i must cure myself  and what shall become of the forfeits asked richard  oh they wont be enough to be worth having i hope said margaret  give them to the ladies committee said ethel making a face oh ritchie they are worse than ever we are so glad that flora is going to join it and see whether she can do any good  we said margaret hesitating  ah i know you arent but papa said she mightand you know she has so much tact and management  as norman says observed margaret doubtfully i cannot like the notion of flora going and squabbling with mrs ledwich and louisa anderson  what do you think ritchie asked ethel is it not too bad that they should have it all their own way and spoil the whole female population why the last thing they did was to leave off reading the prayerbook prayers morning and evening and it is much expected that next they will attack all learning by heart  it is too bad said richard but flora can hardly hinder them  it will be one voice said ethel but oh if i could only say half what i have in my mind they must see the error why these thesewhat they call formalthese the tieslinks on to the churchon to what is goodif they dont learn them soundlyrammed down hardyou know what i meanso that they cant remember the firstremember when they did not know themthey will never get to learnknowunderstand when they can understand  my dear ethel dont frown so horribly or it will spoil your eloquence said margaret  i dont understand either said richard gravely not understand when they can understand what do you mean  why ritchie dont you see if they dont learn themhard firm by rote when they cantthey wont understand when they can  if they dont learn when they cant they wont understand when they can puzzled richard making margaret laugh but ethel was too much in earnest for amusement  if they dont learn them by rote when they have strong memories yes thats it she continued they will not know them well enough to understand them when they are old enough  who wont learn and understand what said richard  oh ritchie ritchie why the childrenthe psalmsthe gospelsthe things they ought to know them love them grow up to them before they know the meaning or they wont care memory association affection all those come when one is younger than comprehension  younger than ones own comprehension  richard you are grown more tiresome than ever are you laughing at me  indeed i beg your pardoni did not mean it said richard i am very sorry to be so stupid  my dear ritchie it was only my blunderingnever mind  but what did you mean i want to know indeed ethel  i mean that memory and association come before comprehension so that one ought to know all good thingsfawith familiarity before one can understand because understanding does not make one love oh one does that before and when the first little gleam little bit of a sparklet of the meaning does come then it is so valuable and so delightful  i never heard of a little bit of a sparklet before said richard but i think i do see what ethel means and it is like what i heard and liked in a university sermon some sundays ago saying that these lessons and holy words were to be impressed on us here from infancy on earth that we might be always unravelling their meaning and learn it fully at lastwhere we hope to be  the very same thought exclaimed margaret delighted but after a pause i am afraid the ladies committee might not enter into it in plain english far less in ethels language  now margaret you know i never meant myself i never can get the right words for what i mean  and you leave about your faux commencements as m ballompre would call them for us to stumble over said margaret  but flora would manage said ethel she has power over people and can influence them oh ritchie dont persuade papa out of letting her go  does mr wilmot wish it asked richard  i have not heard him say but he was very much vexed about the prayers said ethel  will he stay here for the holidays  no his father has not been well and he is gone to take his duty he walked with us to cocksmoor before he went and we did so wish for you  how have you been getting on  pretty well on the whole said ethel but oh dear oh dear richard the mcarthys are gone  gone where  oh to wales i knew nothing of it till they were off una and fergus were missing and jane taylor told me they were all gone oh it is so horrid una had really come to be so good and so much in earnest she behaved so well at school and church that even mrs ledwich liked her and she used to read her testament half the day and bring her sundayschool lessons to ask me about oh i was so fond of her and it really seemed to have done some good with her and now it is all lost oh i wish i knew what would become of my poor child  the only hope is that it may not be all lost said margaret  with such a woman for a mother said ethel and going to some heathenish place again if i could only have seen her first and begged her to go to church and say her prayers if i only knew where she is gone but i dont i did think una would have come to wish me goodbye  i am very sorry to lose her said richard  mr wilmot says it is bread cast on the waters said margarethe was very kind in consoling ethel who came home quite in despair  yes he said it was one of the trials said ethel and that it might be better for una as well as for me and i am trying to care for the rest still but i cannot yet as i did for her there are none of the eyes that look as if they were eating up ones words before they come and that smile of comprehension oh they all are such stupid little dolts and so indifferent  why ethel  fancy last fridaymary and i found only eight there  do you remember what a broiling day friday was interrupted margaret miss winter and norman both told me i ought not to let them go and i began to think so when they came home mary was the colour of a peony  oh it would not have signified if the children had been good for anything but all their mothers were out at work and of those that did come hardly one had learned their lessonswilly blake had lost his spellingcard anne harris kicked susan pope and would not say she was sorry mary hale would not know m from n do all our mary would and jane taylor after all the pains i have taken with her when i asked how the israelites crossed the red sea seemed never to have heard of them  margaret could have said that ethel had come in positively crying with vexation but with no diminution of the spirit of perseverance  i am so glad you are come richard she continued you will put a little new life into them they all looked so pleased when we told them mr richard was coming  i hope we shall get on said richard  i want you to judge whether the popes are civilised enough to be dressed for sundayschool oh and the money here is the accountbook  how neatly you have kept it ethel  ah it was for you you know receiptssee arent you surprised  four pounds eighteen and eightpence that is a great deal  the three guineas were mr riverss fees you know then margaret gave us halfasovereign and mary a shilling and there was one that we picked up tumbling about the house and papa said we might have and the twopence were little blanches savings oh ritchie as a bright coin appeared on the book  that is all i could save this term he said  oh it is famous now i do think i may put another whole sovereign away into the purse for the church see here is what we have paid shoesthose did bring our money very low and then i bought a piece of print which cost sixteen shillings but it will make plenty of frocks so you see the balance is actually two pounds nine that is something the nine shillings will go on till we get another fee for i have two frocks ready made for the popes so the two pounds are a real nestegg towards the church  the church repeated rlchard half smiling  i looked in the paper the other day and saw that a chapel had been built for nine hundred pounds said ethel  and you have two  two in eight months ritchie and more will come as we get older i have a scheme in my head but i wont tell you now  nine hundred and a church has to be endowed as well as built you know ethel  oh never mind that now if we can begin and build some good person will come and help ill run and fetch it ritchie i drew out a sketch of what i want it to be  what a girl that is said richard as ethel dashed away  is not she said margaret and she means all so heartily do you know she has spent nothing on her own pleasures not a book not a thing has she bought this year except a present for blanches birthday and some silk to net a purse for harry  i cannot help being sometimes persuaded that she will succeed said richard  faith energy selfdenial perseverance they go a great way said margaret and yet when we look at poor dear ethel and her queer ungainly ways and think of her building a church  neither richard nor margaret could help laughing but they checked it at once and the former said that brave spirit is a reproof to us all  yes said margaret and so is the resolution to mend her little faults  ethel came back having of course mislaid her sketch and much vexed wished to know if it ought to cause her first forfeit but margaret thought these should not begin till the date of the agreement and the three resumed the cocksmoor discussion  it lasted till the return of the walking party so late that they had been stargazing and came in in full dispute as to which was cygnus and which aquila while blanche was talking very grandly of taurus poniatouski and harry begging to be told which constellations he should still see in the southern hemisphere dr may was the first to rectify the globe for the southern latitudes and fingers were affectionately laid on orions studded belt as though he were a friend who would accompany the sailorboy voices grew loud and eager in enumerating the stars common to both and so came bedtime and the globe stood on the table in danger of being forgotten ethel diligently lifted it up and while norman exclaimed at her tidiness margaret told how a new leaf was to be turned and of her voluntary forfeits  a very good plan cried the doctor we cant do better than follow her example  what you papa oh what fun exclaimed harry  so you think i shall be ruined mr monkey how do you know i shall not be the most orderly of all a penny for everything left about confiscated for the benefit of cocksmoor eh  and twopence for pockethandkerchiefs if you please said norman with a gesture of disgust  very well from blanche upwards margaret shall have a book and set down marks against ushold an audit every saturday night what say you blanche  oh i hope flora will leave something about cried blanche dancing with glee     chapter xxv         oh no we never mention her      we never breathe her namesong   a great deal of merriment had come home with harry who never was grave for ten minutes without a strong reaction and distracted the house with his noise and his antics in proportion as it sometimes seemed to the spaces of serious thought and reading spent in the study where dr may did his best to supply mr ramsdens insufficient attention to his confirmation candidates by giving an hour every day to norman ethel and harry he could not lecture but he read with them and his own earnestness was very impressive  the two eldest felt deeply but harry often kept it in doubt whether he were not as yet too young and wild for permanent impressions so rapid were his transitions and so overpowering his high spirits not that these were objected to but there was a feeling that there might as well be moderation in all things and that it would have been satisfactory if under present circumstances he had been somewhat more subdued and diligent  there are your decimals not done yet harry  for harry being somewhat deficient in arithmetic had been recommended to work in that line during his visit at homean operation usually deferred as at present to the evening  i am going to do my sums now flora said harry somewhat annoyed  he really fetched his arithmetic and his voice was soon heard asking how he was ever to put an end to a sum that would turn to nothing but everlasting threes  what have you been doing young ladies asked dr may did you call on miss walkingham  flora and blanche did said ethel i thought you did not want me to go and i had not time besides a london grand young ladyoh and ethel shook her head in disgust  that is not the way you treat meta rivers  oh meta is different she has never been out  i should have been glad for you to have seen miss walkingham said her father pretty manners are improving besides old lady walkingham begged me to send my daughters  i should not have seen her said ethel for she was not well enough to let us in  was it not pushing said flora there were the andersons leaving their card  those andersons exclaimed the doctor i am sick of the very sound of the name as sure as my name is dick may ill include it in margarets book of fines  flora looked dignified  they are always harping on that little trumpery girls nonsense said harry aught aught eight that is eight thousandths eh norman if it was about those two fellows the boys  you would harp only on what affects you said the doctor  no i dont men never do that is one hundred and twentyfifth  one man does it to an hundred and twentyfive women said dr may  it is rather a female defect indeed said margaret  defect said flora  yes said dr may since it is not only irksome to the hearers but leads to the breaking of the ninth commandment  many voices declared in forms of varying severity that it was impossible to speak worse of the andersons than they deserved  andersons again cried dr may one two three four five six forfeits  papa himself for he said the name saucily put in blanche  i think i should like the rule to be made in earnest said ethel  what in order to catch floras pence for cocksmoor suggested harry  no but because it is malice i mean that is if there is dislike or a grudge in our hearts at themtalking for ever of nasty little miserable irritations makes it worse  then why do you do it asked flora i heard you only on sunday declaiming about fanny anderson  ha cried out all at once there goes flora  she looked intensely serious and innocent  i know said ethel it is the very reason i want the rule to be made just to stop us for i am sure we must often say more than is right  especially when we come to the pass of declaring that the ninth commandment cannot be broken in regard to them observed the doctor  most likely they are saying much the same of us said richard  or worse rejoined dr may the injured never hates as much as the injurer  now papa has said the severest thing of all whispered ethel  proving the inexpedience of personalities said dr may and in good time enter the evening postwhy how now mr may are you gone mad  hallo why ho ha hurrah and up went harrys book of decimals to the ceiling coming down upon a candle which would have been overturned on ethels work if it had not been dexterously caught by richard  harry indignantly cried ethel and flora see what you have done and the doctors voice called to order but harry could not heed hear hear he has a fortune an estate  who tell usdont be so absurd who  who mr ernescliffe here is a letter from hector only listen  did you know we had an old faraway english cousin one mr halliday i hardly did though alan was named after him and he belonged to my mother he was a cross old fellow and took no notice of us but within the last year or two his nephew or son or something died and now he is just dead and the lawyer wrote to tell alan he is heiratlaw mr ernescliffe of maplewood does it not sound well it is a beautiful great place in shropshire and alan and i mean to run off to see it as soon as he can have any time on shore  ethel could not help looking at margaret but was ashamed of her impertinence and coloured violently whereas her sister did not colour at all and norman looking down wondered whether alan would make the voyage  oh of course he will he must said harry he would never give up now  norman further wondered whether hector would remain on the stoneborough foundation and mary hoped they should not lose him but there was no great readiness to talk over the event and there soon was a silence broken by flora saying he is no such nobody as louisa anderson said when we  another shout which caused flora to take refuge in playing waltzes for the rest of the evening moreover to the extreme satisfaction of mary she left her crochetneedle on the floor at night while a tumultuous party were pursuing her with it to claim the penny and richard was conveying margaret upstairs ethel found an opportunity of asking her father if he were not very glad of mr ernescliffes good fortune  yes very he is a good fellow and will make a good use of it  and now papa does it not makeyou wont say now you are sorry he came here  she had no answer but a sigh and a look that made her blush for having ventured so far she was so much persuaded that great events must ensue that all the next day she listened to every ring of the bell and when one at last was followed by a light though to her ears manly sounding tread she looked up flushing with expectation  behold she was disappointed miss walkingham was announced and she rose surprised for the lady in question had only come to stoneborough for a couple of days with an infirm mother who having known dr may in old times had made it her especial request that he would let her see his daughters she was to proceed on her journey today and the return of the visit had been by no means expected  flora went forward to receive her wondering to see her so young looking and so unformed she held out her hand with a red wrist and as far as could be seen under her veil coloured when presented to the recumbent margaret how she got into her chair they hardly knew for flora was at that moment extremely annoyed by hearing an illbred peal of marys laughter in the garden close to the window but she thought it best to appear unconscious since she had no power to stop it  margaret thought the stranger embarrassed and kindly inquired for lady walkingham  much the same thank you mumbled a voice down in the throat  a silence until margaret tried another question equally briefly answered and after a short interval the young lady contrived to make her exit with the same amount of gaucherie as had marked her entrance  expressions of surprise at once began and were so loud that when harry entered the room his inquiry was whats the row  miss walkingham said ethel but you wont understand she seemed half wild worse than me  how did you like the pretty improving manners asked harry  manners she had none said flora she highly connected used to the best society  how do you know what the best society do asked harry  the poor thing seemed very shy said margaret  i dont know about shyness said flora  she was stifling a laugh all the time like a rude schoolboy and i thought papa said she was pretty  ay did you think her so asked harry  a great broad red faceand so awkward cried flora indignantly  if one could have seen her face i think she might have been nicelooking said margaret she had pretty golden curls and merry blue eyes rather like harrys  umph said flora beauty and manners seemed to me much on a par this is one of papas swans indeed  i cant believe it was miss walkingham at all said ethel it must have been some boy in disguise  dear me cried margaret starting with the painful timidity of helplessness  do look whether anything is gone wheres the silver inkstand  you dont think she could put that into her pocket said ethel laughing as she held it up  i dont know do harry see if the umbrellas are safe in the hall i wish you would for now i come to remember the walkinghams went at nine this morning miss winter said that she saw the old lady helped into the carriage as she passed margarets eyes looked quite large and terrified she must have been a spythe whole gang will come at night i wish richard was here harry it really is no laughing matter you had better give notice to the police  the more margaret was alarmed the more harry laughed never mind margaret ill take care of you heres my dirk ill stick all the robbers  harry harry oh dont cried margaret raising herself up in an agony of nervous terror oh where is papa will nobody ring the bell and send george for the police  police police thieves murder robbers fire all hands ahoy shouted harry his hands making a trumpet over his mouth  harry how can you said ethel hastily dont you see that margaret is terribly frightened cant you say at once that it was you  you and margaret sank back as there was a general outcry of laughter and wonder  did you know it ethel asked flora severely  i only guessed at this moment said ethel how well you did it harry  well said flora i did think her dress very like margarets shot silk i hope you did not do that any harm  but how did you manage said ethel where did your bonnet come from  it was a new one of adamss wife mary got it for me come in polly they have found it out did you not hear her splitting with laughing outside the window i would not let her come in for fear she should spoil all  and i was just going to give her such a scolding for giggling in the garden said flora and to say we had been as bad as miss walkingham you should not have been so awkward harry you nearly betrayed yourself  he had nobody to teach him but mary said ethel  ah you should have seen me at my ease in minster street no one suspected me there  in minster street oh harry you dont really mean it  i do that was what i did it for i was resolved to know what the nameless ones said of the misses may  hasty and eager inquiries broke out from flora and ethel  oh dr may was very clever certainly very clever had i seen the daughters i said i was going to call there and they said  what oh what harry  they said flora was thought pretty butand as to ethel now how do you think you came off unready  tell me they could not say the same of me at any rate  quite the reverse they called ethel very odd poor girl  i dont mind said ethel they may say what they please of me besides that i believe it is all harrys own invention  nay that is a libel on my invention exclaimed harry if i had drawn on that could i not have told you something much droller  and was that really all said flora  they saidlet me seethat all our noses were too long and that as to floras being a beauty when their brothers called herso droll of thembut harvey called her a stuckup duchess in fact it was the fashion to make a great deal of those mays  i hope they said something of the sailor brother said ethel  no i found if i stayed to hear much more i should be knocking ned down so i thought it time to take leave before he suspected  all this had passed very quickly with much laughter and numerous interjections of amusement and reprobation or delight so excited were the young people that they did not perceive a step on the gravel till dr may entered by the window and stood among them his first exclamation was of consternation margaret my dear child what is the matter  only then did her brother and sisters perceive that margaret was lying back on her cushions very pale and panting for breath she tried to smile and say it was nothing and she was silly but the words were faint from the palpitation of her heart  it was harrys trick said flora indignantly as she flew for the scentbottle while her father bent over margaret harry dressed himself up and she was frightened  oh nonohe did not mean it gasped margaret dont  harry i did not think you could be so cowardly and unfeeling and dr mays look was even more reproachful than his words  harry was dismayed at his sisters condition but the injustice of the wholesale reproach chased away contrition i did nothing to frighten any one he said moodily  now harry you know how you kept on said flora and when you saw she was frightened  i can have no more of this said dr may seeing that the discussion was injuring margaret more and more go away to my study sir and wait till i come to you all of you out of the room flora fetch the sal volatile  let me tell you whispered margaret dont be angry with harry it was  not now not now my dear lie quite still she obeyed took the sal volatile and shut her eyes while he sat leaning anxiously over watching her presently she opened them and looking up said rather faintly and trying to smile i dont think i can be better till you have heard the rights of it he did not mean it  boys never do mean it was the doctors answer i hoped better things of harry  he had no intention began margaret but she still was unfit to talk and her father silenced her by promising to go and hear the boys own account  in the hall he was instantly beset by ethel and mary the former exclaiming papa you are quite mistaken it was very foolish of margaret to be so frightened he did nothing at all to frighten any one  ethels mode of pleading was unfortunate the very foolish of margaret were the very words to displease  do not interfere said her father sternly you only encourage him in his wanton mischief and no one takes any heed how he torments my poor margaret  papa cried harry passionately bursting open the study door tormenting margaret was the last thing i would do  that is not the way to speak harry what have you been doing  with rapid agitated utterance harry made his confession at another time the doctor would have treated the matter as a joke carried too far but which while it called for censure was very amusing but now the explanation that the disguise had been assumed to impose on the andersons only added to his displeasure  you seem to think you have a licence to play off any impertinent freaks you please without consideration for any one he said but i tell you it is not so as long as you are under my roof you shall feel my authority and you shall spend the rest of the day in your room i hope quietness there will bring you to a better mind but i am disappointed in you a boy who can choose such a time and such subjects for insolent unfeeling practical jokes cannot be in a fit state for confirmation  oh papa papa cried the two girls in tones of entreatywhile harry with a burning face and hasty step dashed upstairs without a word  you have been as bad said dr may i say nothing to you mary you knew no better but to see you ethel first encouraging him in his impertinence and terrifying margaret so that i dare say she may be a week getting over it and now defending him and calling her silly is unbearable i cannot trust one of you  only listen papa  i will have no altercation i must go back to margaret since no one else has the slightest consideration for her  an hour had passed away when richard knocked at ethels door to tell her that tea was ready  i have a great mind not to go down said ethel as he looked in and saw her seated with a book  what do you mean  i cannot bear to go down while poor harry is so unjustly used  hush ethel  i cannot hush just because margaret fancies robbers and murderers and all sorts of nonsense as she always did is poor harry to be accused of wantonly terrifying her and shut up and cut off from confirmation and just when he is going away too it is unkind and unjust and  ethel you will be sorry  papa will be sorry continued ethel disregarding the caution it is very unfair that i will say so it was all nonsense of margarets but he will always make everything give way to her and poor harry just going to sea no ritchie i cannot come down i cannot behave as usual  you will grieve margaret much more said richard  i cant help thatshe should not have made such a fuss  richard was somewhat in difficulties how to answer but at that moment harrys door which was next was slightly opened and his voice said go down ethel the captain may punish any one he pleases and it is mutiny in the rest of the crew to take his part  harry is in the right said richard it is our duty not to question our fathers judgments it would be wrong of you to stay up  wrong said ethel  of course it would be against the articles of war said harry opening his door another inch but ritchie i say do tell me whether it has hurt margaret  she is better now said richard but she has a headache chiefly i believe from distress at having brought this on you she is very sorry for her fright  i had not the least intention of frightening the most fearsome little tender mouse on earth said harry  no indeed said ethel  and at another time it would not have signified said richard but you know margaret always was timid and now the not being able to move and the being out of health has made her nerves weak so that she cannot help it  the fault was in our never heeding her when we were so eager to hear harrys story said ethel that was what made the palpitation so bad but now papa knows all does he not understand about harry  he was obliged to go out as soon as margaret was better said richard and was scarcely come in when i came up  go down ethel repeated harry never mind me norman told me that sort of joke never answered and i might have minded him  the voice was very much troubled and it brought back that burning sensation of indignant tears to ethels eyes  oh harry you did not deserve to be so punished for it  that is what you are not to say returned harry i ought not to have played the trick andand just now toobut i always forget things  the door shut and they fancied they heard sobs ethel groaned but made no opposition to following her brother down to tea margaret lay wan and exhausted on the sofathe doctor looked very melancholy and rather stern and the others were silent ethel had begun to hope for the warm reaction she had so often known after a hasty fit but it did not readily come harry was boy instead of girlthe fault and its consequence had been more seriousand the anxiety for the future was greater besides he had not fully heard the story harry in his incoherent narration had not excused himself and margarets panic had appeared more as if inspired by him than as it was in fact the work of her fancy  thus the evening passed gloomily away and it was not till the others had said goodnight that dr may began to talk over the affair with his eldest son who then was able to lay before him the facts of the case as gathered from his sisters he listened with a manner as though it were a reproof and then said sadly i am afraid i was in a passion  it was very wrong in harry said richard and particularly unlucky it should happen with the andersons  very thoughtless said the doctor no more even as regarded margaret but thoughtlessness should not have been treated as a crime  i wish we could see him otherwise said richard  he wants and there dr may stopped short and taking up his candle slowly mounted the stairs and looked into harrys room the boy was in bed but started up on hearing his fathers step and exclaimed papa i am very sorry is margaret better  yes she is and i understand now harry that her alarm was an accident i beg your pardon for thinking for a moment that it was otherwise  no interrupted harry of course i could never mean to frighten her but i did not leave off the moment i saw she was afraid because it was so very ridiculous and i did not guess it would hurt her  i see my honest boy i do not blame you for you did not know how much harm a little terror does to a person in her helpless state but indeed harry though you did not deserve such anger as mine was it is a serious thing that you should be so much set on fun and frolic as to forget all considerations especially at such a time as this it takes away from much of my comfort in sending you into the world and for higher thingshow can i believe you really impressed and reverent if the next minute  im not fit im not fit sobbed harry hiding his face  indeed i hardly know whether it is not so said the doctor you are under the usual age and though i know you wish to be a good boy yet i dont feel sure that these wild spirits do not carry away everything serious and whether it is right to bring one so thoughtless to  no no and harry cried bitterly and his father was deeply grieved but no more could then be said and they parted for the nightdr may saying as he went away you understand that it is not as punishment for your trick if i do not take you to mr ramsden for a ticket but that i cannot be certain whether it is right to bring you to such solemn privileges while you do not seem to me to retain steadily any grave or deep feelings perhaps your mother would have better helped you  and dr may went away to mourn over what he viewed as far greater sins than those of his son  anger had indeed given place to sorrow and all were grave the next morning as if each had something to be forgiven  margaret especially felt guilty of the fears which perhaps had not been sufficiently combated in her days of health and now were beyond control and had occasioned so much pain ethel grieved over the words she had yesterday spoken in haste of her father and sister mary knew herself to have been an accomplice in the joke and norman blamed himself for not having taken the trouble to perceive that harry had not been talking rhodomontade when he had communicated his capital scheme the previous morning  the decision as to the confirmation was a great grief to all flora consoled herself by observing that as he was so young no one need know it nor miss him and ethel with a trembling almost sobbing voice enumerated all harrys excellences his perfect truth his kindness his generosity his flashes of intense feelingdeclared that nobody might be confirmed if he were not and begged and entreated that mr wilmot might be written to and consulted she would almost have done so herself if richard had not shown her it would be undutiful  harry himself was really subdued he made no question as to the propriety of the decision but rather felt his own unworthiness and was completely humbled and downcast when a note came from mrs anderson saying that she was convinced that it could not have been dr mays wish that she should be exposed to the indignity of a practical joke and that a young lady of the highest family should have been insulted no one had spirits to laugh at the terms and when dr may said what is to be done harry turned crimson and was evidently trying to utter something  i see nothing for it but for him to ask their pardon said dr may and a sound was heard not very articulate but expressing full assent  that is right said the doctor ill come with you  oh thank you cried harry looking up  they set off at once mrs anderson was neither an unpleasing nor unkind personher chief defect being a blind admiration of her sons and daughters which gave her in speaking of them a tone of pretension that she would never have shown on her own account  her displeasure was pacified in a moment by the sight of the confused contrition of the culprit coupled with his fathers frank and kindly tone of avowal that it had been a foolish improper frolic and that he had been much displeased with him for it  say no morepray say no more dr may we all know how to overlook a sailors frolic and i am sure master harrys present behaviour but youll take a bit of luncheon and as something was said of going home to the early dinner i am sure you will wait one minute master harry must have a piece of my cake and allow me to drink to his success  poor mr may to be called master harry and treated to sweet cake but he saw his father thought he ought to endure and he even said thank you  the cake stuck in his throat however when mrs anderson and her daughters opened their full course of praise on their dear harvey and dearest edward telling all the flattering things dr hoxton had said of the order into which harvey had brought the school and insisting on dr mays reading the copy of the testimonial that he had carried to oxford i knew you would be kind enough to rejoice said mrs anderson and that you would have nono feeling about mr norman for of course at his age a little matter is nothing and it must be better for the dear boy himself to be a little while under a friend like harvey than to have authority while so young  i believe it has done him no harm was all that the doctor could bring himself to say and thinking that he and his son had endured quite enough he took his leave as soon as harry had convulsively bolted the last mouthful  not a word was spoken all the way home harrys own trouble had overpowered even this subject of resentment on sunday the notice of the confirmation was read it was to take place on the following thursday and all those who had already given in their names were to come to mr ramsden to apply for their tickets while this was read large teardrops were silently falling on poor harrys book  ethel and norman walked together in the twilight in deep lamentation over their brothers deprivation which seemed especially to humble them for said norman i am sure no one can be more resolved on doing right than july and he has got through school better than i did  yes said ethel if we dont get into his sort of scrape it is only that we are older not better i am sure mine are worse my letting aubrey be nearly burnedmy neglects  papa must be doing right said norman but for july to be turned back when we are taken makes me think of man judging only by outward appearance  a few outrageouslooking acts of giddiness that are so much grieved over may not be half so bad as the hundreds of wandering thoughts that one forgets because no one else can see them said ethel  meanwhile harry and mary were sitting twisted together into a sort of bundle on the same footstool by margarets sofa harry had begged of her to hear him say the catechism once more and mary had joined with him in the repetition there was to be only one more sunday at home and that he said and sighed  margaret knew what he meant for the feast was to be spread for those newly admitted to share it she only said a caressing word of affection  i wonder when i shall have another chance said harry if we should get to australia or new zealandbut then perhaps there would be no confirmation going on and i might be worse by that time  oh you must not let that be  why you see if i cant be good here with all this going on what shall i do among those fellows away from all  you will have one friend  mr ernescliffe you are always thinking of him margaret but perhaps he may not go and if he should a lieutenant cannot do much for a midshipman no i thought when i was reading with my father that somehow it might help me to do what it called putting away childish thingsdont you know i might be able to be stronger and steadier somehow and then ififyou know if i did tumble overboard or anything of that sort there is that about thewhat they will go to next sunday being necessary to salvation  harry laid down his head and cried margaret could not speak for tears and mary was incoherently protesting against any notion of his falling overboard  it is generally necessary harry margaret said at lastnot in impossible cases  yes if it had been impossible but it was not if i had not been a mad goose all this time but when a bit of fun gets hold of me i cant think and if i am too bad for that i am too bad forforand i shall never see mamma again margaret it almost makes me afafraid to sail  harry dont dont talk so sobbed mary oh do come to papa and let us beg and pray take hold of my hand and margaret will beg too and when he sees how sorry you are i am sure he will forgive and let you be confirmed she would have dragged him after her  no mary said harry resisting her it is not that he does not forgive you dont understand it is what is right and he cannot help it or make it right for me if i am such a horrid wretch that i cant keep grave thoughts in my head i might do it again after that just the same  you have been grave enough of late said mary  this was enough to make me so said harry but even at church since i came home i have behaved ill i kicked tom to make him look at old levitt asleep and then i went on because he did not like it i know i am too idle  on the tuesday dr may had said he would take norman and etheldred to mr ramsden ethel was gravely putting on her walking dress when she heard her fathers voice calling harry and she started with a joyful hope  there indeed when she came downstairs stood harry his cap in his hand and his face serious but with a look on it that had as much subdued joy as awe  dear dear harry you are going with us then  yes papa wrote to ask what mr wilmot thought and he said  harry broke off as his father advanced and gave her the letter itself to read mr wilmot answered that he certainly should not refuse such a boy as harry on the proof of such entire penitence and deep feeling whether to bring him to the further privilege might be another question but as far as the confirmation was concerned the opinion was decided  norman and ethel were too happy for words as they went arm in arm along the street leaving their dear sailor to be leaned on by his father  harrys sadness was gone but he still was guarded and gentle during the few days that followed he seemed to have learned thought and in his gratitude for the privileges he had so nearly missed to rate them more highly than he might otherwise have done indeed the doubt for the sunday gave him a sense of probation  the confirmation day came mr rivers had asked that his daughter might be with miss may and ethel had therefore to be called for in the abbotstoke carriage quite contrary to her wishes as she had set her heart on the walk to church with her father and brothers flora would not come for fear of crowding mr rivers who with mrs larpent accompanied his darling  oh margaret said flora after putting her sister into the carriage i wish we had put ethel into a veil there is meta all white from head to foot with such a veil and ethel in her little white cap looks as if she might be lucy taylor only not so pretty  mamma thought the best rule was to take the dress that needs least attention from ourselves and will be least noticed said margaret  there is fanny anderson gone by in the fly with a white veil on cried mary dashing in  then i am glad ethel has not one said flora margaret looked annoyed but she had not found the means of checking flora without giving offence and she could only call mary and blanche to order beg them to think of what the others were doing and offer to read to them a little tale on confirmation  flora sat and worked and margaret stealing a glance at her understood that in her quiet way she resented the implied reproof making the children think me worldly and frivolous she thought as if margaret did not know that i think and feel as much as any reasonable person  the party came home in due time and after one kiss to margaret given in silence dispersed for they could not yet talk of what had passed  only ethel as she met richard on the stairs said ritchie do you know what the bishops text was no man having put his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god  yes said richard interrogatively  i thought it might be a voice to me said ethel besides what it says to all about our christian course it seems to tell me not to be out of heart about all those vexations at cocksmoor is it not a sort of putting our hand to the plough  dr may gave his own history of the confirmation to margaret it was a beautiful thing to watch he said the faces of our own set those four were really like a poem there was little meta in her snowy whiteness looking like innocence itself hardly knowing of evil or pain or struggle as that soft earnest voice made her vow to be ready for it all almost as unscathed and unconscious of trial as when they made it for her at her baptism pretty little thingmay she long be as happy and for our own ethel she looked as if she was promising on and on straight into eternity i heard her i do dear child and it was in such a tone as if she meant to be ever doing  and for the boys  there was norman grave and steadfast as if he knew what he was about and was manfully and calmly readyhe might have been a young knight watching his armour  and so he is said margaret softly and poor harry  the doctor could hardly command voice to tell her poor harry he was last of all he turned his back and looked into the corner of the seat till all the voices had spoken and then turned about in haste and the two words came on the end of a sob  you will not keep him away on sunday said margaret  far be it from me i know not who should come if he should not     chapter xxvi         what matter whether through delight        or led through vale of tears      or seen at once or hid from sight        the glorious way appears      if step by step the path we see        that leads my saviour up to thee   i could not help it said dr may that little witch  meta rivers oh what papa  it seems that wednesday is her birthday and nothing will serve her but to eat her dinner in the old roman camp  and are we to go oh which of us  every one of anything like rational years blanche is especially invited  there were transports till it was recollected that on thursday morning school would recommence and that on friday harry must join his ship  however the roman camp had long been an object of their desires and margaret was glad that the last day should have a brilliancy so she would not hear of any one remaining to keep her company talked of the profit she should gain by a leisure day and took ardent interest in every ones preparations and expectations in ethels researches into county histories and classical dictionaries floras sketching intentions normans promises of campanula glomerata and a secret whispered into her ear by mary and harry  metas weather as they said when the august sun rose fresh and joyous and great was the unnecessary bustle and happy confusion from six oclock till eleven when dr may who was going to visit patients some way farther on the same road carried off harry and mary to set them down at the place  the rest were called for by mr riverss carriage and brake mrs charles wilmot and her little girl were the only additions to the party and meta putting blanche into the carriage to keep company with her contemporary went herself in the brake what a brilliant little fairy she was in her pink summer robes fluttering like a butterfly and with the same apparent felicity in basking in joy all gaiety glee and lightheartedness in making others happy on they went through honeysuckled lanes catching glimpses of sunny fields of corn falling before the reaper and happy knots of harvest folks dining beneath the shelter of their sheaves with the sturdy old green umbrella sheltering them from the sun  snatches of song peals of laughter merry nonsense passed from one to the other norman roused into blitheness found wit the young ladies found laughter and richards eyes and mouth looked very pretty as they smiled their quiet diversion  at last his face drawn all into one silent laugh he directed the eyes of the rest to a high green mound rising immediately before them where stood two little figures one with a spyglass intently gazing the opposite way  at the same time came the halt and norman bounding out sprang lightly and nimbly up the side of the mound and while the spyglass was yet pointed full at wales had hold of a pair of stout legs and with the words keep a good lockout had tumbled mr may headforemost down the grassy slope with mary rolling after  harrys first outcry was for his precious glasshis second was not at his fall but that they should have come from the east when by the compass stoneborough was northnorthwest and then the boys took to tumbling over one another while meta frolicked joyously with nipen after her up and down the mounds chased by mary and blanche who were wild with glee  byandby she joined ethel and norman was summoned to help them to trace out the old lines of encampment ditch rampart and gateshappy work on those slopes of fresh turf embroidered with every minute blossom of the moorthyme birdsfoot eyebright and dwarf purple thistle buzzed and hummed over by busy blacktailed yellowbanded dumbledores the breezy wind blowing softly in their faces and the expanse of countrywooded hill verdant pasture amber harvestfield winding river smokecanopied town and brown moor melting grayly away to the mountain heads  now in sun now in shade the bright young antiquaries surveyed the old banks and talked wisely of vallum and fossa of legion and cohort of agricola and suetonius and discussed the delightful probability that this might have been raised in the war with caractacus whence argued ethel since caractacus was certainly arviragus it must have been the very spot where imogen met posthumus again was not yonder the very highroad to milford haven and thus must not fair fideles grassy tomb be in the immediate neighbourhood  then followed the suggestion that the mound in the middle was a good deal like an ancient tomb where as blanche interposed with some of the lore lately caught from ethels studies they used to bury their tears in wheelbarrows while norman observed it was the more probable as fair fidele never was buried at all  the idea of a search enchanted the young ladies it was the right sort of vehicle evidently said norman looking at harry who had been particularly earnest in recommending that it should be explored and meta declared that if they could but find the least trace her papa would be delighted to go regularly to work and reveal all the treasures  richard seemed a little afraid of the responsibility of treasuretrove but he was overruled by a chorus of eager voices and dispossessed of the trowel which he had brought to dig up some downgentians for the garden while norman set to work as pioneer some skipped about in wild ecstasy and ethel knelt down to peer into the hole  very soon there was a discoveryan eager outcrysome pottery roman vesselsa red thing that might have been a lamp another that might have been a lachrymatory  well said ethel you know norman i always told you that the childrens pots and pans in the clay ditch were very like roman pottery  posthumuss patty pan said norman holding it up no doubt this was the bottle filled with the old queens tears when cloten was killed  you see it is very small added harry she could not squeeze out many  come now i do believe you are laughing at it said meta taking the derided vessels into her hands now they really are genuine and very curious things are not they flora  flora and ethel admired and speculated till there was a fresh and still more exciting discoverya coin actually a medal with the head of an emperor upon itnot a doubt of his high nose being roman meta was certain that she knew one exactly like him among her fathers gems ethel was resolved that he should be claudius and began decyphering the defaced inscription thvrvs she tried claudiuss whole torrent of names and at last made it into a contraction of tiberius which highly satisfied her  then meta in her turn read dvx which as ethel said was all she could wishof course it was dux et imperator and harry muttered into normans ear ducks and geese and then heaved a sigh as he thought of the dux no longer vv continued meta what can that mean  five five of course said flora  no no i have it venus victrix said ethel the ancestral venus ha dont you see there she is on the other side crowning claudius  then there is an e  something about aeneas suggested norman gravely but ethel was sure that could not be because there was no diphthong and a fresh theory was just being started when blanches head was thrust in to know what made them all so busy  why ethel what are you doing with harrys old medal of the duke of wellington  poor meta and ethel what a downfall meta was sure that norman had known it the whole time and he owned to having guessed it from harrys importunity for the search harry and mary had certainly made good use of their time and great was the mirth over the trap so cleverly setthe more when it was disclosed that dr may had been a full participator in the scheme had suggested the addition of the pottery had helped harry to some liquid to efface part of the inscription and had even come up with them to plant the snare in the most plausible corner for researches  meta enchanted with the joke flew off to try to take in her governess and mrs wilmot whom she found completing their leisurely promenade and considering where they should spread the dinner  the sight of those great baskets of good fare was appetising and the company soon collected on the shady turf where richard made himself extremely useful and the feast was spread without any worse mishap than nipens running away with half a chicken of which he was robbed as tom reported by a surlylooking dog that watched in the outskirts of the camp and caused tom to return nearly as fast as the poor little white marauder  meta very immorally as norman told her comforted nipen with a large share of her sandwiches harry armed himself with a stick and mary with a stone and marched off to the attack but saw no signs of the enemy and had begun to believe him a figment of toms imagination when mary spied him under a bush lying at the feet of a boy with whom he was sharing the spoil  harry called out rather roughly hallo what are you doing there  the boy jumped up the dog growled mary shrank behind her brother and begged him not to be cross to the poor boy but to come away harry repeated his question  please sir toby brought it to me  what is toby your dog  yes sir  are you so hungry as to eat dogs meat  i have not had nothing before today sir  why where do you live hereabouts  oh no sir i lived with grandmother up in cheshire but she is dead now and father is just come home from sea and he wrote down i was to be sent to him at portsmouth to go to sea with him  how do you live do you beg your way  no sir father sent up a pound in a letter only nanny brooks said i owed some to her for my victuals and i have not much of it left and bread comes dear so when toby brought me this bit of meat i was glad of it sir but i would not have taken it  the boy was desired to wait while the brother and sister in breathless excitement rushed back with their story  mrs wilmot was at first inclined to fear that the naval part of it had been inspired by harrys uniform but the examination of jem jennings put it beyond a doubt that he spoke nothing but the truth and the choicest delight of the feast was the establishing him and toby behind the barrow and feeding them with such viands as they had probably never seen before  the boy could not read writing but he had his fathers letter in his pocket and mary capered at the delightful coincidence on finding that jem jennings was actually a quartermaster on board the alcestis it gave a sort of property in the boy and she almost grudged meta the having been first to say that she would pay for the rest of his journey instead of doing it by subscription  however mary had a consolation she would offer to take charge of toby who as harry observed would otherwise have been drownedhe could not be taken on board to be sure he was a particularly ugly animal rough grisly shortlegged longbacked and with an apology for a tailbut he had a redeeming pair of eyes and he and jem lived on terms of such close friendship that he would have been miserable in leaving him to the mercy of nanny brooks  so after their meal jem and toby were bidden to wait for dr mays coming and fell asleep together on the green bank while the rest either sketched or wandered or botanised flora acted the grownup lady with mrs wilmot and meta found herself sitting by ethel asking her a great many questions about margaret and her home and what it could be like to be one of such a numerous family flora had always turned aside from personal matters as uninteresting to her companion and in spite of metas admiration and the mutual wish to be intimate confidence did not spring up spontaneously as it had done with the doctor and in that single hour with margaret blunt as ethel was her heartiness of manner gave a sense of real progress in friendship their confirmation vows seemed to make a link and metas unfeigned enthusiasm for the doctor was the sure road to ethels heart she was soon telling how glad margaret was that he had been drawn into taking pleasure in todays scheme since not only were his spirits tried by the approach of harrys departure but he had within the last few days been made very sad by reading and answering aunt floras first letter on the news of last octobers misfortune  my aunt in new zealand explained ethel  have you an aunt in new zealand cried meta i never heard of her  did not you oh she does write such charming long letters  is she dr mays sister  no he was an only child she is dear mammas sister i dont remember her for she went out when i was a baby but richard and margaret were so fond of her they say she used to play with them and tell them stories and sing scotch songs to them margaret says the first sorrow of her life was aunt floras going away  did she live with them  yes after grandpapa died she came to live with them but then mr arnott came about i ought not to speak evil of him for he is my godfather but we do wish he had not carried off aunt flora that letter of hers showed me what a comfort it would be to papa to have her here  perhaps she will come  no uncle arnott has too much to do it was a pretty story altogether he was an officer at edinburgh and fell in love with aunt flora but my grandfather mackenzie thought him too poor to marry her and it was all broken off and they tried to think no more of it but grandpapa died and she came to live here and somehow mr arnott turned up again quartered at whitford and papa talked over my uncle mackenzie and helped themand mr arnott thought the best way would be to go out to the colonies they went when new zealand was very new and a very funny life they had once they had their house burned in hekis rebellionand aunt flora saw a maori walking about in her best sunday bonnet but in general everything has gone on very well and he has a great farm besides an office under government  oh so he went out as a settler i was in hopes it was as a missionary  i fancy aunt flora has done a good deal that may be called missionary work said ethel teaching the maori women and girls they call her mother and she has quite a doctors shop for them and tries hard to teach them to take proper care of their poor little children when they are ill and she cuts out clothes for the whole pah that is the village  and are they christians  oh to be sure they are now they meet in the pah for prayers every morning and eveningthey used to have a hoe struck against a bit of metal for a signal and when papa heard of it he gave them a bell and they were so delighted now there comes a clergyman every fourth sunday and on the others uncle arnott reads part of the service to the english near and the maori teacher to his people  meta asked ravenously for more details and when she had pretty well exhausted ethels stock she said how nice it must be ethel did you ever read the faithful little girl  yes it was one of margarets old sunday books i often recollected it before i was allowed to begin cocksmoor  im afraid i am very like lucilla said meta  what in wishing to be a boy that you might be a missionary said ethel not in being quite so cross at home she added laughing  i am not cross because i have no opportunity said meta  no opportunity oh meta if people wish to be cross it is easy enough to find grounds for it there is always the moon to cry for  really and truly said meta thoughtfully i never do meet with any reasonable trial of temper and i am often afraid it cannot be right or safe to live so entirely at ease and without contradictions  well but said ethel it is the state of life in which you are placed  yes but are we meant never to have vexations  i thought you had them said ethel margaret told me about your maid that would have worried some people and made them horridly cross  oh no rational person cried meta it was so nice to think of her being with the poor mother and i was quite interested in managing for myself besides you know it was just a proof how one learns to be selfish that it had never occurred to me that i ought to spare her  and your school childrenyou were in some trouble about them  oh that is pleasure  i thought you had a class you did not like  i like them nowthey are such steady plodding girls so much in earnest and one that has been neglected is so pleased and touched by kindness i would not give them up for anything nowthey are just fit for my capacity  do you mean that nothing ever goes wrong with you or that you do not mind anythingwhich  nothing goes wrong enough with me to give me a handsome excuse for minding it  then it must be all your good temper  i dont think so said meta it is that nothing is ever disagreeable to me  stay said ethel if the illtemper was in you you would only be the crosser for being indulgedat least so books say and i am sure myself that it is not whether things are disagreeable or not but whether ones will is with them that signifies  i dont quite understand  whyi have seen the boys do for play and done myself what would have been a horrid hardship if one had been made to do it i never liked any lessons as well as those i did without being obliged and always when there is a thing i hate very much in itself i can get up an interest in it by resolving that i will do it well or fast or somethingif i can stick my will to it it is like a lever and it is done now i think it must be the same with you only your will is more easily set at it than mine  what makes me uncomfortable is that i feel as if i never followed anything but my will  ethel screwed up her face as if the eyes of her mind were pursuing some thought almost beyond her if our will and our duty run the same she said that cant be wrong the better people are the more they love what he commands you know in heaven they have no will but his  oh but ethel cried meta distressed that is putting it too high wont you understand what i mean we have learned so much lately about selfdenial and crossing ones own inclinations and enduring hardness and here i live with two dear kind people who only try to keep every little annoyance from my path i cant wish for a thing without getting iti am waited on all day long and i feel like one of the women that are at easeone of the careless daughters  i think still papa would say it was your happy contented temper that made you find no vexation  but that sort of temper is not goodness i was born with it i never did mind anything not even being punished they say unless i knew papa was grieved which always did make me unhappy enough i laughed and went to play most saucily whatever they did to me if i had striven for the temper it would be worth having but it is my nature and ethel she added in a low voice as the tears came into her eyes dont you remember last sunday i felt myself so vain and petted a thing as if i had no share in the cup of suffering and did not deserve to call myself a memberit seemed ungrateful  ethel felt ashamed as she heard of warmer feelings than her own had been expressed in that lowered trembling voice and she sought for the answer that would only come to her mind in sense not at first in words discipline said she would not that show the willingness to have the part taking the right times for refusing oneself some pleasant thing  would not that be only making up something for oneself said meta  no the church orders it it is in the prayerbook said ethel i mean one can do little secret thingsnot read storybooks on those days or keep some tiresome sort of work for them it is very trumpery but it keeps the remembrance and it is not so much as if one did not heed  ill think said meta sighing if only i felt myself at work not to please myself but to be of use ha she cried springing up i do believe i see dr may coming  let us run and meet him said ethel  they did so and he called out his wishes of many happy returns of blithe days to the little birthday queen then added you both look grave thoughhave they deserted you  no papa we have been having a talk said ethel may i tell him meta i want to know what he says  meta had not bargained for this but she was very much in earnest and there was nothing formidable in dr may so she assented  meta is longing to be at workshe thinks she is of no use said ethel she says she never does anything but please herself  pleasing oneself is not the same as trying to please oneself said dr may kindly  and she thinks it cannot be safe or right added ethel to live that happy bright life as if people without care or trouble could not be living as christians are meant to live is that it meta  yes i think it is said meta i seem to be only put here to be made much of  what did david say meta returned dr may                 my shepherd is the living lord                  nothing therefore i need                in pastures fair near pleasant streams                  he setteth me to feed   then you think said meta much touched that i ought to look on this as the pastures fair and be thankful i hope i was not unthankful  oh no said ethel it was the wish to bear hardness and be a good soldier was it not  ah my dear he said the rugged path and dark valley will come in his own fit time depend upon it the good shepherd is giving you what is best for you in the green meadow and if you lay hold on his rod and staff in your sunny days he stopped short and turned to his daughter ethel they sang that psalm the first sunday i brought your mamma home  meta was much affected and began to put together what the father and daughter had said perhaps the little modes of secret discipline of which ethel had spoken might be the true means of clasping the staffperhaps she had been impatient and wanting in humility in craving for the strife when her armour was scarce put on  dr may spoke once again dont let any one long for external trial the offering of a free heart is the thing to offer praise is the great object of all creatures in heaven and earth if the happier we are the more we praise then all is well  but the serious discussion was suddenly broken off  others had seen dr mays approach and harry and mary rushed down in dismay at their story having as they thought been forestalled however they had it all to themselves and the doctor took up the subject as keenly as could have been hoped but the poor boy being still fast asleep after probably much fatigue he would not then waken him to examine him but came and sat down in the semicircle formed by a terraced bank of soft turf where mrs larpent mrs wilmot richard and flora had for some time taken up their abode meta brought him the choice little basket of fruit which she had saved for him and all delighted in having him there evidently enjoying the rest and sport very much as he reposed on the fragrant slope eating grapes and making inquiries as to the antiquities lately discovered  norman gave an exceedingly droll account of the great roman emperor tiberius vv and meta correcting it there was a regular gay skirmish of words which entertained every one extremelyabove all metas indignation when the charge was brought home to her of having declared the old duke exactly like in turns to domitian and tiberiushis features quite forbidding  this lasted till the younger ones who had been playing and rioting till they were tired came up and throwing themselves down on the grass blanche petitioned for something that every one could play at  meta proposed what she called the story play one was to be sent out of earshot and the rest to agree upon a word which was then to be guessed by each telling a story and introducing the word into it not too prominently meta volunteered to guess and harry whispered to mary it would be no go but in the meantime the word was found and blanche eagerly recalled meta and sat in the utmost expectation and delight meta turned first to richard but he coloured distressfully and begged that flora might tell his story for himhe should only spoil the game flora with a little tinge of graceful reluctance obeyed no woman had been to the summit of mont blanc she said till one young girl named marie resolved to have this glory the guides told her it was madness but she persevered she took the staff and everything requisite and following a party began the ascent she bravely supported every fatigue climbed each precipice was undaunted by the giddy heights she attained bravely crossed the fields of snow supported the bitter cold and finally though suffering severely arrived at the topmost peak looked forth where woman had never looked before felt her heart swell at the attainment of her utmost ambition and the name of marie was inscribed as that of the woman who alone has had the glory of standing on the summit of the giant of the alps  it was prettily enunciated and had a pleasing effect meta stood conning the wordswomangiantmountaingloryand begged for another tale  mine shall not be so stupid as floras said harry we have an old sailor on board the alcestisa giant he might be for his voicebut he sailed once in the glory of the west and there they had a monkey that was picked up in africa and one day this old fellow found his queer messmate as he called him spying through a glass just like the captain the captain had a glorious collection of old coins and the like dug up in some of the old greek colonies and whenever master monkey saw him overhauling them he would get out a brass button or a card or two and turn em over and chatter at them and glory over them quite knowing said harry imitating the gesture and i dare say he saw vv and tiberius caesar as well as the best of them  thank you mr harry said meta i think we are at no loss for monkeys here but i have not the word yet who comes next ethel  i shall blunder i forewarn you said ethel but this is mine there was a young king who had an old tutor whom he despised because he was so strict so he got rid of him and took to idle sport one day when he was out hunting in a forest a white hind came and ran before him till she guided him to a castle and there he found a lady all dressed in white with a beamy crown on head and so nobly beautiful that he fell in love with her at once and was only sorry to see another prince who was come to her palace too she told them her name was gloria and that she had had many suitors but the choice did not depend on herselfshe could only be won by him who deserved her and for three years they were to be on their probation trying for her so she dismissed them only burning to gain her and telling them to come back in three years time but they had not gone far before they saw another palace much finer all glittering with gold and silver and their lady gloria came out to meet them not in her white dress but in one all gay and bright with fine colours and her crown they now saw was of diamonds she told them they had only seen her everyday dress and house this was her best and she showed them about the castle and all the pictures of her former lovers there was alexander who had been nearer retaining her than any one only the fever prevented it there was pyrrhus always seeking her but slain by a tile julius caesartamerlaneall the rest and she hoped that one of these two would really prove worthy and gain her by going in the same path as these great people  so our prince went home his head full of being like alexander and all the rest of them and he sent for his good old tutor to reckon up his armies and see whom he could conquer in order to win her but the old tutor told him he was under a mistake the second lady he had seen was a treacherous cousin of gloria who drew away her suitors by her deceits and whose real name was vana gloria if he wished to earn the true gloria he must set to work to do his subjects good and to be virtuous and he did he taught them and he did justice to them and he bore it patiently and kindly when they did not understand but byandby the other king who had no good tutor to help him had got his armies together and conquered ever so many people and drawn off their men to be soldiers and now he attacked the good prince and was so strong that he gained the victory though both prince and subjects fought manfully with heart and hand but the battle was lost and the faithful prince wounded and made prisoner but bearing it most patiently till he was dragged behind the others triumphal car with all the rest when the three years were up to be presented to vana gloria and so he was carried into the forest bleeding and wounded and his enemy drove the car over his body and stretched out his arms to vana gloria and found her a vain ugly wretch who grew frightful as soon as he grasped her but the good dying prince saw the beautiful beamy face of his ladylove bending over him oh he said vision of my life hast thou come to lighten my dying eyes nevernever even in my best days did i deem that i could be worthy of thee the more i strove the more i knew that gloria is for none belowfor me less than all  and then the lady came and lifted him up and she said gloria is given to all who do and suffer truly in a good cause for faithfulness is glory and that is thine  ethels language had become more flowing as she grew more eager in the tale and they all listened with suspended interest norman asked where she got the story out of an old french book the magazin des enfans was the answer  but why did you alter the end said flora why kill the poor man he used to be prosperous why not  because i thought said ethel that glory could not properly belong to any one here and if he was once conscious of it it would be all spoiled well meta do you guess  oh the word i had forgotten all about it i think i know what it must be but i should so like another story may i not have one said meta coaxingly mary it is you  mary fell back on her papa and begged him to take hers papa told the best stories of all she said and meta looked beseeching  my story will not be as long as ethels said the doctor yielding with a halfreluctant smile my story is of a hummingbird a little creature that loved its master with all its strength and longed to do somewhat for him it was not satisfied with its lot because it seemed merely a vain and profitless creature the nightingale sang praise and the woods sounded with the glory of its strains the fowl was valued for its flesh the ostrich for its plume but what could the little hummingbird do save rejoice in the glory of the flood of sunbeams and disport itself over the flowers and glance in the sunny light as its bright breastplate flashed from rich purple to dazzling flamecolour and its wings supported it fluttering so fast that the eye could hardly trace them as it darted its slender beak into the deepbelled blossoms so the little bird grieved and could not rest for thinking that it was useless in this world that it sought merely its own gratification and could do nothing that could conduce to the glory of its master but one night a voice spoke to the little bird why hast thou been placed here it said but at the will of thy master was it not that he might delight himself in thy radiant plumage and see thy joy in the sunshine his gifts are thy buoyant wing thy beauteous colours the love of all around the sweetness of the honeydrop in the flowers the shade of the palm leaf esteem them then as his value thine own bliss while it lasts as the token of his care and love and while thy heart praises him for them and thy wings quiver and dance to the tune of that praise then indeed thy gladness conduces to no vainglory of thine own in beauty or in graceful flight but thou art a creature servingas best thou canst to his glory  i know the word half whispered meta not without a trembling of the lip i know why you told the story dr may but one is not as good as the hummingbirds  the elder ladies had begun to look at watches and talk of time to go home and jem jemmings having been seen rearing himself up from behind the barrow the doctor proceeded to investigate his case was perfectly satisfied of the boys truth and as ready as the young ones to befriend him a letter should be written at once desiring his father to look out for him on friday when he should go by the same train as harry who was delighted at the notion of protecting him so far and begged to be allowed to drive him home to stoneborough in the gig  consent was given and richard being added to give weight and discretion the gig set out at oncethe doctor much to metas delight took his place in the brake blanche who in the morning had been inclined to despise it as something akin to a cart now finding it a popular conveyance was urgent to return in it and flora was made over to the carriage not at all unwillingly for though it separated her from meta it made a senior of her  normans fate conveyed him to the exalted seat beside the driver of the brake where he could only now and then catch the sounds of mirth from below he had enjoyed the day exceedingly with that sort of abandon more than ordinarily delicious to grave or saddened temperaments when roused or drawn out for a time metas winning grace and sweetness had a peculiar charm for him and perhaps his having been originally introduced to her as ill and in sorrow had given her manner towards him a sort of kindness which was very gratifying  and now he felt as if he was going back to a very dusky dusty world the last and blithest day of his holidays was past and he must return to the misapprehensions and injustice that had blighted his school career be kept beneath boys with half his ability and without generous feeling and find all his attainments useless in restoring his position dr hoxtons dull scholarship would chill all pleasure in his studiesthere would be no companionship among the boyseven his supporters ernescliffe and larkins were gone and harry would leave him still under a cloud  norman felt it more as disgrace than he had done since the first and wished he had consented to quit the school when it had been offeredbe made a man instead of suffering these doubly irksome provocations which rose before him in renewed force and what would that little hummingbird think of me if she knew me disgraced thought he but it is of no use to think of it i must go through with it and as i always am getting vainglorious i had better have no opportunity i did not declare i renounced vain pomp and glory last week to begin coveting them now again  so norman repressed the sigh as he looked at the school buildings which never could give him the pleasures of memory they afforded to others  the brake had set out before the carriage so that meta had to come in and wait for her governess before the vehicle had disgorged half its contents harry had rushed out to meet them come in come in norman only hear margaret shall tell you herself hurrah  is mr ernescliffe come crossed ethels mind but margaret was alone flushed and holding out her hands norman where is he dear norman here is good news papa dr hoxton has been here and he knows all about itand oh norman he is very sorry for the injustice and you are dux again  norman really trembled so much that he could neither speak nor stand but sat down on the windowseat while a confusion of tongues asked more  dr hoxton and mr larkins had come to callheard no one was at home but miss mayhad nevertheless come inand margaret had heard that mr larkins who had before intended to remove his son from stoneborough had in the course of the holidays made discoveries from him which he could not feel justified in concealing from dr hoxton  the whole of the transactions with ballhatchet and normans part in them had been explained as well as the true history of the affray in randalls alleyhow norman had dispersed the boys how they had again collected and with the full concurrence of harvey anderson renewed the mischief how the andersons had refused to bear witness in his favour and how ballhatchets illwill had kept back the evidence which would have cleared him  little larkins had told all and his father had no scruple in repeating it and causing the investigation to be set on foot nay he deemed that normans influence had saved his son and came as anxious to thank him as dr hoxton warmhearted though injudicious was to repair his injustice they were much surprised and struck by finding that dr may had been aware of the truth the whole time and had patiently put up with the injustice and the loss of the scholarshipa loss which dr hoxton would have given anything to repair so as to have sent up a scholar likely to do him so much credit but it was now too late and he had only been able to tell margaret how dismayed he was at finding out that the boy to whom all the good order in his school was owing had been so illused kind dr mays first feeling really seemed to be pity and sympathy for his old friend the headmaster in the shock of such a discovery harry was vociferously telling his version of the story to ethel and mary tom stood transfixed in attention meta forgotten and bewildered was standing near norman whose colour rapidly varied and whose breath came short and quick as he listened a quick half interrogation passed metas lips heard by no one else  it is only that it is all right he answered scarcely audibly they have found out the truth  whatwhoyou said meta as she heard words that implied the past suspicion  yes said norman i was suspected but never at home  and is it over now  yes yes he whispered huskily all is right and harry will not leave me in disgrace  meta did not speak but she held out her hand in hearty congratulation norman scarce knowing what he did grasped and wrung it so tight that it was positive pain as he turned away his head to the window to struggle with those irrepressible tears metas colour flushed into her cheek as she found it still held almost unconsciously perhaps in his agitation and she heard margarets words that both gentlemen had said norman had acted nobly and that every revelation made in the course of their examination had only more fully established his admirable conduct  oh norman norman i am so glad cried marys voice in the first pause and margaret asking where he was he suddenly turned round recollected himself and found it was not the back of the chair that he had been squeezing blushed intensely but made no attempt at apology for indeed he could not speakhe only leaned down over margaret to receive her heartfelt embrace and as he stood up again his father laid his hand on his shoulder my boy i am glad but the words were broken and as if neither could bear more norman hastily left the room ethel rushing after him  quite overcome said the doctor and no wonder he felt it cruelly though he bore up gallantly well july  ill go down to school with him tomorrow and see him dux again ill have threetimesthree shouted harry hip hip hurrah and tom and mary joined in chorus  what is all this exclaimed flora opening the door is every one gone mad  many were the voices that answered  well i am glad and i hope the andersons will make an apology but where is poor meta quite forgotten  meta would not wonder if she knew all said the doctor turning with a sweet smile that had in it something nevertheless of apology  oh i am so gladso glad said meta her eyes full of tears as she came forward  and there was no helping it the first kiss between margaret may and margaret rivers was given in that overflowing sympathy of congratulation  the doctor gave her his arm to take her to the carriage and on the way his quick warm words filled up the sketch of normans behaviour metas eyes responded better than her tongue but to her goodbye she could not help adding now i have seen true glory  his answer was much such a grip as her poor little fingers had already received but though they felt hot and crushed all the way home the sensation seemed to cause such throbs of joy that she would not have been without it     chapter xxvii         and full of hope day followed day      while that stout ship at anchor lay         beside the shores of wight      the may had then made all things green      and floating there in pomp serene      that ship was goodly to be seen         his pride and his delight       yet then when called ashore he sought      the tender peace of rural thought         in more than happy mood      to your abodes bright daisy flowers      he then would steal at leisure hours      and loved you glittering in your bowers         a starry multitude                                          wordsworth   harrys last home morning was brightened by going to the school to see full justice done to norman and enjoying the scene for him it was indeed a painful ordeal to norman himself who could at the moment scarcely feel pleasure in his restoration excepting for the sake of his father harry and his sisters to find the headmaster making apologies to him was positively painful and embarrassing and his countenance would have been fitter for a culprit receiving a lecture it was pleasanter when the two other masters shook hands with him mr harrison with a free confession that he had done him injustice and mr wilmot with a glad look of congratulation that convinced harry he had never believed norman to blame  harry himself was somewhat of a hero the masters all spoke to him bade him good speed and wished him a happy voyage and all the boys were eager to admire his uniform and wish themselves already men and officers like mr may he had his longdesired three cheers for may senior shouted with a thorough goodwill by the united lungs of the whichcote foundation and a supplementary cheer arose for the good ship alcestis while hands were held out on every side and the boy arrived at such a pitch of benevolence and good humour as actually to volunteer a friendly shake of the hand to edward anderson whom he encountered skulking apart  never mind ned we have often licked each other before now and dont let us bear a grudge now i am going away we are stoneborough fellows both you know after all  edward did not refuse the offered grasp and though his words were only goodbye i hope you will have plenty of fun harry went away with a lighter heart  the rest of the day harry adhered closely to his father though chiefly in silence dr may had intended much advice and exhortation for his warmhearted wildspirited son but words would not come not even when in the still evening twilight they walked down alone together to the cloister and stood over the little stone marked m m after standing there for some minutes harry knelt to collect some of the daisies in the grass  are those to take with you  margaret is going to make a cross of them for my prayerbook  ay they will keep it in your mindsay it all to you harry she may be nearer to you everywhere though you are far from us dont put yourself from her  that was all dr may contrived to say to his son nor could margaret do much more than kiss him while tears flowed one by one over her cheeks as she tried to whisper that he must remember and guard himself and that he was sure of being thought of at least in every prayer and then she fastened into his book the cross formed of flattened daisies gummed upon a framework of paper he begged her to place it at the baptismal service for he said i like that about fightingand i always did like the church being like a shipdont you i only found that prayer out the day poor little daisy was christened  margaret had indeed a thrill of melancholy pleasure in this task when she saw how it was regarded oh that her boy might not lose these impressions amid the stormy waves he was about to encounter  that last evening of home goodnights cost harry many a choking sob ere he could fall asleep but the morning of departure had more cheerfulness the pleasure of patronising jem jennings was as consoling to his spirits as was to mary the necessity of comforting toby  tobys tastes were in some respects vulgar as he preferred the stable and will adams to all marys attentions but he attached himself vehemently to dr may followed him everywhere and went into raptures at the slightest notice from him the doctor said it was all homage to the master of the house margaret held that the dog was a physiognomist  the world was somewhat flat after the loss of harrythat element of riot and fun aubrey was always playing at poor harry sailing away mary looked staid and sober and norman was still graver and more devoted to books while ethel gave herself up more completely to the thickening troubles of cocksmoor  jealousies had arisen there and these with some rebukes for failures in sending children to be taught had led to imputations on the character of mrs green in whose house the school was kept ethel was at first vehement in her defence then when stronger evidence was adduced of the womans dishonesty she was dreadfully shocked and wanted to give up all connection with her and in both moods was equally displeased with richard for pausing and not going all lengths with her  mr wilmot was appealed to and did his best to investigate but the only result was to discover that no one interrogated had any notion of truth except john taylor and he knew nothing of the matter the mass of falsehood spite violence and dishonesty that became evident was perfectly appalling and not a clue was to be found to the truthscarcely a hope that minds so lost to honourable feeling were open to receive good impressions it was a great distress to ethelit haunted her night and dayshe lay awake pondering on the vain hopes for her poor children and slept to dream of the angry faces and rude accusations margaret grew quite anxious about her and her elders were seriously considering the propriety of her continuing her labours at cocksmoor  mr wilmot would not be at stoneborough after christmas his fathers declining health made him be required at home and since richard was so often absent it became matter of doubt whether the misses may ought to be allowed to persevere unassisted by older heads in such a locality  this doubt put ethel into an agony though she had lately been declaring that it made her very unhappy to goshe could not bear the sight of mrs green and that she knew all her efforts were vain while the poor children had such homes she now only implored to be allowed to go on she said that the badness of the people only made it more needful to do their utmost for them there were no end to the arguments that she poured forth upon her ever kind listener margaret  yes dear ethel yes but pray be calm i know papa and mr wilmot would not put a stop to it if they could possibly help it but if it is not proper  proper that is as bad as miss winter  ethel you and i cannot judge of these thingsyou must leave them to our elders  and men always are so fanciful about ladies  indeed if you speak in that way i shall think it is really hurting you  i did not mean it dear margaret said ethel but if you knew what i feel for poor cocksmoor you would not wonder that i cannot bear it  i do not wonder dearest but if this trial is sent you perhaps it is to train you for better things  perhaps it is for my fault said ethel oh oh if it be that i am too unworthy and it is the only hope no one will do anything to teach these poor creatures if i give it up what shall i do margaret  margaret drew her down close to her and whispered trust them ethel dear the decision will be whatever is the will of god if he thinks fit to give you the work it will come if not he will give you some other and provide for them  if i have been too neglectful of home too vain of persevering when no one but richard would sighed ethel  i cannot see that you have dearest said margaret fondly but your own heart must tell you that and now only try to be calm and patient getting into these fits of despair is the very thing to make people decide against you  i will i will i will try to be patient sobbed ethel i know to be wayward and set on it would only hurt i might only do more harmill try but oh my poor children  margaret gave a little space for the struggle with herself then advised her resolutely to fix her attention on something else it was a saturday morning and time was more free than usual so margaret was able to persuade her to continue a halfforgotten drawing while listening to an interesting article in a review which opened to her that there were too many cocksmoors in the world  the dinnerhour sounded too soon and as she was crossing the hall to put away her drawing materials the front door gave the click peculiar to dr mays lefthanded way of opening it she paused and saw him enter flushed and with a look that certified her that something had happened  well ethel he is come  oh papa mr ernes  he held up his finger drew her into the study and shut the door the expression of mystery and amusement gave way to sadness and gravity as he sat down in his armchair and sighed as if much fatigued she was checked and alarmed but she could not help asking is he here  at the swan he came last night and watched for me this morning as i came out of the hospital we have been walking over the meadows to fordholm  no wonder dr may was hot and tired  but is he not coming asked ethel  yes poor fellow but hush stop say nothing to the others i must not have her agitated till she has had her dinner in peace and the house is quiet you know she cannot run away to her room as you would  then he is really come for that cried ethel breathlessly and perceiving the affirmative added but why did he wait so long  he wished to see his way through his affairs and also wanted to hear of her from harry i am afraid poor julys colours were too bright  and why did he come to the swan instead of to us  that was his fine noble feeling he thought it right to see me first that if i thought the decision too trying for margaret in her present state or if i disapproved of the long engagement i might spare her all knowledge of his coming  oh papa you wont  i dont know but that i ought but yet the fact is that i cannot with that fine young fellow so generously fondly attached i cannot find it in my heart to send him away for four years without seeing her and yet poor things it might be better for them both oh ethel if your mother were but here  he rested his forehead on his hands and ethel stood aghast at his unexpected reception of the addresses for which she had so long hoped she did not venture to speak and presently he roused himself as the dinnerbell rang one comfort is he said that margaret has more composure than i do you go to cocksmoor this afternoon  i wished it  take them all with you you may tell them why when you are out i must have the house quiet i shall get margaret out into the shade and prepare her as best i can before he comes at three oclock  it was not flattering to be thus cleared out of the way especially when full of excited curiosity but any such sensation was quite overborne by sympathy in his great anxiety and ethels only question was had not flora better stay to keep off company  no no said dr may impatiently the fewer the better and hastily passing her he dashed up to his room nearly running over the nursery procession and in a very few seconds was seated at table eating and speaking by snatches and swallowing endless draughts of cold water  you are going to cocksmoor said he as they were finishing  it is the right day said richard are you coming flora  not today i have to call on mrs hoxton  never mind mrs hoxton said the doctor you had better go today a fine cool day for a walk  he did not look as if he had found it so  oh yes flora you must come said ethel we want you  i have engagements at home replied flora  and it really is a trying walk said miss winter  you must reiterated ethel come to our room and i will tell you why  i do not mean to go to cocksmoor till something positive is settled i cannot have anything to do with that woman  if you would only come upstairs implored ethel at the door i have something to tell you alone  i shall come up in due time i thought you had outgrown closetings and foolish secrets said flora  her movements were quickened however by her father who finding her with margaret in the drawingroom ordered her upstairs in a peremptory manner which she resented as treating her like a child and therefore proceeded in no amiable mood to the room where ethel awaited her in wild tumultuous impatience  well ethel what is this grand secret  oh flora mr ernescliffe is at the swan he has been speaking to papa about margaret  proposing for her do you mean said flora  yes he is coming to see her this afternoon and that is the reason that papa wants us to be all out of the way  did papa tell you this  yes said ethel beginning to perceive the secret of her displeasure but only because i was the first person he met and norman guessed it long ago do put on your things ill tell you all i know when we are out papa is so anxious to have the coast clear  i understand said flora but i shall not go with you do not be afraid of my interfering with any one i shall sit here  but papa said you were to go  if he had done me the favour of speaking to me himself said flora i should have shown him that it is not right that margaret should be left without any one at hand in case she should be overcome he is of no use in such cases only makes things worse i should not feel justified in leaving margaret with no one else but he is in one of those handoverhead moods when it is not of the least use to say a word to him  flora how can you when he expressly ordered you  all he meant was do not be in the way and i shall not show myself unless i am needed when he would be glad enough of me i am not bound to obey the very letter like blanche or mary  ethel looked horrified by the assertion of independence but richard called her from below and with one more fruitless entreaty she ran downstairs  richard had been hearing all from his father and it was comfortable to talk the matter over with him and hear explained the anxiety which frightened her while she scarcely comprehended it how dr may could not feel certain whether it was right or expedient to promote an engagement which must depend on health so uncertain as poor margarets and how he dreaded the effect on the happiness of both  ethels romance seemed to be turning to melancholy and she walked on gravely and thoughtfully though repeating that there could be no doubt of margarets perfect recovery by the time of the return from the voyage  her lessons were somewhat nervous and flurried and even the sight of two very nice neat new scholars of very different appearance from the rest and of much superior attainments only half interested her mary was enchanted at them as a pair of prodigies actually able to read and had made out their names and their former abodes and how they had been used to go to school and had just come to live in the cottage deserted by the lamented una  ethel thought it quite provoking in her brother to accede to marys entreaties that they should go and call on this promising importation even the childrens information that they were taught now by sister cherry failed to attract her but richard looked at his watch and decided that it was too soon to go home and she had to submit to her fate  very different was the aspect of the house from the wild irish cabin appearance that it had in the mcarthy days it was the remains of an old farmhouse that had seen better days somewhat larger than the general run of the cocksmoor dwellings respectable furniture had taken up its abode against the walls the kitchen was well arranged and in spite of the wretched flooring and broken windows had an air of comfort a very tidy woman was bustling about still trying to get rid of the relics of her former tenants who might she much feared have left a legacy of typhus fever the more interesting person was however a young woman of three or four and twenty pale and very lame and with the air of a respectable servant her manners particularly pleasing it appeared that she was the daughter of a first wife and after the period of schooling had been at service but had been lamed by a fall downstairs and had been obliged to come home just as scarcity of work had caused her father to leave his native parish and seek employment at other quarries she had hoped to obtain plain work but all the family were dismayed and disappointed at the wild spot to which they had come and anxiously availed themselves of this introduction to beg that the elder boy and girl might be admitted into the town school distant as it was at another time the thought of charity elwood would have engrossed ethels whole mind now she could hardly attend and kept looking eagerly at richard as he talked endlessly with the good mother when at last they did set off he would not let her gallop home like a steamengine but made her take his arm when he found that she could not otherwise moderate her steps at the long hill a figure appeared and as soon as richard was certified of its identity he let her fly like a bolt from a crossbow and she stood by dr mays side  a little ashamed she blushed instead of speaking and waited for richard to come up and begin neither did he say anything and they paused till the silence disturbing her she ventured a well papa  well poor things she was quite overcome when first i told hersaid it would be hard on him and begged me to tell him that he would be much happier if he thought no more of her  did margaret cried ethel oh could she mean it  she thought she meant it poor dear and repeated such things again and again but when i asked whether i should send him away without seeing her she cried more than ever and said you are tempting me it would be selfishness  oh dear she surely has seen him  i told her that i would be the last person to wish to tempt her to selfishness but that i did not think that either could be easy in settling such a matter through a third person  it would have been very unkind said ethel i wonder she did not think so  she did at last i saw it could not be otherwise and she said poor darling that when he had seen her he would know the impossibility but she was so agitated that i did not know how it could be  has she  ay i told him not to stay too long and left him under the tuliptree with her i found her much more composedhe was so gentle and considerate ah he is the very man besides he has convinced her now that affection brings him not mere generosity as she fancied  oh then it is settled cried ethel joyously  i wish it were she has owned that ifif she were in healthbut that is all and he is transported with having gained so much poor fellow so far i trust it is better for them to know each others minds but how it is to be  but papa you know sir matthew fleet said she was sure to get well and in three years time  yes yes that is the best chance but it is a dreary lookout for two young things that is in wiser hands however if only i saw what was right to do my miserable carelessness has undone you all he concluded almost inaudibly  it was indeed to him a time of great distress and perplexity wishing to act the part of father and mother both towards his daughter acutely feeling his want of calm decision and torn to pieces at once by sympathy with the lovers and by delicacy that held him back from seeming to bind the young man to an uncertain engagement above all tortured by selfreproach for the commencement of the attachment and for the misfortune that had rendered its prosperity doubtful  ethel could find no words of comfort in the bewildered glimpse at his sorrow and agitation richard spoke with calmness and good sense and his replies though brief and commonplace were not without effect in lessening the excitement and despondency which the poor doctors present mood had been aggravating  at the door dr may asked for flora and ethel explained if flora had obtruded herself he would have been irritated but as it was he had no time to observe the disobedience and saying that he hoped she was with margaret sent ethel into the drawingroom  flora was not there only margaret lay on her sofa and ethel hesitated shy curious and alarmed but as she approached she was relieved to see the blue eyes more serene even than usual while a glow of colour spread over her face making her like the blooming margaret of old times her expression was full of peace but became somewhat amused at ethels timid awkward pauses as she held out her hands and said come dear ethel  oh margaret margaret  and ethel was drawn into her sisters bosom presently she drew back gazed at her sister inquiringly and said in an odd doubtful voice then you are glad  margaret nearly laughed at the strange manner but spoke with a sorrowful tone glad in one way dearest almost too glad and grateful  oh i am so glad again said ethel i thought it was making everybody unhappy  i dont believe i could be that now he has come now i know and her voice trembled there must be doubt and uncertainty she added but i cannot dwell on them just yet they will settle what is right i know and happen what may i have always this to remember  oh that is right papa will be so relieved he was afraid it had only been distress  poor papa yes i did not command myself at first i was not sure whether it was right to see him at all  oh margaret that was too bad  it did not seem right to encourage any suchsuch the word was lost to such a poor helpless thing as i am i did not know what to do and i am afraid i behaved like a silly child and did not think of dear papas feelings but i will try to be good and leave it all to them  and you are going to be happy said ethel wistfully  for the present at least i cannot help it said margaret oh he is so kind and so unselfish and so beautifully gentleand to think of his still caring but there dear ethel i am not going to cry do call papa or he will think me foolish again i want him to be quite at ease about me before he comes  then he is coming  yes at teatimeso run dear ethel and tell jane to get his room ready  the message quickened ethel and after giving it and reporting consolingly to her father she went up to flora who had been a voluntary prisoner upstairs all this time and was not peculiarly gratified at such tidings coming only through the medium of ethel she had before been sensible that superior in discretion and effectiveness as she was acknowledged to be she did not share so much of the confidence and sympathy as some of the others and she felt mortified and injured though in this case it was entirely her own fault the sense of alienation grew upon her  she dressed quickly and hurried down that she might see margaret alone but the room was already prepared for tea and the children were fast assembling ethel came down a few minutes after and found blanche claiming alan ernescliffe as her lawful property dancing round him chattering and looking injured if he addressed a word to any one else  how did lovers look was a speculation which had more than once occupied ethel and when she had satisfied herself that her father was at ease she began to study it as soon as a shamefaced consciousness would allow her after alans warm shake of the hand  margaret looked much as usual only with more glow and brightnessmr ernescliffe not far otherwise he was as pale and slight as on his last visit with the same soft blue eyes capable however of a peculiar keen steady glance when he was listening and which now seemed to be attending to margarets every word or look through all the delighted uproar which aubrey blanche and mary kept up round him or while taking his share in the general conversation telling of harrys popularity and good conduct on board the alcestis or listening to the history of normans school adventures which he had heard in part from harry and how young jennings was entered in the flagship as a boy though not yet to sail with his father  after the storm of the day the sky seemed quite clear and ethel could not see that being lovers made much difference to be sure papa displeased blanche by calling her away to his side when she would squeeze her chair in between alans and the sofa and alan took all the waiting on margaret exclusively to himself otherwise there was nothing remarkable and he was very much the same mr ernescliffe whom they had received a year ago  in truth the next ten days were very happy the future was left to rest and alan spent his mornings in the drawingroom alone with margaret and looked ever more brightly placid while with the rest he was more than the former kind playfellow for he now took his place as the affectionate elder brother entering warmly into all their schemes and pleasures and winning for himself a full measure of affection from all even his little goddaughter began to know him and smile at his presence margaret and ethel especially delighted in the look of enjoyment with which their father sat down to enter on the evenings conversation after the days work and flora was well pleased that mrs hoxton should find alan in the drawingroom and ask afterwards about his estate and that meta rivers after being certified that this was their mr ernescliffe pronounced that her papa thought him particularly pleasing and gentlemanlike there was something dignified in having a sister on the point of being engaged     chapter xxviii         sail forth into the sea thou ship        through breeze and cloud right onward steer      the moistened eye the trembling lip        are not the signs of doubt or fearlongfellow   tranquility only lasted until mr ernescliffe found it necessary to understand on what terms he was to stand every one was tender of conscience anxious to do right and desirous to yield to the opinion that nobody could or would give while alan begged for a positive engagement margaret scrupled to exchange promises that she might never be able to fulfil and both agreed to leave all to her father who in every way ought to have the best ability to judge whether there was unreasonable presumption in such a betrothal but this very ability only served to perplex the poor doctor more and more it is far easier for a man to decide when he sees only one bearing of a case than when like dr may he not only sees them but is rent by them in his inmost heart sympathising in turn with each lover bitterly accusing his own carelessness as the cause of all their troubles his doubts contending with his hopes his conviction clashing with sir matthew fleets opinion his conscientious sincerity and delicacy conflicting with his affection and eagerness he was perfectly incapable of coming to a decision and suffered so cruelly that margaret was doubly distressed for his sake and alan felt himself guilty of having rendered everybody miserable  dr may could not conceal his trouble and rendered ethel almost as unhappy as himself after each conversation with her though her hopes usually sprang up again and she had a happy conviction that this was only the second volume of the novel flora was not often called into his councils confidence never came spontaneously from dr may to her there was something that did not draw it forth towards her whether it resided in that halfsarcastic corner of her steady blue eye or in the grave commonsense of her gentle voice her view of the case was known to be that there was no need for so much perplexitywhy should not alan be the best judge of his own happiness if margaret were to be delicate for life it would be better to have such a home to look to and she soothed and comforted margaret and talked in a strain of unmixed hope and anticipation that often drew a smile from her sister though she feared to trust to it  floras tact and consideration in keeping the children away when the lovers could best be alone and letting them in when the discussion was becoming useless and harassing her cheerful smiles her evening music that covered all sounds her removal of all extra annoyances were invaluable and margaret appreciated them as indeed flora took care that she should  margaret begged to know her eldest brothers judgment but had great difficulty in dragging it out diffidently as it was proposed it was clear and decided he thought that his father had better send sir matthew fleet a statement of margarets present condition and abide by his answer as to whether her progress warranted the hope of her restoration  never was richard more surprised than by the gratitude with which his suggestion was hailed simple as it was so that it seemed obvious that others should have already thought of it after the tossings of uncertainty it was a positive relief to refer the question to some external voice and only ethel and norman expressed strong dislike to sir matthew becoming the arbiter of margarets fate and were scarcely pacified by dr mays assurance that he had not revealed the occasion of his inquiry the letter was sent and repose returned but hearts beat high on the morning when the answer was expected  dr may watched the moment when his daughter was alone carried the letter to her and kissing her said with an oppressed voice i give you joy my dear  she read with suspended breath and palpitating heart sir matthew thought her improvement sure though slow and had barely a doubt that in a year she would have regained her full strength and activity  you will show it to alan said dr may as margaret lifted her eyes to his face inquiringly  will not you she said  i cannot he answered i wish i was more helpful to you my child he added wistfully but you will rest on him and be happy together while he stays will you not  indeed i will dear papa  mr ernescliffe was with her as the doctor quitted her she held the letter to him but she said slowly i see that papa does not believe it  you promised to abide by it he exclaimed between entreaty and authority  i do if you choose so to risk your hopes  but cried he as he glanced hastily over the letter there can be no doubt these words are as certain as language can make them why will you not trust them  i see that papa does not  despondency and selfreproach made him morbidly anxious believe so my margaret you know he is no surgeon  his education included that line said margaret i believe he has all but the manual dexterity however i would fain have faith in sir matthew she added smiling and perhaps i am only swayed by the habit of thinking that papa must know best  he does in indifferent cases but it is an old axiom that a medical man should not prescribe for his own family above all in such a case where it is but reasonable to believe an unprejudiced stranger who alone is cool enough to be relied on i absolutely depend on him  margaret absolutely depended on the bright cheerful look of conviction yes she said we will try to make papa take pleasure in the prospect perhaps i could do more if i made the attempt  i am sure you could if you would let me give you more support if i were but going to remain with you  dont let us be discontented said margaret smiling when so much more has been granted than i dare to hope be it as it may let us be happy in what we have  it makes you happy said he archly reading her face to draw out the avowal but he only made her hide it with a mute caress of the hand that held hers she was glad enough to rest in the present now that everything concurred to satisfy her conscience in so doing and come what might the days now spent together would be a possession of joy for ever  captain gordon contrived to afford his lieutenant another fortnights leave perhaps because he was in dread of losing him altogether for alan had some doubts and many longings to remain had it been possible to marry at once he would have quitted the navy immediately and he would have given worlds to linger beside margarets couch and claim her the first moment possible believing his care more availing than all he was however so pledged to captain gordon that without strong cause he would not have been justified in withdrawing besides harry was under his charge and dr may and margaret both thought with the captain that an active life would be a better occupation for him than watching her he would never be able to settle down at his new home comfortably without her and he would be more in the way of duty while pursuing his profession so margaret nerved herself against using her influence to detain him and he thanked her for it  though hope and affection could not an once repair an injured spine they had wonderful powers in inciting margaret to new efforts alan was as tender and ready of hand as richard and more clever and enterprising and her unfailing trust in him prevented all alarms and misgivings so that wonders were effected and her father beheld her standing with so little support looking so healthful and so blithe that his forebodings melted away and he talked joyously of the future  the great achievement was taking her round the garden she could not bear the motion of wheels but alan adopted the hammock principle and with the aid of richard and his crony the carpenter produced a machine in which no other power on earth could have prevailed on her to trust herself but in which she was carried round the garden so successfully that there was even a talk of next sunday and of the minster  it was safely accomplished and tired as she was margaret felt as she whispered to alan that he had now crowned all the joy that he had brought to her  ethel used to watch them and think how beautiful their countenances were and talk them over with her father who was quite happy about them now she gave assistance which alan never once called unhandy to all his contrivances and often floundered in upon his conferences with margaret in a way that would have been very provoking if she had not always blushed and looked so excessively discomfited and they had only to laugh and reassure her  alan was struck by finding that the casual words spoken on the way from cocksmoor had been so strenuously acted on and he brought on himself a whole torrent of ethels confused narratives which richard and flora would fain have checked but margaret let them continue as she saw him a willing listener and was grateful to him for comprehending the ardent girl  he declared himself to have a share in the matter reminding ethel of her appeal to him to bind himself to the service of cocksmoor he sent a sovereign at once to aid in a case of the sudden death of a pig and when securely established in his brotherly right he begged ethel to let him know what would help her most she stood colouring twisting her hands and wondering what to say whereupon he relieved her by a proposal to leave an order for ten pounds to be yearly paid into her hands as a fixed income for her school  a thousand a year could hardly have been so much to ethel thank you oh this is charming we could set up a regular school cherry elwood is the very woman alan you have made our fortune oh margaret margaret i must go and tell ritchie and mary this is the first real step to our church and all  may i do it said alan turning to margaret as ethel frantically burst out of the room perhaps i should have asked leave  i was going to thank you said margaret it is the very kindest thing you could have done by dear ethel the greatest comfort to us she will be at peace now when anything hinders her from going to cocksmoor  i wonder said alan musing whether we shall ever be able to help her more substantially i cannot do anything hastily for you know maplewood is still in the hands of the executors and i cannot tell what claims there may be upon me but byandby when i return if i find no other pressing duty might not a church at cocksmoor be a thankoffering for all i have found here  oh alan what joy it would be  it is a long way off he said sadly and perhaps her force of perseverance will have prevailed alone  i suppose i must not tell her even as a vision  it is too uncertain i do not know the wants of the maplewood people and i must provide for hector i would not let these vague dreams interfere with her resolute work but margaret what a vision it is i can see you laying the first stone on that fine heathy brow  oh your godchild should lay the first stone  she shall and you shall lead her and there shall be ethels sharp face full of indescribable things as she marshals her children and richard shall be curate and read in his steady soft tone and your father shall look sunny with his boys around him and you  oh alan said margaret who had been listening with a smile it is indeed a long way off  i shall look to it as the haven where i would be said the sailor  they often spoke together of this scheme ever decking it in brighter colours the topic seemed to suit them better than their own future for there was no dwelling on that without an occasional misgiving and the more glad the anticipation the deeper the sigh that followed on margarets part till mr ernescliffe followed her lead and they seldom spoke of these uncertainties but outwardly smiled over the present inwardly dwelt on the truly certain hopes there were readings shared together made more precious than all by the conversations that ensued  the hour for parting came at last ethel never knew what passed in the drawingroom whence every one was carefully excluded dr may wandered about keeping guard over the door and watching the clock till at the last moment he knocked and called in a trembling voice ernescliffe alan it is past the quarter you must not stay  the other farewells were hurried alan seemed voiceless only nodding in reply to marys vociferous messages to harry and huskily whispering to ethel good luck to cocksmoor  the next moment the door had shut on him and dr may and flora had gone to her sister whom she found not tearful but begging to be left alone  when they saw her again she was cheerful she kept up her composure and animation without flagging nor did she discontinue her new exertions but seemed decidedly the happier for all that had passed  letters came every day for her and presents to every one ethel had a gold chain and eyeglass which it was hoped might cure her of frowning and stooping though her various ways of dangling her new possession caused her to be so much teased by flora and norman that but for regard to margarets feelings she would not have worn it for three days  to mary was sent a daguerreotype of harry her glory and delight say who would that it had pigs eyes a savage frown a pudding chin there were his own tight rings of hair his goldbanded cap his bright buttons how could she prize it enough she exhibited it to the little ones ten times a day she kissed it night and morning and registered her vow always to sleep with it under her pilow in a letter of thanks which margaret defended and despatched in spite of miss winters horrors at its disregard of orthography  it was nearly the last letter before the alcestis was heard of at spithead then she sailed she sent in her letters to plymouth and her final greetings by a falmouth cutterpoor harrys wild scrawl in pencil looking very seasick   dear papa and all goodbye we are out of sight of land three years and keep up a good heart i shall soon be all right                                         your h may   it was enclosed in mr ernescliffes envelope and with it came tidings that harrys brave spirit was not failing even under untoward circumstances but he had struggled on deck and tried to write when all his contemporaries had given in in fact he was a fine fellowevery one liked him and captain gordon though chary of commendation had held him up to the other youngsters as an example of knowing what a sailor was meant to be like  margaret smiled and cried over the news when she imparted itbut all serenelyand though she was glad to be alone and wrote journals for alan when she could not send letters she exerted herself to be the same sister as usual to the rest of the household and not to give way to her wandering musings  from one subject her attention never strayed ethel had never found any lack of sympathy in her for her cocksmoor pursuits but the change now showed that where once margaret had been interested merely as a kind sister she now had a personal concern and she threw herself into all that related to it as her own chief interest and pursuitbecoming the foremost in devising plans and arranging the best means of using mr ernescliffes benefaction  the elwood family had grown in the good opinion of the mays charity had hobbled to church leaning on her fathers arm and being invited to dinner in the kitchen the acquaintance had been improved and nurse herself had pronounced her such a tidy good sort of body that it was a pity she had met with such a misfortune if miss ethel brought in nothing but the like of her they should be welcome poor thing how tired she was  nurses opinions were apt to be sagacious especially when in the face of her prejudices and this gave margaret confidence cherry proved to have been carefully taught by a good clergyman and his wife and to be of very different stamp from the persons to whom the girls were accustomed they were charmed with her and eagerly offered to supply her with booksrespecting her the more when they found that mr hazlewood had already lent her their chief favourites other and greater needs they had no power to fill up  it is so lone without the church bells you see miss said mrs elwood our tower had a real fine peal and my man was one of the ringers i seems quite lost without them and there was cherry went amost every day with the children  every day cried mary looking at her with respect  it was so near said cherry i could get there easy and i got used to it when i was at school  did it not take up a great deal of time said ethel  why you see maam it came morning and night out of working times and i cant be stirring much  then you miss it sadly said ethel  yes maam it made the day go on well like and settled a bodys mind when i fretted for what could not be helped but i try not to fret after it now and mr hazlewood said if i did my best wherever i was the lord would still join our prayers together  mr hazlewood was recollected by mr wilmot as an old college friend and a correspondence with him fully confirmed the favourable estimate of the elwoods and was decisive in determining that the dayschool with alans ten pounds as salary and a penny a week from each child should be offered to cherry  mr hazlewood answered for her sound excellence and aptitude for managing little children though he did not promise genius such as should fulfil the requirements of modern days with these cocksmoor could dispense at present cherry was humbly gratified and her parents delighted with the honour and profit there was a kitchen which afforded great facilities and richard and his carpenter managed the fitting to admiration margaret devised all manner of useful arrangements settled matters with great earnestness saw cherry frequently discussed plans and learned the history and character of each child as thoroughly as ethel herself mr ramsden himself came to the opening of the school and said so much of the obligations of cocksmoor to the young ladies that ethel would not have known which way to look if flora had not kindly borne the brunt of his compliments  every one was pleased except mrs green who took upon herself to set about various malicious reports of cherry elwood but nobody cared for them except mrs elwood who flew into such passions that ethel was quite disappointed in her though not in cherry who meekly tried to silence her mother begged the young ladies not to be vexed and showed a quiet dignity that soon made the shafts of slander fall inoffensively  all went well there was a school instead of a hubbub clean faces instead of dirty shining hair instead of wild elflocks orderly children instead of little savages the order and obedience that ethel could not gain in six months seemed impressed in six days by cherry the neat work made her popular with the mothers her firm gentleness won the hearts of the children and the kitchen was filled not only with boys and girls from the quarry but with some little ones from outlying cottages of fordholm and abbotstoke and there was even a smart little farmer who had been unbearable at home  margarets unsuccessful bathchair was lent to cherry and in it her scholars drew her to stoneborough every sunday and slowly began to redeem their character with the ladies who began to lose the habit of shrinking out of their waythe stoneborough children did so instead and flora and ethel were always bringing home stories of injustice to their scholars fancied or real and of triumphs in their having excelled any national school girl the most stupid children at cocksmoor always seemed to them wise in comparison with the stoneborough girls and the sundayschool might have become to ethel a school of rivalry if richard had not opened her eyes by a quiet observation that the town girls seemed to fare as ill with her as the cocksmoor girls did with the town ladies then she caught herself up tried to be candid and found that she was not always impartial in her judgments why would competition mingle even in the best attempts  cherry did not so bring forward her scholars that ethel could have many triumphs of this dangerous kind indeed ethel was often vexed with her for though she taught needlework admirably and enforced correct reading and reverent repetition her strong provincial dialect was a stumblingblock she could not put questions without book and nothing would teach her ethels rational system of arithmetic that she was a capital dame and made the children very good was allowed but now and then when mortified by hearing what was done at stoneborough fordholm or abbotstoke ethel would make vigorous efforts which resulted only in her coming home fuming at cherrys outrageous dullness  these railings always hurt margaret who had made cherry almost into a friend and generally liked to have a visit from her during the sunday when she always dined with the servants then school questions cocksmoor news and the tempers of the children were talked over and cherry was now and then drawn into home reminiscences and descriptions of the ways of her former school there was no fear of spoiling hernotice from her superiors was natural to her and she had the ladylikeness of womanly goodness so as never to go beyond her own place she had had many trials too and margaret learned the true history of them as she won cherrys confidence and entered into them feeling their likeness yet dissimilarity to her own  cherry had been a brisk happy girl in a good place resting in one of the long engagements that often extend over half the life of a servant enjoying the nod of her baker as he left his bread and her walk from church with him on alternate sundays but poor cherry had been exposed to the perils of windowcleaning and after a frightful fall had wakened to find herself in a hospital and her severe sufferings had left her a cripple for life  and the baker had not been an alan ernescliffe she did not complain of himhe had come to see her and had been much grieved but she had told him she could never be a useful wife and before she had used her crutches he was married to her pretty fellowservant  cherry spoke very simply she hoped it was better for long and believed susan would make him a good wife ethel would have thought she did not feel but margaret knew better  she stroked the thin slight fingers and gently said poor cherry and cherry wiped away a tear and said yes maam thank you it is best for him i should not have wished him to grieve for what cannot be helped  resignation is the great comfort  yes maam i have a great deal to be thankful for i dont blame no one but i do see how some as are married seem to get to think more of this world and now and then i fancy i can see how it is best for me as it is  margaret sighed as she remembered certain thoughts before alans return  then maam there has been such goodness i did vex at being a poor helpless thing nothing but a burden on father and when we had to go from home and mr and mrs hazlewood and all i cant tell you how bad it was maam  then you are comforted now  yes maam said cherry brightening it seems as if he had given me something to do and there are you and mr richard and miss ethel to help i should like please god to be of some good to those poor children  i am sure you will cherry i wish i could do as much  cherrys tears had come again ah maam you and she stopped short and rose to depart margaret held out her hand to wish her goodbye please miss i was thinking how mr hazlewood said that god fits our place to us and us to our place  thank you cherry you are leaving me something to remember  and margaret lay questioning with herself whether the schoolmistress had not been the most selfdenying of the two but withal gazing on the hoop of pearls which alan had chosen as the ring of betrothal  the pearl of great price murmured she to herself if we hold that the rest will soon matter but little it remaineth that both they that have wives be as they that have none and they that weep as though they wept not and they that rejoice as though they rejoiced not if ever alan and i have a home together upon earth may all too confident joy be tempered by the fears that we have begun with i hope this probation may make me less likely to be taken up with the cares and pleasures of his position than i might have been last year he is one who can best help the mind to go truly upward but oh that voyage     chapter xxix         heart affluence in household talk      from social fountains never drytennyson   what a bore  whats the matter now  here has this old fellow asked me to dinner again  a fine pass we are come to cried dr may half amused half irate i should like to know what i should have said at your age if the headmaster had asked me to dinner  papa is not so very fond of dining at dr hoxtons said ethel a whippersnapper schoolboy who might be thankful to dine anywhere continued dr may while the girls burst out laughing and norman looked injured  it is very ungrateful of norman said flora i cannot see what he finds to complain of  you would know said norman if instead of playing those perpetual tunes of yours you had to sit it out in that perfumy drawingroom without anything to listen to worth hearing if i have looked over that court album once i have a dozen times and there is not another book in the place  i am glad there is not said flora i am quite ashamed to see you for ever turning over those old pictures you cannot guess how stupid you look i wonder mrs hoxton likes to have you she added patting his shoulders between jest and earnest  i wish she would not then it is only to escort you  nonsense norman you know better cried ethel you know it is for your own sake and to make up for their injustice that he invites you or flora either  hush ethel he gives himself quite airs enough already said the doctor  papa said ethel in vexation though he gave her a pinch to show it was all in good humour while he went on i am glad to hear they do leave him to himself in a corner a very good thing too where else should a great gawky schoolboy be  safe at home where i wish he would let me be muttered norman though he contrived to smile and followed flora out of the room without subjecting himself to the imputation of offended dignity  ethel was displeased and began her defence papa i wish and there she checked herself  eh miss ethels bristles up said her father who seemed in a somewhat mischievous mood of teasing  how could you papa cried she  how could i what miss etheldred  plague normanthe words would come accuse him of airs  i hate to see young fellows above taking an honour from their elders said dr may  now papa papa you know it is no such thing dr hoxtons parties are very dullyou know they are and it is not fair on norman if he was set up and delighted at going so often then you would call him conceited  conceit has a good many lurkingplaces said dr may it is harder to go and be overlooked than to stay at home  now papa you are not to call norman conceited cried ethel you dont believe that he is any such thing  why not exactly said dr may smiling the boy has missed it marvellously but you see he has everything that subtle imp would wish to feed upon and it is no harm to give him a lick with the rough side of the tongue as your canny scots grandfather used to say  ah if you knew papa began ethel  if i knew  no no i must not tell  what a secret is there  i wish it was not i should like to tell you very much but then you see it is normans and you are to be surprised  your surprise is likely to be very much like blanches birthday presents a stage aside  no i am going to keep it to myself  two or three days after as ethel was going to the schoolroom after breakfast dr may beckoned her back to the diningroom and with his merry look of significance said well maam i have found out your mystery  about norman oh papa did he tell you  when i came home from the hospital last night at an hour when all respectable characters except doctors and police should be in their warm beds i beheld a light in normans window so methought i would see what gravity was doing out of his bed at midnight  and you found him at his greek  so that was the meaning of his looking so lank and careworn just as he did last year and he the prince of the school i could have found it in my heart to fling the books at his head  but you consent dont you to his going up for the scholarship  i consent to anything as long as he keeps within due bounds and does not work himself to death i am glad of knowing it for now i can put a moderate check upon it  and did he tell you all about it  he told me he felt as if he owed it to us to gain something for himself since i had given up the randall to gratify hima pretty sort of gratification  yes and he will be glad to get away from school he says he knows it is bad for himas it is uncomfortable to be singled out in the way dr hoxton does now you know pleaded ethel it is not ingratitude or elation but it is somehow not nice to be treated as he is set apart from the rest  true dr hoxton never had taste or judgment if norman were not a lusus naturae said dr may hesitating for a word his head would have been turned long ago and he wants companions toohe has been forced out of boyhood too soon poor fellowand harry gone too he does not get anything like real relaxation and he will be better among youths than boys stoneborough will never be what it was in my time added the doctor mournfully i never thought to see the poor old place come to this but therewhen all the better class send their sons to the great public schools and leave nothing but riffraff here one is forced for a boys own sake to do the same  oh i am so glad then you have consented to the rest of normans scheme and will not keep poor little tom at school here without him  by what he tells me it would be downright ruin to the boy i little thought to have to take a son of mine away from stoneborough but norman is the best judge and he is the only person who seems to have made any impression on tom so i shall let it be in fact he added half smiling i dont know what i could refuse old june  thats right cried ethel that is so nice then if norman gets the scholarship tom is to go to mr wilmot first and then to eton  if norman gains the scholarship but that is an if said dr may as though hoping for a loophole to escape offending the shade of bishop whichcote  oh papa you cannot doubt of that  i cannot tell ethel he is facile princeps here in his own world but we do not know how it may be when he is measured with public schoolmen who have had more firstrate tutorship than poor old hoxtons  ah he says so but i thought that was all his humility  better he should be prepared if he had had all those advantagesbut it may be as well after all i always had a hankering to have sent him to eton but your dear mother used to say it was not fair on the others and now to see him striving in order to give the advantage of it to his little brother i only hope master thomas is worthy of itbut it is a boy i cant understand  nor i said ethel he never seems to say anything he can help and goes after norman without talking to any one else  i give him up to normans management said dr may he says the boy is very clever but i have not seen it and as to more serious mattershowever i must take it on normans word that he is wishing to learn truth we made an utter mistake about him i dont know who is to blame for it  have you told margaret about normans plan asked ethel  no he desired me to say nothing indeed i should not like toms leaving school to be talked of beforehand  norman said he did not want flora to hear because she is so much with the hoxtons and he said they would all watch him  ay ay and we must keep his secret what a boy it is but it is not safe to say conceited things we shall have a fall yet ethel not seventeen remember and brought up at a mere grammarschool  but we shall still have the spirit that made him try said ethel and that is the thing  and to tell the truth said the doctor lingering for my own part i dont care a rush for it and he dashed off to his work while ethel stood laughing  papa was so very kind said norman tremulously when ethel followed him to his room to congratulate him on having gained his fathers assent of which he had been more in doubt than she  and you see he quite approves of the scheme for tom except for thinking it disrespect to bishop whichcote he said he only hoped tom was worthy of it  tom cried norman take my word for it ethel tom will surprise you all he will beat us all to nothing i know  if only he can be cured of  he will said norman when once he has outgrown his frights and that he may do at mr wilmots apart from those fellows when i go up for this scholarship you must look after his lessons and see if you are not surprised at his construing  when you go it will be in a month  he has told no one i hope  no but i hardly think he will bear not telling margaret  welli hate a thing being out of ones own keeping i should not so much dislike margarets knowing but i wont have flora knowmind that ethel he said with disproportionate vehemence  i only hope flora will not be vexed but oh dear how nice it will be when you have it telling meta rivers and all  and this is a fine way of getting it standing talking here not that i shallyou little know what public schools can do but that is no reason against trying  goodnight then only one thing more you mean that till further orders margaret should not know  of course said norman impatiently she wont take any of floras silly affronts and what is more she would not care half so much as before alan ernescliffe came  oh norman norman im sure  why it is what they always say everybody cant be first and ernescliffe has the biggest half of her i can see  i am sure i did not said ethel in a mortified voice  why of course it always comes of people having lovers  then i am sure i wont exclaimed ethel  norman went into a fit of laughing  you may laugh norman but i will never let papa or any of you be second to any one she cried vehemently  a brotherly hometruth followed nobody asked you sir she said was muttered by norman still laughing heartily  i know said ethel not in the least offended i am very ugly and very awkward but i dont care there never can be anybody in all the world that i shall like half as well as papa and i am glad no one is ever likely to make me care less for him and cocksmoor  stay till you are tried said norman  ethel squeezed up her eyes curled up her nose showed her teeth in a horrible grimace and made a sort of snarl yah thats the face i shall make at them and then with another goodnight ran to her own room  norman was to a certain extent right with regard to margarether thoughts and interest had been chiefly engrossed by alan ernescliffe and so far drawn away from her own family that when the alcestis was absolutely gone beyond all reach of letters for the present margaret could not help feeling somewhat of a void and as if the home concerns were not so entire an occupation for her mind as formerly  she would fain have thrown herself into them again but she became conscious that there was a difference she was still the object of her fathers intense tenderness and solicitude indeed she could not be otherwise but it came over her sometimes that she was less necessary to him than in the first year he was not conscious of any change and indeed it hardly amounted to a change and yet margaret lying inactive and thoughtful began to observe that the fullness of his confidence was passing to ethel now and then it would appear that he fancied he had told margaret little matters when he had really told them to ethel and it was ethel who would linger with him in the drawingroom after the others had gone up at night or who would be late at the mornings reading and disarm miss winter by pleading that papa had been talking to her the secret they shared together was of course the origin of much of this but also ethel was now more entirely the doctors own than margaret could be after her engagement and there was a likeness of mind between the father and daughter that could not but develop more in this year than in all ethels life when she had made the most rapid progress perhaps too the doctor looked on margaret rather as the authority and mistress of his house while ethel was more of a playfellow and thus without either having the least suspicion that the one sister was taking the place of the other and without any actual neglect of margaret ethel was his chief companion  how excited and anxious norman looks said margaret one day when he had rushed in at the dinnerhour asking for his father and when he could not find him shouting out for ethel i hope there is nothing amiss he has looked thin and worn for some time and yet his work at school is very easy to him  i wish there maybe nothing wrong there again said flora there theres the front door banging he is off ethel stepping to the door and calling in her sister who came from the street door her hair blowing about with the wind what did norman want  only to know whether papa had left a note for dr hoxton said ethel looking very confused and very merry  that was not all said flora now dont be absurd etheli hate mysteries  last time i had a secret you would not believe it said ethel laughing  come exclaimed flora why cannot you tell us at once what is going on  because i was desired not said ethel you will hear it soon enough and she capered a little  let her alone flora said margaret i see there is nothing wrong  if she is desired to be silent there is nothing to be said replied flora sitting down again while ethel ran away to guard her secret  absurd muttered flora i cannot imagine why ethel is always making mysteries  she cannot help other people having confidence in her said margaret gently  she need not be so important then said floraalways having private conferences with papa i do not think it is at all fair on the rest  ethel is a very superior person said margaret with half a sigh  flora might toss her head but she attempted no denial in words and continued margaret if papa does find her his best companion and friend we ought to be glad of it  i do not call it just said flora  i do not think it can be helped said margaret the best must be preferred  as to that ethel is often very ridiculous and silly  she is improving every day and you know dear mamma always thought her the finest character amongst us  then you are ready to be left out and have your third sister always put before you  no flora that is not the case neither she nor papa would ever be unfair but as she would say herself what they cant help they cant help and as she grows older she must surpass me more and more  and you like it  i like itwhenwhen i think of papa and of his dear noble ethel i do like it when i am not selfish  margaret turned away her head but presently looked up again  only flora she said pray do not say one word of this on any account to ethel she is so happy with papa and i would not for anything have her think i feel neglected or had any jealousy  ah thought flora you can give up sweetly but you have alan to fall back upon now i who certainly have the best right and a great deal more practical sense  flora took margarets advice and did not reproach ethel for a little reflection convinced her that she should make a silly figure in so doing and she did not like altercations  it was the same evening that norman came in from school with his hands full of papers and with one voice his father and ethel exclaimed you have them  yes and he gave the letter to his father while blanche who had a very inquisitive pair of eyes began to read from a paper he placed on the table  norman walter son of richard and margaret may high street doctor of medicine december 21st 18 thomas ramsden  what is that for norman and as he did not attend she called mary to share her speculations and spell out the words  ha cried dr may this is capital the old doctor seems not to know how to say enough for you have you read it  no he only told me he had said something in my favour and wished me all success  success cried mary oh norman you are not going to sea too  no no interposed blanche knowinglyhe is going to be married i heard nurse wish her brother success when he was going to marry the washerwoman with a red face  no said mary people never are married till they are twenty  but i tell you persisted blanche people always write like this in a great book in church when they are married i know for we always go into church with lucy and nurse when there is a wedding  well norman i wish you success with the bride you are to court said dr may much diverted with the young ladies conjectures  but is it really said mary making her eyes as round as full moons  is it really repeated blanche oh dear is norman going to be married i wish it was to be meta rivers for then i could always ride her dear little white pony  tell them whispered norman a good deal out of countenance as he leaned over ethel and quitted the room  ethel cried now then and looked at her father while blanche and mary reiterated inquiriesmarriage and going to sea being the only events that in their imagination the world could furnish going to try for a balliol scholarship it was a sad falling off even if they understood what it meant the doctors explanations to margaret had a tone of apology for having kept her in ignorance and flora said few words but felt herself injured she had nearly gone to mrs hoxton that afternoon and how strange it would have been if anything had been said to her of her own brothers projects when she was in ignorance  ethel slipped away to her brother who was in his own room surrounded with books flushed and anxious and trying to glance over each subject on which he felt himself weak  i shall fail i know i shall was his exclamation i wish i had never thought of it  what did dr hoxton think you not likely to succeed cried ethel in consternation  oh he said i was certain but what is that we stoneborough men only compare ourselves with each other i shall break down to a certainty and my father will be disappointed  you will do your best  i dont know that my best will all go away when it comes to the point  surely not it did not go away last time you were examined and why should it now  i tell you ethel you know nothing about it i have not got up half what i meant to have done here do take this booktry me whether i know this properly  so they went on ethel doing her best to help and encourage and norman in an excited state of restless despair which drove away half his senses and recollection and his ideas of the superior powers of public schoolboys magnifying every moment they were summoned downstairs to prayers but went up again at once and more than an hour subsequently when their father paid one of his domiciliary visits there they still were with their latin and greek spread out norman trying to strengthen all doubtful points but in a desperate desultory manner that only confused him more and more till he was obliged to lay his head down on the table shut his eyes and run his fingers through his hair before he could recollect the simplest matter his renderings alternated with groans and cold as was the room his cheeks and brow were flushed and burning  the doctor checked all this by saying gravely and sternly this is not right norman where are all your resolutions  i shall never do it i ought never to have thought of it i shall never succeed  what if you do not said dr may laying his hand on his shoulder  what why toms chance lostyou will all be mortified said norman hesitating in some confusion  i will take care of tom said dr may  and he will have been foiled said ethel  if he is  the boy and girl were both silent  are you striving for mere victorys sake norman continued his father  i thought not murmured norman  successful or not you will have done your utmost for us you would not lose one jot of affection or esteem and tom shall not suffer is it worth this agony  no it is foolish said norman with trembling voice almost as if he could have burst into tears he was quite unnerved by the anxiety and toil with which he had overtasked himself beyond his fathers knowledge  oh papa pleaded ethel who could not bear to see him pained  it is foolish continued dr may who felt it was the moment for bracing severity it is rendering you unmanly it is wrong  again ethel made an exclamation of entreaty  it is wrong i know repeated norman but you dont know what it is to get into the spirit of the thing  do you think i do not said the doctor i can tell exactly what you feel now if i had not been an idle dog i should have gone through it all many more times  what shall i do asked norman in a wornout voice  put all this out of your mind sleep quietly and dont open another book  norman moved his head as if sleep were beyond his power  i will read you something to calm your tone said dr may and he took up a prayerbook know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible and norman that is not the struggle where the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong nor the contest where the conqueror only wins vanity and vexation of spirit  norman had cast down his eyes and hardly made answer but the words had evidently taken effect the doctor only further bade him goodnight with a whispered blessing and taking ethel by the hand drew her away when they met the next morning the excitement had passed from normans manner but he looked dejected and resigned he had made up his mind to lose and was not grateful for good wishes he ought never to have thought he said of competing with men from public schools and he knew his return of love of vainglory deserved that he should fail however he was now calm enough not to be likely to do himself injustice by nervousness and margaret hid hopes that richards steady equable mind would have a salutary influence so commending toms lessons to ethel and hearing but not marking countless messages to richard he set forth upon his emprise while his anxiety seemed to remain as a legacy for those at home  poor dr may confessed that his practice by no means agreed with his precept for he could think of nothing else and was almost as bad as norman in his certainty that the boy would fail from mere nervousness margaret was the better companion for him now attaching less intensity of interest to normans success than did ethel she was the more able to compose him and cheer his hopes     chapter xxx         weary soul and burdened sore        labouring with thy secret load      fear not all thy griefs to pour        in this heart loves true abode                                    lyra innocentium   tea had just been brought in on the eighth evening from normans departure when there was a ring at the bell there was a start and look of expectation only a patient said the doctor but it surely was not for that reason that he rose with so much alacrity and opened the door nor was well old fellow the greeting for his patientsso everybody sprang after him and beheld something tall taking off a coat while a voice said i have got it  the mass of children rushed back to margaret screaming he has got it and then aubrey trotted out into the hall again to see what norman had got  a happy face at least said margaret as he came to her and that was not peculiar to norman the radiance had shone out upon every one in that moment and it was one buzz of happy exclamation query and answerthe only tone of regret when mary spoke of harry and all at once took up the strainhow glad poor harry would be as to the examination that had been much less difficult than norman had expected in fact he said it was lucky for him that the very subjects had been chosen in which he was most upluck which as the doctor could not help observing generally did attend norman and norman had been so happy with richard the kind wise elder brother had done exactly what was best for him in soothing his anxiety and had fully shared his feelings and exulted in his success margaret had a most triumphant letter dwelling on the abilities of the candidates whom norman had outstripped and the idea that every one had conceived of his talent indeed wrote richard i fancy the men had never believed that i could have a clever brother i am glad they have seen what norman can do  margaret could not help reading this aloud and it made norman blush with the compunction that richards unselfish pride in him always excited he had much to tell of his ecstasy with oxford stoneborough minster had been a training in appreciation of its hoary beauty but the essentially prosaic richard had never prepared him for the impression that the reverend old university made on him and he was already heart and soul one of her most loyal and loving sons speaking of his college and of the whole university as one who had a right of property in them and looking all the time not elated but contented as if he had found his sphere and was satisfied he had seen cheviot too and had been very happy in the renewed friendship and had been claimed as a cousin by a balliol man a certain norman ogilvie a name well known among the mays and how has tom been getting on he asked when he returned to home affairs  oh i dont know said ethel he will not have my help  not let you help him exclaimed norman  no he says he wants no girls said ethel laughing  foolish fellow said norman i wonder what sort of work he has made  very funny i should think said ethel judging by the verses i could see  the little pale roughhaired tom in his perpetual coating of dust softly crept into the room as if he only wanted to elude observation but mary and blanche were at once vociferating their news in his ears though with little encouragementhe only shook them off abruptly and would not answer when they required him to be glad  norman stretched out his arm intercepting him as he was making for his hidingplace behind dr mays armchair  come august how have things gone on  oh i dont know  whats your place  thirteenth muttered tom in his throat and well he might for two or three voices cried out that was too bad and that it was all his own fault for not accepting ethels help he took little heed but crept to his corner without another word and mary knew she should be thumped if she should torment him there  norman left him alone but the coldness of the little brother for whom he had worked gave a greater chill to his pleasure than he could have supposed possible he would rather have had some cordiality on toms part than all the congratulations that met him the next day  he could not rest contented while tom continued to shrink from him and he was the more uneasy when on saturday morning no calls from mary availed to find the little boy and bring him to the usual reading and catechism  margaret decided that they must begin without him and poor marys verse was read in consequence with a most dolorous tone as soon as the books were shut she ran off and a few words passed among the elder ones about the truantflora opining that the andersons had led him away ethel suggesting that his gloom must arise from his not being well and margaret looking wistfully at norman and saying she feared they had judged much amiss last spring norman heard in silence and walked thoughtfully into the garden presently he caught marys voice in expostulation how could you not come to read  girls work growled another voice out of sight  but norman and richard and harry always come to the reading everybody ought  norman who was going round the shrubs that concealed the speakers from him here lost their voices but as he emerged in front of the old toolhouse he heard a little scream from mary and at the same moment she darted back and fell over a heap of cabbagestumps in front of the old toolhouse it was no small surprise to her to be raised by him and tenderly asked whether she were hurt she was not hurt but she could not speak without crying and when norman begged to hear what was the matter and where tom was she would only plead for himthat he did not intend to hurt her and that she had been teasing him what had he done to frighten her oh he had only run at her with a hoe because she was troublesome she did not mind it and norman must notand she clung to him as if to keep him back while he pursued his researches in the toolhouse where nearly concealed by a great bushelbasket lurked master thomas crouching down with a volume of gil bias in his hand  you here tom what have you hidden yourself here for what can make you so savage to mary  she should not bother me said tom sulkily  norman sent mary away pacifying her by promises that he would not revenge her quarrel upon tom and then turning the basket upside down and perching himself astride on it he began that is the kindest most forgiving little sister i ever did see what possesses you to treat her so ill  i wasnt going to hurt her  but why drive her away why dont you come to read no answer and norman for a moment felt as if tom were really hopelessly illconditioned and sullen but he persevered in restraining his desire to cuff the illhumour out of him and continued come theres something wrong and you will never be better till it is out tell medont be afraid those fellows have been at you again  he took tom by the arm to draw him nearer but a cry and start of pain were the result so they have licked you eh what have they been doing  they said they would spiflicate me if i told sighed tom  they shall never do anything to you and byandby a sobbing confession was drawn forth muttered at intervals as low as if tom expected the strings of onions to hear and betray him to his foes looking on him as a deserter these townboys had taken advantage of his brothers absence to heap on him every misery they could inflict there had been a wager between edward anderson and sam axworthy as to what tom could be made to do and his personal timidity made him a miserable victim not merely beaten and bruised but forced to transgress every rule of right and wrong that had been enforced on his conscience on sunday they had profited by the absence of their dux to have a jollification at a little publichouse not far from the playingfields and here had tom been dragged in forced to partake with them and frightened with threats that he had treated them all and was liable to pay the whole bill which of course he firmly believed as well as that he should be at least half murdered if he gave his father any suspicion that the whole had not been consumed by himself now though poor toms conscience had lost many scruples during the last spring the offence into which he had been forced was too heinous to a child brought up as he had been to be palliated even in his own eyes the profanation of sunday and the carousal in a publichouse had combined to fill him with a sense of shame and degradation which was the real cause that he felt himself unworthy to come and read with his sisters his grief and misery were extreme and normans indignation was such as could find no utterance he sat silent quivering with anger and clenching his fingers over the handle of the hoe  i knew it sighed tom none of you will ever speak to me again  you why august man i have better hopes of you than ever you are more really sorry now than ever you were before  i had never been at the green man before said poor tom feeling his future life stained  you never will again  when you are gone and the poor victims voice died away  tom you will not stay after me it is settled that when i go to balliol you leave stoneborough and go to mr wilmot as pupil those scamps shall never have you in their clutches again  it did not produce the ecstasy norman had expected the boy still sat on the ground staring at his brother as if the good news hardly penetrated the gloom and after a disappointing silence recurred to the most immediate cause of distress eight shillings and tenpence halfpenny norman if you would only lend it to me you shall have all my tin till i have made it upsixpence a week and halfacrown on new years day  i am not going to pay mr axworthys reckoning said norman rather angrily you will never be better till you have told my father the whole  do you think they will send in the bill to my father asked tom in alarm  no indeed that is the last thing they will do said norman but i would not have you come to him only for such a sneaking reason  but the girls would hear it oh if i thought mary and margaret would ever hear itnorman i cant  norman assured him that there was not the slightest reason that these passages should ever come to the knowledge of his sisters tom was excessively afraid of his father but he could not well be more wretched than he was already and he was brought to assent when norman showed him that he had never been happy since the affair of the blottingpaper when his fathers looks and tones had become objects of dread to his guilty conscience was not the only means of recovering a place in papas esteem to treat him with confidence  tom answered not and would only shudder when his brother took upon him to declare that free confession would gain pardon even for the doings at the green man  tom had grown stupefied and passive and his sole dependence was on norman so at last he made no opposition when his brother offered to conduct him to his father and speak for him the danger now was that dr may should not be forthcoming and the elder brother was as much relieved as the younger was dismayed to see through the drawingroom window that he was standing beside margaret  papa can you come and speak to me said norman at the door  coming what now said the doctor entering the hall what tom my boy what is it as he saw the poor child white cold almost sick with apprehension with every pulse throbbing and looking positively ill he took the chilly damp hand which shook nervously and would fain have withdrawn itself  come my dear let us see what is amiss and before tom knew what he was doing he had seated him on his knee in the armchair in the study and was feeling his pulse there rest your head has it not been aching all day  i do not think he is ill said norman but there is something he thinks i had better tell you  tom would fain have been on his feet yet the support of that shoulder was inexpressibly comfortable to his aching temples and he could not but wait for the shock of being roughly shaken and put down so as his brother related what had occurred he crouched and trembled more and more on his fathers breast till to his surprise he found the other arm passed round him in support drawing him more tenderly close  my poor little fellow said dr may trying to look into the drooping face i grieve to have exposed you to such usage as this i little thought it of stoneborough fellows  he is very sorry said norman much distressed by the condition of the culprit  i see iti see it plainly said dr may tommy my boy why should you tremble when you are with me  he has been in great dread of your being displeased  my boy do you not know how i forgive you tom clung round his neck as if to steady himself  oh papa i thought you would never  nay you need never have thought so my boy what have i done that you should fear me  tom did not speak but nestled up to him with more confidence there thats better poor child what he must have suffered he was not fit for the place i had thought him looking ill little did i guess the cause  he says his head has ached ever since sunday said norman and i believe he has hardly eaten or slept properly since  he shall never be under their power again thanks to you norman do you hear that tommy  the answer was hardly audible the little boy was already almost asleep worn out with all he had undergone norman began to clear the sofa that they might lay him down but his father would not hear of disturbing him and sending norman away sat still for more than an hour until the child slowly awoke and scarcely recalling what had happened stood up between his fathers knees rubbing his eyes and looking bewildered  you are better now my boy  i thought you would be very angry slowly murmured tom as the past returned on him  never while you are sorry for your faults and own them freely  im glad i did said the boy still half asleep i did not know you would be so kind  ah tom i fear it was as much my fault as yours that you did not know it but my dear there is a pardon that can give you better peace than mine  i think muttered tom looking downi think i could say my prayers again now if  if what my dear  if you would help me as mamma used  there could be but one response to this speech  tom was still giddy and unwell his whole frame affected by the troubles of the last week and dr may arranged him on the sofa and desired him to be quiet offering to send mary to be his companion tom was languidly pleased but renewed his entreaty that his confession might be a secret from his sisters dr may promised and mary quite satisfied at being taken into favour asked no questions but spent the rest of the morning in playing at draughts with him and in having inflicted on her the history of the bloody fire kings ghosta work of toms imagination which he was wont to extemporise to the extreme terror of much enduring mary  when dr may had called mary he next summoned norman who found him in the hall putting on his hat and looking very stern and determined  norman said he hastily dont say a wordit must be donehoxton must hear of this  normans face expressed utter consternation  it is not your doing it is no concern of yours said dr may walking impetuously into the garden i find my boy ill broken down shatteredit is the usage of this crew of fellowswhat right have i to conceal itleave other peoples sons to be so served  i believe they did so to tom out of illwill to me said norman and because they thought he had ratted  hush dont argue against it said dr may almost petulantly i have stood a great deal to oblige you but i cannot stand this when it is a matter of corruption base crueltyno norman it is not rightnot another word  normans words had not been many but he felt a conviction that in spite of the dismay and pain to himself dr may ought to meet with submission to his judgment and he acquiesced by silence  dont you see continued the doctor if they act thus when your back is turned what is to happen next half tis not for toms sake but how could we justify it to ourselves to expose other boys to this usage  yes said norman not without a sigh i suppose it must be  that is right said dr may as if much relieved i knew you must see it in that light i do not mean to abuse your confidence  no indeed answered norman warmly  but you see yourself that where the welfare of so many is at stake it would be wickednessyes wickednessto be silent could i see that little fellow prostrated trembling in my arms and think of those scamps inflicting the same on other helpless childrenaway from their homes  i see i see said norman carried along by the indignation and tenderness that agitated his fathers voice in his vehemenceit is the only thing to be done  it would be sharing the guilt to hide it said dr may  very well said norman still reluctantly what do you wish me to do you see as dux i know nothing about it it happened while i was away  true true said his father you have learned it as brother not as senior boy yes we had better have you out of the matter it is i who complain of their usage of my son  thank you said norman with gratitude  you have not told me the names of these fellows no i had best not know them  i think it might make a difference hesitated norman  no no i will not hear them it ought to make none the fact is the same be they who they may  the doctor let himself out at the garden gate and strode off at a rapid pace conscious perhaps in secret that if he did not at once yield to the impulse of resentment good nature would overpower the sense of justice his son returned to the house with a heavy sigh yet honouring the generosity that had respected his scruples when merely his own worldly loss was involved but set them aside when the good of others was concerned byandby dr may reappeared the headmaster had been thoroughly roused to anger and had begged at once to examine may junior for whom his father was now come  tom was quite unprepared for such formidable consequences of his confession and began by piteous tears and sobs and when these had with some difficulty been pacified he proved to be really so unwell and exhausted that his father could not take him to minster street and was obliged to leave him to his brothers keeping while he returned to the school  upon this dr hoxton came himself and the sisters were extremely excited and alarmed by the intelligence that he was in the study with papa and tom  then away went the gentlemen and mary was again called to comfort tom who broken down into the mere longing for sympathy sobbed out all his troubles to her while her eyes expanded more and more in horror and her soft heart giving way she cried quite as pitifully and a great deal more loudly and so the other sisters learned the whole and margaret was ready for her father when he came in in the evening harassed and sorrowful his anger was all gone now and he was excessively grieved at finding that the ringleaders samuel axworthy and edward anderson could in dr hoxtons opinion receive no sentence but expulsion which was to be pronounced on them on monday  sam axworthy was the son of a low uneducated man and his best chance had been the going to this school but he was of a surly obstinate temper and showed so little compunction that even such superabundant kindness as dr mays could not find compassion for him especially since it had appeared that tom had been by no means the only victim and that he had often been the promoter of the like malpractices which many boys were relieved to be forced to expose  for edward anderson however or rather for his mother dr may was very sorry and had even interceded for his pardon but dr hoxton though slow to be roused was far less placable than the other doctor and would not hear of anything but the most rigorous justice  poor mrs anderson with her pride in her children flora spoke it with a shade of contemptuous pity but it made her father groan  i shall never be able to look in her face again i shall never see that boy without feeling that i have ruined him  he needed nobody to do that for him said flora  with every disadvantage continued dr may unable even to remember his father why could i not be more patient and forbearing  oh papa was the general crynormans voice giving decision to the sisters exclamation  perhaps said margaret the shock may be the best thing for him  right margaret said her father sometimes such a thing is the first that shows what a course of evil really is  they are an affectionate family too said margaret and his mothers grief may have an effect on him  if she does not treat him as an injured hero said flora besides i see no reason for regret these are but two and the school is not to be sacrificed to them  yes said norman i believe that ashe will be able to keep much better order without axworthy it is much better as it is but harry will be very sorry to hear it and i wish this half was over  poor mrs anderson her shower of notes rent the heart of the one doctor but were tossed carelessly aside by the other on that sunday norman held various conversations with his probable successor ashe a gentle welldisposed boy hitherto in much dread of the post of authority but owning that in axworthys absence the task would be comparatively easy and that anderson would probably originate far less mischief  edward anderson himself fell in normans way in the street and was shrinking aside when a word of not unfriendly greeting caused him to quicken his steps and say hesitatingly i say how is august  better thank you he will be all right in a day or two  i say we would not have bullied him so if he had not been in such a fright at nothing  i dare say not  i did not mean it all but that sort of thing makes a fellow go on continued edward hanging down his head very sorrowful and downcast  if it had only been fair bullying but to take him to that placeto teach him falsehood said norman  edwards eyes were full of tears he almost owned the whole he had not thought of such things and then axworthyit was more evident from manner than words that the boy did repent and was greatly overcome both by his own disgrace and his mothers distress wishing earnestly to redeem his character and declaring from the bottom of his heart that he would avoid his former offences he was emboldened at last to say with hesitation could not you speak to dr hoxton for me  my father has said all he could in your behalf  edwards eye glanced towards norman in wonder as he recollected that the mays must know that a word from him would have saved norman from unjust punishment and the loss of the scholarship and he said goodnight and turned aside to his own home with a heavy sigh  norman took another turn looked up at the sky twisted his hands together in perplexity mumbled something about hating to do a thing when it was all for no use and then marched off towards minster street with a pace like his fathers the day before  when he came forth again from dr hoxtons study he did not believe that his intercession had produced the least effect and there was a sense of vexation at the position which he had assumed he went home and said nothing on the subject but when on monday the school was assembled and the judgment announced it was axworthy alone whose friends had been advised to remove him  anderson received a severe punishment as did all those who had shared in the revel at the green man even tom and another little boy who had been likewise drawn in were obliged to stay within narrow bounds and to learn heavy impositions and a stern reprimand and exhortation were given to the school collectively anderson who had seen from the window that turn towards minster street drew his own conclusions and was not insensible to the generosity that had surpassed his hopes though to his faltering attempt at thanks norman replied that he did not believe it was owing to him and never exposed himself to floras wonder by declaring at home what he had done  so the last weeks of the halfyear passed away with the boys in a subdued but hopeful manner and the reformation under normans auspices progressed so well that ashe might fairly expect to reap the benefit of the discipline established at so much cost  mr wilmot had looked on and given his help but he was preparing to leave stoneborough and there was great concern at the parting with such a friend ethel especially mourned the loss to cocksmoor and for though hers had been the executive part his had been the head and he was almost equally grieved to go from the newlybegun work  margaret lamented the loss of her kind counsellor and the ready hearer of her anxieties for the children writing could ill supply the place of their conversations and she feared likewise that her father would feel the want of his companionship the promise of visits and the intercourse kept up by toms passing to and fro was the best consolation  poor margaret had begun to flag both in strength and spirits as winter approached but there came a revival in the shape of ship letters alan wrote cheerfully and graphically with excellent accounts of harry who on his side sent very joyous and characteristic despatches only wishing that he could present mary with all the monkeys and parrots he had seen at rio as well as the little rubycrested hummingbirds that always reminded him of miss rivers  with the christmas holidays hector ernescliffe came from eton as to a home and was received by margaret as a sort of especial charge it was pretty to see how he turned to her as something peculiarly his own and would sit on a footstool by her letting himself be drawn into confidence and dwelling on his brothers past doings and on future schemes for maplewood for the rest he restored to the house the atmosphere of boy which had somewhat departed with harry mary who had begun to be tamed down ran more wild than ever to the utter despair of miss winter and tom now that his connection with the whichcote foundation was over and he was no more cowed by the sight of his tyrants came out in a new light he put on his boynature rioted like the rest acquired colour in his cheeks divested his jacket of perpetual dust had his hair cut brushed up a crest on his head and ran about no longer a little abject but a merry lad  ethel said it was a change from horridlocks to harfagre margaret said little but like her father she blessed norman in her heart for having given back the boy to his fathers confidence and saved him so far from the terrible course of deceit and corruption she could not much take to heart the mad exploits of the socalled boys even though she spent three hours in heartbeatings on christmas eve when hector mary tom blanche and the dog toby were lost the whole day however they did come back at six oclock having been deluded by an old myth of george larkins into starting for a common three miles beyond cocksmoor in search of mistletoe with scarlet berries and yellow holly with leaves like a porcupine failing these wonders they had been contenting themselves with scarlet holly in the drydale plantations when a rough voice exclaimed who gave you leave to take that whereupon tom had plunged into a thicket and nearly scratched out both his eyes but hector boldly standing his ground with blanche in his hand the woodman discovered that here was the miss mary of whom his little girls talked so much thereupon cut down the choicest boughs and promised to leave a full supply at dr mays margaret could have been angry at the taking the young ladies on so mad a scheme but then mary was so happy and as to hector how scold him when he had lifted blanche over every ditch and had carried her home one mile on his back and another queenscushion fashion between him and mary  flora meanwhile went her own way the desire of compensating for what had passed with norman led to great civilities from dr and mrs hoxton which nobody was at liberty to receive except flora pretty graceful and pleasing she was a valuable companion to a gentle little inane lady with more time and money than she knew what to do with and mrs hoxton who was of a superior grade to the stoneborough ladies in general was such a chaperon as flora was glad to secure dr mays old loyal feelings could not help regarding her notice of his daughter as a favour and kindness and margaret could find no tangible objections nor any precedent from her mothers conduct even had any one had the power to interfere with one so quiet reasonable and determined as flora  so the intimacy became closer and closer and as the winter passed on flora gradually became established as the dear friend and assistant without whom mrs hoxton could give no party further flora took the grand step of setting up a copperplate and cards of miss flora may went out frequently on morning calls with mrs hoxton and her bay horses and when dr may refused his share of invitations to dinner with the neighbours in the county flora generally found that she could go under the hoxtons guardianship      part ii     chapter i         now have i then eke this condicion      that above all the flouris in the mede      then love i most these flouris white and rede      soche that men callin daisies in our town      to them have i so great affection      as i said erst when comin is the maie      that in my bed there dawith me no daie      that i am up and walking in the mede      to see this floure agenst the sunne spredechaucer   that is better said margaret contemplating a butterfly of the penwiper class whose constitution her dexterous needle had been rendering less rickety than blanche had left it  margaret still lay on the sofa and her complexion had assumed the dead white of habitual illhealth there was more languor of manner and her countenance when at rest and not under the eye of her father had a sadness of expression as if any hopes that she might once have entertained were fading away the years of alan ernescliffes absence that had elapsed had rather taken from her powers than added to them nevertheless the habit of cheerfulness and sympathy had not deserted her and it was with a somewhat amused glance that she turned towards ethel as she heard her answer by a sigh  these years had dealt more kindly with etheldreds outward appearance they had rounded her angles softened her features and tinged her cheeks with a touch of red that took off from the surrounding sallowness she held herself better had learned to keep her hair in order and the more womanly dress plain though it was improved her figure more than could have been hoped in the days of her lank gawky girlhood no one could call her pretty but her countenance had something more than ever pleasing in the animated and thoughtful expression on those marked features she was sitting near the window with a book a dictionary and pencil as she replied to margaret with the sigh that made her sister smile  poor ethel i condole with you  and i wonder at you said ethel especially as flora and mrs hoxton say it is all for your sake then nettled by margarets laugh such a nice occupation for her poor thing as if you were mrs hoxton and had no resource but fancywork  you know i am base enough to be so amused said margaret but seriously ethel dear i cannot bear to see you so much hurt by it i did not know you were really grieved  grieved i am ashamedsickened cried ethel vehemently poor cocksmoor as soon as anything is done there flora must needs go about implying that we have set some grand work in hand and want only means  stop ethel flora does not boast  no she does not boast i wish she did that would be straightforward and simple but she has too good taste for thatso she does worseshe tells a little and makes that go a long way as if she were keeping back a great deal you dont know how furious it makes me  ethel  so said ethel disregarding she stirs up all stoneborough to hear what the miss mays are doing at cocksmoor so the ladies committee must needs have their finger in much they cared for the place when it was wild and neglected but they go to inspect cherry and her schoolmrs ledwich and alland back they come shockedno system no order the mistress untrained the school too small with no apparatus they all run about in despair as if we had ever asked them to help us and so mrs hoxton who cares for poor children no more than for puppydogs but who cant live without useless work and has filled her house as full of it as it can hold devises a bazaara field for her trumpery and a showoff for all the young ladies and flora treats it like an inspiration off they trot to the old assembly rooms i trusted that the smallness of them would have knocked it on the head but still worse floras talking of it makes mr rivers think it our pet scheme so what does he do but offer his park and so we are to have a regular fancy fair and cocksmoor school will be founded in vanity and frivolity but i believe you like it  i am not sure of my own feeling said margaret it has been settled without our interposition and i have never been able to talk it over calmly with you papa does not seem to disapprove  no said ethel he will only laugh and say it will spare him a great many of mrs hoxtons nervous attacks he thinks of it nearly as i do at the bottom but i cannot get him to stop it nor even to say he does not wish flora to sell  i did not understand that you really had such strong objections said margaret i thought it was only as a piece of folly and  and interference with my cocksmoor said ethel i had better own to what may be wrong personal feeling at first  i can hardly call it wrong said margaret tenderly considering what cocksmoor is to you and what the ladies committee is  oh margaret if the lawful authorityif a good clergyman would only come how willingly would i work under him but mrs ledwich andit is like having all the spaniards and savages spoiling robinson crusoes desert island  it is not come to that yet said margaret but about the fancy fair we all know that the school is very much wanted  yes but i hoped to wait in patience and perseverance and do it at last  all yourself  now margaret you know i was glad of alans help  i should think so said margaret you need not make a favour of that  yes but dont you see that came as almsgiving in the way which brings a blessing we want nothing to make us give money and work to cocksmoor we do all we can already and i dont want to get a fine bag or a ridiculous pincushion in exchange  not you but  well for the rest if they like to offer their money well and good the better for them but why must they not give it to cocksmoorbut for that unnatural butterfly of blanches with black pins for horns that they will go and sell at an extortionate rate  the price will be given for cocksmoors sake  pooh margaret do you think it is for cocksmoors sake that lady leonora langdale and her fine daughter come down from london would mrs hoxton spend the time in making frocks for cocksmoor children that she does in cutting out paper and stuffing glass bottles with it let people be honestalms or pleasure or vanity let them say which they mean but dont make charity the excuse for the others and above all dont make my poor cocksmoor the victim of it  this is very severe said margaret pausing almost confounded do you think no charity worth having but what is given on unmixed motives who then could give  margaretwe see much evil arise in the bestplanned institutions nay in what are not human dont you think we ought to do our utmost to have no flaw in the foundation schools are not such perfect places that we can build them without fear and if the means are to be raised by a bargain for amusementif they are to come from frivolity instead of selfdenial i am afraid of them i do not mean that cocksmoor has not been the joy of my life and of marys but that was not because we did it for pleasure  no said margaret sighing you found pleasure by the way but why did you not say all this to flora  it is of no use to talk to flora said ethel she would say it was highflown and visionary oh she wants it for the bazaars own sake and that is one reason why i hate it  now ethel  i do believe it was very unfortunate for flora that the hoxtons took to patronising her because norman would not be patronised ever since it began her mind has been full of visitings and parties and county families and she has left off the home usefulness she used to care about  but you are old enough for that said margaret it would be hard to keep flora at home now that you can take her place and do not care for going out one of us must be the representative miss may you know and keep up the civilities and you may think yourself lucky it is not you  if it was only that i should not care but i may as well tell you margaret for it is a weight to me it is not the mere pleasure in gaietiesflora cares for them in themselves as little as i donor is it neighbourliness as a duty to others for you may observe she always gets off any engagement to the wards or any of the town folk to whom it would be a gratification to have hershe either eludes them or sends me the thing is that she is always trying to be with the great people the county set and i dont think that is the safe way of going on  margaret mused sadly you frighten me ethel i cannot say it is not so and these are so like the latent faults that dear mammas letter spoke of  ethel sat meditating and at last said i wish i had not told you i dont always believe it myself and it is so unkind and you will make yourself unhappy too i ought not to have thought it of her think of her everready kindness and helpfulness her pretty courteous ways to the very least her obligingness and tact  yes said margaret she is one of the kindest people there is and i am sure that she thought the gaining funds for cocksmoor was the best thing to be done that you would be pleased and a great deal of pleasant occupation provided for us all  that is the bright side the surface side said ethel  and not an untrue one said margaret meta will not be vain and will work the more happily for cocksmoors sake mary and blanche poor mrs boulder and many good ladies who hitherto have not known how to help cocksmoor will do so now with a good will and though it is not what we should have chosen i think we had better take it in good part  you think so  yes indeed i do if you go about with that dismal face and strong disapproval it will really seem as if it was the having your dominion muddled with that you dislike besides it is putting yourself forward to censure what is not absolutely wrong in itself and that cannot be desirable  no said ethel but i cannot help being sorry for cocksmoor i thought patience would prepare the way and the means be granted in good time without hastinessonly earnestness  you had made a picture for yourself said margaret gently yes we all make pictures for ourselves and we are the foremost figures in them but they are taken out of our hands and we see others putting in rude touches and spoiling our work as it seems but byandby we shall see that it is all guided  ethel sighed then having protested to my utmost against this concern you think i ought to be amiable about it  and to let poor mary enjoy it she would be so happy if you would not bewilder her by your gloomy looks and keep her to the hemming of your endless glazed calico bonnet strings  poor old mary i thought that was by her own desire  only her dutiful allegiance to you and as making pincushions is nearly her greatest delight it is cruel to make her think it in some mysterious way wrong and displeasing to you  ethel laughed and said i did not think mary was in such awe of me ill set her free then but margaret do you really think i ought to give up my time to it  could you not just let them have a few drawings or a little bit of your company workjust enough for you not to annoy every one and seem to be testifying against them you would not like to vex meta  it will go hard if i do not tell meta my mind i cannot bear to see her deluded  i dont think she is said margaret but she does not set her face against what others wish as papa says of his dear little hummingbird she takes the honey and leaves the poison  yes amid all that enjoyment she is always choosing the good and leaving the evil always sacrificing something and then being happy in the sacrifice  no one would guess it was a sacrifice it is so joyously doneleast of all meta herself  her coming home from london was exactly a specimen of that sacrificeand no sacrifice said ethel  what was that said norman who had come up to the window unobserved and had been listening to their few last sentences  did not you hear of it it was a sort of material turning away from vanity that made me respect the little rival daisy as much as i always admired her  tell me said norman when was it  last spring you know mr rivers is always ill in london indeed papa says it would be the death of him but lady leonora langdale thinks it dreadful that meta should not go to all the gaieties and last year when mrs larpent was gone she insisted on her coming to stay with her for the season now meta thought it wrong to leave her father alone and wanted not to have gone at all but to my surprise margaret advised her to yield and go for some short fixed time  yes said margaret as all her elders thought it right i did not think we could advise her to refuse absolutely besides it was a promise  she declared she would only stay three weeks and the langdales were satisfied thinking that once in london they should keep her they little knew meta with her pretty ways of pretending that her resolution is only spoiledchild wilfulness none of you quite trusted her did you margaret even papa was almost afraid though he wanted her very much to be at home for poor mr rivers was so low and forlorn without her though he would not let her know because lady leonora had persuaded him to think it was all for her good  what did they do with her in london asked norman  they did their utmost said ethel they made engagements for her and took her to parties and concertsthose she did enjoy very much and she had lessons in drawing and music but whenever she wanted to see any exhibitions or do anything they always said there was time to spare i believe it was very charming and she would have been very glad to stay but she never would promise and she was always thinking of her positive duty at home she seemed afterwards to think of her wishes to remain almost as if they had been a sin but she saiddear little metathat nothing had ever helped her so much as that she used to say to herself whenever she was going out i renounce the world it came to a crisis at last when lady leonora wanted her to be presentedthe drawingroom was after the end of her three weeksand she held out against it though her aunt laughed at her and treated her as if she was a silly shy child at last what do you think meta did she went to her uncle lord cosham and appealed to him to say whether there was the least necessity for her to go to court  then she gained the day said norman  he was delighted with that spirited yet coaxing way of hers and admired her determination he told papa so himselffor you must know when he heard all meta had to say he called her a very good girl and said he would take her home himself on the saturday she had fixed and spend sunday at abbotstoke oh he was perfectly won by her sweet ways was not it lucky for before this lady leonora had written to mr rivers and obtained from him a letter which meta had the next day desiring her to stay for the drawingroom but meta knew well enough how it was and was not to be conquered that way so she said she must go home to entertain her uncle and that if her papa really wished it she would return on monday  knowing well that mr rivers would be only too glad to keep her  just so how happy they both did look when they came in here on their way from the station where he had met her how she danced in and how she sparkled with glee said margaret and poor mr rivers was quite tremulous with the joy of having her back hardly able to keep from fondling her every minute and coming again into the room after they had taken leave to tell me that his little girl had preferred her home and her poor old father to all the pleasures in london oh i was so glad they came that was a sight that did one good and then i fancy mr rivers is a wee bit afraid of his brotherinlaw for he begged papa and flora to come home and dine with them but flora was engaged to mrs hoxton  ha flora said norman as if he rather enjoyed her losing something through her going to mrs hoxton i suppose she would have given the world to go  i was so sorry said ethel but i had to go instead and it was delightful papa made great friends with lord cosham while mr rivers went to sleep after dinner and i had such a delightful wandering with meta listening to the nightingales and hearing all about it i never knew meta so well before  and there was no more question of her going back said norman  no indeed she said when her uncle asked in joke on monday morning whether she had packed up to return with him mr rivers was quite nervously alarmed the first moment lest she should intend it  that little meta said margaret her wishes for substantial use have been pretty well realised  um said ethel  what do you mean said norman sharply i should call her present position the perfection of feminine usefulness  so perhaps it is said ethel but though she does it beautifully and is very valuable to be the mistress of a great luxurious house like that does not seem to me the subject of aspirations like metas  think of the contrast with what she used to be said margaret gently the pretty gentle playful toy that her father brought her up to be living a life of mere accomplishments and selfindulgence kind certainly but never so as to endure any disagreeables or make any exertion but as soon as she entered into the true spirit of our calling did she not begin to seek to live the sterner life and train herself in duty the quiet way she took always seemed to me the great beauty of it she makes duties of her accomplishments by making them loving obedience to her father  not that they are not pleasant to her interposed norman  certainly said margaret but it gives them the zest and confidence that they are right which one could not have in such things merely for ones own amusement  yes said ethel she does more she told me one day that one reason she liked sketching was that looking into nature always made psalms and hymns sing in her ears and so with her music and her beautiful copies from the old italian devotional pictures she says our papa taught her to look at them so as to see more than the mere art and beauty  think how diligently she measures out her day said margaret getting up early to be sure of time for reading her serious books and working hard at her tough studies  and what i care for still more said ethel her being bent on learning plain needlework and doing it for her poor people she is so useful amongst the cottagers at abbotstoke  and a famous little mistress of the house added margaret when the old housekeeper went away two years ago she thought she ought to know something about the government of the house so she asked me about it and proposed to her father that the new one should come to her for orders and that she should pay the wages and have the accounts in her hands mr rivers thought it was only a freak but she has gone on steadily and i assure you she has had some difficulties for she has come to me about them perhaps ethel does not believe in them  no i was only thinking how i should hate ordering those fanciful dinners for mr rivers i know what you mean and how she had difficulties about sending the maids to church and in dealing with the cook who did harm to the other servants and yet sent up dinners that he liked and how puzzled she was to avoid annoying him oh she has got into a peck of troubles by making herself manager  and had she not been the meta she is she would either have fretted or thrown it all up instead of humming briskly through all she never was afraid to speak to any one said margaret that is one thing i believe every difficulty makes the spirit bound higher till she springs over it and finds it as she says only a pleasure  she need not be afraid to speak said ethel for she always does it well and winningly i have seen her give a reproof in so firm and kind a way and so bright in the instant of forgiveness  yes said margaret she does those disagreeable things as well as flora does in her way  and yet said ethel doing things well does not seem to be a snare to her  because whispered margaret she fulfils more than almost any onethewhatsoever ye do do all to the glory of god  do you know said norman suddenly the derivation of margarita  no further than those two pretty meanings the pearl and the daisy said ethel  it is from the persian mervarid child of light said norman and with a sudden flush of colour he returned to the garden  a fit meaning for one who carries sunshine with her said margaret i feel in better tune for a whole day after her bright eyes have been smiling on me  you want no one to put you in tune said ethel fondlyyou our own pearl of light  no call me only an old faded daisy said margaret sadly  not a bit only our moon la gran margarita said ethel  i hear the real daisy coming exclaimed margaret her face lighting up with pleasure as the two youngest children entered and indeed little gertrudes golden hair round open face fresh red and white complexion and innocent looks had so much likeness to the flower as to promote the use of the pet name though protests were often made in favour of her proper appellation her temper was daisylike too serene and loving and able to bear a great deal of spoiling and resolve as they might who was not her slave  miss winter no longer ruled the schoolroom her sway had been brought to a happy conclusion by a proposal from a widowed sister to keep house with her and ethel had reason to rejoice that margaret had kept her submissive under authority which if not always judicious was both kind and conscientious  upon the change ethel had thought that the lessons could easily be managed by herself and flora while flora was very anxious for a finishing governess who might impart singing to herself graces to ethel and accomplishments to mary and blanche  dr may however took them both by surprise he met with a family of orphans the eldest of whom had been qualifying herself for a governess and needed nothing but age and finish and in ten minutes after the project had been conceived he had begun to put it in execution in spite of floras prudent demurs  miss bracy was a gentle pleasing young person pretty to look at with her soft olive complexion and languid pensive eyes obliging and intelligent and the change from the dry authoritative miss winter was so delightful that unedifying contrasts were continually being drawn blanche struck up a great friendship for her at once mary always docile ceased to be piteous at her lessons and ethel moralised on the satisfaction of having sympathy needed instead of repelled and did her utmost to make miss bracy feel at homeand like a friendin her new position  for herself ethel had drawn up a beautiful timetable with all her pursuits and duties most carefully balanced after the pattern of that which margaret rivers had made by her advice on the departure of mrs larpent who had been called away by the illhealth of her son meta had adhered to hers in an exemplary manner but she was her own mistress in a manner that could hardly be the lot of one of a large family  margaret had become subject to languor and palpitations and the head of the household had fallen entirely upon flora who on the other hand was a person of multifarious occupations and always had a great number of letters to write or songs to copy and practise which together with her frequent visits to mrs hoxton made her glad to devolve as much as she could upon her younger sister and oh ethel you will not mind just doing this for me was said often enough to be a tax upon her time  moreover ethel perceived that aubreys lessons were in an unsatisfactory state margaret could not always attend to them and suffered from them when she did and he was bandied about between his sisters and miss bracy in a manner that made him neither attentive nor obedient  on her own principle that to embrace a task heartily renders it no longer irksome she called on herself to sacrifice her studies and her regularity as far as was needful to make her available for home requirements she made herself responsible for aubrey and after a few battles with his desultory habits made him a very promising pupil inspiring so much of herself into him that he was if anything overfull of her classical tastes in fact he had such an appetite for books and dealt so much in precocious wisdom that his father was heard to say six years old it is a comfort that he will soon forget the whole  gertrude was also ethels pupil but learning was not at all in her line and the sight of cobwebs to catch flies or of the venerated little charles were the most serious clouds that made the daisy pucker up her face and infuse a whine into her voice  however today as usual she was half dragged half coaxed through her days portion of the discipline of life and then sent up for her sleep while aubreys two hours were spent in more agreeable work such as margaret could not but enjoy hearingso spirited was ethels mode of teachingso eager was her scholar  his play afterwards consisted in fighting oer again the siege of troy on the floor with wooden bricks shells and the survivors of a noahs ark while ethel read to margaret until gertrudes descent from the nursery when the only means of preventing a dire confusion in aubreys camp was for her elder sisters to become her playfellows and so spare aubreys temper ethel goodhumouredly gave her own time till their little tyrant trotted out to make norman carry her round the garden on his back  so sped the morning till flora came home full of the intended bazaar and ethel would fain have taken refuge in puzzling out her spanish had she not remembered her recent promise to be gracious  the matter had been much as she had described it flora had a way of hinting at anything she thought creditable and thus the stoneborough public had become aware of the exertions of the may family on behalf of cocksmoor  the plan of a fancy fair was started mrs hoxton became more interested than was her wont and flora was enchanted at the opening it gave for promoting the welfare of the forlorn district she held a position which made her hope to direct the whole as she had once declared with truth it only had depended on themselves whether she and her sisters should sink to the level of the andersons and their set or belong to the county society and her tact had resulted in her being decidedlyas the little dressmakers apprentice amused ethel by sayingone of our most distinguished patronessesa name that had stuck by her ever since  margaret looked on passively inclined to admire flora in everything yet now and then puzzled and her father in his simplehearted way felt only gratitude and exultation in the kindness that his daughter met with as to the bazaar if it had been started in his own family he might have weighed the objections but as it was not his daughters own concern he did not trouble himself about it only regarding it as one of the many vagaries of the ladies of stoneborough  so the scheme had been further developed till now flora came in with much to tell the number of stalls had been finally fixed mrs hoxton undertook one with flora as an aidedecamp and some nieces to assist lady leonora was to chaperon miss rivers and a third to floras regret had been allotted to miss cleveland a goodnatured merry elderly heiress who would flora feared bring on them the whole stoneborough crew and then she began to reckon up the present resourcesdrawings bags and pincushions that chip hat you plaited for daisy margaret you must let us have that it will be lovely trimmed with pink  do you wish for this said ethel heaving up a mass of knitting  thank you said flora so ornamental especially the original performance in the corner which you would perpetrate in spite of my best efforts  i shall not be offended if you despise it i only thought you might have no more scruple in robbing granny hall than in robbing daisy  pray send it papa will buy it as your unique performance  no you shall tell me what i am to do  does she mean it said flora turning to margaret have you converted her well done then ethel we will get some pretty batiste and you and mary shall make some of those nice sunbonnets which you really do to perfection  thank you that is a more respectable task than i expected people may have something worth buying said ethel who like all the world felt the influence of floras tact  i mean to study the useful said flora the cleveland set will be sure to deal in frippery and i have been looking over mrs hoxtons stores where i see quite enough for mere decoration there are two splendid vases in potichomanie in an etruscan pattern which are coming for me to finish  mrs taylor at cocksmoor could do that for you said ethel her two phials stuffed with chintz patterns and flour are quite as original and tasteful  silly work said flora but it makes a fair show  the essence of vanity fair said ethel  it wont do to be satirical over much said flora you wont get on without humouring your neighbours follies  i dont want to get on  but you wantor at least i wantcocksmoor to get on  ethel saw margaret looking distressed and recalling her resolution she said well flora i dont mean to say any more about it i see it cant be helped and you all think you intend it for good so theres an end of the matter and ill do anything for you in reason  poor old king ethel said flora smiling in an eldersisterly manner you will see my dear your views are very pretty but very impracticable and it is a workaday world after alleven papa would tell you so when cocksmoor school is built then you may thank me i do not look for it before     chapter ii         knowledge is second not the first      a higher hand must make her mild      if all be not in vain and guide      her footsteps moving side by side      with wisdom like the younger child      for she is earthly of the mind      but knowledge heavenly of the soulin memoriam   etheldred had not answered her sister but she did not feel at all secure that she should have anything to be thankful for even if the school were built  the invasion of cocksmoor was not only interference with her own field of action but it was dangerous to the improvement of her scholars since the departure of mr wilmot matters at stoneborough national school had not improved though the misses anderson talked a great deal about progress science and lectures  the ladies committee were constantly at war with the mistresses and that one was a veteran who endured them or whom they could endure beyond her first halfyear no mistress had stayed a year within the memory of any girl now at school perpetual change prevented any real education and as each lady held different opinions and proscribed all books not agreeing thereto everything dogmatical was excluded and as ethel said the children learned nothing but facts about lions and steamengines while their doctrine varied with that of the visitor for the week if the ten generals could only have given up to miltiades but alas there was no miltiades mr ramsdens health was failing and his neglect told upon the parish in the dreadful evils reigning unchecked and engulfing many a child whom more influential teaching might have saved mental arithmetic and the rivers of africa had little power to strengthen the soul against temptation  the scanty attendance at the national school attested the indifference with which it was regarded and the borderers voluntarily patronised cherry elwood and thus had perhaps first aroused the emulation that led mrs ledwich on a visit of inspection to what she chose to consider as an offshoot of the national school  the next day she called upon the misses may it was well that ethel was not at home margaret received the ladys horrors at the sight of the mere crowded cottage kitchen the stupid untrained mistress without an idea of method and that impertinent woman her mother miss flora and miss ethel must have had a great deal to undergo and she would lose no time in convening the ladies committee and appointing a successor to that elwood as soon as a fit room could be erected for her use if margaret had not known that mrs ledwich sometimes threatened more than she could accomplish she would have been in despair she tried to say a good word for cherry but was talked down and had reason to believe that mrs elwood had mortally offended mrs ledwich  the sisters had heard the other side of the story at cocksmoor mrs elwood would not let them enter the school till she had heard how that there mrs ledwich had come in and treated them all as if it was her own placehow she had found fault with cherry before all the children and as good as said she was not fit to keep a school she had even laid hands on one of the books and said that she should take it home and see whether it were a fit one for them to use whereupon mrs elwood had burst out in defenceit was miss ethel mays book and should not be taken awayit was miss ethel as she looked to and when it seemed that mrs ledwich had said something disparaging of miss ethel either as to youth judgment or doctrine mrs elwood had fired up into a declaration that miss ethel was a real ladythat she was and that no real lady would ever come prying into other folks work and finding fault with what wasnt no business of theirs with more of a personal nature which flora could not help enjoying even while she regretted it  cherry was only too meek as her mother declared she had said not a word except in quiet reply and being equally terrified by the attack and defence had probably seemed more dull than was her wont her real feelings did not appear till the next sunday when in her peaceful conference with margaret far from the sound of storms she expressed that she well knew that she was a poor scholar and that she hoped the young ladies would not let her stand in the childrens light when a better teacher could be found for them  i am sure cried ethel as she heard of this it would be hard to find such a teacher in humility cherry bears it so much better than i that it is a continual reproof  as to the dullness against which ethel used to rail the attacks upon it had made her erect it into a positive merit she was always comparing the truth honesty and respectful demeanour of cherrys scholars with the notorious faults of the national school girls as if these defects had been implanted either by mrs ledwich or by geography it must be confessed that the violence of partisanship did not make her a pleasant companion  however the interest of the bazaar began somewhat to divert the current of the ladies thoughts and ethel found herself walking day after day to cocksmoor unmolested by further reports of mrs ledwichs proceedings richard was absent preparing for ordination but norman had just returned home for the long vacation and rather than lose the chance of a conversation with her had joined her and mary in a walk to cocksmoor  his talk was chiefly of settlesham old mr wilmots parish where he had been making a visit to his former tutor and talking over the removal to eton of tom who had well responded to the care taken of him and with his good principles confirmed and his character strengthened might be with less danger exposed to trial  it had been a visit such as to leave a deep impression on normans mind sixty years ago old mr wilmot had been what he now was himselfan enthusiastic and distinguished balliol man and he had kept up a warm clearsighted interest in oxford throughout his long life his anecdotes his recollections and comments on present opinions had been listened to with great eagerness and norman had felt it an infinite honour to give the venerable old man his arm as to be shown by him his curious collection of books his parish carefully watched for so many years had been a study not lost upon norman who detailed particulars of the doings there which made ethel sigh to think of the contrast with stoneborough in such conversation they came to the entrance of the hamlet and mary with a scream of joy declared that she really believed that he was going to help them he did not turn away  thank you said ethel in a low voice from the bottom of her heart  she used him mercifully and made the lessons shorter than usual but when they reached the open air again he drew a long breath and when mary eagerly tried for a compliment to their scholars asked if they could not be taught the use of eyelids  did they stare said ethel thats one advantage of being blind no one can stare me out of countenance  why were you answering all your questions yourself asked mary  because no one else would said norman  you used such hard words replied ethel  indeed i thought i was very simple  oh cried mary there were derive and instruction and implicate andoh so many  never mind said ethel seeing him disconcerted it is better for them to be drawn up and you will soon learn their language if we only had una mcarthy here  then you dont like it said mary disappointed  it is time to learn not to be fastidious he answered so if you will help me  norman i am so glad said ethel  yes said norman i see now that these things that puff us up and seem the whole world to us now all end in nothing but such as this think of old mr wilmot once carrying all before him but deeming all his powers well bestowed in fifty years teaching of clowns  yes replied ethel very low one soul is worth and she paused from the fullness of thought  and these things about which we are so elated do not render us so fit to teachas you mary or as richard  they do said ethel the ten talents were doubled strength tells in power the more learning the fitter to teach the simplest thing  you remind me of old mr wilmot saying that the first thing he learned at his parish was how little his people knew the second how little he himself knew  so norman persevered in the homely discipline that he had chosen for himself which brought out his deficiency in practical work in a manner which lowered him in his own eyes to a degree almost satisfactory to himself he was not indeed without humility but his nature was selfcontemplative and selfconscious enough to perceive his superiority of talent and it had been the struggle of his life to abase this perception so that it was actually a relief not to be obliged to fight with his own complacency in his powers he had learned not to think too highly of himselfhe had yet to learn to think soberly his aid was ethels chief pleasure through this somewhat trying summer it might be her last peaceful one at cocksmoor  that bazaar how wild it had driven the whole town and even her own home  margaret herself between good nature and feminine love of pretty things had become ardent in the cause in her unvaried life it was a great amusement to have so many bright elegant things exhibited to her and ethel was often mortified to find her excited about some new device or drawn off from rational employments to complete some trifle  mary and blanche were far worse from the time that consent had been given to the fancywork being carried on in the schoolroom all interest in study was over thenceforth lessons were a necessary form gone through without heart or diligence these were reserved for pasteboard boxes beplastered with rice and sealingwax for alum baskets dressed dolls and every conceivable trumpery and the governess was as eager as the scholars  if ethel remonstrated she hurt miss bracys feelings and this was a very serious matter to both parties  the governess was one of those morbidly sensitive people who cannot be stopped when once they have begun arguing that they are injured two women together each with the lastword instinct have no power to cease and when the words are spent in explainingnot in scoldingconscience is not called in to silence them and nothing but dinner or a thunderstorm can check them all ethels good sense was of no avail she could not stop miss bracy and though she might resolve within herself that real kindness would be to make one reasonable reply and then quit the subject yet on each individual occasion such a measure would have seemed mere impatience and cruelty she found that if miss winter had been too dry miss bracy went to the other extreme and demanded a manifestation of sympathy and return to her passionate attachment that perplexed ethels undemonstrative nature poor good miss bracy she little imagined how often she added to the worries of her dear miss ethel all for want of selfcommand  finally as the lessons were less and less attended to and the needs of the stall became more urgent dr may and margaret concurred in a decision that it was better to yield to the mania and give up the studies till they could be pursued with a willing mind  ethel submitted and only laughed with norman at the display of treasures which the girls went over daily like the house that jack built always starting from the box that mary made come when dr may would into the drawingroom there was always a line of penwipers laid out on the floor bags pendent to all the tabledrawers antimacassars laid out everywhere  ethel hoped that the holidays would create a diversion but mary was too old to be made into a boy and blanche drew hector over to the feminine party setting him to gum gild and paste all the contrivances which in their hands were mere feeble gimcracks but which now became fairly sound or at least saleable  the boys also constructed a beautiful little ship from a print of the alcestis so successfully that the doctor promised to buy it and ethel grudged the very sight of it to the bazaar  tom who in person was growing like a little shadow or model of norman had unlike him a very dexterous pair of hands and made himself extremely useful in all such works on the other hand the cleveland stall seemed chiefly to rely for brilliance on the wit of harvey anderson who was prospering at his college and the pride of his family a great talker and extremely gallant he was considered a far greater acquisition to a stoneborough drawingroom than was the silent bashful norman may and rather looked down on his brother edward who having gone steadily through the school was in the attorneys office and went on quietly and well colouring up gratefully whenever one of the may family said a kind word to him     chapter iii           any silk any thread        any toys for your head      of the newest and finest weara        come to the pedlar        moneys a medlar      that doth utter all mens warea                                 winters tale   this one day and it will be over and we shall be rational again thought ethel as she awoke  flora was sleeping at the grange to be ready for action in the morning and ethel was to go early with mary and blanche who were frantic to have a share in the selling norman and the boys were to walk at their own time and the children to be brought later by miss bracy the doctor would be bound by no rules  it was a pattern day bright clear warm and not oppressive perfect for an outofdoors fete and ethel had made up her mind to fulfil her promise to margaret of enjoying herself in the brilliant sunshine and between two such happy sisters it would have been surly indeed not to enter into the spirit of the day and ethel laughed gaily with them and at their schemes and hopes blanches heart being especially set on knowing the fate of a watchguard of her own construction  hearing that the ladies were in the gardens they repaired thither at once the broad smooth bowlinggreen lay before them a marquee almost converted into a bower bounding it on either side while in the midst arose gorgeous and delicious a pyramid of flowerscontributions from all the hothouses in the neighbourhoodto be sold for the benefit of the bazaar their freshness and fragrance gave a brightness to the whole scene while shrinking from such light as only the beauteous works of nature could bear was the array accomplished by female fingers  under the wreathed canopies were the stalls piled up with bright colours most artistically arranged ethel with her overminute knowledge of every article could hardly believe that yonder glowing eastern pattern of scarlet black and blue was in fact a judicious mosaic of penwipers that she remembered as shreds begged from the tailor that the delicate lacework consisted of miss bracys perpetual antimacassars and that the potichomanie could look so dignified and etruscan  here you are cried meta rivers springing to meet them good girls to come early wheres my little daisy  coming in good time said ethel how pretty it all looks  but wheres florawheres my watchguard anxiously asked blanche  she was here just now said meta looking round what a genius she is ethel she worked wonders all yesterday and let the miss hoxtons think it was all their own doing and she was out before six this morning putting finishing touches  is this your stall said ethel  yes but it will not bear a comparison with hers it has a ladysmaid look by the side of hers in fact bellairs and my aunts maid did it chiefly for papa was rather ailing yesterday and i could not be out much  how is he now  better he will walk round byandby i hope it will not be too much for him  oh what beautiful things cried mary in ecstasy at what she was forced to express by the vague substantive for her imagination had never stretched to the marvels she beheld  ay we have been lazy you see and so aunt leonora brought down all these smart concerns it is rather like howell and jamess isnt it  in fact lady leonoras marquee was filled with costly knickknacks which as meta justly said had not half the grace and appropriate air that reigned where flora had arranged and where margaret had worked with the peculiar freshness and finish that distinguished everything to which she set her hand  miss clevelands counter was not ill setout but it wanted the air of ease and simplicity which was even more noticeable than the perfect taste of floras wares if there had been nothing facetious the effect would have been better but there was nothing to regret and the whole was very bright and gay  blanche could hardly look so anxious was she for flora to tell her the locality of her treasure  there she is said meta at last george is fixing that branch of evergreen for her  flora i did not know her cried each sister amazed while mary added oh how nice she looks  it was the first time of seeing her in the white muslin and broad chip hatwhich all the younger saleswomen of the bazaar had agreed to wear it was a most becoming dress and she did indeed look strikingly elegant and well dressed it occurred to ethel for the first time that flora was decidedly the reigning beauty of the bazaarno one but meta rivers could be compared to her and that little lady was on so small a scale of perfect finish that she seemed fit to act the fairy where flora was the enchanted princess  flora greeted her sisters eagerly while meta introduced her brothera great contrast to herself though not without a certain comeliness tall and large with ruddy complexion deep lustreless black eyes and a heavy straight bush of black moustache veiling rather thick lips blanche reiterated inquiries for her watchguard  i dont knowsaid flora somewhere among the rest  blanche was in despair  you may look for it said flora who however hurried never failed in kindness if you will touch nothing  so blanche ran from place to place in restless dismay that caused mr george rivers to ask what was the matter  the guards the guards cried blanche whereupon he fell into a fit of laughter which disconcerted her because she could not understand him and made ethel take an aversion to him on the spot  however he was very goodnatured he took blanches reluctant hand and conducted her all along the stall even proceeding to lift her up where she could not command a view of the whole thus exciting her extreme indignation she shook herself out when he set her down surveyed her crumpled muslin and believed he took her for a little girl she ought to have been flattered when the quest was successful and he insisted on knowing which was the guard and declared that he should buy it she begged him to do no such thing and he desired to know whyinsisting that he would give five shillingsfifteentwentyfive for that one till she did not know whether he was in earnest and she doing an injury to the bazaar  meantime the hour had struck and flora had placed mrs hoxton in a sheltered spot where she could take as much or as little trouble as she pleased lady leonora and miss langdale came from the house and with the two ladiesmaids in the background took up their station with miss rivers miss cleveland called her party to order and sounds of carriages were heard approaching  mary and blanche disbursed the first money spent in the fancy fair mary on a blottingbook for harry to be placed among the presents to which she added on every birthday while blanche bought a sixpenny gift for every one with more attention to the quantity than the quality then came a revival of her anxieties for the guards and while mary was simply desirous of the fun of being a shopwoman and was made happy by meta rivers asking her help blanche was in despair till she had sidled up to their neighbourhood and her piteous looks had caused goodnatured mrs hoxton to invite her to assist when she placed herself close to the precious object  a great fluttering of heart went to that manoeuvre but still felicity could not be complete that great troublesome mr george rivers had actually threatened to buy nothing but that one watchchain and blanches eye followed him everywhere with fear lest he should come that way and there were many other gentlemenwhat could they want but watchguards and of themwhatsave this paragon  poor blanche what did she not undergo whenever any one cast his eye over her range of goods and this was not seldom for there was an attraction in the pretty little eager girl glowing and smiling one old gentleman actually stopped handled the guards themselves and asked their price  eighteenpence said blanche colouring and faltering as she held up one in preference  eh is not this the best said he to the lady on his arm  oh please take that instead exclaimed blanche in extremity  and why asked the gentleman amused  i made this she answered  is that the reason i must not have it  no dont tease her the lady said kindly and the other was taken  i wonder for what it is reserved the lady could not help saying as she walked away  let us watch her for a minute or two what an embellishment children are ha dont you seethe little maid is fluttering and reddeningnow how pretty she looks ah i see heres the favoured dont you see that fine bronzed ladetonone can see at a glance it is a little drama they are pretending to be strangers he is turning over the goods with an air she trying to look equally careless but what a pretty carnation it is ha ha he has come to ithe has it now the acting is over and they are having their laugh out how joyously what next oh she begs off from keeping shopshe darts out to him goes off in his handi declare that is the prettiest sight in the whole fair i wonder who the little demoiselle can be  the great event of the day was over now with blanche and she greatly enjoyed wandering about with hector and tom there was a postoffice at miss clevelands stall where on paying sixpence a letter could be obtained to the address of the inquirer blanche had been very anxious to try but flora had pronounced it nonsense however hector declared that flora was not his master tapped at the sliding panel and charmed blanche by what she thought a most witty parody of his name as achilles lionsrock esquire when the answer came from within ship letter sir double postage they thought it almost uncanny and hectors shilling was requited by something so like a real ship letter that they had some idea that the real post had somehow transported itself thither the interior was decidedly oracular consisting of this one line i counsel you to persevere in your laudable undertaking  hector said he wished he had any laudable undertaking and blanche tried to persuade tom to try his fortune but he pronounced that he did not care to hear harvey andersons trashhe knew his writing though disguised and had detected his shining boots below the counter there mr george rivers came up and began to tease blanche about the guards asking her to take his fifteen shillingsor fiveandtwenty and who had got that one which alone he wanted till the poor child after standing perplexed for some moments looked up with spirit and said you have no business to ask and running away took refuge in the back of mrs hoxtons marquee where she found ethel packing up for miss hoxtons purchasers and confiding to her that mr george rivers was a horrid man she ventured no more from her protection she did indeed emerge when told that papa was coming with aubrey and daisy and miss bracy and she had the pleasure of selling to them some of her wares dr may bargaining with her to her infinite satisfaction and little gertrudes blue eyes opened to their full width not understanding what could have befallen her sisters  and what is ethel doing asked the doctor  packing up parcels papa and ethels face was raised looking very merry  packing parcels how long will they last tied up said dr may laughing  lasting is the concern of nothing in the fair papa answered she in the same tone  for ethel was noted as the worst packer in the house but having offered to wrap up a pincushion sold by a hurried miss hoxton she became involved in the office for the rest of the daythe same which bellairs and her companion performed at the langdale counter flora was too ready and dexterous to need any such aid but the misses hoxton were glad to be spared the trouble and blanche whose fingers were far neater than ethels made the task much easier and was kept constant to it by her dread of the dark moustache which was often visible near their tent searching she thought for her  their humble employment was no sinecure for this was the favourite stall with the purchasers of better style since the articles were in general tasteful and fairly worth the moderate price set on them at miss clevelands counter there was much noisy laughtermany jocular cheatstricks for gaining money and refusals to give change and it seemed to be very popular with the stoneborough people and to carry on a brisk trade the only languor was in lady leonoras quarterthe articles were too costly and hung on hand nor were the ladies sufficiently well known nor active enough to gain custom excepting meta who drove a gay traffic at her end of the stall which somewhat redeemed the general languor  her eyes were all the time watching for her father and suddenly perceiving him she left her trade in charge of the delighted and important mary and hastened to walk round with him and show him the humours of the fair  mary in her absence had the supreme happiness of obtaining norman as a customer he wanted a picture for his rooms at oxford and watercoloured drawings were as tom had observed suitable staple commodities for miss rivers mary tried to make him choose a brightlycoloured pheasant with a pencil background and then a fine foaming seapiece by some unknown lady adelaide that much dazzled her imagination but nothing would serve him but a sketch of an old cedar tree with stoneborough minster in the distance and the welsh hills beyond which mary thought a remarkable piece of bad taste sincecould he not see all that any day of his life and was it worth while to give fourteen shillings and sixpence for it but he said it was all for the good of cocksmoor and mary was only too glad to add to her hoard of coin so she only marvelled at his extravagance and offered to take care of it for him but to this he would not consent he made her pack it up for him and had just put the whiteybrown parcel under his arm when mr rivers and his daughter came up before he was aware mary proudly advertised meta that she had sold something for her  indeed what was it  your great picture of stoneborough said mary  is that gone i am sorry you have parted with that my dear it was one of your best said mr rivers in his soft sleepy gentle tone  oh papa i can do another but i wonder i put that extortionate price on it thinking no one would give it and so that i should keep it for you who has it mary  norman there he would have it though i told him it was very dear  norman pressed near them by the crowd had been unable to escape and stood blushing hesitating and doubting whether he ought to restore the prize which he had watched so long and obtained so eagerly  oh it is you said mr rivers politely oh no do not think of exchanging it i am rejoiced that one should have it who can appreciate it it was its falling into the hands of a stranger that i disliked you think with me that it is one of her best drawings  yes i do said norman still rather hesitating she did that with c when he was here last year he taught her very well have you that other here that you took with him my dear the view from the gate i mean  no dear papa you told me not to sell that  ah i remember that is right but there are some very pretty copies from prout here  while he was seeking them meta contrived to whisper if you could persuade him to go indoorsthis confusion of people is so bad for him and i must not come away i was in hopes of dr may but he is with the little ones  norman signed comprehension and meta said those copies are not worth seeing but you know papa you have the originals in the library  mr rivers looked pleased but was certain that norman could not prefer the sketches to this gay scene however it took very little persuasion to induce him to do what he wished and he took normans arm crossed the lawn and arrived in his own study where it was a great treat to him to catch any one who would admire his accumulation of prints drawings coins etc and his young friend was both very well amused and pleased to be setting miss riverss mind at ease on her fathers account it was not till halfpast four that dr may knocked at the door and stood surprised at finding his son there mr rivers spoke warmly of the young oxonians kindness in leaving the fair for an old man and praised normans taste in art norman rose to take leave but still thought it incumbent on him to offer to give up the picture if mr rivers set an especial value on it but mr rivers went to the length of being very glad that it was in his possession and added to it a very pretty drawing of the same size by a noted master which had been in the watercolour exhibition and while norman walked away well pleased mr rivers began to extol him to his father as a very superior and sensible young man of great promise and began to wish george had the same turn  norman on returning to the fancy fair found the world in all the ardour of raffles lady leonoras contributions were the chief prizes which attracted every one and of course the result was delightfully incongruous poor ethel who had been persuaded to venture a shilling to please blanche who had spent all her own obtained the two jars in potichomanie and was regarding them with a face worth painting harvey anderson had a doll george rivers a wooden monkey that jumped over a stick and if hector ernescliffe was enchanted at winning a beautiful motherofpearl inlaid workbox which he had vainly wished to buy for margaret flora only gained a matchbox of her own well known always to miss fire but which had been decided to be good enough for the bazaar  by fair means or foul the commodities were cleared off and while the sunbeams faded from the trodden grass the crowds disappeared and the vague compliment a very good bazaar was exchanged between the lingering sellers and their friends  flora was again to sleep at the grange and return the next day for a committee to be held over the gains which were not yet fully ascertained so dr may gathered his flock together and packed them boys and all into the two conveyances and ethel bade meta goodnight almost wondering to hear her merry voice say it has been a delightful day has it not it was so kind of your brother to take care of papa  oh it was delightful echoed mary and i took one pound fifteen and sixpence  i hope it will do great good to cocksmoor added meta but if you want real help you know you must come to us  ethel smiled but hurried her departure for she saw blanche again tormented by mr george rivers to know what had become of the guard telling her that if she would not say he should be furiously jealous  blanche hid her face on ethels arm when they were in the carriage and almost cried with indignant shamefastness that longdesired day had not been one of unmixed happiness to her poor child and ethel doubted whether it had been so to any one except indeed to mary whose desires never soared so high but that they were easily fulfilled and whose placid content was not easily wounded all she was wishing now was that harry were at home to receive his papercase  the return to margaret was real pleasure the narration of all that had passed was an event to her she was so charmed with her presents of every degree things unpleasant at the time could by drollery in the relating be made mirthful fun ever after dr may and the boys were so comical in their observationsmarys wonder and simplicity came in so amazinglyand there was such merriment at ethels two precious jars that she could hardly wish they had not come to her on one head they were all agreed in dislike of george rivers whom mary pronounced to be a detestable man and when gently called to order by margaret defended it by saying that miss bracy said it was better to detest than to hate while blanche coloured up to the ears and hid herself behind the armchair and dr may qualified the censure by saying he believed there was no great harm in the youth but that he was shallowbrained and extravagant and having been born in the days when mr rivers had been working himself up in the world had not had so good an education as his little halfsister  well what are you thinking of said her father laying his hand on ethels arm as she was wearily and pensively putting together the scattered purchases before going up to bed  i was thinking papa that there is a great deal of trouble taken in this world for a very little pleasure  the trouble is the pleasure in most cases most misanthropical miss  yes that is true but if so why cannot it be taken for some good  they meant it to be good said dr may come i cannot have you severe and ungrateful  so i have been telling myself papa all along but now that the day has come and i have seen what jealousies and competitions and vanities and disappointments it has producednot even poor little blanche allowed any comforti am almost sick at heart with thinking cocksmoor was the excuse  spectators are more philosophical than actors ethel others have not been tying parcels all day  i had rather do that thanbut that is the fox and the grapes said ethel smiling what i mean is that the real gladness of life is not in these great occasions of pleasure but in the little side delights that come in the midst of ones work dont they papa why is it worth while to go and search for a days pleasuring  ethel my child i dont like to hear you talk so said dr may looking anxiously at her it may be too true but it is not youthful nor hopeful it is not as your mother or i felt in our young days when a treat was a treat to us and gladdened our hearts long before and after i am afraid you have been too much saddened with loss and care  oh no papa said ethel rousing herself though speaking huskily you know i am your merry ethel you know i can be happy enoughonly at home  and ethel though she had tried to be cheerful leaned against his arm and shed a few tears  the fact is she is tired out said dr may soothingly yet half laughing she is not a beauty or a grace and she is thoughtful and quiet and so she moralises instead of enjoying as the world goes by i dare say a nights rest will make all the difference in the world  ah but there is more to come that ladies committee at cocksmoor  they are not there yet ethel goodnight you tired little cynic     chapter iv         back then complainer      go to the world return nor fear to cast      thy bread upon the waters sure at last         in joy to find it after many dayschristian year   the next day ethel had hoped for a return to reason but behold the world was cross the reaction of the long excitement was felt gertrude fretted and was unwell aubrey was pettish at his lessons and mary and blanche were weary yawning and inattentive every straw was a burden and miss bracy had feelings  ethel had been holding an interminable conversation with her in the schoolroom interrupted at last by a summons to speak to a cocksmoor woman at the back door and she was returning from the kitchen when the doctor called her into his study  ethel what is all this mary has found miss bracy in floods of tears in the schoolroom because she says you told her she was illtempered  i am sure you will be quite as much surprised said ethel somewhat exasperated when you hear that you lacerated her feelings yesterday  i why what did i do exclaimed dr may  you showed your evident want of confidence in her  i what can i have done  you met aubrey and gertrude in her charge and you took them away at once to walk with you  well  well that was it she saw you had no confidence in her  ethel what on earth can you mean i saw the two children dragging on her and i thought she would see nothing that was going on and would be glad to be released and i wanted them to go with me and see metas gold pheasants  that was the offence she has been breaking her heart all this time because she was sure from your manner that you were displeased to see them alone with hereating bonbons i believe and therefore took them away  daisy is the worse for her bonbons i believe but the overdose of them rests on my shoulders i do not know how to believe you ethel of course you told her nothing of the kind crossed my mind poor thing  i told her so over and over again as i have done forty times before but her feelings are always being hurt  poor thing poor thing no doubt it is a trying situation and she is sensitive surely you are all forbearing with her  i hope we are said ethel but how can we tell what vexes her  and what is this of your telling her she was illtempered asked dr may incredulously  well papa said ethel softened yet wounded by his thinking it so impossible i had often thought i ought to tell her that these sensitive feelings of hers were nothing but temper and perhapsindeed i know i doi partake of the general fractiousness of the house today and i did not bear it so patiently as usual i did say that i thought it wrong to foster her fancies for if she looked at them coolly she would find they were only a form of pride and temper  it did not come well from you ethel said the doctor looking vexed  no i know it did not said ethel meekly but oh to have these janglings once a week and to see no end to them  once a week  it is really as often or more often said ethel if any of us criticise anything the girls have done if there is a change in any arrangement if she thinks herself neglectedi cant tell you what little matters suffice she will catch me and argue with me tilloh till we are both half dead and yet cannot stop ourselves  why do you argue  if i could only help it  bad management said the doctor in a low musing tone you want a head and he sighed  oh papa i did not mean to distress you i would not have told you if i had rememberedbut i am worried today and off my guard  ethel i thought you were the one on whom i could depend for bearing everything  these were such nonsense  what may seem nonsense to you is not the same to her you must be forbearing ethel remember that dependence is prone to morbid sensitiveness especially in those who have a humble estimate of themselves  it seems to me that touchiness is more pride than humility said ethel whose temper already not in the smoothest state found it hard that after having long borne patiently with these constant arguments she should find miss bracy made the chief object of compassion  dr mays chivalrous feeling caused him to take the part of the weak and he answered you know nothing about it among our own kith and kin we can afford to pass over slights because we are sure the heart is rightwe do not know what it is to be among strangers uncertain of any claim to their esteem or kindness sad sad he continued as the picture wrought on him each trifle seems a token one way or the other i am very sorry i grieved the poor thing yesterday i must go and tell her so at once  he put ethel aside and knocked at the schoolroom door while ethel stood mortified he thinks i have been neglecting or speaking harshly to her for fifty times that i have borne with her maundering i have at last once told her the truth and for that i am accused of want of forbearance now he will go and make much of her and pity her till she will think herself an injured heroine and be worse than ever and he will do away with all the good of my advice and want me to ask her pardon for itbut that i never will it was only the truth and i will stick to it  ethel cried mary running up to her then slackening her pace and whispering you did not tell miss bracy she was illtempered  nonot exactly how could you tell papa i did  she said so she was crying and i asked what was the matter and she said my sister ethel said she was illtempered  she made a great exaggeration then said ethel  i am sure she was very cross all day said mary  well that is no business of yours said ethel pettishly what now mary dont look out at the street window  it is florathe grange carriage whispered mary as the two sisters made a precipitate retreat into the drawingroom  meanwhile dr may had been in the schoolroom miss bracy had ceased her tears before he camethey had been her retort on ethel and she had not intended the world to know of them half disconcerted half angry she heard the doctor approach she was a gentle tearful woman one of those who are often called meek under an erroneous idea that meekness consists in making herself exceedingly miserable under every kind of grievance and she now had a sort of melancholy satisfaction in believing that the young ladies had fabricated an exaggerated complaint of her temper and that she was going to become injured innocence to think herself accused of a great wrong excused her from perceiving herself guilty of a lesser one  miss bracy said dr may entering with his frank sweet look i am concerned that i vexed you by taking the children to walk with me yesterday i thought such little brats would be troublesome to any but their spoiling papa but they would have been in safer hands with you you would not have been as weak as i was in regard to sugarplums such amends as these confused miss bracy who found it pleasanter to be lamentable with ethel than to receive a full apology for her imagined offence from the master of the house feeling both small and absurd she murmured something of oh no and being sure and hoped he was going so that she might sit down to pity herself for those girls having made her appear so ridiculous  no such thing dr may put a chair for her and sat down himself saying with a smile you see you must trust us sometimes and overlook it if we are less considerate than we might be we have rough careless habits with each other and forget that all are not used to them  miss bracy exclaimed oh no never they were most kind  we wish to be said dr may but there are little neglectsor you think there are i will not say there are none for that would be answering too much for human nature or that they are fancifulfor that would be as little comfort as to tell a patient that the pain is only nervous  miss bracy smiled for she could remember instances when after suffering much at the time she had found the affront imaginary  he was glad of that smile and proceeded you will let me speak to you as to one of my own girls to them i should say use the only true cure dont brood over vexations small or great but think of them as trials that borne bravely become blessings  oh but dr may she exclaimed shocked nothing in your house could call for such feelings  i hope we are not very savage he said smiling but indeed i still say it is the safest rule it would be the only one if you were really among unkind people and if you take so much to heart an unlucky neglect of mine what would you do if the slight were a true one  you are right but my feelings were always oversensitive and this she said with a sort of complacency  well we must try to brace them said dr may much as if prescribing for her will not you believe in our confidence and esteem and harden yourself against any outward unintentional piece of incivility  she felt as if she could at that moment  or at least try to forgive and forget them talking them over only deepens the sense of them and discussions do no good to any one my daughters are anxious to be your best friends as i hope you know  oh they are most kind  but you see i must say this added dr may somewhat hesitating as they have no mother toto spare all this and then growing clearer he proceeded i must beg you to be forbearing with them and not perplex yourself and them with arguing on what cannot be helped they have not the experience that could enable them to finish such a discussion without unkindness and it can only waste the spirits and raise fresh subjects of regret i must leave youi hear myself called  miss bracy began to be sensible that she had somewhat abused ethels patience and the unfortunate speech about the source of her sensitiveness did not appear to her so direfully cruel as at first she hoped every one would forget all about it and resolved not to take umbrage so easily another time or else be silent about it but she was not a person of much resolution  the doctor found that meta rivers and her brother had brought flora home and were in the drawingroom where margaret was hearing another edition of the history of the fair and a byplay was going on of teasing blanche about the chain  george rivers was trying to persuade her to make one for him and her refusal came out at last in an almost passionate key in the midst of the other conversationno i sayno  another no and that will be yes  no i wont i dont like you well enough  margaret gravely sent blanche and the other children away to take their walk and the brother and sister soon after took leave when flora called ethel to hasten to the ladies committee that they might arrange the disposal of the one hundred and fifty pounds the amount of their gains  to see the fate of cocksmoor said ethel  do you think i cannot manage the stoneborough folk said flora looking radiant with good humour and conscious of power poor ethel i am doing you good against your will never mind here is wherewith to build the school and the management will be too happy to fall into our hands do you think every one is as ready as you are to walk three miles and back continually  there was sense in this there always was sense in what flora said but it jarred on ethel and it seemed almost unsympathising in her to be so gay when the rest were wearied or perturbed ethel would have been very glad of a short space to recollect herself and recover her good temper but it was late and flora hurried her to put on her bonnet and come to the committee ill take care of your interests she said as they set out you look as doleful as if you thought you should be robbed of cocksmoor but that is the last thing that will happen you will see  it would not be acting fairly to let them build for us and then for us to put them out of the management said ethel  my dear they want importance not action they will leave the real power to us of themselves  you like to build cocksmoor with such instruments said ethel whose ruffled condition made her forget her resolution not to argue with flora  bricks are made of clay said flora there that was said like norman himself on your plan we might have gone on for forty years saving seven shillings a year and spending six whenever there was an illness in the place  you who used to dislike these people more than even i did said ethel  that was when i was an infant my dear and did not know how to deal with them i will take carei will even save cherry elwood for you if i can alan ernescliffes ten pounds is a noble weapon  you always mean to manage everything and then you have no time said ethel sensible all the time of her own illhumour and of her sisters patience and amiability yet propelled to speak the unpleasant truths that in her better moods were held back  still flora was goodtempered though ethel would almost have preferred her being provoked i know she said i have been using you ill and leaving the world on your shoulders but it was all in your service and cocksmoors and now we shall begin to be reasonable and useful again  i hope so said ethel  really ethel to comfort you i think i shall send you with norman to dine at abbotstoke grange on wednesday mr rivers begged us to come he is so anxious to make it lively for his son  thank you i do not think mr george rivers and i should be likely to get on together what a bad style of wit you heard what mary said about him and ethel repeated the doubt between hating and detesting  young men never know how to talk to little girls was floras reply  at this moment they came up with one of the miss andersons and flora began to exchange civilities and talk over yesterdays events with great animation her notice always gave pleasure brightened as it was by the peculiarly engaging address which she had inherited from her father and which therefore was perfectly easy and natural fanny anderson was flattered and gratified rather by the manner than the words and on excellent terms they entered the committeeroom namely the schoolmistresss parlour  there were nine ladies on the committeenine muses as the doctor called them because they produced anything but harmony mrs ledwich was in the chair miss rich was secretary and had her pen and ink and accountbook ready flora came in smiling and greeting ethel grave earnest and annoyed behind her trying to be perfectly civil but not at all enjoying the congratulations on the successful bazaar the ladies all talked and discussed their yesterdays adventures gathering in little knots as they traced the fate of favourite achievements of their skill while ethel lugubrious and impatient beside flora the only one not engaged and therefore conscious of the hubbub of clacking tongues  at last mrs ledwich glanced at the mistresss watch in its pasteboard tower in gothic architecture and insisted on proceeding to business so they all sat down round a circular table with a very fine red blue and black oilcloth whose pattern was inseparably connected in ethels mind with absurdity tedium and annoyance  the business was opened by the announcement of what they all knew before that the proceeds of the fancy fair amounted to one hundred and fortynine pounds fifteen shillings and tenpence  then came a pause and mrs ledwich said that next they had to consider what was the best means of disposing of the sum gained in this most gratifying manner every one except flora ethel and quiet mrs ward began to talk at once there was a great deal about elizabethan architecture crossed by much more in which normal industrial and common things most often met ethels ear with some stories secondhand from harvey anderson of marvellous mistakes and on the opposite side of the table there was mrs ledwich impressively saying something to the silent mrs ward marking her periods with emphatic beats with her pencil and each seemed to close with mrs perkinsons niece whom ethel knew to be cherrys intended supplanter she looked piteously at flora who only smiled and made a sign with her hand to her to be patient ethel fretted inwardly at that serene sense of power but she could not but admire how well flora knew how to bide her time when having waited till mrs ledwich had nearly wound up her discourse on mrs elwoods impudence and mrs perkinsons niece she leaned towards miss boulder who sat between and whispered to her ask mrs ledwich if we should not begin with some steps for getting the land  miss boulder having acted as conductor the president exclaimed just so the land is the first consideration we must at once take steps for obtaining it thereupon mrs ledwich who always did things methodically moved and miss anderson seconded that the land requisite for the school must be obtained and the nine ladies held up their hands and resolved it  miss rich duly recorded the great resolution and miss boulder suggested that perhaps they might write to the national society or government or something whereat miss rich began to flourish one of the very long goose quills which stood in the inkstand before her chiefly as insignia of office for she always wrote with a small stiff metal pen  flora here threw in a query whether the national society or government or something would give them a grant unless they had the land to build upon  the ladies all started off hereupon and all sorts of instances of hardness of heart were mentioned the most relevant of which was that the church building society would not give a grant to mr holloways proprietary chapel at whitford when mrs ledwich was suddenly struck with the notion that dear mr holloway might be prevailed on to come to stoneborough to preach a sermon in the minster for the benefit of cocksmoor when they would all hold plates at the door flora gave ethel a tranquillising pat and as mrs ledwich turned to her asking whether she thought dr may or dr hoxton would prevail on him to come she said with her winning look i think that consideration had better wait till we have some more definite view had we not better turn to this land question  quite true they all agreed but to whom did the land belongand what a chorus arose miss anderson thought it belonged to mr nicolson because the wagons of slate had james nicolson on them and if so they had no chance for he was an old miserand six stories illustrative thereof ensued miss rich was quite sure some body held it and bodies were slow of movement mrs ledwich remembered some question of enclosing and thought all waste lands were under the crown she knew that the stoneborough people once had a right to pasture their cattle because mr southrons cow had tumbled down a loampit when her mother was a girl no that was on farview down out the other way miss harrison was positive that sir henry walkinghame had some right there and would not dr may apply to him mrs grey thought it ought to be part of the drydale estate and miss boulder was certain that mr bramshaw knew all about it  floras gentle voice carried conviction that she knew what she was saying when at last they left a moment for her to speakethel would have done so long ago if i am not mistaken the land is a copyhold of sir henry walkinghame held under the manor of drydale which belongs to m college and is underlet to mr nicolson  everybody being partially right was delighted and had known it all before miss boulder agreed with miss anderson that miss may had stated it as lucidly as mr bramshaw could the next question was to whom to apply and after as much as was expedient had been said in favour of each it was decided that as sir henry walkinghame was abroad no one knew exactly where it would be best to go to the fountainhead and write at once to the principal of the college but who was to write flora proposed mr ramsden as the fittest person but this was negatived every one declared that he would never take the trouble and miss rich began to agitate her pens by this time however mrs ward who was opposite to the gothic clocktower began to look uneasy and suggested in a nervous manner that it was halfpast five and she was afraid mr ward would be kept waiting for his dinner mrs grey began to have like fears that mr grey would be come in from his ride after banking hours the other ladies began to think of tea and the meeting decided on adjourning till that day next week when the committee would sit upon miss richs letter  my dear miss flora began miss rich adhering to her as they parted with the rest at the end of the street how am i to write to a principal am i to begin reverend sir or my lord or is he venerable like an archdeacon what is his name and what am i to say  why it is not a correspondence much in my line said flora laughing  ah but you are so intimate with dr hoxton and your brothers at oxford you must know  ill take advice said flora goodnaturedly shall i come and call before friday and tell you the result  oh pray it will be a real favour goodmorning  there said flora as the sisters turned homewards cherry is not going to be turned out just yet  how could you flora now they will have that man from whitford and you said not a word against it  what was the use of adding to the hubbub a little opposition would make them determined on having him you will see ethel we shall get the ground on our own terms and then it will be time to settle about the mistress if the harvest holidays were not over we would try to send cherry to a trainingschool so as to leave them no excuse  i hate all this management and contrivance it would be more honest to speak our minds and not pretend to agree with them  my dear ethel have i spoken a word contrary to my opinion it is not fit for me a girl of twenty to go disputing and dragooning as you would have me but a little savoir faire a grain of common sense thrown in among the babble always works dont you remember how mrs wards sister told us that a whole crowd of tottering chinese ladies would lean on her because they felt her firm support though it was out of sight  ethel did not answer she had selfcontrol enough left not to retort upon floras estimate of herself but the irritation was strong she felt as if her cherished views for cocksmoor were insulted as well as set aside by the place being made the occasion of so much folly and vain prattle the sanctity of her vision of selfdevotion destroyed by such interference and floras promises did not reassure her she doubted floras power and had still more repugnance to the means by which her sister tried to govern they did not seem to her straightforward and she could not endure floras complacency in their success had it not been for her real love for the place and people as well as the principle which prompted that love she could have found it in her heart to throw up all concern with it rather than become a fellowworker with such a conclave  such were ethels feelings as the pair walked down the street the one sister bright and smiling with the good humour that had endured many shocks all that day all good nature and triumph looking forward to success great benefit to cocksmoor and plenty of management with credit and praise to herself the other downcast and irritable with annoyance at the interference with her schemes at the prospects of her school and at herself for being out of temper prone to murmur or to reply tartly and not able to recover from her mood but only as she neared the house lapsing into her other trouble and preparing to resist any misjudged though kind attempt of her father to make her unsay her rebuke to miss bracy pride and temper ah etheldred where were they now  dr may was at his study door as his daughters entered the hall and ethel expected the order which she meant to question but instead of this after a brief inquiry after the doings of the nine muses which flora answered so as to make him laugh he stopped ethel as she was going upstairs by saying i do not know whether this letter is intended for richard or for me at any rate it concerns you most  the envelope was addressed to the reverend richard may d d market stoneborough and the letter began reverend sir so far ethel saw and exclaimed with amusement then with a longdrawn ah and an interjection my poor dear una she became absorbed the large tearsyes ethels reluctant tears gathering slowly and dropping  the letter was from a clergyman far away in the north of england who said he could not though a stranger resist the desire to send to dr may an account of a poor girl who seemed to have received great benefits from him or from some of his family especially as she had shown great eagerness on his proposing to write  he said it was nearly a year since there had come into his parish a troop of railwaymen and their families for the most part they were completely wild and rude unused to any pastoral care but even on the first sunday he had noticed a keenlooking freckled ragged unmistakably irish girl creeping into church with a prayerbook in her hand and had afterwards found her hanging about the door of the school i never saw a more engaging though droll wild expression than that with which she looked up to me ethels cry of delight was at that sentenceshe knew that look too well and had yearned after it so often i found her far better instructed than her appearance had led me to expect and more truly impressed with the spirit of what she had learned than it has often been my lot to find children she was perfect in the new testament historyah that she was not when she went awayand was in the habit of constantly attending church and using morning and evening prayers oh how i longed when she went away to beg her to keep them up dear una on my questions as to how she had been taught she always replied mr richard may or miss athel you must excuse me if i have not correctly caught the name from her irish pronunciation i am afraid he thinks my name is athaliah but oh this dear girl how i have wished to hear of her everything was answered with mr richard or miss athel and if i inquired further her face would light up with a beam of gratitude and she would run on as long as i could listen with instances of their kindness it was the same with her mother a wild rude specimen of an irishwoman whom i never could bring to church herself but who ran on loudly with their praises usually ending with heavens be their bed and saying that una had been quite a different girl since the young ladies and gentleman found her out and put them parables in her head  for my own part i can testify that in the seven months that she attended my school i never had a serious fault to find with her but far more often to admire the earnestness and devout spirit as well as the kindness and generosity apparent in all her conduct bad living and an unwholesome locality have occasioned a typhus fever among the poor strangers in this place and una was one of the first victims her mother almost from the first gave her up saying she knew she was one marked for glory and una has been lying day after day in a sort of halfdelirious state constantly repeating hymns and psalms and generally apparently very happy except when one distress occurred again and again whether delirious or sensible namely that she had never gone to wish miss may goodbye and thank her and that maybe she and mr richard thought her ungrateful and she would sometimes beg in her phraseology to go on her bare knees to stoneborough only to see miss athel again  her mother i should say told me the girl had been half mad at not being allowed to go and take leave of miss may and she had been sorry herself but her husband had come home suddenly from the search for work and having made his arrangements removed them at once early the next morningtoo early to go to the young lady though she said una didas they passed through stoneboroughrun down the street before she was aware and she found her sobbing fit to break her heart before the house oh why why was i not up and at the window oh my una to think of that when i spoke of writing to let miss may hear how it was the poor girl caught at the idea with the utmost delight her weakness was too great to allow her to utter many words distinctly when i asked her what she would have me say but these were as well as i could understandthe blessing of one that they have brought peace unto tell them i pray and will pray that they may walk in the robe of gloryand tell mr richard that i mind what he said to me of taking hold on the sure hope god crown all their crosses unto them and fulfil all their desires unto everlasting life i feel that i am not rendering her words with all their fervour and beauty of irish expression but i would that i could fully retain and transmit them for those who have so led her must indeed be able to feel them precious i never saw a more peaceful frame of penitence and joy she died last night sleeping herself away without more apparent suffering and will be committed to the earth on sunday next all her fellowscholars attending and i hope profiting by the example she has left  i have only to add my most earnest congratulations to those whose labour of love has borne such blessed fruit and hoping you will pardon the liberty etc  etheldred finished the letter through blinding tears while rising sobs almost choked her she ran away to her own room bolted the door and threw herself on her knees beside her bednow confusedly giving thanks for such resultsnow weeping bitterly over her own unworthiness oh what was she in the sight of heaven compared with what this poor girl had deemed herwith what this clergyman thought her she the teacher taught trained and guarded from her infancy by her wise mother and by such a father she to have given way all day to pride jealousy anger selfish love of her own will when this poor girl had embraced and held fast the blessed hope from the very crumbs they had brought her nothing could have so humbled the distrustful spirit that had been working in ethel which had been scotched into silencenot killedwhen she endured the bazaar and now had been indemnifying itself by repining at every stumblingblock her own scholars blessing was the rebuke that went most home to her heart for having doubted whether good could be worked in any way save her own  she was interrupted by mary trying to open the door and admitting her heard her wonder at the traces of her tears and ask what there was about una ethel gave her the letter and marys tears showered very fastthey always came readily oh ethel how glad richard will be  yes it is all richards doing so much more good and wise and humble as he is no wonder his teaching and ethel sat down and cried again  mary pondered it makes me very glad she said and yet i dont know why one cries ethel do you thinkshe came near and whisperedthat una has met dear mamma there  ethel kissed her it was almost the first time mary had spoken of her mother and she answered dear mary we cannot tellwe may think it is all one communion you know  mary was silent and next time she spoke it was to hope that ethel would tell the cocksmoor children about una  ethel was obliged to dress and go downstairs to tea her father seemed to have been watching for her with his study door open for he came to meet her took her hand and said in a low voice my dear child i wish you joy this will be a pleasant message to bid poor ritchie good speed for his ordination will it not  that it will papa  why ethel have you been crying over it all this time said he struck by the sadness of her voice  many other things papa i am so unworthybut it was not our doingbut the grace  no but thankful you may be to have been the means of awakening the grace  ethels lips trembled and oh papa coming today when i have been behaving so ill to you and miss bracy and flora and all  have you i did not know you had behaved ill to me  about miss bracyi thought wrong things if i did not say them to her i believe i said what was true though it was harsh of me to say it and  what about pride and temper it was true and i hope it will do her good cure a piping turkey with a peppercorn sometimes i have spoken to her and told her to pluck up a little spirit not fancy affronts and not to pester you with them poor child you have been sadly victimised today and yesterday no wonder you were bored past patience with that absurd rabble of women  it was all my own selfish distrustful temper wanting to have cocksmoor taken care of in my own way and angry at being interfered with i see it nowand here this poor girl that i thought thrown away  ay ethel you will often see the like the main object may fail or fall short but the earnest painstaking will always be blessed some way or other and where we thought it most wasted some fresh green shoot will spring up to show it is not we that give the increase i suppose you will write to richard with this  that i shall  then you may send this with it tell him my arm is tired and stiff today or i would have said more he must answer the clergymans letter  dr may gave ethel his sheet not folded his written words were now so few as to be cherished amongst his children   dear richard  may all your ministerial works be as blessed as this your first labour of love i give you hearty joy of this strengthening blessing mine goes with itonly be strong and of a good courage                      your affectionate father                              r may  psmargaret does not gain ground this summer you must soon come home and cheer her     chapter v         as late engaged by fancys dream      i lay beside a rapid stream      i saw my first come gliding by      its airy form soon caught my eye      its texture frail and colour various      like human hopes and life precarious      sudden my second caught my ear      and filled my soul with constant fear      i quickly rose and home i ran      my whole was hissing in the panriddle   flora revised the letter to the principal and the ladies committee approved after having proposed seven amendments all of which flora caused to topple over by their own weakness  after interval sufficient to render the nine ladies very anxious the principal wrote from scotland where he was spending the long vacation and informed them that their request should be laid before the next college meeting  after the committee had sat upon this letter the two sisters walked home in much greater harmony than after the former meeting etheldred had recovered her candour and was willing to own that it was not art but good sense that gave her sister so much ascendancy she began to be hopeful and to declare that flora might yet do something even with the ladies flora was gratified by the approval that no one in the house could help valuing positively said flora i believe i may in time you see there are different ways of acting as an authority or as an equal  the authority can move from without the equal must from within said ethel  just so we must circumvent their prejudices instead of trying to beat them down  if you only could have the proper catechising restored  wait you will see let me feel my ground  or if we could only abdicate into the hands of the rightful power  the rightful power would not be much obliged to you  that is the worst of it said ethel it is sad to hear the sick people say that dr may is more to them than any parson it shows that they have so entirely lost the notion of what their clergyman should be  dr may is the man most looked up to in this town said flora and that gives weight to us in the committee but it is all in the using  yes said ethel hesitatingly  you see we have the prestige of better birth and better education as well as of having the chief property in the town and of being the largest subscribers added to his personal character said flora so that everything conspires to render us leaders and our age alone prevented us from assuming our post sooner  they were at home by this time and entering the hall perceived that the whole party were in the lawn the consolation of the children for the departure of hector and tom was a bowl of soapsuds and some tobacco pipes and they had collected the house to admire and assist even margarets couch being drawn close to the window  bubbles is one of the most fascinating of sports there is the soft foamy mass like driven snow or like whipped cream blanche bends down to blow a honeycomb holding the bowl of the pipe in the water at her gurgling blasts there slowly heaves upwards the pile of larger clearer bubbles each reflecting the whole scene and sparkling with rainbow tints until aubrey ruthlessly dashes all into fragments with his hand and mary pronounces it stiff enough and presents a pipe to little daisy who drawing the liquid into her mouth throws it away with a grimace and declares that she does not like bubbles but aubrey stands with swelled cheeks gravely puffing at the sealingwaxed extremity out pours a confused assemblage of froth but the glassy globe slowly expands the little branching veins flowing down on either side bearing an enlarging miniature of the sky the clouds the tuliptree aubrey pauses to exclaim but where is it try again a proud bubble as mary calls it a peacock in blended pink and green is this transparent sphere reflecting and embellishing house wall and shrubs it is too beautiful it is gone mary undertakes to give a lesson and blows deliberately without the slightest result again she waves her disengaged hand in silent exultation as the airy balls detach themselves and float off on the summer breeze with a tardy graceful uncertain motion daisy rushes after them catches at them and looks at her empty fingers with a puzzled all gone as plainly expressed by toby who snaps at them and shakes his head with offended dignity at the shock of his meeting teeth while the kitten frisks after them striking at them with her paw amazed at meeting vacancy  even the grave norman is drawn in he agrees with mary that bubbles used to fly over the wall and that one once went into mrs richardsons garret window when her housemaid tried to catch it with a pair of tongs and then ran downstairs screaming that there was a ghost in her room but that was in harrys time the heroic age of the may nursery  he accepts a pipe and his greater height raises it into a favourable current of airthe glistening balloon sails off it flies it soars no it is coming down the children shout at it as if to drive it up but it wilfully descendsthey rush beneath they try to waft it on high with their breaththere is a collision between mary and blancheaubrey perceives a taste of soapy waterthe bubble is no moreit is vanished in his open mouth  papa himself has taken a pipe and the little ones are mounted on chairs to be on a level with their tall elders a painted globe is swimming along hesitating at first but the dancing motion is tending upwards the rainbow tints glisten in the sunlightall rush to assist it if breath of the lips can uphold it it should rise indeed up above the wall over mrs richardsons elm over the topmost branchhurrah out of sight margaret adds her voice to the acclamations beat that if you can mary that doubtful wind keeps yours suspended in a graceful minuet its pace is acceleratedbut earthwards it has committed selfdestruction by running foul of a rosebush a general blank  you here ethel said norman as the elders laughed at each others baffled faces  i am more surprised to find you here she answered  excitement said norman smiling one cause is as good as another for it  very pretty sport said dr may you should write a poem on it norman  it is an exhausted subject said norman bubble and trouble are too obvious a rhyme  ha there it goes it will be over the house thats right every one joined in the outcry  whose is it  blanches  hurrah for blanche well done white mayflower there said the doctor that is what i meant see the applause gained by a proud bubble that flies dont we all bow down to it and waft it up with the whole force of our lungs air as it is and when it fairly goes out of sight is there any exhilaration or applause that surpasses ours  the whole world being bent on making painted bubbles fly over the house said norman far more thoughtfully than his father it is a fair pattern of life and fame  i was thinking continued dr may what was the most unalloyed exultation i remember  harrys when you were made dux whispered ethel to her brother  not mine said norman briefly  i believe said dr may i never knew such glorification as when aubrey spencer climbed the poor old marketcross we all felt ourselves made illustrious for ever in his person  nay papa when you got that gold medal must have been the grandest time said blanche who had been listening  dr may laughed and patted her i blanche why i was excessively amazed that is all not in normans way but i had been doing next to nothing to the very last then fell into an agony and worked like a horse thinking myself sure of failure and that my mother and my uncle would break their hearts  but when you heard that you had it persisted blanche  why then i found i must be a much cleverer fellow than i thought for said he laughing but i was ashamed of myself and of the authorities for choosing such an idle dog and vexed that other plodding lads missed it who deserved it more than i  of course said norman in a low voice that is what one always feels i had rather blow soapbubbles  where was dr spencer asked ethel  not competing he had been ready a year before and had gained it or i should have had no chance poor spencer what would i not give to see him or hear of him  the last washow long ago said ethel  six years when he was setting off to return from poonshedagore said dr may sighing i gave him up his health was broken and there was no one to look after him he was the sort of man to have a nameless grave and a name too blessed for fame  ethel would have asked further of her fathers dear old friend but there were sounds denoting an arrival and margaret beckoned to them as miss rivers and her brother were ushered into the drawingroom and blanche instantly fled away with her basin to hide herself in the schoolroom  meta skipped out and soon was established on the grass an attraction to all the live creatures as it seemed for the kitten came and was caressed till her own graceful nipen was ready to fight with the uncouth toby for the possession of a restingplace on the skirt of her habit while daisy nestled up to her as claiming a privilege and aubrey kept guard over the dogs  meta inquired after a huge dolldr hoxtons gift to daisy at the bazaar  she is in margarets wardrobe was the answer because aubrey tied her hands behind her and was going to offer her up on the nursery grate  oh aubrey that was too cruel  no returned aubrey she was iphigenia going to be sacrificed  mary unconsciously acted diana said ethel and bore the victim away  pray was daisy a willing clytemnestra asked meta  oh yes she liked it said aubrey while meta looked discomfited  i never could get proper respect paid to dolls said margaret we deal too much in their natural enemies  yes said ethel my only doll was like a heraldic lion couped in all her parts  harry and tom once made a general execution said flora there was a doll hanging to every balusterthe number made up with rag  george rivers burst out laughinghis first sign of life and meta looked as if she had heard of so many murders  i cant help feeling for a doll she said they used to be like sisters to me i feel as if they were wasted on children that see no character in them and only call them dolly  i agree with you said margaret if there had been no live dolls richard and i should have reared our doll family as judiciously as tenderly there are treasures of carpentry still extant that he made for them  oh i am so glad cried meta as if she had found another point of union if i were to confessthere is a dear old rose in the secret recesses of my wardrobe i could as soon throw away my sister  ha cried her brother laying hold of the child here little daisy will you give your doll to meta  my name is gertrude margaret may said the little round mouth the fat arm was drawn back with all a babys dignity and the rosy face was hidden in dr mays breast at the sound of george riverss broad laugh and well done little one  dr may put his arm round her turned aside from him and began talking to meta about mr rivers  flora and norman made conversation for the brother and he presently asked norman to go out shooting with him but looked so amazed on hearing that norman was no sportsman that flora tried to save the family credit by mentioning hectors love of a gun which caused their guest to make a general tender of sporting privileges though added he with a drawl shooting is rather a nuisance especially alone  meta told ethel a little apart that he was so tired of going out alone that he had brought her here in search of a companion  he comes in at eleven oclock poor fellow quite tired with solitude said she and comes to me to be entertained  indeed exclaimed ethel what can you do  what i can said meta laughing whatever is not a horrid nuisance to him  it would be a horrid nuisance to me said ethel bluntly if my brothers wanted me to amuse them all the morning  your brothers oh said meta as if that were very different besides you have so much more to do i am only too glad and grateful when george will come to me at all you see i have always been too young to be his companion or find out what suited him and now he is so very kind and goodnatured to me  but what becomes of your business  i get time one way or another there is the evening very often when i have sung both him and papa to sleep i had two hours all to myself yesterday night said meta with a look of congratulation and i had a famous reading of thirlwalls greece  i should think that such evenings were as bad as the mornings  come ethel dont make me naughty large families like yours may have merry sociable evenings but i do assure you ours are very pleasant we are so pleased to have george at home and we really hope that he is taking a fancy to the dear grange you cant think how delighted papa is to have him content to stay quietly with us so long i must call him to go back now though or papa will be kept waiting  when ethel had watched the tall ponderous brother help the bright fairy sister to fly airily into her saddle and her sparkling glance and wave of the hand as she cantered off contrasting with his slow bend and immobility of feature she could not help saying that metas life certainly was not too charming with her fanciful valetudinarian father and that stupid idealess brother  he is very amiable and goodnatured interposed norman  ha norman you are quite won by his invitation to shoot how he despised you for refusingas much as you despised him  speak for yourself said norman you fancy no sensible man likes shooting but you are all wrong some of our best men are capital sportsmen why there is ogilvieyou know what he is when i bring him down here you will see that there is no sort of sport that he is not keen after  this poor fellow will never be keen after anything said dr may i pity him existence seems hard work to him  we shall have baby calling him the detestable next said ethel what a famous set down she gave him  she is a thorough lady and allows no liberties said dr may  ah said margaret it is a proof of what i want to impression you we really must leave off calling her daisy when strangers are there  it is so much nicer pleaded mary  the very reason said margaret fondling names should be kept for our innermost selves not spread abroad and made common i remember when i used to be called pegtopand flora flossywe were never allowed to use the names when any visitor was near and we were asked if we could not be as fond of each other by our proper names i think it was felt that there was a want of reserve in publishing our pet words to other people  quite true said dr may babynames never ought to go beyond home it is the fashion to use them now and besides the folly it seems to me an absolute injury to a girl to let her grow up with a nickname attached to her  ay chimed in norman i hear men talking of henny and loo and the like and you cant think how glad i have been that my sisters could not be known by any absurd word  it is a case where selfrespect would make others behave properly said flora  true said dr may but if girls wont keep up their own dignity their friends duty is to do it for them the mischief is in the intimate friends who blazon the words to every one  and then they call one formal for trying to protect the right name said flora it is onehalf of it silliness and the other affectation of intimacy  now i know said mary why you are so careful to call meta miss rivers to all the people here  i should hope so cried norman indignantly  why yes mary said margaret i should hope ladylike feelings would prevent you from calling her meta before  the andersons cried ethel laughing margaret was just going to say it we only want harry to exact the forfeit poor dear little hummingbird it gives one an oppression on the chest to think of her having that great donothing brother on her hands all day  thank you said norman i shall know where i am not to look when i want a sister  ay said ethel when you come yawning to me to find amusement for you you will see what i shall do  stand over me with a stick while i print a b c for cocksmoor i suppose said norman  well why not people are much better doing something than nothing  what you wont even let me blow bubbles said norman  that is too intellectual as papa makes it said ethel by the bye norman she added as she had now walked with him a little apart it always was a bubble of mine that you should try for the newdigate prize ha as the colour rushed into his cheeks you really have begun  i could not help it when i heard the subject given out for next year our old friend decius mus  have you finished  by no means but it brought a world of notions into my head such as i could not but set down now ethel do oblige me do write another as we used in old times  i had better not said ethel standing thoughtful if i throw myself into it i shall hate everything else and my wits will be woolgathering i have neither time nor poetry enough  you used to write english verse  i was cured of it  how  i wanted money for cocksmoor and after persuading papa i got leave to send a ballad about a little girl and a white rose to that school magazine i dont think papa liked it but there were some verses that touched him and one had seen worse it was actually inserted and i was in high feather till oh norman imagine richard getting hold of this unlucky thing without a notion where it came from margaret put it before him to see what he would say to it  i am afraid it was not like a young ladys anonymous composition in a story  by no means imagine ritchie picking my poor metaphors to pieces and weighing every sentimental line and all in his dear old simplicity because he wanted to understand it seeing that margaret liked it he had not the least intention of hurting my feelings but never was i so annihilated i thought he was doing it on purpose till i saw how distressed he was when he found it out and worse than all was his saying at the end that he supposed it was very fine but he could not understand it  let me see it  some time or other but let me see decius  did you give up verses because richard could not understand them  no because i had other fish to fry and i have not given them up altogether i do scrabble down things that tease me by running in my head when i want to clear my brains and know what i mean but i cant do it without sitting up at night and that stupefies me before breakfast and as to making bubbles of them ritchie has cured me of that  it is a pity said norman  nonsense let me see decius i know he is splendid  i wish you would have tried for all my best ideas are stolen from you  ethel prevailed by following her brother to his room and perching herself on the windowsill while he read his performance from many slips of paper the visions of those boyish days had not been forgotten the vesuvius scenery was much as ethel had once described it but with far more force and beauty there was deciuss impassioned address to the beauteous land he was about to leave and the remembrances of his roman hearth his farm his children whom he quitted for the pale shadows of an uncertain elysium there was a great hiatus in the middle and norman had many more authorities to consult but the summingup was nearly complete and ethel thought the last lines grand as they spoke of the noble consuls name living for evermore added to the examples that nerve ardent souls to devote life and all that is precious to the call of duty fame is not their object she may crown their pale brows but for the good of others not their own a beacon light to the world self is no object of theirs and it is the casting self behind that winsnot always the visible earthly strife but the combat between good and evil they are the true victors and whether chronicled or forgotten true glory rests on their heads the sole true glory that man can attain namely the reflected beams that crown them as shadowy types of him whom decius knew notthe prince who gave himself for his people and thus rendered death for truths sake the highest boon to mortal man  norman you must finish it when will it be given in  next spring if at all but keep the secret ethel i cannot have my fathers hopes raised  ill tell you of a motto said ethel do you remember mrs hemans mention of a saying of sir walter scottnever let me hear that brave blood has been shed in vain it sends a roaring voice down through all time  if said norman rather ashamed of the enthusiasm which almost approaching to the socalled funny state of his younger days had trembled in his voice and kindled his eyeif you wont let me put nascitur ridiculus mus  too obvious said ethel depend upon it every undergraduate has thought of it already  ethel was always very happy over normans secrets and went about smiling over decius and comparing her brother with such a one as poor meta was afflicted with wasting some superfluous pity and contempt on the weary weight that was inflicted on the grange  what do you think of me said margaret one afternoon i have had mr george rivers here for two hours  alone what could bring him here  i told him that every one was out but he chose to sit down and seemed to be waiting  how could you get on  oh we asked a few questions and brought out remarks with great difficulty at long intervals he asked me if lying here was not a great nuisance and at last he grew tired of twisting his moustache and went away  i trust it was a call to take leave  no he thinks he shall sell out for the army is a great nuisance  you seem to have got into his confidence  yes he said he wanted to settle down but living with ones father was such a nuisance  by the bye cried ethel laughing margaret it strikes me that this is a dumbiedikes courtship  of yourself said margaret slyly  no of flora you know she has often met him at the grange and other places and she does contrive to amuse him and make him almost animated i should not think he found her a great nuisance  poor man i am sorry for him said margaret  oh rejection will be very good for him and give him something to think of  flora will never let it come to that said margaret but not one word about it ethel  margaret and etheldred kept their eyes open and sometimes imagined sometimes laughed at themselves for their speculations and so october began and ethel laughed as she questioned whether the grange would feel the hussars return to his quarters as much as home would the departure of their scholar for balliol     chapter vi         so lady flora take my lay        and if you find a meaning there      oh whisper to your glass and say        what wonder if he thinks me fairtennyson   flora and norman were dining with one of their county acquaintance and dr may had undertaken to admit them on their return the fire shone red and bright as it sank calmly away and the timepiece and clock on the stairs had begun their nightly duet of ticking the crickets chirped in the kitchen and the doctor sat alone his book lay with unturned pages as he sat musing with eyes fixed on the fire living over again his own life the easy bright days of his youth when without much pains on his own part the tendencies of his generous affectionate disposition and the influences of a warm friendship and an early attachment had guarded him from evilthen the period when he had been perfectly happy and the sobering power of his position had been gradually working on him but though always religious and highly principled the very goodness of his natural character preventing him from perceiving the need of selfcontrol until the shock that changed the whole tenor of his life and left him for the first time sensible of his own responsibility but with inveterate habits of heedlessness and hastiness that love alone gave him force to combat he was now a far gentler man his younger children had never seen his elder had long since forgotten his occasional bursts of temper but he suffered keenly from their effects especially as regarded some of his children though richards timidity had been overcome and toms more serious failures had been remedied he was not without anxiety and had a strange unsatisfactory feeling as regarded flora he could not feel that he fathomed her she reminded him of his old scottish fatherinlaw professor mackenzie whom he had never understood nor if the truth were known liked her dealings with the ladies committee were so like her grandfathers canny ways in a public meeting that he laughed over thembut they were not congenial to him flora was a most valuable person all that she undertook prospered and he depended entirely on her for household affairs and for the care of margaret but highly as he esteemed her he was a little afraid of her cool prudence she never seemed to be in any need of him nor to place any confidence in him and seemed altogether so much older and wiser than he could feel himselfpretty girl as she wasand very pretty were her fine blue eyes and clear skin set off by her dark brown hair there arose the vision of eyes as blue skin as clear but of light blonde locks and shorter rounder more dovelike form open simple loving face and serene expression that had gone straight to his heart when he first saw maggie mackenzie making tea  he heard the wheels and went out to unbolt the door those were a pair for a father to be proud ofnorman of fine stature and noble looks with his high brow clear thoughtful eye and grave intellectual eagle face lighting into animation with his rare sweet smile and flora so tall and graceful and in her white dress picturesquely half concealed by her mantle with flowers in her hair and a deepened colour in her cheek was a fair vision as she came in from the darkness  well was it a pleasant party  norman related the circumstances while his sister remained silently leaning against the mantelpiece looking into the fire until he took up his candle and bade them goodnight dr may was about to do the same when she held out her hand one moment if you please dear papa she said i think you ought to know it  what my dear  mr george rivers papa  ha said dr may beginning to smile so that is what he is at is it but what an opportunity to take  it was in the conservatory said flora a little hurt as her father discovered by her tone the music was going on and i dont know that there could have been  a better opportunity eh said dr may laughing well i should have thought it awkward was he very much discomposed  i thought said flora looking down and hesitating that he had better come to you  indeed so you shifted the ungracious office to me i am very glad to spare you my dear but it was hard on him to raise his hopes  i thought faltered flora that you could not disapprove  flora and he paused completely confounded while his daughter was no less surprised at the manner in which her news was received each waited for the other to speak and flora turned away resting her head against the mantelpiece  surely said he laying his hand on her shoulder you do not mean that you like this man  i did not think that you would be against it said flora in a choked voice her face still averted  heaven knows i would not be against anything for your happiness my dear he answered but have you considered what it would be to spend your life with a man that has not three ideas not a resource for occupying himselfa regular prey to ennuione whom you could never respect he had grown more and more vehement and flora put her handkerchief to her eyes for tears of actual disappointment were flowing  come come he said touched but turning it off by a smile we will not talk of it any more tonight it is your first offer and you are flattered but we know               colours seen by candlelight               will not bear the light of day  there goodnight flora my dearwe will have ateteatete in the study before breakfast when you have had time to look into your own mind  he kissed her affectionately and went upstairs with her stopping at her door to give her another embrace and to say bless you my dear child and help you to come to a right decision  flora was disappointed she had been too highly pleased at her conquest to make any clear estimation of the prize individually considered her vanity magnified her achievement and she had come home in a flutter of pleasure at having had such a position in society offered to her and expecting that her whole family would share her triumph gratified by george riverss admiration she regarded him with favour and complacency and her habit of considering herself as the most sensible person in her sphere made her so regard his appreciation of her that she was blinded to his inferiority it must be allowed that he was less dull with her than with most others  and in the midst of her glory when she expected her father to be delighted and gratefulto be received as a silly girl ready to accept any proposal her lover spoken of with scorn and the advantages of the match utterly passed over was almost beyond endurance a physician with eleven children dependent on his practice to despise an offer from the heir of such a fortune but that was his customary romance she forgave him when it occurred to her that she was too important and valuable to be easily spared and a tenderness thrilled through her as she looked at the sleeping margarets pale face and thought of surrendering her and little daisy to ethels keeping and what would become of the housekeeping she decided however that feelings must not sway herout of six sisters some must marry for the good of the rest blanche and daisy should come and stay with her to be formed by the best society and as to poor dear ethel mrs rivers would rule the ladies committee for her with a high hand and perhaps provide cocksmoor with a school at her sole expense what a useful admirable woman she would be the doctor would be the person to come to his senses in the morning when he remembered abbotstoke mr rivers and meta  so flora met her father the next morning with all her ordinary composure in which he could not rival her after his sleepless anxious night his looks of affectionate solicitude disconcerted what she had intended to say and she waited with downcast eyes for him to begin  well flora he said at last have you thought  do you know any cause against it said flora still looking down  i know almost nothing of him i have never heard anything of his character or conduct those would be a subject of inquiry if you wish to carry this on  i see you are averse said flora i would do nothing against your wishes  my wishes have nothing to do with it said dr may the point isthat i must do right as far as i can as well as try to secure your happiness and i want to be sure that you know what you are about  i know he is not clever said flora but there may be many solid qualities without talent  i am the last person to deny it but where are these solid qualities i cannot see the recommendation  i place myself in your hands said flora in a submissive tone which had the effect of making him lose patience  flora flora why will you talk as if i were sacrificing you to some dislike or prejudice of my own dont you think i should only rejoice to have such a prosperous home offered to you if only the man were worthy  if you do not think him so of course there is an end of it said flora and her voice showed suppressed emotion  it is not what i think in the absence of proof but what you think flora what i want you to do is thisto consider the matter fairly compare him withill not say with normanbut with richard alan mr wilmot do you think you could rely on himcome to him for advice flora never did come to any one for advice above alldo you think him likely to be a help or a hindrance in doing right  i think you underrate him said flora steadily but of course if you dislike itthough i think you would change your mind if you knew him better  well he said as if to himself it is not always the most worthy then continued i have no dislike to him perhaps i may find that you are right since your mind is made up i will do this first we must be assured of his fathers consent for they may very fairly object since what i can give you is a mere nothing to them next i shall find out what character he bears in his regiment and watch him well myself and if nothing appear seriously amiss i will not withhold my consent but flora you should still consider whether he shows such principle and right feeling as you can trust to  thank you papa i know you will do all that is kind  mind you must not consider it an engagement unless all be satisfactory  i will do as you please  ethel perceived that something was in agitation but the fact did not break upon her till she came to margaret after the schoolroom reading and heard dr may declaiming away in the vehement manner that always relieved him  such a cub these were the words that met her ear and she would have gone away but he called her come in ethel margaret says you guessed at this affair  at what affair exclaimed ethel oh it is about flora poor man has he done it  poor he is not the one to be pitied said her father  you dont mean that she likes him  she does though a fellow with no more brains than a turnip lantern  she does not mean it said ethel  yes she does very submissive and proper spoken of course but bent on having him so there is nothing left for me but to consentprovided mr rivers does and he should turn out not to have done anything outrageous but theres no hope of thathe has not the energy what can possess her what can she see to admire  he is goodnatured said margaret and rather goodlooking  flora has more sense what on earth can be the attraction  i am afraid it is partly the grandeur said ethel she broke off short quite dismayed at the emotion she had excited dr may stepped towards her almost as if he could have shaken her  ethel he cried i wont have such motives ascribed to your sister  ethel tried to recollect what she had said that was so shocking for the idea of floras worldly motives was no novelty to her they had appeared in too many instances and though frightened at his anger she stood still without unsaying her words  margaret began to explain away ethel did not mean dear papa  no said dr may his passionate manner giving way to dejection the truth is that i have made home so dreary that my girls are ready to take the first means of escaping  poor margarets tears sprang forth and looking up imploringly she exclaimed oh papa papa it was no want of happiness i could not help it you know he had come before  any reproach to her had been entirely remote from his thoughts and he was at once on his knee beside her soothing and caressing begging her pardon and recalling whatever she could thus have interpreted meanwhile ethel stood unnoticed and silent making no outward protestation but with lips compressed as in her heart of hearts she passed the resolutionthat her father should never feel this pain on her account leave him who might she would never forsake him nothing but the will of heaven should part them it might be hasty and venturesome she knew not what it might cost her but where ethel had treasured her resolve to work for cocksmoor there she also laid up her secret vowthat no earthly object should be placed between her and her father  the ebullition of feeling seemed to have restored dr mays calmness and he rose saying i must go to my work the man is coming here this afternoon  where shall you see him margaret asked  in my study i suppose i fear there is no chance of floras changing her mind first or do you think one of you could talk to her and get her fairly to contemplate the real bearings of the matter and with these words he left the room  margaret and ethel glanced at each other and both felt the impenetrability of floras nature so smooth that all thrusts glided off  it will be of no use said ethel and what is more she will not have it done  pray try a few of your forcible words would set it in a new light  why do you think she will attend to me when she has not chosen to heed papa said ethel with an emphasis of incredulity no whatever flora does is done deliberately and unalterably  still i dont know whether it is not our duty said margaret  more yours than mine said ethel  margaret flushed up oh no i cannot she said always timid and slightly defective in moral courage she looked so nervous and shaken by the bare idea of a remonstrance with flora that ethel could not press her and though convinced that her representation would be useless she owned that her conscience would rest better after she had spoken but there is flora walking in the garden with norman she said no doubt he is doing it  so ethel let it rest and attended to the childrens lessons during which flora came into the drawingroom and practised her music as if nothing had happened  before the morning was over ethel contrived to visit norman in the diningroom where he was wont to study and asked him whether he had made any impression on flora  what impression do you mean  why about this concern said ethel this terrible man that makes papa so unhappy  papa unhappy why what does he know against him i thought the riverses were his peculiar pets  the riverses as if because one liked the sparkling stream one must like a muddy ditch  what harm do you know of him said norman with much surprise and anxiety as if he feared that he had been doing wrong in ignorance  harm is he not a regular oaf  my dear ethel if you wait to marry till you find some one as clever as yourself you will wait long enough  i dont think it right for a woman to marry a man decidedly her inferior  we have all learned to think much too highly of talent said norman gravely  i dont care for mere talentpeople are generally more sensible without it but one way or other there ought to be superiority on the mans side  well who says there is not  my dear norman why this george rivers is really below the average you cannot deny that did you ever meet any one so stupid  really said norman considering and speaking very innocently i cannot see why you think so i do not see that he is at all less capable of sustaining a conversation than richard  ethel sat down perfectly breathless with amazement and indignation  norman saw that he had shocked her very much i do not mean he said that we have not much more to say to richard all i meant to say was merely as to the intellect  i tell you said ethel it is not the intellect richard why you know how we respect and look up to him dear old ritchie with his goodness and earnestness and right judgmentto compare him to that man norman norman i never thought it of you  you do not understand me ethel i only cited richard as a person who proves how little cleverness is needed to insure respect  and i tell you that cleverness is not the point  it is the only objection you have put forward  i did wrong said ethel it is not the real one it is earnest goodness that one honours in richard where do we find it in this man who has never done anything but yawn over his self indulgence  now ethel you are working yourself up into a state of foolish prejudice you and papa have taken a dislike to him and you are overlooking a great deal of good safe sense and right thinking i know his opinions are sound and his motives right he has been undereducated we all see and is not very brilliant or talkative but i respect flora for perceiving his solid qualities  very solid and weighty indeed said ethel ironically i wonder if she would have seen them in a poor curate  ethel you are allowing yourself to be carried by prejudice a great deal too far are such imputations to be made wherever there is inequality of means it is very wrong very unjust  so papa said replied ethel as she looked sorrowfully down he was very angry with me for saying so i wish i could help feeling as if that were the temptation  you ought said norman you will be sorry if you set yourself and him against it  i only wish you to know what i feel and i think margaret and papa do said ethel humbly and then you will not think us more unjust than we are we cannot see anything so agreeable or suitable in this man as to account for floras liking and we do not feel convinced of his being good for much that makes papa greatly averse to it though he does not know any positive reason for refusing and we cannot feel certain that she is doing quite right or for her own happiness  you will be convinced said norman cheerfully you will find out the good that is under the surface when you have seen more of him i have had a good deal of talk with him  a good deal of talk to him would have been more correct if norman had but been aware of it he had been at the chief expense of the conversation with george rivers and had taken the sounds of assent which he obtained as evidences of his appreciation of all his views norman had been struggling so long against his old habit of looking down on richard and exalting intellect and had seen in his oxford life so many illeffects of the knowledge that puffeth up that he had come to have a certain respect for dullness per se of which george rivers easily reaped the benefit when surrounded by the halo which everything at abbotstoke grange bore in the eyes of norman  he was heartily delighted at the proposed connection and his genuine satisfaction not only gratified flora and restored the equanimity that had been slightly disturbed by her father but it also reassured ethel and margaret who could not help trusting in his judgment and began to hope that george might be all he thought him  ethel finding that there were two ways of viewing the gentleman doubted whether she ought to express her opinion it was floras disposition and the advantages of the match that weighed most upon her and in spite of her surmise having been treated as so injurious she could not rid herself of the burden  dr may was not so much consoled by normans opinion as ethel expected the corners of his mouth curled up a little with diversion and though he tried to express himself glad and confident in his sons judgment there was the same sort of involuntary lurking misgiving with which he had accepted sir matthew fleets view of margarets case  there was no danger that dr may would not be kind and courteous to the young man himself it was not his fault if he were a dunce and dr may perceived that his love for flora was real though clumsily expressed he explained that he could not sanction the engagement till he should be better informed of the young gentlemans antecedents this was as george expressed it a great nuisance but his father agreed that it was quite right in some doubt perhaps as to how dr may might be satisfied     chapter vii         ye cumbrous fashions crowd not on my head      mine be the chip of purest white      swanlike and as her feathers light      when on the still wave spread      and let it wear the graceful dress      of unadorned simpleness                             catherine fanshaws parody on grey   nothing transpired to the discredit of lieutenant rivers he had spent a great deal of money but chiefly for want of something else to do and though he was not a subject for high praise there was no vice in himno more than in an old donkeyas dr may declared in his concluding paroxysm of despair on finding that though there was little to reconcile him to the engagement there was no reasonable ground for thwarting his daughters wishes he argued the matter once more with her and finding her purpose fixed he notified his consent and the rest of the family were admitted to a knowledge of the secret which they had never suspected  etheldred could not help being gratified with the indignation it excited with one voice mary and blanche declared that they would never give up the title of the detestable and would not make him any presents certainly not watchchains miss bracy rather alarmed lectured them just enough to make them worse and margaret overhearing blanche instructing aubrey in her own impertinences was obliged to call her to her sofa and assure her that she was unkind to flora and that she must consider mr george rivers as her brother  never my brother like harry exclaimed mary indignantly  no indeed nor like alan exclaimed blanche and i wont call him george i am determined if it is ever so  it will not matter to him what such little girls call him said margaret  blanche was so annihilated that the sound of a carriage and of the door bell was a great satisfaction to her  meta rivers came flying into the room her beautiful eyes dancing and her cheeks glowing with pleasure as a little timidly she kissed margaret while ethel in a confused way received mr rivers in pain for her own cold abrupt manner in contrast with his gentle congratulating politeness  meta asked blushing and with a hesitating voice for their dear flora mary offered to call her but meta begged to go herself and thus was spared the awkwardness that ensued ethel was almost vexed with herself as ungrateful when she saw mr rivers so mildly kind and so delighted with the bland courtesy that seemed fully conscious of the favour that flora had conferred on his son and thankful to the mays for accepting him  margaret answered with more expression of gratification than would have been sincere in ethel but it was a relief when flora and meta came in together as pretty a contrast as could be seen the little darkeyed fairy all radiant with joy clinging to the slender waist of flora whose quiet grace and maidenly dignity were never more conspicuous than as with a soft red mantling in her fair cheek her eyes cast down but with a simple unaffected warmth of confidence and gratitude she came forward to receive mr riverss caressing affectionate greeting  stiffness was over when she came in and dr may who presently made his appearance soon was much more at his ease than could have been hoped after his previous declarations that he should never be able to be moderately civil about it to mr rivers people of ready sympathy such as dr may and margaret have a great deal of difficulty with their sincerity spared them by being carried along with the feelings of others ethel could not feel the same and was bent on avoiding any expression of opinion she hoped that metas ecstasies would all be bestowed upon her future sisterinlaw but meta was eager for an interview with ethel herself and as usual gained her point  now then you are property of my own she cried may i not take you all for sisters  ethel had not thought of this as a convenience of the connection and she let meta kiss her and owned that it was very nice  ethel said meta i see and i wanted to talk to you you dont think poor george good enough for flora  i never meant to show it said ethel  you need not mind said meta smiling i was very much surprised myself and thought it all a mistake but i am so very glad for i know it will make such a difference to him poor fellow i should like to tell you all about him for no one else can very well and you will like him better perhaps you know my grandfather made his own fortune and you would think some of our relations very queer my aunt dorothy once told me all about itpapa was made to marry the partners daughter and i fancy she could not have been much of a lady i dont think he could have been very happy with her but she soon died and left him with this one son whom those odd old aunts brought up their own way by and by you know papa came to be in quite another line of society but when he married again poor george had been so spoiled by these aunts and was so big and old that my mother did not know what to make of him  a great lubberly boy ethel said rather repenting the next moment  he is thirteen years older than i am said meta and you see it has been hard on him altogether he had not the education that papa would have given him if he had been born later and he cant remember his mother and has always been at a loss when with clever people i never understood it till within the last two or three years nor knew how trying it must be to see such a little chit as me made so much ofalmost thrusting him aside but you cannot think what a warmhearted good fellow he ishe has never been otherwise than so very kind to me and he was so very fond of his old aunt hitherto he has had such disadvantages and no real sensible woman has taken him in hand he does not care for papas tastes and i am so much younger that i never could get on with him at all till this time but i do know that he has a real good temper and all sorts of good qualities and that he only needs to be led right to go right oh flora may make anything of him and we are so thankful to her for having found it out  thank you for telling me said ethel it is much more satisfactory to have no shamming  meta laughed for ethels sham was not too successful she continued dear dr may i thought he would think his beautiful flora not exactly matchedbut tell him ethel for if he once is sorry for poor george he will like him and it will really be the making of george to be thrown with him and your brothers oh we are so glad but i wont tease you to be so  i can like it better now said ethel you know norman thinks very highly of your brother and declares that it will all come out by and by  meta clapped her hands and said that she should tell her father and ethel parted with her liking her at least better than ever there was a comical scene between her and the doctor trying to define what relations they should become to each other which ethel thought did a good deal to mollify her father  the history of georges life did more he took to pitying him and pity was indeed akin to love in the good doctors mind in fact george was a man who could be liked when once regarded as a belonginga necessity not a choice for it was quite true that there was no harm in him and a great deal of good nature his constant kindness and evident liking for margaret stood him in good stead he made her a sort of confidante bestowing on her his immeasurable appreciation of floras perfections and telling her how well he was getting on with the old gentlemana name under which she failed to recognise her father  as to tom he wrote his congratulations to ethel that she might make a wedding present of her etruscan vases the cupids on which must have been put there by anticipation richard heard none of the doubts and gave kind warm congratulations promising to return home for the wedding and mary and blanche no sooner heard a whisper about bridesmaids than all their opposition faded away in a manner that quite scandalised ethel while it set margaret on reminiscences of her having been a sixyearold bridesmaid to floras godmother mrs arnott  as to the gossip in the town ethel quite dreaded the sight of every one without flora to protect her and certainly floras unaffected quiet manner was perfection and kept off all too forward congratulations while it gratified those whom she was willing to encourage  there was no reason for waiting and mr rivers was as impatient as his son so an understanding arose that the wedding should take place near the end of the christmas holidays  flora showed herself sensible and considerate always openhanded her father was inclined to do everything liberally and laid no restrictions on her preparations but she had too much discretion to be profuse and had a real regard for the welfare of the rest she laughed with ethel at the anticipations of the stoneborough ladies that she must be going to london and at the requests as a great favour that they might be allowed the sight of her trousseau her weddingdress white silk with a white cashmere mantle was indeed ordered from metas london dressmaker but for the rest she contented herself with an expedition to whitford accompanied by miss bracy and her two enchanted pupils and there laid in a stock of purchases unpretending and in good taste aiming only at what could be well done and not attempting the decorative wardrobe of a great lady ethel was highly amused when the misses anderson came for their inspection to see their concealed disappointment at finding no under garments trimmed with brussels lace nor pockethandkerchiefs all openwork except a centre of the size of a crownpiece and the only thing remarkable was margarets beautiful marking in embroidery there was some compensation in the costly wedding presentsflora had reaped a whole harvest from friends of her own grateful patients of her father and the whole rivers and langdale connection but in spite of the brilliant uselessness of most of these the young ladies considered themselves illused thought dr may never would have been shabby and were of opinion that when miss ward had married her fathers surgical pupil her outfit had been a far more edifying spectacle  the same moderation influenced floras other arrangements dr may was resigned to whatever might be thought most proper stipulating only that he should not have to make a speech but flora felt that in their house a grand breakfast would be an unsuccessful and melancholy affair if the bride had been any one else she could have enjoyed making all go off well but under present circumstances it would be great pain to her father and margaret a misery to ethel and something she dared not think of to the guests she had no difficulty in having it dispensed with george was glad to avoid a great nuisance mr rivers feared the fatigue and with his daughter admired flora for her amiability and as to the home party no words could express their gratitude to her for letting them off mary and blanche did indeed look rather blank but blanche was consoled by settling with hector the splendours in store for alan and margaret and mary cared the less as there would be no harry to enjoy the fun  the bridemaidens glory was theirs by right though ethel was an unsatisfactory chief for such as desired splendour she protested against anything incongruous with january or that could not be useful afterwards and meta took her part laughing at the cruel stroke they were preparing for bellairs ethel begged for dark silks and straw bonnets and flora said that she had expected to hear of brown stuff and gray duffle but owned that they had better omit the ordinary muslin garb in the heart of winter the baby bridesmaid was at last the chief consideration margaret suggested how pretty she and blanche would look in skyblue merino trimmed with swansdown meta was charmed with the idea and though ethel stuck out her shoulderblades and poked out her head and said she should look like the ugly duckling she was clamorously reminded that the ugly duckling ended by being a swan and promised that she should be allowed a bonnet of a reasonable size trimmed with white for mr riverss good taste could endure as little as dr mays sense of propriety the sight of a daughter without shade to her face ethel finally gave in on being put in mind that her papa had a penchant for swansdown and on margarets promising to wear a dress of the same as theirs  ethel was pleased and satisfied by floras dislike of parade and attention to the feelings of all passing over the one great fact the two sisters were more of one mind than usual probably because all latent jealousy of ethel had ceased in floras mind hitherto she had preferred the being the only practically useful person in the family and had encouraged the idea of ethels gaucherie but now she desired to render her sister able to take her place and did all in her power to put her in good heart  for etheldred was terrified at the prospect of becoming responsible housekeeper margaret could only serve as an occasional reference her morning powers became too uncertain to be depended on for any regular necessary duty and it would have oppressed her so much to order the dinners which she never saw that though she offered to resume the office flora would not hear of ethels consenting if it were her proper business ethel supposed she could do it but another hour of her leisure was gone and what would become of them all with her a proverb for heedlessness and ignorance of ordinary details she did not know that these were more proverbial than actual and having a bad name she believed in it herself however flora made it her business to persuade her that her powers were as good for household matters as for books or cocksmoor instructed her in her own methodical plans and made her keep house for a fortnight with so much success that she began to be hopeful  in the attendance on margaret the other great charge old nurse was the security and ethel who had felt her self much less unhandy than before was to succeed to the abode in her roomblanche being promoted from the nursery to the old attic and said flora consolingly if dear margaret ever should be ill you may reckon on me  miss flora may made her last appearance at the ladies committee to hear the reply from the principal of the college it was a civil letter but declined taking any steps in the matter without more certain intelligence of the wishes of the incumbent of the parish or of the holders of the land in question  the ladies abused all collegesas prejudiced old bodies and feared that it would be impossible to ask mrs perkinsons niece to take the school while there was neither room nor lodging so miss rich recorded the correspondence and the vote of censure by which it was to be hoped the ladies committee of market stoneborough inflicted a severe blow on the principal and fellows of m college  never mind ethel said flora i shall meet sir henry walkinghame in london and will talk to him we shall yet astonish the muses if we can get the land without them we shall be able to manage it our own way without obligations  you forget the money  we will keep them from dissipating itor that might be no harm a hundred pounds will be easily found and we should then have it in our own hands besides you know i dont mean to give up i shall write a polite note to mrs ledwich begging to subscribe on my own account and to retain my seat and you will see what we shall do  you mean to come down with the external authority said ethel smiling  true and though my driving in with a pair of horses may make little difference to you ethel depend upon it mrs ledwich will be the more amenable whenever i want to be particularly impressive i shall bring in that smellingbottle with the diamond stopper that wont come out and you will find that carries all before it  a talisman said ethel laughing but i had rather they yielded to a sense of right  so had i said flora perhaps you will rule them that way  not i cried ethel terrified  then you must come to me and secondary motives seriouslyi do mean that george should do something for stoneborough and in a position of influence i hope to be able to be useful to my poor old town perhaps we shall have the minster restored  flora did wish it she did love stoneborough and was sincerely interested for cocksmoor she thought she worked earnestly for them and that her situation would be turned to their profit but there was something for which she worked more earnestly had flora never heard of the two masters whom we cannot serve at the same time  richard came home for a parsons week so as to include the wedding he looked very fresh and youthful but his manner though still gentle and retiring had lost all that shrinking diffidence and had now a very suitable grave composure everybody was delighted to have him and ethel more than any one except margaret what floods of cocksmoor histories were poured upon him and what comparing of notes about his present schoolchildren he could not enter into the refinements of her dread of the ladies committee and thought she might be thankful if the school were built by any proper means for if cherry elwood were retained and the ladies prevented from doing harm he did not understand why ethel should wish to reject all assistance that did not come in a manner she admired he never would comprehendso ethel gave it upfeared she was again jealous and selfsufficient and contented herself with the joy that his presence produced at cocksmoor where the children smiled blushed and tittered with ecstasy whenever he even looked at one of them  richard was not allowed to have a sunday of rest his father apologised for having made an engagement for himas mr ramsden was unwell and the school clergy were all absent so that he could do no otherwise than assist in the service richard coloured and said that he had brought no sermon and he was in fact deprived of much of his sisters company for composition was not easy to him and the quantity of time he spent on it quite alarmed norman and ethel who both felt rather nervous on the sunday morning but agreed that preaching was not everything  ethel could not see well as far as the readingdesk but she saw her father glance up take off his spectacles wipe them and put them away and she could not be displeased though she looked reproof at blanches breathless whisper oh he looks so nice those white folds did truly suit well with the meek serious expression of the young deacons fair face and made him as his sisters afterwards said like one of the solemnly peaceful angelcarvings of the earlier ages  his voice was sweet and clear and his reading full of quiet simplicity and devotion such as was not often heard by that congregation who were too much used either to carelessness or to pomposity the sermon made his brother and sister ashamed of their fears it was an exposition of the gospel for the day practical and earnest going deep and rising high with a clearness and soberness yet with a beauty and elevation such as norman and ethel had certainly not expectedor rather they forgot all their own expectations and richard himself and only recollected their own hearts and the great future before them  even blanche and aubrey told margaret a great deal about it and declared that if richard preached every sunday they should like going to church much better  when dr may came in some time after he was looking much pleased so mr ritchie he said you have made quite a sensationevery one shaking me by the hand and thanking me for my sons sermon you will be a popular preacher at last  richard blushed distressfully and quoted the saying that it would be the true comfort to hear that people went home thinking of themselves rather than of the sermon this put an end to the subject but the doctor went over it again most thoroughly with his other children who were greatly delighted  floras last home sunday she was pale and serious evidently feeling much though seeking no teteatetes and chiefly engrossed with waiting on margaret or fondling little gertrude no one saw the inside of her mindprobably she did not herself on the outside was a very suitable pensiveness and affection for all that she was leaving the only one in the family to whom she talked much was norman who continued to see many perfections in george and contrived by the force of his belief to impress the same on the others and to make them think his great talent for silence such a proof of his discretion that they were not staggered even by his shy blundering exclamation that his wedding would be a great nuisancea phrase which as dr may observed was to him what estilpossible was to his namesake of denmark  nobody wished for any misgivings so richard was never told of any though there was a careful watch kept to see what were his first impressions none transpired except something about good nature but it was shrewdly believed that richard and george being much alike in shy unwillingness to speak had been highly satisfied with the little trouble they had caused to each other and so had come to a tacit esteem  there was very little bustle of preparation excepting the packing everything went on much as usual till the thursday morning and then the children were up early refreshing the christmas hollies and working up their excitement only to have it damped by the suppressed agitation of their elders at the breakfasttable  dr may did not seem to know what he was about and flora looked paler and paler she went away before the meal was over and when ethel went to the bedroom shortly after she found that she had fairly broken down and was kneeling beside margarets sofa resting her head on her sisters bosom and sobbingas ethel had never seen her weep except on that dreadful night after their mothers death  in a person ordinarily of such selfcommand as flora weeping was a terrible thing and margaret was much distressed and alarmed but the worst had passed before ethel came up and flora was able to speak oh margaret i cannot leave you oh how happy we have been  you are going to be happier we trust dearest said margaret fondly  oh what have i done it is not worth it  ethel thought she caught those words but no more marys step was heard and flora was on her feet instantly composing herself rapidly she shed no more tears but her eyelids were very heavy and her face softened in a manner that though she was less pretty than usual was very becoming under her bridal veil she recovered calmness and even cheerfulness while reversing the usual order of things and dressing her bridesmaids who would never have turned out fit to be seen but for the exertions of herself margaret and miss bracy ethels long scotch bones and marys round dumpy shapelessness were in their different ways equally hard to overcome and the one was swelled out with a fabulous number of petticoats and the other pinched in till she gasped and screamed for mercy while blanche and gertrude danced about beautiful to behold under their shady hats and presently with a light tap at the door meta rivers stepped in looking so pretty that all felt that to try to attain to such an appearance was vain  timid in her affection she hardly dared to do more than kiss them and whisper her pretty caressing words to each there was no more timedr hoxtons carriage was come to take up the bride  ethel did as she was told without much volition of her own and she quitted the carriage and was drawn into her place by norman trusting that meta would not let her do wrong and relieved that just in front of her were the little ones over whose heads she could see her father with floras veiled bending figure  that pause while the procession was getting into order the slow movement up the centre aisle the weekday atmosphere of the church brought back to her thoughts a very different time and one of those strange echoings on the mind repeated in her ears the words for man walketh in a vain shadow and disquieteth himself in vain  there was a little pausegeorge did not seem to be forthcoming and meta turned round rather uneasily and whispered something about his having been so nervous however there he was looking exceedingly red and very sheepish and disposed to fall back on his best man norman whose countenance was at the brightestand almost handsome  dr hoxton performed the ceremony assisted by richard it had been floras choice and his loud sonorous voice was thought very impressive blanche stood the nearest and looked happy and important with floras glove gertrude held marys hand and gazed straight up into the fretted roof as if that were to her the chief marvel ethel stood and knelt but did not seem to herself to have the power of thinking or feeling she saw and heardthat was all she could not realise  they drew her forward when it was over to sign her name as witness she took up the pen looked at the flora may written for the last time and found her hand so trembling that she said half smiling that she could not write mary was only too well pleased to supply the deficiency dr may looked at her anxiously and asked whether she felt overcome  no papa i did not know my hand was shaky  he took it into his and pressed it ethel knew then how much had been undeveloped in her own mind catching it as it were from his touch and look the thought of his past joythe sad fading of hope for margaretthe fear and doubt for their present brideabove all the sense that the fashion of this world passeth away and that it is not the outward scene but our bearing in it that is to last for ever  the bells struck up each peal ending with a crash that gave ethel some vague idea of fatality and they all came back to the house where margaret was ready in the drawingroom to receive them looking very pretty in her soft blue dress which especially became her fair complexion and light brown hair ethel did not quite like the pink colour on her cheeks and feared that she had been shaken by floras agitation in the morning but she was very calm and bright in the affectionate greeting with which she held out her hands to the bride and bridegroom as they came in  mr rivers and meta were the only guests and while meta was seized by the children margaret lay talking to mr rivers george standing upright and silent behind her sofa like a sentinel flora was gone to change her dress not giving way but nervous and hurried as she reiterated parting directions about household comforts to ethel who stood by the toilettetable sticking a pin into the pincushion and drawing it out again as if solely intent on making it always fit into the same hole while mary dressed flora packed flew about and was useful  as they came downstairs ethel found that flora was trembling from head to foot and leaning on her dr may stood at the foot of the stairs and folded his daughter in a long embrace flora gave herself up to it as if she would never bear to leave it did a flash come over her then what the father was whom she had held cheaply what was the worth of that for which she had exchanged such a home she spoke not a word she only clung tightlyif her heart failed herit was too late bless you my child he said at last only be what your mother was  a coming tread warned them to part there was a tray of luncheon for the two who were about to depart and the great snowwhite cake was waiting for flora to cut it she smiled accomplished that feat steadily and norman continuing the operation aubrey guided gertrude in handing round the slices george did full justice thereto as well as to the more solid viands flora could taste nothing but she contrived to smile and say it was too early she was in haste to have it over now and as soon as george had finished she rose up still composed and resolved the last kisses were givengertrude was lifted up to her after she was in the carriage for the very last when george proposed to run away with her also whereupon daisy kicked and screamed and was taken back in haste the door was shut and they drove off bound for the continent and then mary as if the contingency of losing flora had only for the first time occurred to her as the consequence of the wedding broke out into a piteous fit of sobbingrather too unrestrained considering her fourteen years  poor mary she was a very child still they pulled her into the study out of the way of mr rivers and meta had no sooner said how flora would soon come home and live at the grange and talked of the grand schoolfeast to which she was at once going to take her friends than the round rosy face drew out of its melancholy puckers into smiles as mary began to tell the delight caused by the invitations which she had conveyed that was to be a feast indeedall the abbotstoke childrenall floras class at stoneborough and as many cocksmoor scholars as could walk so far were to dine on christmas fare at one oclock at the grange and meta was in haste to be at home to superintend the feast  mary blanche and aubrey went with her under the keeping of miss bracy the boys were to follow she had hoped for ethel but on looking at her ceased her coaxing importunity  i see she said kindly even schoolchildren will not be so good for you as peace  thank you said ethel i should like to be quiet till the evening if you will let me off it is very kind in you  i ought to know how to pity you said meta i who have gained what you have lost  i want to think too said ethel it is the beginning to me of a new life and i have not been able to look at it yet  besides margaret will want you poor margarethas it been very trying to her  i fear so but i shall keep out of her way and leave her to a quiet afternoon with richard it will be the greatest treat to those two to be together  very well i will carry off the children and leave the house quiet  and quiet it was in another hourgertrude walking with the nurses dr may gone to his patients and all the rest at abbotstoke except richard and margaret downstairs and ethel who while arranging her properties in her new room had full leisure to lay out before herself the duties that had devolved on her and to grapple with them she recalled the many counsels that she had received from flora and they sounded so bewildering that she wished it had been conic sections and then she looked at a hebrew grammar that norman had given her and gave a sigh as she slipped it into the shelf of the seldom used she looked about the room cleared out the last piece of brown paper and burned the last torn envelope that no relic of packing and change might distress margarets eyes for order then feeling at once desolate and intrusive she sat down in floras fireside chair opened her desk and took out her last timetable she looked at it for some minutes laid it aside and rising knelt down again seating herself she resumed her paper took a blank one ruled it and wrote her rules for each hour of each day in the week that first hour after breakfast when hitherto she had been free was one sacrifice it must go now to ordering dinner seeing after stores watching over the childrens clothes and the other nondescripts which happily for her flora had already reduced to method the other loss was the spare time between the walk and tea she must not spend that in her own room now or there would be no one to sit with margaret or keep the little ones from being troublesome to her ethel had often had to give up this space before when flora went out in the evening and she had seldom felt otherwise than annoyed give it up for good that was the cure for temper but it had been valuable as something of her own she would have been thankful could she have hoped to keep regularly to her own rules but that she knew was utterly improbableboys holidays callers engagements dr may would all conspire to turn half her days upside down and cocksmoor itself must often depend not only on the weather but on home doings two or three notes she wrote at the foot of her paper     n b  these are a standardnot a bed of procrustes    muststo be first consultedmayslast  ethel mays           last of all           if i cannot do everythingomit the selfchosen    mem  neither hurry when it depends on myself           nor fidget when it depends on others    keep a book going to pacify myself   her rules drawn up ethel knelt once more then she drew a long sigh and wondered where flora was and next as she was fairly fagged mind and body she threw herself back in the armchair took up a railway novel that hector had brought home and which they had hidden from the children and repaired herself with the luxury of an idle reading  margaret and richard likewise spent a peaceful though pensive afternoon margaret had portions of letters from alan to read to him and a consultation to hold the hope of her full recovery had so melted away that she had in every letter striven to prepare mr ernescliffe for the disappointment and each that she received in return was so sanguine and affectionate that the very fondness was as much grief as joy she could not believe that he took in the true state of the case or was prepared to perceive that she could never be his wife and she wanted richard to write one of his clear dispassionate statements such as carried full conviction and to help to put a final end to the engagement  but why said richardwhy should you wish to distress him  because i cannot bear that he should be deceived and should feed on false hopes do you think it right richard  i will write to him if you like said richard but i think he must pretty well know the truth from all the letters to harry and to himself  it would be so much better for him to settle his mind at once said margaret  perhaps he would not think so  there was a pause while margaret saw that her brother was thinking at last he said margaret will you pardon me i do think that this is a little restlessness the truth has not been kept from him and i do not see that we are called to force it on him he is sensible and reasonable and will know how to judge when he comes home  it was to try to save him the pang murmured margaret  yes but it will be worse far away than near i do not mean that we should conceal the fact but you have no right to give him up before he comes home the whole engagement was for the time of his voyage  then you think i ought not to break it off before his return  certainly not  it will be pain sparedunless it should be worse by and by  i do not suppose we ought to look to by and by said richard  how so  do the clearly right thing for the present i mean he said without anxiety for the rest how do weany of usknow what may be the case in another year  do not flatter me with hopes said margaret sadly smiling i have had too many of them  no said richard i do not think you will ever get well but so much may happen  i had rather have my mind made up once for all and resign myself said margaret  his will is sometimes that we should be uncertain said richard  and that is the most trying said margaret  just so and he paused tenderly  i feel how much has been right said margaret this wedding has brought my real character before me i feel what i should have been you have no notion how excited and elated i can get about a little bit of dress out of the common way for myself or others said she smiling and then all the external show and things belonging to stationi naturally care much more for them than even flora does ethel would bear all those things as if they did not existi could not  they would be a temptation  they would once have been yes they would now said margaret and government and management and influenceyou would not guess what dreams i used to waste on them and now here am i set aside from it all good for nothing but for all you dear ones to be kind to  they would not say so said richard kindly  not say it but i feel it papa and ethel are all the world to each otherrichard i may say it to you there has been only one thing more hard to bear than thatdont suppose there was a moments neglect or disregard but when first i understood that ethel could be more to him than i then i could not always feel rightly it was the punishment for always wanting to be first  my father would be grieved that you had the notion you should not keep it  he does not know it is so said margaret i am his first care i fear his second grief but it is not in the nature of things that ethel should not be more his comfort and companion oh i am glad it was not she who married what shall we do when she goes  this came from margarets heart so as to show that if there had once been a jealous pang of mortification it had been healed by overflowing unselfish affection and humility  they went off to praise ethel and thence to praise norman and the elder brother and sister who might have had some jealousy of the superiority of their juniors spent a good happy hour in dwelling on the shining qualities they loved so heartily  and richard was drawn into talking of his own deeper thoughts and margaret had again the comfort of clerical counseland now from her own most dear brother so they sat till darkness closed in when ethel came down bringing gertrude and her great favour very full of chatter only not quite sure whether she had been bride bridesmaid or bridegroom  the schoolroom set with tom and aubrey came home soon after and tongues went fast with stories of roastbeef plumpudding and blindmansbuff how the dear meta had sent a cart to cocksmoor to bring cherry herself and how many slices everybody had eaten and how the brides health had been drunk by the children in real wine and how they had all played norman and all and how hector had made blanche bold enough to extract a raisin from the flaming snapdragon it was not half told when dr may came home and ethel went up to dress for her dinner at abbotstoke mary following to help her and continue her narration which bade fair to entertain margaret the whole evening  dr may richard and ethel had a comfortable dark drive to the grange and on arriving found hector deep in wild sports of the west while norman and meta were sitting over the fire talking and mr rivers was resting in his library  and when ethel and meta spent the time before the gentlemen came in from the diningroom in a happy teteatete ethel learned that the firelight dialogue had been the pleasantest part of the whole day and that meta had had confided to her the existence of decius musa secret which ethel had hitherto considered as her own peculiar property but she supposed it was a pledge of the sisterhood which meta professed with all the house of may     chapter viii         the rest all accepted the kind invitation      and much bustle it caused in the plumed creation      such ruffling of feathers such pruning of coats      such chirping such whistling such clearing of throats      such polishing bills and such oiling of pinions      had never been known in the biped dominions                                        peacock at home   etheldred was thankful for that confidence to meta rivers for without it she would hardly have succeeded in spurring norman up to give the finishing touches to decius and to send him in if she talked of the poem as the devotion of decius he was willing enough and worked with spirit for he liked the ideas and enjoyed the expressing them and trying to bring his lines to his notion of perfection but if she called it the newdigate or the prize poem and declared herself sure it would be successful he yawned slackened leaned back in his chair and began to read other peoples poetry which ethel was disrespectful enough not to think nearly as good as his own  it was completed at last and ethel stitched it up with a narrow red and white ribbonthe balliol colours and set meta at him till a promise was extorted that he would send it in  and in due time ethel received the following note   my dear ethel  my peacock bubble has flown over the house tell them all about it  your affectionate                                           n w m   they were too much accustomed to normans successes to be extraordinarily excited ethel would have been much mortified if the prize had been awarded to any one else but as it was it came rather as a matter of course the doctor was greatly pleased and said he should drive round by abbotstoke to tell the news there and then laughed beyond measure to hear that meta had been in the plot saying he should accuse the little hummingbird of being a magpie stealing secrets  by this time the bride and bridegroom were writing that they thought of soon returning they had spent the early spring at paris had wandered about in the south of france and now were at paris again floras letters were long descriptive and affectionate and she was eager to be kept fully informed of everything at home as soon as she heard of normans success she wrote a whole budget of letters declaring that she and george would hear of no refusal they were going to spend a fortnight at oxford for the commemoration and must have meta and ethel with them to hear normans poem in the theatre  dr may who already had expressed a hankering to run up for the day and take ethel with him was perfectly delighted at the proposal and so was mr rivers but the young ladies made many demurs ethel wanted mary to go in her stead and had to be told that this would not be by any means the same to the other partiesshe could not bear to leave margaret it was a long time since there had been letters from the alcestis and she did not like to miss being at home when they should come and meta on her side was so unwilling to leave her father that at last dr may scolded them both for a pair of conceited selfimportant damsels who thought nothing could go on without them and next compared them to young birds obliged to be shoved by force into flying  meta consented first on condition that ethel would and ethel found that her whole house would be greatly disappointed if she refused so she proceeded to be grateful and then discovered how extremely delightful the plan was oxford of which she had heard so much and which she had always wished to see and normans gloryand metas companynay the very holiday and going from home were charms enough for a girl of eighteen who had never been beyond whitford in her life besides to crown all papa promised that if his patients would behave well and not want him too much he would come up for the one great day  mr and mrs george rivers came to abbotstoke to collect their party they arrived by a railroad whose station was nearer to abbotstoke than to stoneborough therefore instead of their visiting the high street by the way dr may with ethel and mary were invited to dine at the grange the first eveninga proposal at least as new and exciting to mary as was the journey to oxford to her sister  the two girls went early as the travellers had intended to arrive before luncheon and though ethel said few words but let mary rattle on with a stream of conjectures and questions her heart was full of longings for her sister as well as of strange doubts and fears as to the change that her new life might have made in her  there there cried mary yes it is flora only she has her hair done in a funny way  flora and meta were both standing on the steps before the conservatory and mary made but one bound before she was hugging flora ethel kissed her without so much violence and then saw that flora was looking very well and bright more decidedly pretty and elegant than ever and with certainly no diminution of affection it was warmer though rather more patronising  how natural you look was her first exclamation as she held marys hand and drew ethels arm into hers and how is margaret  pretty wellbut the heat makes her languid  is there any letter yet  no  i do not see any cause for alarmletters are so often detained but of course she will be anxious has she had pain in the back again  sometimes but summer always does her good  i shall see her tomorrowand the daisy how do you all get on have you broken down yet ethel  oh we do go on said ethel smiling the worst thing i have done was expecting james to dress the salads with lampoil  a greenland salad but dont talk of oili have the taste still in my mouth after the pyrennean cookery oh ethel you would have been wild with delight in those places  snowy mountains are they not like a fairydream to you now you must have felt at home as a scotchwomans daughter  think of the peaks in the sunrise oh i wanted you in the pass of roncevalles to hear the echo of rolands horn and we saw the cleft made by rolands sword in the rocks  oh how delightfuland spain too  ay the isle of pheasants where all the conferences took place  where louis xiv met his bride and francois i sealed his treason with his empty flourish  well dont let us fight about francois i now i want to know how tom likes eton  he gets on famously i am so glad he is in the same house with hector  mr ramsdenhow is he  no better he has not done any duty for weeks tomkins and his set want to sell the next presentation but papa hopes to stave that off for there is a better set than usual in the town council this year  cocksmoor and how are our friends the muses i found a note from the secretary telling me that i am elected again how have they behaved  pretty well said ethel mrs ledwich has been away so we have had few meetings and have been pretty quiet except for an uproar about the mistress beating that franklins girland what do you think i did flora i made bold to say the woman should show her to papa to see if she had done her any harm and he found that it was all a fabrication from one end to the other so it ended in the poor girl being expelled and mary and i have her twice a week to see if there is any grace in her  to reward her said flora that is always your way  why one cannot give the poor thing quite up said ethel  you will manage the ladies at last cried flora  not while mrs ledwich is there  ill cope with her but come i want you in my room  may not i come said meta i must see when  flora held up her hand and while signing invitation gave an arch look to meta to be silent ethel here bethought herself of inquiring after mr rivers and then for george  mr rivers was pretty wellgeorge quite well and somewhere in the garden and meta said that he had such a beard that they would hardly know him while flora added that he was delighted with the oxford scheme floras rooms had been already often shown to her sisters when mr rivers had been newly furnishing them with every luxury and ornament that taste could devise her dressingroom with the large bay window commanding a beautiful view of stoneborough and filled but not crowded with every sort of choice article was a perfect exhibition to eyes unaccustomed to such varieties  mary could have been still amused by the hour in studying the devices and ornaments on the shelves and chiffonieres and blanche had romanced about it to the little ones till they were erecting it into a mythical palace  and flora in her simple wellchosen dress looked and moved as if she had been born and bred in the like  there were signs of unpacking about the roomfloras dressingcase on the table and some dresses lying on the sofa and ottoman  mary ran up to them eagerly and exclaimed at the beautiful shot blue and white silk  paris fashions said ethel carelessly  yes but i dont parade my own dresses here said flora  whose are they then your commissions meta  no and meta laughed heartily  your french maids then said ethel i dare say she dresses quite as well and the things are too really pretty and simple for an english maids taste  i am glad you like them said flora maliciously now please to be good  who are they for then said ethel beginning to be frightened  for a young lady whose brother has got the newdigate prize and who is going to oxford  me those but i have not got four backs as ethel saw meta in fits of laughing and flora making affirmative signs mary gave a ponderous spring of ecstasy  come said flora you may as well be quiet whatever you may like i am not going to have the newdigate prizeman shown as brother to a scarecrow i knew what you would come to without me to take care of you look at yourself in the glass  im sure i see no harm in myself said ethel turning towards the pierglass and surveying herselfin a white muslin made high a black silk mantle and a brown hat she had felt very respectable when she set out but she could not avoid a lurking conviction that beside flora and meta it had a scanty schoolgirl effect and she continued quaintly besides i have really got a new gown on purposea good useful silk that papa chose at whitfordjust the colour of a copper teakettle where it turns purple  ethel you will kill me said meta sinking back on the sofa  and i suppose continued flora that you have sent it to miss broads without any directions and she will trim it with flamecoloured gimp and glass buttons and unless margaret catches you you will find yourself ready to set the thames on fire no my dear teakettle i take you to oxford on my own terms and you had better submit without a fuss and be thankful it is no worse george wanted me to buy you a white brocade with a perfect flowergarden on it that you could have examined with a microscope i was obliged to let him buy that lace mantle to make up to him now then meta the scene opens and discovers  meta opened the foldingdoors into floras bedroom and thence came forward bellairs and a little brisk frenchwoman whom flora had acquired at paris the former who was quite used to adorning miss ethel against her will looked as amused as her mistresses and before ethel knew what was going on her muslin was stripped off her back and that instrument of torture a half made body was being tried upon her she made one of her most wonderful grimaces of despair and stood still the dresses were not so bad after all they were more tasteful than costly and neither in material nor ornament were otherwise than suitable to the occasion and the wearer it was very kind and thoughtful of florathat she could not but feelnothing had been forgotten but when ethel saw the mantles the ribbons the collars the bonnet all glistening with the french air of freshness and grace she began to feel doubts and hesitations whether she ought to let her sister go to such an expense on her account and privately resolved that the accepting thanks should not be spoken till she should have consulted her father  in the meantime she could only endure be laughed at by her elders and entertained by marys extreme pleasure in her array good maryit was more than any comedy to her she had not one moments thought of herself till when flora dived into her box produced a pair of bracelets and fastened them on her comfortable plump arms her eyes grew wide with wonder and she felt at least two stages nearer womanhood  flora had omitted no one there was a paris present for every servant at home and a needlecase even for cherry elwood for which ethel thanked her with a fervency wanting in her own case  she accomplished consulting her father on her scruples and he set her mind at rest he knew that the outlay was a mere trifle to the riverses and was greatly pleased and touched with the affection that flora showed so he only smiled at ethels doubts and dwelt with heartfelt delight on the beautiful print that she had brought him from ary scheffers picture of the great consoler  flora was in her glory to be able to bestow benefits on those whom she loved had been always a favourite vision and she had the full pleasure of feeling how much enjoyment she was causing they had a very pleasant evening she gave interesting accounts of their tour and by her appeals to her husband made him talk also he was much more animated and agreeable than ethel had ever seen him and was actually laughing and making mary laugh heartily with his histories of the inns in the pyrennees old mr rivers looked as proud and happy as possible and was quite young and gay having evidently forgotten all his maladies in paying elaborate attention to his daughterinlaw  ethel told margaret that night that she was quite satisfied about florashe was glad to own that she had done her injustice and that norman was right in saying there was more in george rivers than met the eye  the morning spent at home was equally charming flora came back with love strengthened by absence she was devoted to margaretcaressing to all she sat in her old places she fulfilled her former offices she gratified miss bracy by visiting her in the schoolroom and talking of french books and won golden opinions by taking gertrude in her hand and walking to minster street to call on mrs hoxton as in old times and take her the newest foreign device of working to kill time  so a few days passed merrily away and the great journey commenced ethel met the abbotstoke party at the station and with a parting injunction to her father that he was to give all his patients a sleeping potion that they might not miss him she was carried away from stoneborough  meta was in her gayest mood ethel full of glee and wonder for once beyond whitford the whole world was new to her flora more quiet but greatly enjoying their delight and george not saying much but smiling under his beard as if well pleased to be so well amused with so little trouble  he took exceeding care of them and fed them with everything he could make them eat at the swindon station asking for impossible things and wishing them so often to change for something better that if they had been submissive they would have had no luncheon at all and as it was flora was obliged to whisk into the carriage with her last sandwich in her hand  i am the more sorry said he after grumbling at the allotted ten minutes as we shall dine so late you desired norman to bring any friend he liked did you not flora  yes and he spoke of bringing our old friend charles cheviot and mr ogilvie said flora  mr ogilvie said ethel the master of glenbracken oh i am so glad i have wanted so much to see him  ah he is a great hero of yours said flora  do you know him said meta  no but he is a great friend of normans and a scottish cousinnorman ogilvie norman has his name from the ogilvies  our grandmother mrs mackenzie was a daughter of lord glenbracken said flora  this man might be called the master of glenbracken at home said ethel it is such a pretty title and there is a beautiful history belonging to them there was a master of glenbracken who carried james ivs standard at flodden and would not yield and was killed with it wrapped round his body and the lion was dyed with his blood mamma knew some scraps of a ballad about him then they were out with montrose and had their castle burned by the covenanters and since that they have been jacobites and one barely escaped being beheaded at carlisle i want to hear the rights of it norman is to go some time or other to stay at glenbracken  yes said flora coming down to times present this young heir seems worthy of his race they are pattern peoplehave built a church and have all their tenantry in excellent order this is the only son and very good and cleverhe preferred going to balliol that he might work but he is a great sportsman george added she you will get on with him very well about fishing and grouse shooting i dare say  norman met them at the station and there was great excitement at seeing his long nose under his college cap he looked rather thin and worn but brightened at the sight of the party after the questionwhether there had been any letters from harry he asked whether his father were comingand ethel thought he seemed nervous at the idea of this addition to his audience he saw them to their hotel and promising them his two guests departed  ethel watched collegiate figures passing in the street and recollected the gray buildings just glimpsed at in her driveit was dreamy and confused and she stood musing not discovering that it was time to dress till flora and her frenchwoman came in and laid violent hands on her  the effect of their manipulations was very successful ethel was made to look welldressed and still more distinguished her height told well when her lankiness was overcome and her hair was disposed so as to set off her features to advantage the glow of amusement and pleasure did still more for her and norman who was in the parlour when the sisters appeared quite started with surprise and satisfaction at her aspect  well done flora he said why i have been telling ogilvie that one of my sisters was very plain  then i hope we have been preparing an agreeable surprise for him said flora ethel is very much obliged to you by the bye she said in her universal amity i must ask harvey anderson to dinner one of these days norman started and his face said dont  oh very well it is as you please i thought it would please stoneborough and that edward was a protege of yours what has he been doing did we not hear he had been distinguishing himself dr hoxton was boasting of his two scholars  ask him said norman hurriedly at least said he do not let anything from me prevent you  has he been doing anything wrong reiterated flora  not that i know of was the blunt answer and at the same instant mr ogilvie arrived he was a pleasant highbred looking gentleman browncomplexioned and darkeyed with a brisk and resolute cast of countenance that ethel thought might have suited the norman of glenbracken who died on the ruddy lion of scotland and speaking with the very same slight degree of scottish intonation as she remembered in her mother making a most homelike sound in her ears  presently the rest of their own party came down and soon after charles cheviot appeared looking as quiet and tame as he used to be in the schoolboy days when norman would bring him home and he used to be too shy to speak a word  however he had learned the use of his tongue by this time though it was a very soft one and he stood by ethel asking many questions about stoneborough while something apparently very spirited and amusing was going on between the others  the dinner went off wellthere were few enough for the conversation to be general the young men began to strike out sparks of wit against each otherflora put in a word or twoethel grew so much interested in the discussion that her face lighted up and she joined in it as if it had been only between her father and brotherkeen clear and droll after that she had her full share in the conversation and enjoyed it so much that when she left the dinnertable she fetched her writingcase to sketch the colloquy for margaret and her father  flora exclaimed at her for never allowing any one to think of rest meta said she should like to do the same but it was impossible now she did not know how she should ever settle down to write a letter ethel was soon interruptedthe gentlemen entered and mr ogilvie came to the window where she was sitting and began to tell her how much obliged to her he and his college were for having insisted on her brothers sending in his poem thanks are due for our being spared an infliction next week he said  have you seen it she asked and she was amused by the quick negative movement of his head  i read my friends poems but our lungs are prepared will you give me my cueit is of no use to ask him when we are to deafen you one generally knows the crack passagessomething beginning with oh woman but it is well to be in readinessif you would only forewarn me of the telling hits  if they cannot tell themselves said ethel smiling i dont think they deserve the name  perhaps you think what does tell on the undergraduates collectively is not always what ought to tell on them  i dont know i dare say the same would not be a favourite with them and with me  i should like to know which are your favourites no doubt you have a copy heremade by yourself and he looked towards her papercase  there was the copy and she took it out peering to see whether norman were looking  let me see he said as she paused to open the ms he told me the thoughts were more yours than his own  did he that was not fair one thought was an old one long ago talked over between us the rest is all his own  here mr ogilvie took the paper and ethel saw his countenance show evident tokens of surprise and feeling  yes he said presently may goes deepdeeper than most menthough i doubt whether they will applaud this  i should like it better if they did not said ethel it is rather to be felt than shouted at  and i dont know how the world would go on if it were felt few men would do much without the hope of fame said norman ogilvie  is it the question what they would do said ethel  so you call fame a low motive i see where your brothers philosophy comes from  i do not call it a low motive her pause was expressive  nor allow that the non omnis moriar of horace has in it something divine  for a heathenyes  and pray what would you have the moving spring  duty  would not that end in mine be a cot beside the rill said he with an intonation of absurd sentiment  well and suppose an enemy came would duty prompt not the hay with the jokeor winkelried on the spears  nay why notit is my duty to take care of lucy  then lucy ought to be broken on her own wheel  not at all it is lucys duty to keep her colin from running into danger  i hope there are not many lucies who would think so  i agree with you most would rather have colin killed than disgraced  to be sure then perceiving a knowing twinkle as if he thought she had made an admission she added but what is disgrace  some say it is misfortune said mr ogilvie  is it not failure in duty said ethel  well  colins first duty is to his king and country if he fail in that he is disgraced in his own eyes before heaven and men if he does it there is a reward which seems to me a better more powerful motive for lucy to set before him than my dear i hope you will distinguish yourself when the fact is                   england has forty thousand men                    we trust as good as he   victory or westminster abbey is a tolerable warcry said mr ogilvie  not so good as england expects every man to do his duty that serves for those who cannot look to westminster abbey  ah you are an english woman  only by halves i had rather have been the master of glenbracken at flodden than king james orfor she grew rather ashamed of having been impelled to utter the personal allusionbetter to have been the swinton or the gordon at homildon than all the rest put together  i always thought swinton a pigheaded old fellow and i have little doubt that my ancestor was a young ruffian coolly answered the master of glenbracken  why was all that ethel could say in her indignation  it was the normal state of scottish gentlemen he answered  if i thought you were in earnest i should say you did not deserve to be a scot  and so you wish to make me out a fause scot  ogilvie called norman are you fighting scottish and english battles with ethel there we want you to tell us which will be the best day for going to blenheim  the rest of the evening was spent in arranging the programme of their lionising in which it appeared that the scottish cousin intended to take his full share ethel was not sorry for he interested her much while provoking her she was obliged to put out her full strength in answering him and felt at the same time that he was not making any effort in using the arguments that puzzled hershe was in earnest while he was at play and though there was something teasing in this and she knew it partook of what her brothers called chaffing it gave her that sense of power on his side which is always attractive to women with the knowledge that through norman she had of his real character she understood that half at least of what he said was jest and the other half was enough in earnest to make it exciting to argue with him     chapter ix         while i thy dearest sat apart      and felt thy triumphs were as mine      and lovd them more than they were thine                                             tennyson   that was a week of weeks the most memorable week in ethels life spent in indefatigable sightseeing college chapels bodleian library taylor gallery the museum all were thoroughly studied and if flora had not dragged the party on in mercy to poor georges patience ethel would never have got through a days work  indeed mr ogilvie when annoyed at being hurried in going over merton chapel with her was heard to whisper that he acted the part of policeman by a perpetual move on and as ethel recollected the portly form and wooden face of the superintendent at stoneborough she was afraid that the comparison would not soon be forgotten norman ogilvie seemed to consider himself bound to their train as much as his namesake or as on the second morning norman reported his reasoning it was that a man must walk about with somebody on commemoration week and that it was a comfort to do so with ladies who wore their bonnets upon their heads instead of like most of those he met remind him of what cock robin said to jenny wren in that matrimonial quarrel when                robin he grew angry              hopped upon a twig   flora was extremely delighted and in matronly fashion told her sister that people were always respected and admired who had the strength of mind to resist unsuitable customs ethel laughed in answer and said she thought it would take a great deal more strength of mind to go about with her whole visage exposed to the universal gaze and womanlike they had a thorough gossip over the evils of the backsliding headgear  norman had retreated from it into the window when flora returned to the charge about harvey anderson she had been questioning their old friend mr everard and had learned from him that the cause of the hesitation with which his name had been received was that he had become imbued with some of the rationalistic ideas current in some quarters he seldom met norman may without forcing on him debates which were subjects of great interest to the hearers as the two young men were considered as the most distinguished representatives of their respective causes among their own immediate contemporaries normans powers of argument his eloquence readiness and clearness were thought to rank very high and in the opinion of mr everard had been of great effect in preventing other youths from being carried away by the specious brilliancy of his rival  ethel valued this testimony far above the newdigate prize and she was extremely surprised by hearing flora declare her intention of still asking mr anderson to dinner only consulting her brother as to the day  why flora ask him norman  norman had turned away with the simple answer any day  norman is wiser than you are ethel said flora he knows that stoneborough would be up in arms at any neglect from us to one of the andersons and considering the rivalship it is the more graceful and becoming  i do not think it right said ethel stoutly i believe that a line ought to be drawn and that we ought not to associate with people who openly tamper with their faith  never fear smiled flora i promise you that there shall be no debates at my table  ethel felt the force of the pronoun and as flora walked out of the room she went up to norman who had been resting his brow against the window  it is vain to argue with her she said but norman do not you think it is clearly wrong to seek after men who desert and deny  she stopped short frightened at his pale look  he spoke in a low clear tone that seemed to thrill her with a sort of alarm if the secrets of mens hearts were probed who could cast the first stone  i dont want to cast stones she began but he made a gesture as if he would not hear and at the same moment mr ogilvie entered the room  had ethel been at home she would have pondered much over her brothers meaninghere she had no leisure not only was she fully occupied with the new scenes around her but her scottish cousin took up every moment open to conversation he was older than norman and had just taken his degree and he talked with that superior aplomb which a few years bestow at their time of life without conceit but more hopeful and ambitious and with higher spirits than his cousin  though industrious and distinguished he had not avoided society or amusement was a great cricketer and tennisplayer one of the eight whose success in the boat races was one of normans prime interests and he told stories of frolics that reminded ethel of her fathers old cambridge adventures  he was a new variety in her eyes and entertained her greatly where the bounds of banter ended was not easy to define but whenever he tried a little mystification she either entered merrily into the humour or threw it over with keen wit that he kept constantly on the stretch they were always discovering odd unexpected bits of knowledge in each other and a great deal more accordance in views and opinions than appealed on the surface for his enthusiasm usually veiled itself in persiflage on hers though he was too good and serious to carry it too far  at blenheim perhaps he thought he had given an overdose of nonsense and made her believe as meta really did that the duchess sarah was his model woman for as they walked in the park in search of phoebe mayflowers well he gathered a fern leaf to show her the glenbracken badge and talked to her of his home his mother and his sister marjorie and the little church in the rocky glen he gave the history of the stolen meetings of the little knot of churchmen during the days of persecution and showed a heart descended straight from the ogilvie who was out with montrose now that the upper structure of young england was for a little while put aside  after this she took his jokes much more coolly and made thrusts beneath them which he seemed to enjoy and caused him to unfold himself the more she liked him all the better for finding that he thought norman had been a very good friend to him and that he admired her brother heartily watching tenderly over his tendencies to make himself unhappy he confided to her that much as he rejoiced in the defeats of anderson he feared that the reading and thought consequent on the discussions had helped to overstrain normans mind and he was very anxious to carry him away from all study and toil and make his brains rest and his eyes delight themselves upon scottish mountains  thereupon came vivid descriptions of the scenery especially his own glen with the ruined tower and ardent wishes that his cousin ethel could see them also and know marjorie she could quite echo the wish edinburgh and loch katrine had been the visions of her life and now that she had once taken the leap and left home absence did not seem impossible and with a start of delight she hailed her own conviction that he intended his mother to invite the party to glenbracken  after normans visit mr ogilvie declared that he must come home with him and pay his longpromised visit to stoneborough he should have come long ago he had been coming last winter but the wedding had prevented him he had always wished to know dr may whom his father well remembered and now nothing should keep him away  flora looked on amused and pleased at ethels developmenther abruptness softened into piquancy and her countenance so embellished that the irregularity only added to the expressiveness there was no saying what ethel would come to she had not said that she would not go to the intended ball and her grimaces at the mention of it were growing fainter every day  the discussion about harvey anderson was never revived flora sent the invitation without another wordhe came with half a dozen other gentlemenethel made him a civil greeting but her head was full of boats and the procession day about which mr ogilvie was telling her and she thought of him no more  a lucky step thought flora a grand thing for ethela capital connection for us all lady glenbracken will not come too much into my sphere either yes i am doing well by my sisters  it would make stayathome people giddy to record how much pleasure how much conversation and laughter were crowded into those ten days and with much thought and feeling beside them for these were not girls on whom grave oxford could leave no impression but one of gaiety  the whole party was very full of merriment norman may especially on whom flora contrived to devolve that real leadership of conversation that should rightly have belonged to george rivers kept up the ball with wit and drollery far beyond what he usually put forth enlivened george into being almost an agreeable man and drew out little metas vivacity into sunny sparkles  meta generally had norman for her share and seemed highly contented with his lionisings which were given much more quietly and copiously than those which his cousin bestowed upon his sister or if there were anything enterprising to be done any tower to be mounted or anything with the smallest spice of danger in it meta was charmed and with her lightness and airiness of foot and figure and perfectly feminine ways showed a spirit of adventure that added to the general diversion but if she were to be helped up or down anywhere she certainly seemed to find greater security in norman mays assistance though it was but a featherlike touch that she ever used to aid her bounding step  both as being diffident and in a manner at home norman was not as constantly her cavalier as was mr ogilvie to his sister and when supplanted his wont was either to pioneer for flora or if she did not need him to walk alone grave and abstracted there was a weight on his brow when nothing was going on to drive it away and whether it were nervousness as to the performance in store for him anxiety about harry or as mr ogilvie said too severe application some burden hung upon him that was only lightened for the time by his participation in the enjoyment of the party  on sunday evening when they had been entering into the almost visionlike delight of the choicest of music and other accompaniments of church service they went to walk in christchurch meadows they had begun altogether by comparing feelingsethel wondering whether stoneborough minster would ever be used as it might be and whether if so they should be practically the better for it and proceeding with metaphysics on her side and satire on norman ogilvies to speculate whether that which is is best and the rights and wrongs of striving for change and improvements what should begin from above and what from beneathwith illustrations often laughtermoving though they were much in earnest as the young heir of glenbracken looked into his future life  flora had diverged into wondering who would have the living after poor old mr ramsden and walked keeping her husband amused with instances of his blunders  meta as with norman she parted from the rest thought her own dear abbotstoke church and mr charles wilmot great subjects for content and thanksgiving though it was a wonderful treat to see and hear such as she had enjoyed today and she thought it was a joy to carry away abidingly to know that praise and worship as near perfection as this earth could render them were being offered up  norman understood her thought but responded by more of a sigh than was quite comfortable  meta went on with her own thoughts on the connection between worship and good works how the one leads to the other and how praise with pure lips is after all the great purpose of existenceher last thought she spoke aloud  i suppose everything our own happiness and all are given to us to turn into praise she said  yes echoed norman but as if his thoughts were not quite with hers or rather in another part of the same subject then recalling himself happy such as can do so  if one only could said meta  you candont say otherwise exclaimed norman i know at least that you and my father can  dr may does so more than any one i know said meta  yes said norman again it is his secret of joy to him it is never i am half sick of shadows  to him they are not shadows but foretastes said meta silence again and when she spoke she said i have always thought it must be such a happiness to have power of any kind that can be used in direct service or actual doing good  no said norman whatever becomes a profession becomes an unreality  surely not in becoming a duty said meta  not for all he answered but where the fabric erected by ourselves in the sight of the world is but an outer case a shell of mere words blown up for the occasion strung together as mere language then selfconvicted we shrink within the husk and feel our own worthlessness and hypocrisy  as one feels in reproving the school children for behaving ill at church said meta  you never felt anything approaching to it said norman to know oneself to be such a deception that everything else seems a delusion too  i dont know whether that is metaphysical said meta but i am sure i dont understand it one must know oneself to be worse than one knows any one else to be  i could not wish you to understand said norman and yet he seemed impelled to go on for after a hesitating silence he added when the wanderer in the desert fears that the spring is but a mirage or when all that is held dear is made hazy or distorted by some enchanter what do you think are the feelings meta  it must be dreadful she said rather bewildered but he may know it is a delusion if he can but wake has he not always a spell a charm  what is the spell eagerly said norman standing still  believe said meta hardly knowing how she came to choose the words  i believe he repeated whatwhen we go beyond the province of reasonhuman a thing of sense after all how often have i so answered but meta when a man has been drawn in selfsufficient security to look into a magic mirror and cannot detach his eyes from the confused misty scenewhere all that had his allegiance appears shattered overthrown like a broken image or at least unable to endure examination then  oh norman is that the trial to any one here i thought old oxford was the great guardian nurse of truth i am sure she cannot deal in magic mirrors or such frightful things do you know you are talking like a very horrible dream  i believe i am in one said norman  to be sure you are wake said meta looking up smiling in his face you have read yourself into a maze thats allwhat mary calls muzzling your head you dont really think all this and when you get into the country away from books you will forget it one look at our dear old purple welsh hills will blow away all the mists  i ought not to have spoken in this manner said norman sadly forget it meta  forget it of course i will it is all nonsense and meant to be forgotten said meta laughing you will own that it is byandby  he gave a deep sigh  dont think i am unfeeling she said but i know it is all a fog up from books books booksi should like to drive it off with a good fresh gust of wind oh i wish those yellow lilies would grow in our river  meta talked away gaily for the rest of the walk she was anything but unfeeling but she had a confidence in norman that forbade her to see anything here but one of his variations of spirits which always sank in the hour of triumph she put forth her brightness to enliven him and in their subsequent teteatetes she avoided all that could lead to a renewal of this conversation ethel would not have rested till it had been fought out meta thought it so imaginary that it had better die for want of the aliment of words certainly hers could not reach an intellect like his and she would only soothe and amuse him dr may mindcurer as well as bodycurer would soon be here to put the climax to the general joy and watch his own son  he did arrive quite prepared to enjoy giving an excellent account of both homes mr rivers very well and the wilmots taking care of him and margaret as comfortable as usual mary making a most important and capable little housekeeper miss bracy as good as possible he talked as if they had all nourished the better for ethels absence but he had evidently missed her greatly as he showed without knowing it by his instant eagerness to have her to himself even norman prizeman as he was was less wanted there was proud affection eager congratulation for him but it was ethel to whom he wanted to tell everything that had passed during her absencewhom he treated as if they were meeting after a tedious separation  they dined rather early and went out afterwards to walk down the high street to christchurch meadow norman and ethel had been anxious for this they thought it would give their father the best idea of the tout ensemble of oxford and were not without hopes of beating him by his own confession in that standing fight between him and his sons as to the beauties of oxford and cambridgea fight in which hitherto they had been equally matchedneither partisan having seen the rival university  flora stayed at home she owned herself fairly tired by her arduous duties of following the two young ladies about and was very glad to give her father the keeping of them dr may held out his arm to ethelnorman secured his peculiar property ethel could have preferred that it should be otherwisenorman would have no companion but george rivers how bored he would be  all through the streets while she was telling her father the names of the buildings she was not giving her whole attention she was trying to guess from the sounds behind whether mr ogilvie were accompanying them they entered the meadowsnorman turned round with a laugh to defy the doctor to talk of the cam on the banks of the isis the party stood stillthe other two gentlemen came up they amalgamated againall the oxonians conspiring to say spiteful things of the cam and dr may making a spirited defence in which ethel found herself impelled to join  in the wide gravelled path they proceeded in threes george attached himself to his sister and norman mr ogilvie came to ethels other side and began to point out all the various notabilities ethel was happy again her father was so much pleased and amused with him and he with her father that it was a treat to look on  presently dr may as usual always meeting with acquaintances fell in with a county neighbour and ethel had another pleasant aside until her father claimed her and mr ogilvie was absorbed among another party and lost to her sight  he came to tea but by that time dr may had established himself in the chair which had hitherto been appropriated to her cousin a chair that cut her nook off from the rest of the world and made her the exclusive possession of the occupant there was a most interesting history for her to hear of a meeting with the town council which she had left pending when dr may had been battling to save the next presentation of the living from being sold  few subjects could affect ethel more nearly yet she caught herself missing the thread of his discourse in trying to hear what mr ogilvie was saying to flora about a visit to glenbracken  the time came for the two balliol men to take their leave norman may had been sitting very silent all the evening and meta who was near him respected his mood when he said goodnight he drew ethel outside the door ethel he said only one thing do ask my father not to put on his spectacles tomorrow  very well said ethel half smiling richard did not mind them  richard has more humilityi shall break down if he looks at me i wish you were all at home  thank you  the other norman came out of the sittingroom at the moment and heard the last words  never mind said he to ethel ill take care of him he shall comport himself as if you were all at nova zembla a pretty fellow to talk of despising fame and then get a fit of stagefright  well goodnight said norman sighing it will be over tomorrow only remember the spectacles  dr may laughed a good deal at the request and asked if the rest of the party were to be blindfolded meta wondered that ethel should have mentioned the request so publicly she was a good deal touched by it and she thought dr may ought to be so  goodnight was said and dr may put his arm round ethel and gave her the kiss that she had missed for seven nights it was very homelike and it brought a sudden flash of thought across ethel what had she been doing she had been impatient of her fathers monopoly of her  she parted with flora and entered the room she shared with meta where bellairs waited to attend her little mistress few words passed between the two girls and those chiefly on the morrows dress meta had some fixed ideasshe should wear pink norman had said he liked her pink bonnet and then she could put down her white veil so that he could be certain that she was not looking ethel vaguely believed flora meant to wearsomething  bellairs went away and meta gave expression to her eager hope that norman would go through it well if he would only read it as he did last easter to her and ethel  he will said ethel this nervousness always wears off when it comes to the point and he warms with his subject  oh but think of all the eyes looking at him  ours are all that he really cares for and he will think of none of them when he begins no meta you must not encourage him in it papa says if he did not think it half morbidthe result of the shock to his nerveshe should be angry with it as a sort of conceit  i should have thought that the last thing to be said of norman said meta with a little suppressed indignation  it was once in his nature said ethel and i think it is the fault he most beats down there was a time before you knew him when he would have been vain and ambitious  then it is as they say conquered faults grow to be the opposite virtues said meta how very good he is ethel one sees it more when he is with other people and one hears all these young mens stories  everything norman does not do is not therefore wrong said ethel with her usual lucidity of expression  dont you like him the better for keeping out of all these follies  norman does not call them so i am sure  no he is too good to condemn  it is not only that said ethel i know papa thinks that the first grief coming at his age and in the manner it did checked and subdued his spirits so that he has little pleasure in those things and he always meant to be a clergyman which acted as a sort of consecration on him but many things are innocent and i do believe papa would like it better if norman were less grave  yes said meta remembering the sunday talk but still he would not be all he isso different from others  of course i dont mean less good only less grave said ethel and certainly less nervous but perhaps it is a good thing dear mamma thought his talents would have been a greater temptation than they seem to be subdued as he has been i only meant that you must not condemn all that norman does not do now goodnight  very different were the feelings with which those two young girls stretched themselves in their beds that night margaret riverss innocent happy little heart was taken up in one contemplation admiration sympathy and the exultation for him which he would not feel for himself drew little meta entirely out of herselfa self that never held her much she was proud of the slender thread of connection between them she was confident that his vague fancies were but the scruples of a sensitive mind and as she fell sound asleep she murmured broken lines of decius mixed with promises not to look  etheldred heard them for there was no sleep for her she had a parley to hold with herself and to accuse her own feelings of having been unkind ungrateful undutiful towards her father what had a fit of vanity brought her to that she should have been teased by what would naturally have been her greatest delight her fathers pleasure in being with her was this the girl who had lately vowed within herself that her father should be her first earthly object  at first ethel blamed herself for her secret impatience but another conviction crossed her and not an unpleasing one though it made her cheeks tingle with maidenly shame at having called it up throughout this week norman ogilvie had certainly sought her out he had looked disappointed this eveningthere was no doubt that he was attracted by herby her plain awkward ethel such a perception assuredly never gave so much pleasure to a beauty as it did to ethel who had always believed herself far less goodlooking than she really was it was a gleam of delight and though she set herself to scold it down the conviction was elastic and always leaped up again  that resolution came before her but it had been unspoken it could not be binding and if her notion were really right the misty brilliant future of mutual joy dazzled her but there was another side her father oppressed and lonely margaret ill and pining mary neither companion nor authority the children running wild and she who had mentally vowed never to forsake her father far away enjoying her own happiness ah that resolve had seemed easy enough when it was made when thought ethel i fancied no one could care for me shame on me now is the time to test it i must go home with papa  it was a great struggleon one side there was the deceitful guise of modesty telling her it was absurd to give so much importance to the kindness of the first cousin with whom she had ever been thrown there was the dislike to vex flora to make a discussion and break up the party there was the desire to hear the concert to go to the breakfast at  college to return round by warwick castle and kenilworth as designed should she lose all this for a mere flattering fancy she who had laughed at miss boulder for imagining every one who spoke to her was smitten what reason could she assign it would be simply ridiculous and unkindand it was so very pleasant mr ogilvie would be too wise to think of so incongruous a connection which would be so sure to displease his parents it was more absurd than ever to think of it the heir of glenbracken and a country physicians daughter  that was a candid heart which owned that its own repugnance to accept this disparity as an objection was an additional evidence that she ought to flee from further intercourse she believed that no harm was done yet she was sure that she loved her father better than anything else in the world and whilst she did so it was best to preserve her heart for him widowed as he was she knew that he would sorely miss her and that for years to come she should be necessary at home she had better come away while it would cost only a slight pang for that it was pain to leave norman ogilvie was symptom enough of the need of not letting her own silly heart go further however it might be with him another week would only make it worse with her  i will go home with papa was the ultimatum reached by each chain of mental reasonings and borne in after each short prayer for guidance as ethel tossed about listening to the perpetual striking of all the oxford clocks until daylight had begun to shine in when she fell asleep and was only waked by meta standing over her with a sponge looking very mischievous as she reminded her of their appointment with dr may to go to the early service in new college chapel  the world looked different that morning with ethel but the determination was fixed and the service strengthened it she was so silent during the walk that her companions rallied her and they both supposed she was anxious about norman but taking her opportunity when meta was gone to prepare for breakfast she rushed in her usual way into the subject papa if you please i should like to go home tomorrow with you  eh said the doctor amazed how is this i told you that miss bracy and mary are doing famously  yes but i had rather go back  indeed and dr may looked at the door and spoke low they make you welcome i hope  oh yes nothing can be kinder  i am glad to hear it this rivers is such a lout that i could not tell how it might be i did not look to see you turn homesick all at once  ethel smiled yes i have been very happy but please papa ask no questionsonly take me home  come it is all a homesick fit ethelnever fear the ball think of the concert if it were not for that poor baby of mrs larkins i should stay myself to hear sonntag again you wont have such another chance  i know but i think i ought to go  george came in and they could say no more both were silent on the subject at breakfast but when afterwards flora seized on ethel to array her for the theatre she was able to say flora please dont be angry with meyou have been very kind to me but i mean to go home with papa tomorrow  i declare said flora composedly you are as bad as the children at the infant school crying to go home the instant they see their mothers  no flora but i must go thank you for all this pleasure but i shall have heard normans poem and then i must go  flora turned her round looked in her face kindly kissed her and said my dear never mind it will all come right againonly dont run away  what will come right  any little misunderstanding with norman ogilvie  i dont know what you mean said ethel becoming scarlet  my dear you need not try to hide it i see that you have got into a fright you have made a discovery but that is no reason for running away  yes it is said ethel firmly not denying the charge though reddening more than ever at finding her impression confirmed  poor child she is afraid said flora tenderly but i will take care of you ethel it is everything delightful you are the very girl for such a heros de roman and it has embellished you more than all my paris fineries  hush flora we ought not to talk in this way as if  as if he had done more than walk with and talk with nobody else how he did hate papa last night i had a great mind to call papa off in pity to him  dont flora if there were anything in it it would not be proper to think of it so i am going home to prevent it the words were spoken with averted face and heaving breath  proper said flora the mays are a good old family and our own grandmother was an honourable ogilvie herself a scottish baron very poor too has no right to look down  they shall not look down flora it is of no use to talk i cannot be spared from home and i will not put myself in the way of being tempted to forsake them all  tempted said flora laughing is it such a wicked thing  not in others but it would be wrong in me with such a state of things as there is at home  i do not suppose he would want you for some years to come he is only twoandtwenty mary will grow older  margaret will either be married or want constant care flora i will not let myself be drawn from them  you may think so now but it would be for their real good to relieve papa of any of us if we were all to think as you do how should we live i dont knowfor papa told me there will be barely ten thousand pounds besides the houses and what will that be among ten i am not talking of yourself but think of the others  i know papa will not be happy without me and i will not leave him repeated ethel not answering the argument  flora changed her ground and laughed we are getting into the heroics she said when it would be very foolish to break up our plans only because we have found a pleasant cousin there is nothing serious in it i dare say how silly of us to argue on such an idea  meta came in before flora could say more but ethel with burning cheeks repeated it will be safer  ethel had meantime been dressed by her sister and as bellairs came to adorn meta and she could have no solitude she went downstairs thinking she heard normans step and hoping to judge of his mood  she entered the room with an exclamation oh norman  at your service said the wrong norman looking merrily up from behind a newspaper  oh i beg your pardon i thought  your thoughts were quite right he said smiling your brother desires me to present his respects to his honoured family and to inform them that his stock of assurance is likely to be diminished by the pleasure of their company this morning  how is he asked ethel anxiously  pretty fair he has blue saucers round his eyes as he had before he went up for his little go  oh i know them said ethel  very odd continued her cousin when the end always is that he says he has the luck of being set on in the very place he knows best but i think it has expended itself in a sleepless night and i have no fears when he comes to the point  what is he doing  writing to his brother harry he said it was the day for the pacific mail and that harrys pleasure would be the best of it  ah said ethel glancing towards the paper is there any naval intelligence  he looked and while she was thinking whether she ought not to depart he exclaimed in a tone that startled her ha no is your brothers ship the alcestis  yes oh what  nothing then i assure you see it is merely thisshe has not come into sydney so soon as expected which you knew before that is all  let me see said the trembling ethel  it was no more than an echo of their unconfessed apprehensions yet it seemed to give them a body and ethels thoughts flew to margaret her going home would be absolutely necessary now mr ogilvie kindly began to talk away her alarm saying that there was still no reason for dread mentioning the many causes that might have delayed the ship and reassuring her greatly  but norman she said  ah true poor may he will break down to a certainty if he hears it i will go at once and keep guard over him lest he should meet with this paper but pray dont be alarmed i assure you there is no cause you will have letters tomorrow  ethel would fain have thrown off her finery and hurried home at once but no one regarded the matter as she did dr may agreed with flora that it was no worse than before and though they now thought ethels return desirable on margarets account it would be better not to add to the shock by a sudden arrival especially as they took in no daily paper at home so the theatre was not to be given up nor any of the subsequent plans except so far as regarded ethel and this agreed they started for the scene of action  they were hardly in the street before they met the ubiquitous mr ogilvie saying that cheviot normans prompter was aware of the report and was guarding him while he came to escort the ladies through what he expressively called the bear fight ethel resolutely adhered to her father and her cousin took care of meta who had been clinging in a tiptoe manner to the point of her brothers high elbow looking as if the crowd might easily brush off such a little fly without his missing her  inch by inch a step at a time the ladies were landed in a crowd of their own sex where flora bravely pioneered they emerged on their benches shook themselves out and seated themselves there was the swarm of gay ladies around them and beneath the area fast being paved with heads black brown gray and bald a surging living sea where meta soon pointed out dr may and george the mere sight of such masses of people was curious and interesting reminding ethel of cherry elwood having once shocked her by saying the whitmonday club was the most beautiful sight in the whole year and above that gallery of trampling undergraduates and more than trampling ethel and meta could at first have found it in their hearts to be frightened at those thundering shouts but the young ladies were usually of opinions so similar that the louder grew the cheers the more they laughed and exulted so carried along that no cares could be remembered  making a way through the thronged area behold the procession of scarlet doctors advancing through the midst till the red and black vicechancellor sat enthroned in the centre and the scarlet line became a semicircle dividing the flowergarden of ladies from the black mass below  then came the introduction of the honorary doctors one by one with the latin speech which ethels companions unreasonably required her to translate to them while she was using all her ears to catch a word or two and her eyes to glimpse at the features of men of note  byandby a youth made his appearance in the rostrum and a good deal of latin ensued of which flora hoped ethel was less tired than she was in time however meta saw the spectacles removed and george looking straight up and she drew down her veil and took hold of floras hand and ethel flushed like a hot coal nevertheless all contrived to see a tall figure with face much flushed and hands moving nervously the world was tired and people were departing so that the first lines were lost perhaps a satisfaction to norman but his voice soon cleared and became louder his eyes lighted and ethel knew the funny state had come to his reliefpeoples attention was arrestedthere was no more going away  it was well that norman was ignorant of the fears for harry for four lines had been added since ethel had seen the poem saying how selfsacrifice sent forth the sailorboy from home to the lone watch the wave and storm his spirit rising high ere manhood braced his form  applause did not come where ethel had expected it and at first there was silence at the close but suddenly the acclamations rose with deafening loudness though hardly what greets some poems with more to catch the popular ear  ethels great excitement was over and presently she found herself outside of the theatre a shower falling and an umbrella held over her by mr ogilvie who was asking her if it was not admirable and declaring the poem might rank with hebers palestine or milmans apollo  they were bound for a great luncheon at one of the colleges where ethel might survey the principal with whom miss rich had corresponded mr ogilvie sat next to her told her all the names and quizzed the dignitaries but she had a sense of depression and did not wish to enter into the usual strain of banter he dropped his lively tone and drew her out about harry till she was telling eagerly of her dear sailor brother and found him so sympathising and considerate that she did not like him less though she felt her intercourse with him a sort of intoxication that would only make it the worse for her byandby  during that whole luncheon and their walk through the gardens where there was a beautiful horticultural show something was always prompting her to say while in this quasiprivacy that she was on the eve of departure but she kept her resolution against itshe thought it would have been an unwarrantable experiment when they returned to their inn they found norman looking fagged but relieved half asleep on the sofa with a novel in his hand he roused himself as they came in and to avoid any compliments on his own performance began well ethel are you ready for the ball  we shall spare her the ball said dr may there is a report about the alcestis in the newspaper that may make margaret uncomfortable and this good sister will not stay away from her  norman started up crying what papa  it is a mere nothing in reality said dr may only what we knew before and he showed his son the paragraph which norman read as a death warrant the colour ebbed from his lips and cheeks he trembled so that he was obliged to sit down and without speaking he kept his eyes fixed on the words serious apprehensions are entertained with regard to h m s alcestis captain gordon  if you had seen as many newspaper reports come to nothing as i have you would not take this so much to heart said dr may i expect to hear that this very mail has brought letters  and meta added that at luncheon she had been seated next to one of the honorary doctorsa naval captainwho had been making discoveries in the south sea and that he had scouted the notion of harm befalling the alcestis and given all manner of reassuring suppositions as to her detention adding besides that no one believed the australian paper whence the report was taken he had seen the alcestis knew captain gordon and spoke of him as one of the safest people in the world had his acquaintance extended to lieutenants and midshipmen it would have been perfect as it was the tidings brought back the blood to normans cheek and the light to his eye  when do we set off was normans question  at five said ethel you mean it papa  i did intend it if i had gone alone but i shall not take you till eight nor you norman at all  norman was bent on returning but his father and flora would not hear of it flora could not spare him and dr may was afraid of the effect of anxiety on nerves and spirits so sensitive while this was going on mr ogilvie looked at ethel in consternation and said are you really going home  yes my eldest sister must not be left alone when she hears this  he looked downethel had the resolution to walk away flora could not give up the ball and meta found that she must go but both the normans spent a quiet evening with dr may and ethel norman may had a bad headache which he was allowed to have justly earned dr may was very happy reviving all his scottish recollections and talking to young ogilvie about edinburgh once there was a private consultation ethel was provoked and ashamed at the throbs that it would excite what on a weeks acquaintance  when alone with her father she began to nerve herself for something heroic and great was her shame when she heard only of her cousins kind consideration for her brother whom he wished to take home with him and thence to see the highlands so as to divert his anxiety for harry as well as to call him off from the studies with which he had this term overworked himself even more than usual dr may had given most grateful consent and he spoke highly in praise of the youth but there was no more to come and ethel could have beaten herself for the moment of anticipation  meta came home apologising for wakening ethel but ethel had not been asleep the ball had not it seemed been as charming to her as most events were and ethel heard a sigh as the little lady lay down in her bed  late as it was when she went to rest meta rose to see the travellers off she sent hosts of messages to her father and wished she might go with them george and flora were not visible and dr may was leaving messages for them and for norman in her charge when the two balliol men walked in  ethel had hoped it was over yet she could not be sorry that the two youths escorted them to the station and as ethel was placed in the carriage she believed that she heard something of never forgettinghappiest weekbut in the civilities which the other occupant of the carriage was offering for the accommodation of their lesser luggage she lost the exact words and the last she heard were goodbye i hope you will find letters at home     chapter x         true to the kindred points of heaven and home                                              wordsworth   etheldreds dream was over she had wakened to the inside of a great western carriage her father beside her and opposite a thin foreignlooking gentleman her father to whom her life was to be devoted she looked at his profile defined against the window and did not repent in a sort of impulse to do something for him she took his hat from his hand and was going to dispose of it in the roof when he turned smiling his thanks but saying it was not worth whilethis carriage was a very transitory restingplace  the stranger at that moment sprang to his feet exclaiming dick himself  spencer old fellow is it you cried dr may in a voice of equal amazement and joy holding out his hand which was grasped and wrung with a force that made ethel shrink for the poor maimed arm  ha what is amiss with your arm was the immediate question three technical words were spoken in a matteroffact way as dr may replaced his hand in his bosom and then with an eager smile said ethel here you have heard of him  ethel had indeed and gave her hand cordially surprised by the bow and air of deferential politeness with which it was received like a favour while dr spencer asked her whether she had been staying in oxford  ay and what for do you think said dr may joyously  you dont say that was your son who held forth yesterday i thought his voice had a trick of yoursbut then i thought you would have held by old cambridge  what could i do said dr may deprecatingly the boy would go and get a balliol scholarship  why the lad is a genius a poetno mistake about it but i scarcely thought you could have one of such an age  of his age his brother is in holy ordersone of his sisters is married theres for you spencer  bless me dick i thought myself a young man  what with hair of that colour said dr may looking at his friends milkwhite locks  bleached by that frightful sickly season at poonshedagore when i thought i was done for but you youthe boy of the whole lot you think me very disrespectful to your father added he turning to ethel but you see what old times are  i know said ethel with a bright look  so you were in the theatre yesterday continued dr may but there is no seeing any one in such a throng how long have you been in england  a fortnight i went at once to see my sister at malvern there i fell in with rudden the man i was with in new guinea he was going up to be made an honorary doctor and made me come with him  and where are you bound for as the train showed signs of a halt  for london i meant to hunt up mat fleet and hear of you and other old friends  does he expect you  no one expects me i am a regular vagabond  come home with us said dr may laying his hand on his arm i cannot part with you so soon come find your luggage take your ticket for gloucester  so suddenly will it not be inconvenient said he looking tempted but irresolute  oh no no pray come said ethel eagerly we shall be so glad  he looked his courteous thanks and soon was with them enroute for stoneborough  ethels thoughts were diverted from all she had left at oxford she could not but watch those two old friends she knew enough of the traveller to enter into her fathers happiness and to have no fears is of another sir matthew  they had been together at stoneborough at cambridge at paris at edinburgh always linked in the closest friendship but by dr mays own account his friend had been the diligent one of the pair a bright compound of principle and spirit and highly distinguished in all his studies and dr mays model of perfection their paths had since lain far apart and they had not seen each other since twentysix years ago they had parted in londonthe one to settle at his native town while the other accepted a situation as travelling physician on his return he had almost sacrificed his life by selfdevoted attendance on a feverstricken emigrantship he had afterwards received an appointment in india and there the correspondence had died away and dr may had lost traces of him only knowing that in a visitation of cholera he had again acted with the same carelessness of his own life and a severe illness which had broken up his health had occasioned him to relinquish his post  it now appeared that he had thought himself coming home ever since he had gone to recruit in the himalayas and had become engrossed in scientific observations on their altitudes as well as investigations in natural history going to calcutta he had fallen in with a party about to explore the asiatic islands and he had accompanied them as well as going on an expedition into the interior of australia he had been employed in various sanitary arrangements there and in india and had finally worked his way slowly home overland visiting egypt and palestine and refreshing his memory with every italian german or french cathedral or work of art that had delighted him in early days  he was a slight small man much sunburned nearly bald and his hair snowy but his eyes were beautiful very dark soft and smiling and yet their gaze peculiarly keen and steady as if ready for any emergency and his whole frame was full of alertness and vigour his voice was clear and sweet and his manner most refined and polished indeed his courtesy to ethel whenever there was a change of carriage was so exemplary that she understood it as the effect on a chivalrous mind of living where a lady was a rare and precious article it frightened ethel a little at first but before the end of the journey she had already begun to feel towards him like an old friendone of those inheritances who are so much valued and loved like a sort of unclesinfriendship she had an especial grateful honour for the delicate tact which asked no questions as she saw his eye often falling anxiously on her fathers left hand where the wedding ring shone upon the little finger  there was talk enough upon his travels on public changes and on old friends but after those first few words home had never been mentioned  when at five oclock the engine blew its whistle at the old familiar station dr may had scarcely put his head out before adams hastened up to him with a note  all well at home  yes sir miss margaret sent up the gig  i must go at once said dr may hastilythe larkins child is worse ethel take care of him and introduce him love to margaret ill be at home before tea  he was driven off at speed and ethel proposed to walk home dr spencer gave her his arm and was silent but presently said in a low anxious voice my dear you must forgive me i have heard nothing for many years your mother  it was an accident said ethel looking straight before her it was when papas arm was hurt the carriage was overturned  and repeated dr spencer earnestly  she was killed on the spot said ethel speaking shortly and abruptly if she was to say it at all she could not do so otherwise  he was dreadfully shockedshe knew it by the shudder of his arm and a tight suppressed groan he did not speak and ethel as if a relief from the silence must be made said what was not very consoling and equally blunt margaret had some harm done to her spineshe cannot walk  he did not seem to hear but walked on as in a dream where ethel guided him and she would not interrupt him again  they had just passed mr bramshaws office when a voice was heard behind calling miss ethel miss ethel and edward anderson now articled to mr bramshaw burst out pen in hand and looking shabby and inky  miss ethel he said breathlessly i beg your pardon but have you heard from harry  no said ethel have they had that paper at home  not that i know of said edward my mother wanted to send it but i would not take itnot while dr may was away  thank youthat was very kind of you  and oh miss ethel do you think it is true  we hope not said ethel kindlywe saw a captain at oxford who thought it not at all to be depended on  i am so glad said edward and shaking hands he went back to his high stool ethel feeling that he deserved the pains that norman had taken to spare and befriend him she spoke to her companion in explanation we are very anxious for news of my next brothers ship alcestis in the pacific  more exclaimed poor dr spencer almost overpowered good heavens i thought may at least was happy  he is not unhappy said ethel not sorry that they had arrived at the back entrance of the shrubbery  how long ago was this said he standing still as soon as they had passed into the garden  four years next october i assure you his spirits are almost always good  when i was at adelaide little thinking he sighed then recollecting himself forgive me i have given you pain  no she said or rather i gave you more  i knew her and there he broke off paused for a minute then collecting himself seemed resolutely to turn away from the subject and said walking on this garden is not much altered  at that moment a little shrill voice broke out in remonstrance among the laurelsbut you know daisy you are the captain of the forty thieves  a startling announcement said dr spencer looking at ethel and the next two steps brought them in view of the playplace in the laurels where aubrey lay on the ground feigning sleep but keeping a watchful eye over blanche who was dropping something into the holes of inverted flowerpots gertrude dancing about in a way that seemed to have called for the reproof of the more earnest actors  ethel ethel screamed the children with one voice and while the two girls stood in shyness at her companion aubrey had made a dart at her neck and hung upon her arms legs body and all like a wild cat  that will do that will do old manlet go speak to dr spencer my dear  blanche did so demurely and asked where was papa  coming as soon as he has been to mrs larkinss poor baby  george larkins has been here said aubrey and i have finished vipera et lima ethel but margaret makes such false quantities  what is your name youngster said dr spencer laying his hand on aubreys head  aubrey spencer may was the answer  hey day where did you steal my name exclaimed dr spencer while aubrey stood abashed at so mysterious an accusation  oh exclaimed blanche seizing on ethel and whispering is it really the boy that climbed the market cross  you see your fame lives here said ethel smiling as dr spencer evidently heard  he was a little boy said aubrey indignantly looking at the grayhaired man  there said ethel to dr spencer  the tables turned he said laughing heartily but do not let me keep you you would wish to prepare your sister for a stranger and i shall improve my acquaintance here where are the forty thieves  i am all of them said the innocent daisyfaced gertrude and ethel hastened towards the house glad of the permission granted by his true goodbreeding  there was a shriek of welcome from mary who sat working beside margaret ethel was certain that no evil tidings had come to her eldest sister so joyous was her exclamation of wonder and rebuke to her homesick ethel naughty girl running home at once i did think you would have been happy there  so i was said ethel hastily but who do you think i have brought home margaret flushed with such a pink that ethel resolved never to set her guessing again and hurried to explain and having heard that all was well and taken her housekeeping measures she proceeded to fetch the guest but mary who had been unusually silent all this time ran after her and checked her  ethel have you heard she said  have you said ethel  george larkins rode in this morning to see when papa would come home and he told me he said i had better not tell margaret for he did not believe it  and you have not that is very good of you mary  oh i am glad you are come i could not have helped telling if you had been away a whole week but ethel does papa believe it poor marys full lip swelled and her eyes swam ready to laugh or weep in full faith in her sisters answer  ethel told of metas captain and the smile predominated and settled down into marys usual broad beamy look like a benignant rising sun on the sign of an inn as ethel praised her warmly for a fortitude and consideration of which she had not thought her capable  dr spencer was discovered full in the midst of the comedy of the forty thieves alternating as required between the robbercaptain and the ass and the children in perfect ecstasies with him  they all followed in his train to the drawingroom and were so clamorous that he could have no conversation with margaret he certainly made them so but ethel remembering what a blow her disclosures had been thought it would be only a kindness to send aubrey to show him to his room where he might have some peace  she was not sorry to be very busy so as to have little time to reply to the questions on the doings at oxford and the cause of her sudden return and yet it would have been a comfort to be able to sit down to understand herself and recall her confused thoughts but solitary reflection was a thing only to be hoped for in that house in bed and ethel was obliged to run up and down and attend to everybody under an undefined sense that she had come home to a dull anxious world of turmoil  margaret seemed to guess nothing that was one comfort she evidently thought that her return was fully accounted for by the fascination of her papas presence in a strange place she gave ethel no credit for the sacrifice naturally supposing that she could not enjoy herself away from home ethel did not know whether to be glad or not she was relieved but it was flat as to norman ogilvie one or two inquiries whether she liked him and if norman were going to scotland with him were all that passed and it was very provoking to be made so hot and conscious by them  she could not begin to dress till late and while she was unpacking she heard her father come home among the childrens loud welcomes and go to the drawingroom he presently knocked at the door between their rooms  so margaret does not know he said  no mary has been so very good and she told what had passed  well done mary i must tell her so she is a good girl on a pinch you see  and we dont speak of it now or will it hurt margaret more to think we keep things from her  that is the worst risk of the two i have seen great harm done in that way mention it but without seeming to make too much of it  wont you papa  you had betterit will seem of less importance i think nothing of it myself  nevertheless ethel saw that he could not trust himself to broach the subject to margaret  how was the larkins baby  doing better what have you done with spencer  i put him into richards room the children were eating him up he is so kind to them  ay i say ethel that was a happy consequence of your coming home with me  what a delightful person he is  is he not a true knight errant as he always was i could not tell you what i owed to him as a boyall my life i may say ethel he added suddenly we must do our best to make him happy here i know it nowi never guessed it then but one is very hard and selfish when one is happy  what do you mean papa  i see it now continued dr may incoherently the cause of his wandering lifeadvantages thrown aside he the most worthy things i little heeded at the time have come back on me i understand why he banished himself  why asked ethel bewildered  she never had an idea of it but i might have guessed from what fell from him unconsciously for not a word would he have saidnor did he say to show how he sacrificed himself  who was it aunt flora said ethel beginning to collect his meaning  no ethel it was your own dear mother you will think this another romantic fancy of mine but i am sure of it  so am i said ethel  howwhat ah i remembered after we parted that he might know nothing  he asked me said ethel  and how did he bear it  ethel told and the tears filled her fathers eyes  it was wrong and cruel in me to bring him home unprepared and then to leave it to you i always forget other peoples feelings poor spencer and now ethel you see what manner of man we have here and how we ought to treat him  indeed i do  the most unselfishthe most selfsacrificing continued dr may and to see what it all turned on i happened to have this place open to methe very cause perhaps of my having taken things easyand so the old professor threw opportunities in my way while aubrey spencer with every recommendation that man could have was set aside and exiled himself leaving the station and all he might so easily have gained ah ethel sir matthew fleet never came near him in ability but not one word to interfere with me would he say andhow i have longed to meet him again after parting in my selfish unfeeling gladness and now i have nothing to do for him but show him how little i was to be trusted with her  ethel never knew how to deal with these occasional bursts of grief but she said that she thought dr spencer was very much pleased to have met with him and delighted with the children  ah well you are her children said dr may with his hand on ethels shoulder  so they went downstairs and found mary making tea and margaret fearing dr spencer was overwhelmed with his young admirersfor aubrey and gertrude were one on each knee and blanche standing beside him inflicting on him a catalogue of the names and ages of all the eleven  ethel has introduced you i see said dr may  ay i assure you it was an alarming introduction no sooner do i enter your garden than i hear that i am in the midst of the forty thieves i find a young lady putting the world to death after the fashion of hamletand looking about to find what i have lost i find this urchin has robbed me of my namea property i supposed was always left to unfortunate travellers however small they might be chopped themselves  well aubrey boy will you make restitution  it is my name said aubrey positively for as his father added he is not without dread of the threat being fulfilled and himself left to be that anon who blanche says writes so much poetry  aubrey privately went to ethel to ask her if this were possible and she had to reassure him by telling him that they were only in fun  it was fun with a much deeper current though for dr spencer was saying with a smile between gratification and sadness i did not think my name would have been remembered here so long  we had used up mine and the grandfathers and the uncles and began to think we might look a little further afield said dr may if i had only known where you were i would have asked you to be the varlets godfather but i was much afraid you were nowhere in the land of the living  i have but one godson and he is coffeecoloured i ought to have written but you see for seven years i thought i was coming home  aubrey had recovered sufficiently to observe to blanche that was almost as bad as ulysses which being overheard and repeated led to the information that he was ethels pupil whereupon dr spencer began to inquire after the school and to exclaim at his friend for having deserted it in the person of tom dr may looked convicted but said it was all normans fault and dr spencer shaking his head at blanche opined that the young gentleman was a great innovater and that he was sure he was at the bottom of the pulling down the market cross and the stopping up randalls alleyiniquities of the nasty people of which she already had made him aware  poor norman he suffered enough anent randalls alley said dr may but as to the market cross that came down a year before he was born  it was the town council said ethel  one of the ordinary stultifications of town councils  take care spencer said dr may i am a town council man myself  you dick and he turned with a start of astonishment and went into a fit of laughing reechoed by all the young ones who were especially tickled by hearing from another the abbreviation that had hitherto only lived in the favourite expletive as sure as my name is dick may  of course said dr may dost thou not suspect my place dost thou not suspect my years one that hath two gowns and everything handsome about him  his friend laughed the more and they betook themselves to the college stories of which the quotation from dogberry seemed to have reminded them  there was something curious and affecting in their manner to each other often it was the easy bantering familiarity of the two youths they had once been together with somewhat of elder brotherhood on dr spencers sideand of looking up on dr maysand just as they had recurred to these terms some allusion would bring back to dr spencer that the heedless highspirited dick whom he had always had much ado to keep out of scrapes was a householder a man of weight and influence a light which would at first strike him as most ludicrous and then mirth would end in a sigh for there was yet another aspect after having thought of him so long as the happy husband of margaret mackenzie he found her place vacant and the trace of deep grief apparent on the countenance once so gaythe oppression of anxiety marked on the brow formerly so joyous the merriment almost more touching than gravity would have been for the former nature seemed rather shattered than altered in merging towards this side there was a tender respect in dr spencers manner that was most beautiful though this evening such subjects were scrupulously kept at the utmost distance by the constant interchange of new and old jokes and stories  only when bedtime had come and margaret had been carried offdid a silence fall on the two friends unbroken till dr may rose and proposed going upstairs when he gave his hand to wish goodnight dr spencer held it this time most carefully and said oh may i did not expect this  i should have prepared you said his host but i never recollected that you knew nothing  i had dwelt on your happiness  there never were two happier creatures for twentytwo years said dr may his voice low with emotion sorrow spared her yes think of her always in undimmed brightnessalways smiling as you remember her she was happy she is he concluded his friend had turned aside and hidden his face with his hands then looked up for a moment and you dick he said briefly  sorrow spared her was dr mays first answer and hers are very good children  there was a silence again ending in dr mays saying what do you think of my poor girl  they discussed the nature of the injury dr spencer could not feel otherwise than that it was a very hopeless matter her father owned that he had thought so from the first and had wondered at sir matthew fleets opinion his subdued tone of patience and resignation struck his guest above all as changed from what he had once been  you have been sorely tried he said when they parted at his room door  i have received much good simply answered dr may goodnight i am glad to have you hereif you can bear it  bear it dick how like that girl is to you she is yourself  such a self as i never was goodnight  ethel overcame the difficulty of giving the account of the newspaper alarm with tolerable success by putting the story of metas conversation foremost margaret did not take it to heart as much as she had feared nor did she appear to dwell on it afterwards the truth was perhaps that dr spencers visit was to every one more of an excitement and amusement than it was to ethel not that she did not like him extremely but after such a week as she had been spending the homeworld seemed rather stale and unprofitable  miss bracy relapsed into a state of feelings imagining that ethel had distrusted her capabilities and therefore returned or as ethel herself sometimes feared there might be irritability in her own manner that gave cause of annoyance the children were inclined to be riotous with their new friend who made much of them continually and especially patronised aubrey mary was proud of showing how much she had learned to do for margaret in her sisters absence dr may was so much taken up with his friend that ethel saw less of him than usual and she began to believe that it had been all a mistake that every one was so dependent on her for in fact they did much better without her  meantime she heard of the gaieties which the others were enjoying and she could not feel heroic when they regretted her at the end of a week meta rivers was escorted home from warwick by two servants and came to stoneborough giving a lively description of all the concluding pleasures but declaring that ethels departure had taken away the zest of the whole and mr ogilvie had been very disconsolate margaret had not been prepared to hear that mr ogilvie had been so constant a companion and was struck by finding that ethel had passed over one who had evidently been so great an ingredient in the delights of the expedition meta had however observed nothingshe was a great deal too simple and too much engrossed for such notions to have crossed her mind but margaret inferred something and hoped to learn more when she should see flora this would not be immediately george and his wife were gone to london and thence intended to pay a round of visits and norman had accompanied his namesake to glenbracken  ethel fought hard with her own petulance and sense of tedium at home which was as she felt particularly uncalled for at present when dr spencer was enlivening them so much he was never in the way he was always either busy in the diningroom in the morning with books and papers or wandering about his old schoolboy haunts in the town or taking adams place and driving out dr may or sometimes joining the children in a walk to their supreme delight his sketches for he drew most beautifully were an endless pleasure to margaret with his explanations of themshe even tried to sit up to copy them and he began to teach blanche to draw the evenings when there was certain to be some entertaining talk going on between the two doctors were very charming and margaret seemed quite revived by seeing her father so happy with his friend ethel knew she ought to be happy also and if attention could make her so she had it for kind and courteous as dr spencer was to all she seemed to have a double charm for him it was as if he found united in her the quaint brusquerie that he had loved in her father with somewhat of her mother for though ethel had less personal resemblance to mrs may than any other of the family dr spencer transferred to her much of the chivalrous distant devotion with which he had regarded her mother ethel was very little conscious of it but he was certainly her sworn knight and there was an eagerness in his manner of performing every little service for her a deference in his way of listening to her over and above his ordinary polish of manner  ethel lighted up and enjoyed herself when talking was going onher periods of ennui were when she had to set about any home employmentwhen aubreys lessons did not go wellwhen she wanted to speak to her father and could not catch him and even when she had to go to cocksmoor  she did not seem to make any progress therethe room was very full and very close the children were dull and she began to believe she was doing no goodit was all a weariness but she was so heartily ashamed of her feelings that she worked the more vehemently for them and the utmost show that they outwardly made was that margaret thought her less vivacious than her wont and she was a little too peremptory at times with mary and blanche she had so much disliked the display that flora had made about cocksmoor that she had imposed total silence on it upon her younger sisters and dr spencer had spent a fortnight at stoneborough without being aware of their occupation when there occurred such an extremely sultry day that margaret remonstrated with ethel on her intention of broiling herself and mary by walking to cocksmoor when the quicksilver stood at 80° in the shade  ethel was much inclined to stay at home but she did not know whether this was from heat or from idleness and her fretted spirits took the turn of determinationso she posted off at a galloping pace that her brothers called her cocksmoor speed and mary panted by her side humbly petitioning for the plantation path when she answered that it was as well to be hot in the sun as in the shade  the schoolroom was unusually full all the haymaking mothers made it serve as an infant school and though as much window was opened as there could be the effect was not coolness nevertheless ethel sat down and gathered her class round her and she had just heard the chapter once read when there was a little confusion a frightened cry of ethel and before she could rise to her feeta flump upon the floorpoor mary had absolutely fainted dead away  ethel was much terrified and very angry with herself mary was no light weight but mrs elwood coming at their cry helped ethel to drag her into the outer room where she soon began to recover and to be excessively puzzled as to what had happened to her she said the sea was roaring and where was harry and then she looked much surprised to find herself lying on mrs elwoods damp flagsa circumstance extremely distressing to mrs elwood who wanted to carry her upstairs into cherrys room very clean and very white but with such a sun shining full into it  ethel lavished all care and reproached herself greatly though to be sure nothing had ever been supposed capable of hurting mary and mary herself protested that nothing at all had ailed her till the childrens voices began to sound funny and turned into the waves of the sea and therewith poor mary burst into a great flood of tears and asked whether harry would ever come back the tears did her a great deal of good though not so much as the being petted by ethel and she soon declared herself perfectly well but ethel could not think of letting her walk home and sent off a boywho she trusted would not faintwith a note to margaret desiring her to send the gig which fortunately was at home today  mary had partaken of some of mrs elwoods tea which though extremely bitter seemed a great cordial and was sitting quite revived in the arbour at the door when the gig stopped and dr spencer walked in  well and how are you  quite well now thank you was margaret frightened why did you come  i thought it would make her happier as your father was not at home here let me feel your pulse do you think no one is a doctor but your papa theres not much the matter with you however where is ethel  in the school and mary opened the door dr spencer looked in as ethel came out and his face put her in mind of normans look  no wonder was all he said  ethel was soon satisfied that he did not think mary ill in fact he said fainting was the most natural and justifiable measure under the circumstances how many human creatures do you keep there he asked  fortyseven today said mary proudly  i shall indict you for cruelty to animals i think i have known it hotter at poonshedagore but there we had punkahs  it was very wrong of me said ethel i should have thought of poor mary in that sunny walk but mary never complains  oh never mind said mary it did not hurt  im not thinking of mary said dr spencer but of the wretched beings you are leaving shut up there i wonder what the mercury would be there  we cannot help it said mary we cannot get the ground  and mary having been voted into the seat of honour and comfort by his side in the carriage told her version of cocksmoor and the committee while ethel sat up in the little narrow seat behind severely reproaching herself for her want of consideration towards one so good and patient as mary who proved to have been suffering far more on harrys account than they had guessed and who was so simple and thoroughgoing in doing her duty this was not being a good elder sister and when they came home she confessed it and showed so much remorse that poor mary was quite shocked and cried so bitterly that it was necessary to quit the subject  ethel dearest said margaret that night after they were in bed is there anything the matter  no nothing but that oxford has spoiled me said ethel resolutely i am very cross and selfish  it will be better byandby said margaret if only you are sure you have nothing to make you unhappy  nothing said ethel she was becoming too much ashamed of her fancy to breathe one word about it and she had spoken the truth pleasure had spoiled her  if only we could do something for cocksmoor she sighed presently with that one hundred and fifty pounds lying idle  margaret was very glad that her thoughts were taking this channel but it was not a promising one for there seemed to be nothing practicable present or future the ground could not be hadthe pig would not get over the stilethe old woman could not get home tonight cocksmoor must put up with its present school and mary must not be walked to death  or as ethel drew her own moral sacrifice must not be selfish one great resolution that has been costly must not blunt us in the daily details of life     chapter xi      if to do were as easy as to know what were good to do chapels had   been churches and poor mens cottages princes palaces                                              merchant of venice   dick said dr spencer as the friends sat together in the evening after marys swoon you seem to have found an expedient for making havoc among your daughters  it does not hurt them said dr may carelessly  pretty well after the specimen of today  that was chance  if you like it i have no more to say but i should like to make you sit for two hours in such a temperature if they were mine  very fine talking but i would not take the responsibility of hindering the only pains that have ever been taken with that unlucky place you dont know that girl ethel she began at fifteen entirely of her own accord and has never faltered if any of the children there are saved from perdition it is owing to her and i am not going to be the man to stop her they are strong healthy girls and i cannot see that it does them any harmrather good  have you any special predilection for a room eight feet by nine  cant be helped what would you have said if you had seen the last  what is this about one hundred and fifty pounds in hand  the ladies here chose to have a fancy fair the only result of which hitherto has been the taking away my flora there is the money but the land cant be had  why not  tied up between the drydale estate and  college and in the hands of the quarry master nicolson there was an application made to the college but they did not begin at the right end  upon my word dick you take it easy cried his friend rather indignantly  i own i have not stirred in the matter said dr may i knew nothing would come to good under the pack of silly women that our schools are ridden with and as he heard a sound a little like pish he continued and that old ramsden it is absolutely useless to work with such a heador no head theres nothing for it but to wait for better times instead of setting up independent insubordinate action  you are the man to leave venerable abuses undisturbed  the cure is worse than the disease  there spoke the corporation  ah it was not the way you set to work in poonshedagore  why really when the venerable abuses consisted of hindoos praying to their own threelegged stools and keeping sacred monkeys in honour of the ape hanyuman it was a question whether one could be a christian oneself and suffer it undisturbed it was coming it too strong when i was requested to lend my own stepladder for the convenience of an exhibition of a devotee swinging on hooks in his sides  dr spencer had in fact never rested till he had established a mission in his former remote station and his brown godson once a brahmin now an exemplary clergyman traced his conversion to the friendship and example of the english physician  well i have lashed about me at abuses in my time said dr may  i dare say you have dick and they both laughedthe inconsiderate way was so well delineated  just so replied dr may and i made enemies enough to fetter me now i do not mean that i have done righti have not but there is a good deal on my hands and i dont write easily i have been slower to take up new matters than i ought to have been  i see i see said dr spencer rather sorry for his implied reproach but must cocksmoor be left to its fate and your gallant daughter to hers  the vicar wont stir he is indolent enough by nature and worse with gout and i do not see what good i could do i once offended the tenant nicolson by fining him for cheating his unhappy labourers on the abominable truck system and he had rather poison me than do anything to oblige me and as to the copyholder he is a fine gentleman who never comes near the place nor does anything for it  who is he  sir henry walkinghame  sir henry walkinghame i know the man i found him in one of the caves at thebes among the mummies laid up with a fever nearly ready to be a mummy himself i remember bleeding himirregular was not it but one does not stand on ceremony in pharaohs tomb i got him through with it we came up the nile together and the last i saw of him was at alexandria he is your man something might be done with him  i believe flora promises to ask him if she should ever meet him in london but he is always away if ever we should be happy enough to get an active incumbent we shall have a chance  two days after ethel came down equipped for cocksmoor it was as hot as ever and mary was ordered to stay at home being somewhat pacified by a promise that she should go again as soon as the weather was fit for anything but a salamander  dr spencer was in the hall with his bamboo his great panama hat and gray loose coat for he entirely avoided except on sundays the medical suit of black he offered to relieve ethel of her bag of books  no thank you he had them by this time but i am going to cocksmoor  will you allow me to be your companion  i shall be very glad of the pleasure of your company but i am not in the least afraid of going alone said she smiling however so as to show she was glad of such pleasant company i forewarn you though that i have business there  i will find occupation  and you must promise not to turn against me i have undergone a great deal already about that place norman was always preaching against it and now that he has become reasonable i cant have papa set against it againbesides he would mind you more  dr spencer promised to do nothing but what was quite reasonable ethel believed that he accompanied her merely because his gallantry would not suffer her to go unescorted and she was not sorry for it was too long a walk for solitude to be very agreeable when strange wagoners might be on the road though she had never let them be lions in the path  the walk was as pleasant as a scorching sun would allow and by the time they arrived at the scattered cottages ethel had been drawn into explaining many of her cocksmoor perplexities  if you could get the land granted where should you choose to have it he asked you know it will not do to go and say be pleased to give me a piece of land without specifying what or you might chance to have one at the lands end  i see that was one of the blunders said ethel but i had often thought of this nice little square place between two gardens and sheltered by the old quarry  ha hardly space enough i should say replied dr spencer stepping it out no that wont do so confined by the quarry let us look farther  a surmise crossed ethel could he be going to take the work on himself but that was too wild a suppositionshe knew he had nothing of his own only a moderate pension from the east india company  what do you think of this he said coming to the slope of a knoll commanding a pretty view of the abbotstoke woods clear from houses and yet not remote from the hamlet she agreed that it would do well and he kicked up a bit of turf and pryed into the soil pronouncing it dry and fit for a good foundation then he began to step it out making a circuit that amazed her but he said it is of no use to do it at twice your school can be only the first step towards a church and you had better have roomenough at once it will serve as an endowment in the meantime  he would not let her remain in the sun and she went into school she found him when she came out sitting in the arbour smoking a cigarrather a shock to her feelings though he threw it away the instant she appeared and she excused him for his foreign habits  in the evening he brought down a travellers case of instruments and proceeded to draw a beautiful little map of cocksmoor where it seemed that he had taken all his measurements whilst she was in school he ended by an imaginary plan and elevation for the school with a pretty oriel window and bellgable that made ethel sigh with delight at the bare idea  next day he vanished after dinner but this he often did he used to say he must go and have a holiday of smokinghe could not bear too much civilised society he came back for tea however and had not sat down long before he said now i know all about it i shall pack up my goods and be off for vienna tomorrow  to vienna was the general and dolorous outcry and gertrude laid hold of him and said he should not go  i am coming back he said if you will have me the college holds a court at fordholm on the 3rd and on the last of this month i hope to return  college court what are you going to do at vienna where have you left your senses asked dr may  i find sir henry walkinghame is there i have been on an exploring expedition to drydale found out his man of business and where he is to be written to the college holds a court at fordholm and i hope to have our business settled  ethel was too much confounded to speak her father was exclaiming on the shortness of the time  plenty of time said dr spencer demonstrating that he should be able to travel comfortably and have four days to spare at viennaa journey which he seemed to think less of than did dr may of going to london  as to checking him of that there was no possibility nor indeed notion though ethel did not quite know how to believe in it nor that the plan could come to good ethel was much better by this time by her vigorous efforts she had recovered her tone of mind and interest in what was passing and though now and then normans letters carrying sentences of remembrance made her glow a little she was so steady to her resolution that she averted all traffic in messages through her brothers correspondence and in that fear allowed it to lapse into margarets hands more than she had ever done indeed no one greatly liked writing from home it was heartless work to say always no news from the alcestis and yet they all declared they were not anxious  hector ernescliffe knelt a great while beside margarets sofa on the first evening of his holidays and there was a long lowvoiced talk between them ethel wished that she had warned him off for margaret looked much more harassed and anxious after having heard the outpouring of all that was on his mind  dr spencer thought her looking worse when he came as come he did on the appointed day he had brought sir henry walkinghames full consent to the surrender of the land drawn up in such form as could be acted upon and a letter to his man of business but nicolson he was a worse dragon nearer home hating all schools especially hating dr may  however said dr spencer in eastern form have i encountered rajahs and smoked pipes with threetailed pachas that i should dread the face of the father of quarrymen  what he did with the father of quarrymen was not known whether he talked him over or bought him offmargaret hoped the former dr may feared the latter the results were certain mr nicolson had agreed that the land should be given up  the triumphant dr spencer sat down to write a statement to be shown to the college authorities when they should come to hold their court  the land must be put into the hands of trustees he said the incumbent of course  then yourself and we must have another your soninlaw  you i should think said dr may  i why i am going  going but not gone said his friend  i must go i tell you dick i must have a place of my own to smoke my pipe in  is that all said dr may i think you might be accommodated here unless you wished to be near your sister  my sister is always resorting to wateringplaces my nieces do nothing but play on the piano no i shall perhaps go off to america the only place i have not seen yet and i more than half engaged to go and help at poonshedagore  better order your coffin then muttered dr may  i shall try lodgings in london near the old hospital perhapsand go and turn over the british museum library  look you here spencer i have a much better plan do you know that scrap of a house of mine by the back gate just big enough for you and your pipe set up your staff there ethel will never get her school built without you  oh that would be capital cried ethel  it would be the best speculation for me you would pay rent and the last old woman never did continued dr may a garden the length of this one  but i sayi want to be near the british museum  take a seasonticket and run up once a week  i shall teach your boys to smoke  ill see to that  you have given cocksmoor one lift said ethel and it will never go on without you  it is such a nice house added the children in chorus it would be such fun to have you there  daisy will never be able to spare her other doctor said margaret smiling  run to mrs adams tom and get the key said dr may  there was a putting on of hats and bonnets and the whole party walked down the garden to inspect the housea matter of curiosity to somefor it was where the old lady had resided on whom harry had played so many tricks and the subject of many myths hatched between him and george larkins  it was an odd little narrow slip of a house four stories of two rooms all the way up each with a large window with a marked white eyebrow dr may eagerly pointed out all the conveniences parlour museum smoking den while dr spencer listened and answered doubtfully and the childrens clamorous anxiety seemed to render him the more silent  hector ernescliffe discovered a jackdaws nest in the chimney whereupon the whole train rushed off to investigate leaving the two doctors and ethel standing together in the empty parlour dr may pressing dr spencer raising desultory objections but so evidently against his own wishes that ethel said now indeed you must not disappoint us all  no said dr may it is a settled thing  no no thanks thanks to you all but it cannot be let me go and he spoke with emotion you are very kind but it is not to be thought of  why not said dr may spencer stay with me and he spoke with a pleading almost dependent air why should you go  it is of no use to talk about it you are very kind but it will not do to encumber you with a lone man growing old  we have been young together said dr may  and you must not leave papa added ethel  no said dr may trouble may be at hand help us through with it remember these children have no uncles  you will stay said ethel  he made a sign of assenthe could do no more and just then gertrude came trotting back so exceedingly smutty as to call everybodys attention hector had been shoving tom halfway up the chimney in hopes of reaching the nest and the consequences of this amateur chimneysweeping had been a plentiful bespattering of all the spectators with soot that so greatly distressed the young ladies that mary and blanche had fled away from public view  dr spencers first act of possession was to threaten to pull tom down by the heels for disturbing his jackdaws whereupon there was a general acclamation and dr may began to talk of marauding times when the jackdaws in the minster tower had been harried  ah said dr spencer as tom emerged blacker than the outraged jackdaws and half choked what do you know about jackdaws nests you that are no whichcote scholars  dont we cried hector when there is a jackdaws nest in eton chapel twenty feet high  old grey made that said tom who usually acted the part of esprit fort to hectors credulity  why there is a picture of it on jesses book said hector  but may not we get up on the roof to see if we can get at the nest papa said tom  you must ask dr spencer it is his house  dr spencer did not gainsay it and proceeded even to show the old whichcote spirit by leading the assault and promising to take care of aubrey while ethel retained gertrude and her father too for dr may had such a great inclination to scramble up the ladder after them that she thinking it a dangerous experiment for so helpless an arm was obliged to assure him that it would create a sensation among the gossiphood of stoneborough if their physician were seen disporting himself on the top of the house  ah im not a physician unattached like him said dr may laughing hullo have you got up tom theres a door up there ill show you  no dont papa think of mrs ledwich and asking her to see two trustees up there said ethel  ah mrs ledwich what is to be done with her ethel  i am sure i cant tell if flora were but at home she would manage it  spencer can manage anything was the answer that was the happiest chance imaginable that you came home with me and so we came to go by the same train  ethel was only afraid that time was being cruelly wasted but the best men and it is emphatically the best that generally are sohave the boy strong enough on one side or other of their natures to be a great provocation to womankind and dr spencer did not rest from his pursuit till the brood of the jackdaws had been discovered and two grayheaded nestlings kidnapped which were destined to a wicker cage and education little aubrey was beyond measure proud and was suggesting all sorts of outrageous classical names for them till politely told by tom that he would make them as great prigs as himself and that their names should be nothing but jack and jill  theres nothing for it but for aubrey to go to school cried tom sententiously turning round to ethel  ay to stoneborough said dr spencer  tom coloured as if sorry for his movement and hastened away to make himself sufficiently clean to go in quest of a prison for his captives  dr spencer began to bethink him of the paper that he had been so eagerly drawing up and looking at his own begrimed hands asked ethel whether she would have him for a trustee  will the other eight ladies said ethel thats the point  ha spencer you did not know what you were undertaking do you wish to be let off said dr may  not i said the undaunted doctor come ethel let us hear what should be done  theres no time said ethel bewildered the court will be only on the day after tomorrow  ample time said dr spencer who seemed ready to throw himself into it with all his might what we have to do is this the ladies to be propitiated are  nine muses to whom you will have to act apollo said dr may who having put his friend into the situation had a mischievous delight in laughing at him and watching what he would do  one and two ethel and mrs rivers  rather eight and nine said ethel though flora may be somebody now  seven then said dr spencer well then ethel suppose we set out on our travels this afternoon visit these ladies get them to call a meeting tomorrow and sanction their three trustees  you little know what a work it is to call a meeting or how many notes miss rich sends out before one can be accomplished  faint heartyou know the proverb ethel allons ill call on mrs ledwich  stay said dr may let ethel do that and ask her to tea and we will show her your drawing of the school  so the remaining ladies were dividedethel was to visit miss anderson miss boulder and mrs ledwich dr spencer the rest and a meeting if possible be appointed for the next day  ethel did as she was told though rather against the grain and her short abrupt manner was excused the more readily that dr spencer had been a subject of much mysterious speculation in stoneborough and to gain any intelligence respecting him was a great object so that she was extremely welcome wherever she called  mrs ledwich promised to come to tea and instantly prepared to walk to miss rich and authorise her to send out the notes of summons to the morrows meeting ethel offered to walk with her and found mrs and miss rich in a flutter after dr spencers call the daughter just going to put on her bonnet and consult mrs ledwich and both extremely enchanted with dr spencer who would be such an acquisition  the hour was fixed and the notes sent out and ethel met dr spencer at the garden gate  well he said smiling i think we have fixed them offhave not we  yes but is it not heartless that everything should be done through so much nonsense  did you ever hear why the spire of ulm cathedral was never finished said dr spencer  no why not  because the citizens would accept no help from their neighbours  i am glad enough of help when it comes in the right way and from good motives  there are more good motives in the world than you give people credit for ethel you have a good father good sense and a good education and you have some perception of the system by which things like this should be done unfortunately the system is in bad hands here and these good ladies have been left to work for themselves and it is no wonder that there is plenty of little selfimportance nonsense and the like among them but for their own sakes we should rather show them the way than throw them overboard  if they will be shown said ethel  i cant say they seemed to me so very formidable said dr spencer gentle little women  oh it is only mrs ledwich that stirs them up i hope you are prepared for that encounter  mrs ledwich came to tea sparkling with black bugles and was very patronising and amiable her visits were generally subjects of great dread for she talked unceasingly laid down the law and overwhelmed margaret with remedies but tonight dr spencer took her in hand it was not that he went out of his ordinary self he was always the same simplemannered polished gentleman but it was this that toldshe was evidently somewhat in awe of himthe refinement kept her in check she behaved very quietly all the evening admired the plans consented to everything and was scarcely mrs ledwich  you will get on now ethel said dr may afterwards never fear but that he will get the ladies committee well in hand  why do you think so papa  never you fear  that was all she could extract from him though he looked very arch the ladies committee accepted of their representatives with full consent and the indefatigable dr spencer next had to hunt up the fellow trustee he finally contrived to collect every one he wanted at fordholm the case was laid before the collegethe college was propitious and by four oclock in the evening dr spencer laid before ethel the promise of the piece of land  marys joy was unbounded and ethel blushed and tried to thank this would have been the summit of felicity a year ago and she was vexed with herself for feeling that though land and money were both in such safe hands she could not care sufficiently to feel the ecstasy the attainment of her object would once have given to her then she would have been frantic with excitement and heedless of everything now she took it so composedly as to annoy herself  to think of that one week at oxford having so entirely turned this head of mine  perhaps it was the less at home because she had just heard that george and flora had accepted an invitation to glenbracken but though the zest of cocksmoor might be somewhat gone she called herself to order and gave her full attention to all that was planned by her champion  never did man plunge into business more thoroughly than he when he had once undertaken it he was one of those men who from gathering particulars of every practical matter that comes under their notice are able to accomplish well whatever they set their hand to and building was not new to him though his former subjectsa church and mission station in indiabore little remembrance to the present  he bought a little round dumpling of a white pony and trotted all over the country in search of building materials and builders he discovered trees in distant timberyards he brought home specimens of stone one in each pocket to compare and analyse he went to london to look at model schools he drew plans each more neat and beautiful than the last he compared builders estimates and wrote letters to the national society so as to be able to begin in the spring  in the meantime he was settling himself furnishing his new house with great precision and taste he would have no assistance in his choice either of servants or furniture but made numerous journeys of inspection to whitford to malvern and to london and these seemed to make him the more content with stoneborough sir matthew fleet had evidently chilled him and as he found his own few remaining relations uncongenial he became the more ready to find a restingplace in the gray old town the scene of his school life beside the friend of his youth and the children of her for whose sake he had never sought a home of his own though he now and then talked of seeing america or of going back to india in hopes of assisting his beloved mission at poonshedagore these plans were fast dying away as he formed habits and attachments and perceived the sphere of usefulness open to him  it was a great step when his packages arrived and his beautiful indian curiosities were arranged making his drawingroom as pretty a room as could anywhere be seen in readiness as he used to tell ethel for a grand teaparty for all the ladies committee when he should borrow her and the best silver teapot to preside moreover he had a chemical apparatus a telescope and microscope of great power wherewith he tried experiments that were the height of felicity to tom and ethel and much interested their father he made it his business to have full occupation for himself with plans books or correspondence so as not to be a charge on the hands of the may family with whom he never spent an evening without special and earnest invitation  he gave attendance at the hospital on alternate days as well as taking off dr mays hands such of his gratuitous patients as were not averse to quit their old doctor and could believe in a physician in shepherds plaid and panama hat exceedingly sociable he soon visited every one far and wide and went to every sort of party from the grand dinners of the county families to the teadrinkings of the stoneborough ladiesa welcome guest at all and enjoying each in his own way english life was so new to him that he entered into the little accessories with the zest of a youth and there seemed to be a curious change between the two old fellow students the elder and more staid of former days having come back with unencumbered freshness to enliven his friend just beginning to grow aged under the wear of care and sorrows  it was very droll to hear dr may laughing at dr spencers histories of his adventures and at the new aspects in which his own welltrodden district appeared to travelled eyes and not less amusing was dr spencers resolute defence of all the nine muses generally and individually  he certainly had no reason to think ill of them as one woman they were led by him and conformed their opinions the only seceder was louisa anderson who had her brother for her oracle and indeed the more youthful race to whom harvey was the glass of fashion uttered disrespectful opinions as to the doctors age and would not accede to his being as mrs ledwich declared much younger than dr may  harvey anderson had first attempted patronage then argument with dr spencer but found him equally impervious to both very clever but an old world man said harvey he has made up his bundle of prejudices  clever sort of lad said dr spencer a cool hand but very shallow  ethel wondered to hear thus lightly disposed of the powers of argument that had been thought fairly able to compete with norman and which had taxed him so severely she did not know how differently abstract questions appear to a mature mind confirmed in principle by practice and to one young struggling in selfformation and more used to theories than to realities     chapter xii         the heart may ache but may not burst      heaven will not leave thee nor forsake                                      christian year   hector and tom finished their holidays by a mornings shooting at the grange dr may promising to meet them and let them drive him home  meta was out when he arrived and repairing to the library he found mr rivers sitting by a fire though it was early in september with the newspaper before him but not reading he looked depressed and seemed much disappointed at having heard that george and flora had accepted some further invitations in scotland and did not intend to return for another month dr may spoke cheerfully of the hospitality and kindness they had met but failed to enliven him and as if trying to assign some cause for his vexation he lamented over fogs and frosts and began to dread an october in scotland for flora almost as if it were the arctic regions  he grew somewhat more animated in praising flora and speaking of the great satisfaction he had in seeing his son married to so admirable a person he only wished it could be the same with his daughter  you are a very unselfish father said dr may i cannot imagine you without your little fairy  it would be hard to part said mr rivers sighing yet i should be relieved to see her in good hands so pretty and engaging as she is and something of an heiress with our dear flora she is secure of a happy home when i am gone but still i should be glad to have seen and he broke off thoughtfully  she is so sensible that we shall see her make a good choice said dr may smiling that is if she choose at all for i do not know who is worthy of her  i am quite indifferent as to fortune continued mr rivers she will have enough of her own  enough not to be dependent which is the point said dr may though i should have few fears for her any way  it would be a comfort harped on mr rivers dwelling on the subject as if he wanted to say something if she were only safe with a man who knew how to value her and make her happy such a young man as your norman nowi have often thought  dr may would not seem to hear but he could not prevent himself from blushing as crimson as if he had been the very norman as he answered going on with his own speech as if mr riverss had been unmade she is the brightest little creature under the sun and the sparkle is down so deep within that however it may turn out i should never fear for her happiness  flora is my great reliance proceeded mr rivers her aunt lady leonora is very kind but somehow she does not seem to suit with meta  oh ho thought the doctor have you made that discovery my good friend  the voices of the two boys were heard in the hall explaining their achievements to meta and dr may took his departure hector driving him and embarking in a long discourse on his own affairs as if he had quite forgotten that the doctor was not his father and going on emphatically in spite of the absence of mind now and then betrayed by his auditor who at dr spencers door exclaimed stop hector let me out herethank you and presently brought out his friend into the garden and sat down on the grass talking low and earnestly over the disease with which mr rivers had been so long affected for though dr may could not perceive any positively unfavourable symptom he had been rendered vaguely uneasy by the unusual heaviness and depression of manner so long did they sit conversing that blanche was sent out primed with an impertinent message that two such old doctors ought to be ashamed of themselves for sitting so late in the dew  dr spencer was dragged in to drink tea and the meal had just been merrily concluded when the door bell rang and a message was brought in the carriage from the grange sir miss rivers would be much obliged if you would come directly  there said dr may looking at dr spencer as if to say i told you so in the first triumph of professional sagacity but the next moment exclaiming poor little meta he hurried away  a gloom fell on those who remained for besides their sympathy for meta and their liking for her kind old father there was that one unacknowledged heartache which though in general bravely combated lay in wait always ready to prey on them hector stole round to sit by margaret and dr spencer muttered this will never do and sent tom to fetch some papers lying on his table whence he read them some curious accounts that he had just received from his missionary friends in india  they were interested but in a listening mood that caused a universal start when the bell again sounded this time james reported that the servant from the grange said his master was very illhe had brought a letter to post for mr george rivers and here was a note for miss ethel it was the only note ethel had ever received from her father and contained these few words   dear e  i believe this attack will be the last come to meta and bring my things                                        r m   ethel put her hands to her forehead it was as if she had been again plunged into the stunned dream of misery of four years ago and her sensation was of equal bewilderment and uselessness but it was but for a momentthe next she was in a state of overbustle and eagerness she wanted to fly about and hasten to help meta and could hardly obey the word and gesture by which margaret summoned her to her side  dear ethel you must calm yourself or you will not be of use  i i cant be of any use oh if you could go if flora were but here but i must go margaret  i will put up your fathers things said dr spencer in a soothing tone the carriage cannot be ready in a moment so that there will be full time  mary and miss bracy prepared ethels own goods which she would otherwise have forgotten and margaret meanwhile detained her by her side trying to calm and encourage her with gentle words of counsel that might hinder her from giving way to the flurry of emotion that had seized her and prevent her from thinking herself certain to be useless  adams was to drive her thither in the gig and it presently came to the door dr spencer wrapped her up well in cloaks and shawls and spoke words of kindly cheer in her ear as she set off the fresh night air blew pleasantly on her the stars glimmered in full glory overhead and now and then her eye was caught by the rocketlike track of a shootingstar orion was rising slowly far in the east and bringing to her mind the sailorboy under the southern sky if indeed he were not where sun and stars no more are the light it was strange that the thought came more as soothing than as acute pain she could bear to think of him thus in her present frame as long as she had not to talk of him under those solemn stars the life everlasting seemed to overpower the sense of this mortal life and ethels agitation was calmed away  the old cedartree stood up in stately blackness against the sky and the lights in the house glanced behind it the servants looked rather surprised to see ethel as if she were not expected and conducted her to the great drawingroom which looked the more desolate and solitary from the glare of lamplight falling on the empty seats which ethel had lately seen filled with a glad home party she was looking round thinking whether to venture up to metas room and there summon bellairs when meta came gliding in and threw her arms round her ethel could not speak but metas voice was more cheerful than she had expected how kind of you dear ethel  papa sent for me said ethel  he is so kind can margaret spare you  oh yes but you must leave me you must want to be with him  he never lets me come in when he has these attacks said meta if he only would but will you come up to my room that is nearer  is papa with him  yes  meta wound her arms round ethel and led her up to her sittingroom where a book lay on the table she said that her father had seemed weary and torpid and had sat still until almost their late dinnerhour when he seemed to bethink himself of dressing and had risen she thought he walked weakly and rather tottering and had run to make him lean on her which he did as far as his own room door there he had kissed her and thanked her and murmured a word like blessing she had not however been alarmed until his servant had come to tell her that he had another seizure  ethel asked whether she had seen dr may since he had been with her father she had but ethel was surprised to find that she had not taken in the extent of his fears she had become so far accustomed to these attacks that though anxious and distressed she did not apprehend more than a few days weakness and her chief longing was to be of use she was speaking cheerfully of beginning her nursing tomorrow and of her great desire that her papa would allow her to sit up with him when there was a slow reluctant movement of the lock of the door and the two girls sprang to their feet as dr may opened it and ethel read his countenance at once  not so meta how is he may i go to him cried she  not now my dear said dr may putting his hand on her shoulder in a gentle detaining manner that sent a thrill of trembling through her frame though she did not otherwise move she only clasped her hands together and looked up into his face he answered the look yes my dear the struggle is over  ethel came near and put her arm round metas waist as if to strengthen her as she stood quite passive and still  dr may seemed to think it best that all should be told but though intently watching meta he directed his words to his own daughter thank heaven it has been shorter and less painful than i had dared to hope  meta tried to speak but could not bring out the words and with an imploring look at ethel as if to beg her to make them clear for her she inarticulately murmured oh why did you not call me  i could not he would not let me his last conscious word to me was not to let you see him suffer  meta wrung her clasped hands together in mute anguish dr may signed to ethel to guide her back to the sofa but the movement seemed so far to rouse her that she said i should like to go to bed  rightthe best thing said dr may and he whispered to ethel go with her but dont try to rouse herdont talk to her come back to me presently  he did not even shake hands with meta nor wish her goodnight as she disappeared into her own room  bellairs undressed her and ethel stood watching till the young head under the load of sorrow so new to it was laid on the pillow bellairs asked her if she would have a light  no no thank youthe dark and alone goodnight said meta ethel went back to the sittingroom where her father was standing at the window looking out into the night he turned as she came in folded her in his arms and kissed her forehead and how is the poor little dear he asked  the same said ethel i cant bear to leave her alone and to have said nothing to comfort her  it is too soon as yet said dr mayher mind has not taken it in i hope she will sleep all night and have more strength to look at it when she wakens  she was utterly unprepared  i could not make her understand me said dr may  and oh papa what a pity she was not there  it was no sight for her till the last few minutes and his whole mind seemed bent on sparing her what tenderness it has been  must we leave her to herself all night  better so said dr may she has been used to loneliness and to thrust companionship on her would be only harassing  ethel who scarcely knew what it was to be alone looked as if she did not understand  i used to try to force consolation on people said dr may but i know now that it can only be done by following their bent  you have seen so many sorrows said ethel  i never understood till i felt said dr may those few first days were a lesson  i did not think you knew what was passing said ethel  i doubt whether any part of my life is more distinctly before me than those two days said dr may flora coming in and out and poor alan sitting by me but i dont believe i had any will i could no more have moved my mind than my broken arm and i verily think ethel that but for that merciful torpor i should have been frantic it taught me never to disturb grief  and what shall we do  you must stay with her till flora comes i will be here as much as i can she is our charge till they come home i told him between the spasms that i had sent for you and he seemed pleased  if only i were anybody else  dr may again threw his arm round her and looked into her face he felt that he had rather have her such as she was than anybody else and together they sat down and talked of what was to be done and what was best for meta and of the solemnity of being in the house of death ethel felt and showed it so much in her subdued awestruck manner that her father felt checked whenever he was about to return to his ordinary manner familiarised as he necessarily was with the like scenes it drew him back to the thought of their own trouble and their conversation recurred to those days so that each gained a more full understanding of the other and they at length separated certainly with the more peaceful and soft feelings for being in the abode of mourning  bellairs promised to call ethel to be with her young lady as early as might be reporting that she was sound asleep and sleep continued to shield her till past her usual hour so that ethel was up and had been with dr may before she was summoned to her and then she found her half dressed and hastening that she might not make dr may late for breakfast and in going to his patients there was an elasticity in the happily constituted young mind that could not be entirely struck down nor deprived of power of taking thought for others yet her eyes looked wandering and unlike themselves and her words now and then faltered as if she was not sure what she was doing or saying ethel told her not to minddr spencer would take care of the patients but she did not seem to recollect at first who dr spencer was nor to care for being reminded  breakfast was laid out in the little sittingroom ethel wanted to take the trouble off her hands but she would not let her she sat behind her urn and asked about tea or coffee quite accurately in a low subdued voice that nearly overcame dr may when the meal was over and she had rung the bell and risen up as if to her daily work she turned round with that piteous perplexed air and stood for a moment as if confused  cannot we help you said ethel  i dont know thank you but dr may i must not keep you from other people  i have no one to go to this morning said dr may i am ready to stay with you my dear  meta came closer to him and murmured thank you  the breakfast things had by this time been taken away and meta looking to see that the door had shut for the last time said in a low voice now tell me  dr may drew her down to sit on the sofa beside him and in his soft sweet voice told her all that she wished to learn of her fathers last hours and was glad to see showers of quiet wholesome tears drop freely down but without violence and she scarcely attempted to speak there was a pause at the end and then she said gently thank you for it all dear papa and she rose up and went back to her room  she has learned to dwell apart said dr may much moved  how beautiful she bears up said ethel  it has been a life which as she has used it has taught her strength and selfdependence in the midst of prosperity  yes said ethel she has trained herself by her dread of selfindulgence and seeking after work but oh what a break up it is for her i cannot think how she holds up shall i go to her  i think not she knows the way to the only comforter i am not afraid of her after those blessed tears  dr may was right meta presently returned to them in the same gentle subdued sadness enfolding her indeed as a flower weighed down by mist but not crushing nor taking away her powers it was as if she were truly upheld and thankful to her friends as she was she did not throw herself on them in utter dependence or selfabandonment  she wrote needful letters shedding many tears over them and often obliged to leave off to give the blinding weeping its course but refusing to impose any unnecessary task upon dr mays lame arm all that was right she strove to do she saw mr charles wilmot and was refreshed by his reading to her and when dr may desired it she submissively put on her bonnet and took several turns with ethel in the shrubbery though it made her cry heartily to look into the downstairs rooms and she lay on the sofa at last owning herself strangely tired she did not know why and glad that ethel should read to her by and by she went to dress for the evening and came back full of the tidings that one of the children in the village had been badly burned it occupied her very muchshe made ethel promise to go and see about her tomorrow and sent bellairs at once with every comfort that she could devise  on the whole those two days were to ethel a peaceful and comfortable time she saw more than usual of her father and had such conversations with him as were seldom practicable at home and that chimed in with the unavowed care which hung on their minds while meta was a most sweet and loving charge without being a burden and often saying such beautiful things in her affectionate resignation that ethel could only admire and lay them up in her mind dr may went backwards and forwards and brought good accounts of margaret and fond messages he slept at the grange each night and meta used to sit in the corner of the sofa and work or not as best suited her while she listened to his talk with ethel and now and then herself joined  george riverss absence was a serious inconvenience in all arrangements but his sister dreaded his grief as much as she wished for his return and often were the posts and the journeys reckoned over without a satisfactory conclusion as to when he could arrive from so remote a part of scotland  at last as the two girls had finished their early dinner the butler brought in word that mr norman may was there meta at once begged that he would come in and ethel went into the hall to meet him he looked very wan with the dark rings round his eyes a deeper purple than ever and he could hardly find utterance to ask how is she  as good and sweet as she can be said ethel warmly but no more for meta herself had come to the diningroom door and was holding out her hand norman took it in both his but could not speak metas own soft voice was the first i thought you would comehe was so fond of you  poor norman quite gave way and meta was the one to speak gentle words of soothing there is so much to be thankful for she said he has been spared so much of the suffering dr may feared for him and he was so happy about george  norman made a great effort to recover himself ethel asked for flora and george it appeared that they had been on an excursion when the first letter arrived at glenbracken and thus had received both together in the evening on their return george had been greatly overcome and they had wished to set off instantly but lady glenbracken would not hear of floras travelling night and day and it had at length been arranged that norman ogilvie should drive norman across the country that evening to catch the mail for edinburgh and he had been on the road ever since george was following with his wife more slowly and would be at home tomorrow evening meantime he sent full authority to his fatherinlaw to make arrangements  ethel went to see the burned child leaving meta to take her walk in the garden under normans charge he waited on her with a sort of distant reverence for a form of grief so unlike what he had dreaded for her when the first shock of the tidings had brought back to him the shattered bewildered feelings to which he dared not recur  to dwell on the details was to her a comfort knowing his sympathy and the affection there had been between him and her father nor had they parted in such absolute brightness as to make them unprepared for such a meeting as the present the cloud of suspense was brooding lower and lower over the may family and the need of faith and submission was as great with them as with the young orphan herself norman said little but that little was so deep and fervent that after a time meta could not help saying when ethel was seen in the distance and their talk was nearly over oh norman these things are no mirage  it is the world that is the mirage he answered ethel came up and dr may also in good time for the post he was obliged to become very busy using norman for his secretary till he saw his sons eyes so heavy that he remembered the two nights that he had been up and ordered him to go home and go to bed as soon as tea was over  may i come back tomorrow  whyyesi think you may no no he added recollecting himself i think you had better not and he did not relent though norman looked disappointed  meta had already expressed her belief that her father would be buried at the suburban church where lay her mother and dr may having been desired to seek out the will and open it found it was so and fixed the day and hour with meta who was as submissive and reasonable as possible though much grieved that he thought she could not be present  ethel after going with meta to her room at night returned as usual to talk matters over with him and again say how good meta was  and i think normans coming did her a great deal of good said ethel  ha yes said the doctor thoughtfully  she thinks so much of mr rivers having been fond of him  yes said the doctor he was i find in glancing over the will which was newly made on floras marriage that he has remembered normanleft him £100 and his portfolio of prints by raffaelle  has he indeedhow very kind how much norman will value it  it is remarkable said dr may and then as if he could not help it told ethel what mr rivers had said of his wishes with regard to his daughter ethel blushed and smiled and looked so much touched and delighted that he grew alarmed and said you know ethel this must be as if it never had been mentioned  what you will not tell norman  no certainly not unless i see strong cause they are very fond of each other certainly but they dont know and i dont know whether it is not like brother and sister i would not have either of them guess at this or feel bound in any way why ethel she has thirty thousand pounds and i dont know how much more  thirty thousand said ethel her tone one of astonishment while his had been almost of objection  it would open a great prospect continued dr may complacently with normans talents and such a lift as that he might be one of the first men in england provided he had nerve and hardness enough which i doubt  he would not care for it said ethel  no but the field of usefulness but what an old fool i am after all my resolutions not to be ambitious for that boy to be set agoing by such a thing as this still norman is something out of the common way i wonder what spencer thinks of him  and you never mean them to hear of it  if they settle it for themselves said dr may that sanction will come in to give double value to mine or if i should see poor norman hesitating as to the inequality i might smooth the way but you see ethel this puts us in a most delicate situation towards this pretty little creature what her father wanted was only to guard her from fortunehunters and if she should marry suitably elsewherewhy we will be contented  i dont think i should be said ethel  she is the most winning of hummingbirds and what we see of her now gives one double confidence in her she is so far from the petted helpless girl that he poor man would fain have made her and she has a bright brave temper and elastic spirits that would be the very thing for him poor boy with that morbid sensitivenesshe would not hurt her and she would brighten him it would be a very pretty thingbut we must never think about it again  if we can help it said ethel  ah i am sorry i have put it into your head too we shall not so easily be unconscious now when they talk about each other in the innocent way they do we have had a lesson against being pleased at matchmaking but turning away from the subject you shall not lose your cocksmoor income ethel  i had never thought of that you have taken no fees here since we have been all one family  well he has been good enough to leave me £500 and cocksmoor can have the interest if you like  oh thank you papa  it is only its due for i suppose that is for attendance personally to myself he has left that beautiful claude which he knew i admired so much he has been very kind but after all we ought not to be talking of all thisi should not have known it if i had not been forced to read the will well so we are in floras house ethel i wonder how poor dear little meta will feel the being a guest here instead of the mistress i wish that boy were three or four years older i should like to take her straight home with usi should like to have her for a daughter i shall always look on her as one  as a daisy said ethel  dont talk of it said dr may hastily this is no time for such things after all i am glad that the funeral is not hereflora and meta might be rather overwhelmed with these three incongruous sets of relations by their letters those riverses must be quite as queer a lot as georges relations after all if we have nothing else ethel we have the best of it in regard to such relations as we have  there is lord cosham said ethel  yes he is metas guardian as well as her brother but he could not have her to live with him she must depend upon flora but we shall see  ethel felt confident that flora would be very kind to her little sisterinlaw and yet one of those gleams of doubt crossed her whether flora would not be somewhat jealous of her own authority  late the next evening the carriage drove to the door and george and flora appeared in the hall their sisters went out to meet them and george folded meta in his arms and kissing her again and again called her his poor dear little sister and wept bitterly and even violently flora stood beside ethel and said in a low voice that poor george felt it dreadfully and then came forward touched him gently and told him that he must not overset meta and drawing her from him kissed her and said what a grievous time this had been for her and how sorry they had been to leave her so long but they knew she was in the best hands  yes i should have been so sorry you had been overtired i was quite well off said meta  and you must look on us as your home added flora  how can she thought ethel this is taking possession and making meta a guest already  however meta did not seem so to feel itshe replied by caresses and turned again to her brother poor george was by far the most struck down of all the mourners and his whole demeanour gave his new relations a much warmer feeling towards him than they could ever have hoped to entertain his gentle refined father had softly impressed his duller nature and his want of attention and many extravagances came back upon him acutely now in his changed home he could hardly bear to look at his little orphan sister and lavished every mark of fondness upon her nor could he endure to sit at the bottom of his table but when they had gone in to dinner he turned away from the chair and hid his face he was almost like a child in his want of selfrestraint and with all dr mays kind soothing manner he could not bring him to attend to any of the necessary questions as to arrangements and was obliged to refer to flora whose composed good sense was never at fault  ethel was surprised to find that it would be a great distress to meta to part with her until the funeral was over though she would hardly express a wish lest ethel should be needed at home as soon as flora perceived this she begged her sister to stay and again ethel felt unpleasantly that meta might have seen if she had chosen that flora took the invitation upon herself  so while dr may with george norman and tom went to london she remained though not exactly knowing what good she was doing unless by making the numbers rather less scanty but both sisters declared her to be the greatest comfort possible and when meta shut herself up in her own room where she had long learned to seek strength in still communing with her own heart flora seemed to find it a relief to call her sister to hers and talk over ordinary subjects in a tone that struck on ethels ear as a little incongruousbut then flora had not been here from the first and the impression could not be as strong she was very kind and her manner when with others was perfect from its complete absence of affectation but alone with ethel there was a little complacency sometimes betrayed and some curiosity whether her father had read the will ethel allowed what she had heard of the contents to be extracted from her and it certainly did not diminish floras secret satisfaction in being somebody  she told the whole history of her visits first how cordial lady leonora langdale had been and then how happy she had been at glenbracken the old lord and lady and marjorie all equally charming in their various ways and norman ogilvie so good a son and so highly thought of in his own country  did i tell you ethel that he desired to be remembered to you  yes you said so  what has coralie done with it continued flora seeking in her dressingcase she must have put it away with my brooches oh no here it is i had been looking for cairngorm specimens in a shop saying i wanted a brooch that you would wear when norman ogilvie came riding after the carriage looking quite hot and eager he had been to some other place and hunted this one up is it not a beauty  it was one of the round bruce brooches of dark pebble with a silver fernleaf lying across it the dots of small cairngorm stones the glenbracken badge you know continued flora  ethel twisted it about in her fingers and said was not it meant for you  it was to oblige me if you choose so to regard it said flora smiling he gave me no injunctions but you see you must wear it now i shall not wear coloured brooches for a year  ethel sighed she felt as if her black dress ought perhaps to be worn for a nearer cause she had a great desire to keep that glenbracken brooch and surely it could not be wrong to refuse it would be much worse and would only lead to floras keeping it and not caring for it  then it is your present flora  if you like better to call it so my dear i find norman ogilvie is going abroad in a few months i think we ought to ask him here on his way  flora i wish you would not talk about such things  do you really and truly ethel  certainly not at such a time as this said ethel  flora was checked a little and sat down to write to marjorie ogilvie shall i say you like the brooch ethel she asked presently  say what is proper said ethel impatiently you know what i mean in the fullest sense of the word  do i said flora  i mean said ethel that you may say simply and rationally that i like the thing but i wont have it said as a message or that i take it as his present  very well said flora the whole affair is simple enough if you would not be so conscious my dear  flora i cant stand your calling me my dear  i am very much obliged to you said flora laughing more than she would have liked to be seen but recalled by her sisters look ethel was sorry at once  flora i beg your pardon i did not mean to be cross only please dont begin about that indeed i think you had better leave out about the brooch altogether no one will wonder at your passing it over in such a return as this  you are right said flora thoughtfully  ethel carried the brooch to her own room and tried to keep herself from speculating what had been mr ogllvies views in procuring it and whether he remembered showing her at woodstock which sort of fern was his badge and how she had abstained from preserving the piece shut up in her guidebook  metas patient sorrow was the best remedy for proneness to such musings how happy poor little meta had been the three sisters sat together that long day and ethel read to the others and by and by went to walk in the garden with them till as flora was going in meta asked do you think it would be wrong for me to cross the park to see that little burned girl as mr wilmot is away today and she has no one to go to her  flora could see no reason against it and meta and ethel left the garden and traversed the green park in its quiet home beauty not talking much except that meta said well i think there is quite as much sweetness as sadness in this evening  because of this calm autumn sunset beauty said ethel look at the golden light coming in under the branches of the trees  yes said meta one cannot help thinking how much more beautiful it must be  the two girls said no more and came to the cottage where so much gratitude was expressed at seeing miss rivers that it was almost too much for her she left ethel to talk and only said a few soft little words to her sick scholar who seemed to want her voice and smile to convince her that the small mournful face under all that black crape belonged to her own dear bright teacher  it is odd said meta as they went back it is seeing other people that makes one know it is all sad and alteredit seems so bewildering though they are so kind  i know what you mean said ethel  one ought not to wish it to go on because there are other people and other duties said meta but quietness is so peaceful do you know ethel i shall always think of those two first days before anybody came with you and dr may as something veryveryprecious she said at last with the tears rising  i am sure i shall said ethel  i dont know how it is but there is something even in this affliction that makes it likea strange sort of happiness said meta musingly  i know what it is said ethel  that he is so very good said meta reverently  yes said ethel almost rebuked for the first thought namely that it was because meta was so very good  it does make one feel more confidence said meta  it is good for me to have been in trouble repeated ethel  yes said meta i hope it is not wrong or unkind in me to feel it for i think dear papa would wish it but i do not feel as ifmiss him always as i shallthe spring of life were gone from me i dont think it can for i know no more pain or trouble can reach him and there isdont you think ethel that i may think soespecial care for the orphan like a compensation and there is hope and work here and i am very thankful how much worse it would have been if george had not been married dear flora will you tell her ethel how really i do wish her to take the command of me tell her it will be the greatest kindness in the world to make me useful to her  i will said ethel  and please tell her that i am afraid i may forget and take upon me as if i were still lady of the house tell her i do not mean it and i hope that she will check it  i think there is no fear of her forgetting that said ethel regretting the words before they were out of her mouth  i hope i shall not said meta if i do i shall drive myself away to stay with aunt leonora and i dont want to do that at all so please to make flora understand that she is head and i am ready to be hand and foot and metas bright smile shone out with the pleasure of a fresh and loving service  ethel understood the force of her fathers words that it was a brave vigorous spirit  dr may came back with george and stayed to dinner after which he talked over business with flora whose sagacity continually amazed him and who undertook to make her husband understand and do what was needed  meta meanwhile crossquestioned her brother on the pretty village by the thames of which she had a fond childish remembrance and heard from him of the numerous kind messages from all her relations there were various invitations but george repeated them unwillingly  you wont go meta he said it would be a horrid nuisance to part with you  as long as you think so dear george when i am in your way or floras  that will never be i say flora will she ever be in our way  no indeed meta and i understand that said flora looking up well i suppose bruce cant be trusted to value the books and prints  dr may thought it a great relief that meta had a home with flora for as he said to ethel as they went home together certainly except lord cosham i never saw such an unpresentable crew as their relations you should have heard the boys afterwards there was master tom turning up his eton nose at them and pronouncing that there never were such a set of snobs and norman taking him to task as i never heard him do beforetelling him that he would never have urged his going to eton if he had thought it would make him despise respectable folks probably better than himself and that this was the last time in the world for such observationswhereat poor tommy was quite annihilated for a word from norman goes further with him than a lecture from any one else  well i think norman was right as to the unfitness of the time  so he was but we had a good deal of them waiting in the inn parlour people make incongruities when they will have such things done in state it could not be helped here to be sure but i always feel at a grand undertakers display like this that except the service itself there is little to give peace or soothing i hate what makes a talk better be little folk  one would rather think of our own dear cloister and those who cared so much said ethel  ah you were happy to be there said dr may but it all comes to the same pausing he looked from the window then signed to ethel to do the sameorion glittered in the darkness  one may sleep sound without the lullaby said dr may and the waves  oh dont papa you dont give up hope  i believe we ought ethel dont tell her but i went to the admirality today  and what did you hear there  great cause for fearbut they do not give up my poor margaret but those stars tell us they are in the same hand     chapter xiii         shall i sit alone in my chamber        and set the chairs by the wall      while you sit with lords and princes        yet have not a thought at all       shall i sit alone in my chamber        and duly the table lay      whilst you stand up in the diet        and have not a word to sayold danish ballad   oh norman are you come already exclaimed margaret as her brother opened the door bringing in with him the crisp breath of december  yes i came away directly after collections how are you margaret  pretty brave thank you but the brother and sister both read on each others features that the additional three months of suspense had told there were traces of toil and study on normans brow the sunken look about his eyes and the dejected outline of his cheek margaret knew betokened discouragement and though her mild serenity was not changed she was almost transparently thin and pale they had long ago left off asking whether there were tidings and seldom was the subject adverted to though the whole family seemed to be living beneath a dark shadow  how is flora he next asked  going on beautifully except that papa thinks she does too much in every way she declares that she shall bring the baby to show me in another week but i dont think it will be allowed  and the little lady prospers  capitally though i get rather contradictory reports of her first papa declared her something surpassingexactly like flora and so i suppose she is but ethel and meta will say nothing for her beauty and blanche calls her a fright but papa is her devoted admirerhe does so enjoy having a sort of property again in a baby  and george rivers said norman smiling  poor george he is very proud of her in his own way he has just been here with a note from flora and actually talked between her and the election he is wonderfully brilliant  the election has mr esdaile resigned  have you not heard he intends it and george himself is going to stand the only danger is that sir henry walkinghame should think of it  rivers in parliament well sound men are wanted  fancy flora our members wife how well she will become her position  how soon is it likely to be  quickly i fancy dr spencer who knows all kinds of news papa says he makes a scientific study of gossip as a new branch of comparative anatomy found out from the clevelands that mr esdaile meant to retire and happened to mention it the last time that flora came to see me it was like firing a train you would have wondered to see how it excited her who usually shows her feelings so little she has been so much occupied with it and so anxious that george should be ready to take the field at once that papa was afraid of its hurting her and ethel comes home declaring that the election is more to her than her baby  ethel is apt to be a little hard on flora they are too unlike to understand each other  ethel is to be godmother though and flora means to ask mr ogilvie to come and stand  i think he will be gone abroad or i should have asked him to fulfil his old promise of coming to us  i believe he must be lodged here if he should come flora will have her house full for lady leonora is coming the baby is to be called after her  indeed exclaimed norman  yes i thought it unnecessary as she is not georges aunt but flora is grateful to her for much kindness and she is coming to see meta i am afraid papa is a little hurt that any name but one should have been chosen  has meta been comfortable  dear little thing every one says how beautifully she has behaved she brought all her housekeeping books to flora at once and only begged to be made helpful in whatever way might be most convenient she explained what we never knew before how she had the young maids in to read with her and asked leave to go on very few could have been set aside so simply and sweetly in their own house  flora was sensible of it i hope  oh yes she took the management of course but meta is charmed with her having the girls in from the village in turn to help in the scullery they have begun family prayers too and george makes the stablemen go to churcha matter which had been past meta as you may guess though she had been a wonderful little manager and flora owned herself quite astonished  i wonder only at her being astonished  meta owned to ethel that what had been worst of all to her was the heart sinking at finding herself able to choose her occupations with no one to accommodate them to but she would not give wayshe set up more work for herself at the school and has been talking of giving singing lessons at cocksmoor and she forced herself to read though it was an effort she has been very happy lately in nursing flora  is ethel there  no she is as usual at cocksmoor there are great councils about sending cherry to be trained for her new school  would flora be able to see me if i were to ride over to the grange  you may try and if papa is not there i dare say she will  at least i shall see meta and she may judge i want to see rivers too so i will ask if the bay is to be had ah you have the claude i see  yes it is too large for this room but papa put it here that i might enjoy it and it is almost a companion the sky improves so in the sunset light  norman was soon at abbotstoke and as he drew his rein metas bright face nodded to him from floras sittingroom window and as he passed the conservatory the little person met him with a summons at once to his sister  he found flora on the sofa with a table beside her covered with notes and papers she was sitting up writing and though somewhat pale was very smiling and animated  norman how kind to come to me the first thing  margaret encouraged me to try whether you would be visible  they want to make a regular prisoner of me said flora laughing papa is as bad as the old nurse but he has not been here today so i have had my own way did you meet george  no but margaret said he had been with her  i wish he would come we expect the second post to bring the news that mr esdaile has accepted the chiltern hundreds if he found it so he meant to go and talk to mr bramshaw for though he is so dull we must make him agent  is there any danger of opposition  none at all if we are soon enough in the field papas name will secure us and there is no one else on the right side to come forward so that it is an absolute rescue of the seat  it is the very moment when men of principle are most wanted said norman the questions of the day are no light matters and it is an immense point to save stoneborough from being represented by one of the tomkins set  exactly so said flora i should feel it a crime to say one word to deter george at a time when every effort must be made to support the right cause one must make sacrifices when the highest interests are at stake  flora seemed to thrive upon her sacrificeshe had never appeared more brilliant and joyous her brother saw in her a roman matron and the ambition that was inherent in his nature began to find compensation for being crushed as far as regarded himself by soaring for another he eagerly answered that he fully agreed with her and that she would never repent urging her husband to take on himself the duties incumbent on all who had the power  highly gratified she asked him to look at a copy of georges intended address which was lying on the table he approved of the tenor but saw a few phrases susceptible of a better point give it she said putting a pen into his hand and he began to interline and erase her fair manuscript talking earnestly and working up himself and the address at the same time till it had grown into a composition far superior to the merely sensible affair it had been eloquence and thought were now in the language and substanceand flora was delighted  i have been very disrespectful to my niece all this time said norman descending from the clouds of patriotism  i do not mean to inflict her mercilessly on her relations said flora but i should like you to see her she is so like blanche  the little girl was brought in and flora made a very pretty young mother as she held her in her arms with so much graceful pride norman was perfectly entrancedhe had never seen his sister so charming or so admirable between her delight in her infant and her selfdevotion to the good of her husband and her countryacting so wisely and speaking so considerately and praising her dear meta with so much warmth he would never have torn himself away had not the nurse hinted that mrs rivers had had too much excitement and fatigue already today and besides he suspected that he might find meta in the drawingroom where he might discuss the whole with her and judge for himself of her state of spirits  floras next visitor was her father who came as the twilight was enhancing the comfortable red brightness of the fire he was very happy in these visitsmother and child had both prospered so well and it was quite a treat to be able to expend his tenderness on flora his little grandchild seemed to renew his own happy days and he delighted to take her from her mother and fondle her no sooner was the baby in his arms than floras hands were busy among the papers and she begged him to ring for lights  not yet he said why cant you sit in the dark and give yourself a little rest  i want you to hear georges address norman has been looking at it and i hope you will not think it too strong and she turned so that the light might fall on the paper  let me see said dr may holding out his hand for it  this is a rough copy too much scratched for you to make out  she read it accordingly and her father admired it exceedinglynormans touches above all and floras reading had dovetailed all so neatly together that no one knew where the joins were i will copy it fairly she said if you will show it to dr spencer and ask whether he thinks it too strong mr dodsley too he would be more gratified if he saw it first in private and thought himself consulted  dr may was dismayed at seeing her take up her pen make a desk of her blottingbook and begin her copy by firelight  flora my dear he said this must not be have i not told you that you must be content to rest  i did not get up till ten oclock and have been lying here ever since  but what has this head of yours been doing has it been resting for ten minutes together now i know what i am saying florai warn you that if you will not give yourself needful quiet now you will suffer for it by and by  flora smiled and said i thought i had been very good but what is to be done when ones wits will work and there is work for them to do  is not there work enough for them here said dr may looking at the babe your mother used to value such a retirement from care  flora was silent for a minute then said mr esdaile should have put off his resignation to suit me it is an unfortunate time for the election  and you cant let the election alone  she shook her head and smiled a negative as if she would but that she was under a necessity  my dear if the election cannot go on without you it had better not go on at all  she looked very much hurt and turned away her head  her father was grieved my dear he added i know you desire to be of use especially to george but do you not believe that he would rather fail than that you or his child should suffer  no answer  does he stand by his own wish or yours flora  he wishes it it is his duty said flora collecting her dignity  i can say no more except to beg him not to let you exert yourself  accordingly when george came home the doctor read him a lecture on his wifes overbusy brain and was listened to as usual with gratitude and deference he professed that he only wished to do what was best for her but she never would spare herself and going to her side with his heavy fond solicitude he made her promise not to hurt herself and she laughed and consented  the promise was easily given for she did not believe she was hurting herself and as to giving up the election or ceasing secretly to prompt george that was absolutely out of the question what could be a greater duty than to incite her husband to usefulness  moreover it was but proper to invite metas aunt and cousin to see her and to project a few select dinners for their amusement and the gratification of her neighbours it was only grateful and cousinly likewise to ask the master of glenbracken and as she saw the thrill of colour on ethels cheeks at the sight of the address to the honourable norman ogilvie she thought herself the best of sisters she even talked of ogilvie as a second christian name but meta observed that old aunt dorothy would call it leonorar rogilvie rivers and thus averted it somewhat to ethels satisfaction  ethel scolded herself many times for wondering whether mr ogilvie would come what was it to her suppose he should suppose the rest what a predicament how unreasonable and conceited even to think of such a thing when her mind was made up what could result save tossings to and fro a passing gratification set against infinite pain and strife with her own heart and with her fathers unselfishness had he but come before floras marriage no ethel hated herself for the wish that arose for the moment far better he should keep away if perhaps without the slightest inclination towards her his mere name could stir up such a tumultall it might be founded in vanity rebellious feelings and sense of tedium had once been subduedwhy should they be roused again  the answer came norman ogilvie was setting off for italy and regretted that he could not take abbotstoke on his way he desired his kind remembrances and warm christmas wishes to all his cousins  if ethel breathed more freely there was a sense that tranquillity is uninteresting it was it must be confessed a flat end to a romance that all the permanent present effect was a certain softening and a degree more attention to her appearance and after all this might as flora averred be ascribed to the paris outfit having taught her to wear clothes as well as to that which had awakened the feminine element and removed that sense of not being like other women which sometimes hangs painfully about girls who have learned to think themselves plain or awkward  there were other causes why it should be a dreary winter to ethel under the anxiety that strengthened by duration and the strain of acting cheerfulness for margarets sake even mary was a care her round rosy childhood had worn into height and sallowness and her languor and indifference fretted miss bracy and was hunted down by ethel till margaret convinced her that it was a case for patience and tenderness which thenceforth she heartily gave even encountering a scene with miss bracy who was much injured by the suggestion that mary was oppressed by perspective poor mary no one guessed the tears nightly shed over harrys photograph  nor could ethel quite fathom norman he wore the dispirited burdened expression that she knew too well but he would not as formerly seek relief in confidence to her shunning the being alone with her and far too much occupied to offer to walk to cocksmoor when the intelligence came that good old mr wilmot of settlesham had peacefully gone to his rest after a short and painless illness tom was a good deal affected in his peculiar silent and ungracious fashion but norman did not seek to talk over the event and the feelings he had entertained two years agohe avoided the subject and threw himself into the election matters with an excitement foreign to his nature  he was almost always at abbotstoke or attending george rivers at the committeeroom at the swan talking writing or consulting concocting squibs and perpetrating bons mots that were the delight of friends and the confusion of foes flora was delighted george adored him metas eyes danced whenever he came near dr spencer admired him and dr hoxton prophesied great things of him but ethel did not feel as if he were the veritable norman and had an undefined sensation of discomfort when she heard his brilliant repartees and the laughter with which he accompanied them so unlike his natural rare and noiseless laugh she knew it was false excitement to drive away the suspense that none dared to avow but which did not press on them the less heavily for being endured in silence indeed dr may could not help now and then giving way to outbursts of despondency of which his friend dr spencer who made it his special charge to try to lighten his troubles was usually the kind recipient  and though the bustle of the election was incongruous and seemed to make the leaden weight the more heavy there was a compensation in the tone of feeling that it elicited which gave real and heartfelt pleasure  dr may had undergone numerous fluctuations of popularity he had always been the same man excellent in intention though hasty in action and heeding neither praise nor censure and while the main tenor of his course never varied making many deviations by flying to the reverse of the wrong most immediately before him still his personal character gained esteem every year and though sometimes his merits and sometimes his failings gave violent umbrage he had steadily risen in the estimation of his fellowtownsmen as much as his own inconsistencies and theirs would allow and every now and then was the favourite with all save with the few who abused him for tyranny because he prevented them from tyrannising  he was just now on the top of the wave and his soninlaw had nothing to do but to float in on the tide of his favour the opposite faction attempted a contest but only rendered the triumph more complete and gave the gentlemen the pleasure of canvassing and hearing times without number that the constituents only wished the candidate were dr may himself his sons and daughters were full of exultationdr spencer much struck rallied dick on his influenceand dr may the drops of warm emotion trembling on his eyelashes smiled and bade his friend see him making a churchrate  the addresses and letters that came from the grange were so admirable that dr may often embraced normans steady opinion that george was a very wise man if norman was unconscious how much he contributed to these compositions he knew far less how much was floras in his ardour he crammed them both and conducted george when flora could not be at his side george himself was a personable man wrote a good bold hand would do as he was desired and was not easily put out of countenance he seldom committed himself by talking and when a speech was required was brief and to the purpose he made a very good figure and in the glory of victory ethel herself began to grow proud of him and the childrens great object in life was to make the jackdaws cry rivers for ever  flora had always declared that she would be at stoneborough for the nomination no one believed her until three days before she presented herself and her daughter before the astonished margaret who was too much delighted to be able to scold she had come away on her own responsibility and was full of triumph to come home in this manner after having read rivers for ever on all the dead walls might be called that for which she had lived she made no stayshe had only come to show her child and establish a precedent for driving out and margaret had begun to believe the apparition a dream when the others came in some from cocksmoor others from the committeeroom at the swan  so she brought the baby exclaimed ethel i should have thought she would not have taken her out before her christening  ethel said dr spencer permit me to make a suggestion when relations live in the same neighbourhood there is no phrase to be more avoided than i should have thought  the nominationday brought flora meta baby and all to be very quiet as was said but how could that be when every boy in the house was frantic and the men scarcely less so aubrey and gertrude and the two jackdaws each had a huge blue and orange rosette and the two former went about roaring rivers for ever without the least consideration for the baby who would have been decked in the same manner if ethel would have heard of it without indignation at her wearing any colour before her christening white as to jack and jill though they could say their lesson they were too much distressed by their ornaments to do ought but lurk in corners and strive to peck them off  flora comported herself in her usual quiet way and tried to talk of other things though a carnation spot in each cheek showed her anxiety and excitement she went with her sisters to look out from dr spencers windows towards the town hall her husband gave her his arm as they went down the garden and ethel saw her talking earnestly to him and pressing his arm with her other hand to enforce her words but if she did tutor him it was hardly visible and he was very glad of whatever counsel she gave  she spoke not a word after the ladies were left with aubrey who was in despair at not being allowed to follow hector and tom but was left as his prematurely classical mind expressed it like the gaulish women with the impedimenta in the marsheswhereas tom had added insult to injury by a farewell to jack among the maidens  meta tried to console him by persuading him that he was their protector and he began to think there was need of a guard when a mighty cheer caused him to take refuge behind ethel even when assured that it was anything but terrific he gravely declared that he thought margaret would want him but he could not cross the garden without meta to protect him  she would not allow any one else to relieve her from the doughty champion and thereby she missed the spectacle it might be that she did not regret it for though it would have been unkind to refuse to come in with her brother and sister her wound was still too fresh for crowds turmoil and noisy rejoicing to be congenial she did not withdraw her hand which aubrey squeezed harder at each resounding shout nor object to his conducting her to see his museum in the dark corner of the attics most remote from the tumult  the loss was not great the others could hear nothing distinctly and see only a wilderness of heads but the triumph was complete dr may had been cheered enough to satisfy even hector george rivers had made a very fair speech and hurrahs had covered all deficiencies hector had shouted till he was as hoarse as the jackdaws the opposite candidate had never come forward at all tomkins was hiding his diminished head and the gentlemen had nothing to report but success and were in the highest spirits  by and by blanche was missing and ethel going in quest of her spied a hem of blue merino peeping out under all the cloaks in the hall cupboard and found the poor little girl sobbing in such distress that it was long before any explanation could be extracted but at last it was revealedwhen the door had been shut and they stood in the dark half stifled among the cloaks that georges spirits had taken his old facetious style with blanche and in the very hearing of hector the misery of such jokes to a sensitive child conscious of not comprehending their scope is incalculable and blanche having been a babycoquette was the more susceptible she hid her face again from the very sound of her own confession and resisted ethels attempts to draw her out of the musty cupboard declaring that she could never see either of them again ethel in vain assured her that george was gone to the dinner at the swan nothing was effectual but being told that for her to notice what had passed was the sure way to call hectors attention thereto when she bridled emerged and begged to know whether she looked as if she had been crying poor child she could never again be unconscious but at least she was rendered peculiarly afraid of a style of notice that might otherwise have been a temptation  ethel privately begged flora to hint to george to alter his style of wit and the suggestion was received better than the blundering manner deserved flora was too exulting to take offence and her patronage of all the world was as fullblown as her ladylike nature allowed ethel she did not attempt to patronise but she promised all the sights in london to the children and masters to mary and blanche and she perfectly overwhelmed miss bracy with orphan asylums for her sisters she would have liked nothing better than dispersing cards with mrs rivers prominent among the recommenders of the case  a fine comingout for you little lady said she to her baby when taking leave that evening if it was good luck for you to make your first step in life upwards what is this  excelsior said ethel and flora smiled well pleased but she had not caught half the meaning may it be the right excelsior added ethel in a low voice that no one heard and she was glad they did not they were all triumphant and she could not tell why she had a sense of sadness and thought of floras story long ago of the girl who ascended mont blanc and for what  all she had to do at present was to listen to miss bracy who was sure that mrs rivers thought mary and blanche were not improved and was afraid she was ungrateful for all the intended kindness to her sister  ethel had more sympathy here for she had thought that flora was giving herself airs and she laughed and said her sister was pleased to be in a position to help her friends and tried to turn it off but ended by stumbling into allowing that prosperity was apt to make people overlavish of offers of kindness  dear miss ethel you understand so perfectly there is no one like you cried miss bracy attempting to kiss her hand  if ethel had not spoken rightly of her sister she was sufficiently punished  what she did was to burst into a laugh and exclaim miss bracy miss bracy i cant have you sentimental i am the worst person in the world for it  i have offended you cannot feel with me  yes i can when it is sense but please dont treat me like a heroine i am sure there is quite enough in the world that is worrying without picking shades of manner to pieces it is the sure way to make an old crab of me and so i am going off only one parting piece of advice miss bracyread frank fairlegh and put everybody out of your head  and thinking she had been savage about her hand ethel turned back and kissed the little governesss forehead wished her goodnight and ran away  she had learned that to be rough and merry was the best way of doing miss bracy good in the end and so she often gave herself the present pain of knowing that she was being supposed careless and hardhearted but the violent affection for her proved that the feeling did not last  ethel was glad to sit by the fire at bedtime and think over the day outwardly so gay inwardly so fretting and perplexing  it was the first time that she had seen much of her little niece she was no great babyhandler nor had she any of the phrases adapted to the infant mind but that pretty little serene blueeyed girl had been her chief thought all day and she was abashed by recollecting how little she had dwelt on her own duties as her sponsor in the agitations excited by the doubts about her coadjutor  she took out her prayerbook and read the service for baptism recollecting the thoughts that had accompanied her youngest sisters orphaned christening the vain pomp and glory of the world and all covetous desires of the same they seemed far enough off then and nowpoor little leonora  ethel knew that she judged her sister hardly yet she could not help picturing to herself the futurea young lady trained for fashionable life serious teaching not omitted but right made the means of rising in the world taught to strive secretly but not openly for admirationa scheming for her marriagea career like floras own ethel could scarcely feel that it would not be a mockery to declare on her behalf that she renounced the world but alas where was not the world ethel blushed at having censured others when so lately she had herself been oblivious of the higher duty she thought of the prayer including every christian in holy and loving intercessioni pray not that thou wouldest take them out of the world but that thou wouldest keep them from the evil  keep her from the evilthat shall be my prayer for my poor little leonora his grace can save her were the surrounding evil far worse than ever it is likely to be the intermixture with good is the trial and is it not so everywhereever since the world and the church have seemed fused together but she will soon be the child of a father who guards his own and at least i can pray for her and her dear mother may i only live better that so i may pray better and act better if ever i should have to act  there was a happy family gathering on the new years day and flora who had kindly felt her way with meta finding her not yet ready to enjoy a public festivity for the village added a supplement to the christmas beef that a second dinner might be eaten at home in honour of miss leonora rivers  lady leonora was highly satisfied with her visit which impressed her far more in favour of the abbotstoke neighbourhood than in the days of poor old mr rivers flora knew every one and gave little select dinnerparties which by her good management even george at the bottom of the table could not make heavy dr spencer enjoyed them greatly and was an unfailing resource for conversation and as to the hoxtons flora felt herself amply repaying the kindness she had received in her young lady days when she walked down to the diningroom with the portly headmaster or saw his good lady sit serenely admiring the handsome rooms a very superior person extremely pleasing and agreeable was the universal verdict on mrs rivers lady leonora struck up a great friendship with her and was delighted that she meant to take meta to london the only fault that could be found with her was that she had so many brothers and flora recollecting that her ladyship mistrusted those brothers avoided encouraging their presence at the grange and took every precaution against any opening for the suspicion that she threw them in the way of her little sisterinlaw  nor had flora forgotten the ladies committee or cocksmoor as to the muses they gave no trouble at all exemplary civilities about the chair passed between the members lady and mrs ledwich ending in floras insisting that priority in office should prevail feeling that she could well afford to yield the post of honour since anywhere she was the leader she did not know how much more conformable the ladies had been ever since they had known dr spencers opinion and yet he only believed that they were grateful for good advice and went about among them easy goodnatured and utterly unconscious that for him sparkled mrs ledwichs bugles and for him waved every spinsters ribbon from miss rich down to miss boulder  the point carried by their united influence was charity elwoods being sent for six months finish at the diocesan training school while a favourite pupilteacher from abbotstoke took her place at cocksmoor dr spencer looked at the training school and talked mrs ledwich into magnanimous forgiveness of mrs elwood cherry dreaded the ordeal but she was willing to do anything that was thought right and likely to make her fitter for her office     chapter xiv         twas a long doubt we never heard        exactly how the ship went downarcher gurney   the tidings came at last came when the heartsickness of hope deferred had faded into the worse heartsickness of fear deferred and when spirits had been fain to rebel and declare that they would be almost glad to part with the hope that but kept alive despair  the christmas holidays had come to an end and the home party were again alone when early in the forenoon there was a tap at the drawingroom door and dr spencer called ethel can you come and speak to me  margaret started as if those gentle tones had been a thunderclap go go ethel she said dont keep me waiting  dr spencer stood in the hall with a newspaper in his hand ethel said is it and he made a sorrowful gesture both she asked  both he repeated the ship burnedthe boat lost  ethel come hoarsely called margaret  take it said dr spencer putting the paper into her hand i will wait  she obeyed she could not speak but kneeling down by her sister they read the paragraph together ethel with one eye on the words the other on margaret  no doubt was left captain gordon had returned and this was his official report the names of the missing stood below and the list began thus          lieutenant a h ernescliffe         mr charles owen mate         mr harry may midshipman  the alcestis had taken fire on the 12th of april of the former year there had been much admirable conduct and the intrepid coolness of mr ernescliffe was especially recorded the boats had been put off without loss but they were scantily provisioned and the nearest land was far distant for five days the boats kept together then followed a night of storms and when morning dawned the second cutter under command of mr ernescliffe had disappeared there could be no doubt that she had sunk and the captain could only record his regrets for the loss the service had experienced in the three brave young officers and their gallant seamen after infinite toil and suffering the captain with the other boats crews had reached tahiti whence they had made their way home  oh margaret margaret cried ethel  margaret raised herself and the colour came into her face  i did not write the letter she said  what letter said ethel alarmed  richard prevented me the letter that would have parted us now all is well  all is well i know if we could but feel it  he never had the pain it is unbroken continued margaret her eyes brightening but her breath in longdrawn gasps that terrified ethel into calling dr spencer  mary was standing before him with bloodless face and dilated eyes but as ethel approached she turned and rushed upstairs  dr spencer entered the drawingroom with ethel who tried to read his face as he saw margaretrestored as it seemed to all her girlish bloom and her eyes sparkling as they were lifted up far beyond the present scene ethel had a moments sense that his expression was as if he had seen a deathblow struck but it was gone in a moment as he gently shook margaret by the hand and spoke a word of greeting as though to recall her  thank you she said with her own grateful smile  where is your father he asked of ethel  either at the hospital or at mr ramsdens said ethel with a ghastly suspicion that he thought margaret in a state to require him  papa said margaret if he were but here butah i had forgotten  she turned aside her head and hid her face dr spencer signed ethel nearer to him this is a more natural state he said dont be afraid for her i will find your father and bring him home pressing her hand he departed  margaret was weeping tranquillyethel knelt down beside her without daring at first to speak but sending up intense mental prayers to him who alone could bear her or her dear father through their affliction then she ventured to take her hand and margaret returned the caress but began to blame herself for the momentary selfishness that had allowed her brothers loss and her fathers grief to have been forgotten in her own ethels oh no no did not console her for this which seemed the most present sorrow but the flow of tears was so gentle that ethel trusted that they were a relief ethel herself seemed only able to watch her and to fear for her father not to be able to think for herself  the front door opened and they heard dr mays step hesitating in the hall as if he could not bear to come in  go to him cried margaret wiping off her tears ethel stood a moment in the doorway then sprang to him and was clasped in his arms  you know it he whispered  dr spencer told us did not you meet him  no i read it at bramshaws office how he could not say the words but he looked towards the room and wrung the hand he held  quiet like herself come  he threw one arm round ethel and laid his hand on her head how much there is to be thankful for he said then advancing he hung over margaret calling her his own poor darling  papa you must forgive me you said sending him to sea was giving him up  did i well margaret he did his duty that is all we have to live for our yellowhaired laddie made a gallant sailor and  tears choked his utterancemargaret gently stroked his hand  it falls hard on you my poor girl he said  no papa said margaret i am content and thankful he is spared pain and perplexity  you are right i believe said dr may he would have been grieved not to find you better  i ought to grieve for my own selfishness said margaret i cannot help it i cannot be sorry the link is unbroken and that he had not to turn to any one else  he never would cried dr may almost angrily  i tried to think he ought said margaret his life would have been too dreary but it is best as it is  it must be said the doctor where are the rest ethel call them all down  poor mary ethel felt as if she had neglected her she found her hanging over the nursery fire alternating with old nurse in fond reminiscences of harrys old days sometimes almost laughing at his pranks then crying again while aubrey sat between them drinking in each word  blanche and gertrude came from the schoolroom where miss bracy seemed to have been occupying them with much kindness and judgment she came to the door to ask ethel anxiously for the doctor and miss may and looked so affectionate and sympathising that ethel gave her a hearty kiss  dear miss ethel if you can only let me help you  thank you said ethel with all her heart and hurried away nothing was more in favour of miss bracy than that there should be a hurry then she could be warm and not morbid  dr may gathered his children round him and took out the great prayerbook he read a psalm and a prayer from the burial service and the sentence for funerals at sea then he touched each of their heads and in short broken sentences gave thanks for those still left to him and for the blessed hope they could feel for those who were gone and he prayed that they might so follow in their footsteps as to come to the same holy place and in the meantime realise the communion of saints then they said the lords prayer he blessed them and they arose  mary my dear he said you have a photograph  she put the case into his hands and ran away  he went to the study where he found dr spencer awaiting him  i am only come to know where i shall go for you  thank you spencer thank you for taking care of my poor girls  they took care of themselves they have the secret of strength  they have he turned aside and burst out oh spencer you have been spared a great deal if you missed a great deal of joy you have missed almost as much sorrow and covering his face he let his grief have a free course  dick dear old dick you must bear up think what treasures you have left  i do i try to do so said poor dr may but spencer you never saw my yellowhaired laddie with his lion look he was the flower of them all not one of these other boys came near him in manliness and with such a loving heart an hour ago i thought any certainty would be gain but now i would give a lifetime to have back the hope that i might see my boys face again oh spencer this is the first time i could rejoice that his mother is not here  she would have been your comforter sighed his friend as he felt his inability to contend with such grief  there i can be thankful dr may said and he looked so she has had her brave loving boy with her all this time while we little thoughtbut there are others my poor margaret  her patience must be blessed said dr spencer i think she will be better now that the suspense no longer preys on her there will be more rest  rest repeated dr may supporting his head on his hand and looking up dreamilythere remaineth a rest  the large bible lay beside him on the table and dr spencer thought that he would find more rest there than in his words leaving him therefore his friend went to undertake his days work and learn once more in the anxious inquiries and saddened countenances of the patients and their friends how great an amount of love and sympathy that dr may had won by his own warmth of heart the patients seemed to forget their complaints in sighs for their kind doctors troubles and the gouty mayor of stoneborough kept dr spencer half an hour to listen to his recollections of the brightfaced boys droll tricks and then to the praises of the whole may family and especially of the mother  poor dr spencer he heard her accident described so many times in the course of the day that his visits were one course of shrinking and suffering and his only satisfaction was in knowing how his friend would be cheered by hearing of the universal feeling for him and his children  ethel wrote letters to her brothers and dr may added a few lines begging richard to come home if only for a few days margaret would not be denied writing to hector ernescliffe though she cried over her letter so much that her father could almost have taken her pen away but she said it did her good  when flora came in the afternoon ethel was able to leave margaret to her and attend to mary with whom miss bracys kindness had been inefficacious if she was cheered for a few minutes some association either with the past or the vanished future soon set her off sobbing again if i only knew where dear dear harry is lying she sobbed and that it had not been very bad indeed i could bear it better  the ghastly uncertainty was too terrible for ethel to have borne to contemplate it she knew that it would haunt their pillows and she was trying to nerve herself by faith  mary she said that is the worst but after all god willed that we should not know we must bear it like his good children it makes no differences to them now  i know said mary trying to check her sobs  and you know we are all in the same keeping the sea is a glorious great pure thing you know that man cannot hurt or defile it seems to me said ethel looking up as if resting there was like being buried in our baptismtide over again till the great new birth it must be the next best place to a churchyard anywhere they are as safe as among the daisies in our own cloister  say it againwhat you said about the sea said mary more comforted than if ethel had been talking down to her  by and by ethel discovered that the sharpest trouble to the fond simple girl was the deprivation of her precious photograph it was like losing harry over again to go to bed without it though she would not for the world seem to grudge it to her father  ethel found an opportunity of telling him of this distress and it almost made him smile poor mary he said is she so fond of it it is rather a libel than a likeness  dont say so to her pray papa it is all the world to her three strokes on paper would have been the same if they had been called by his name  yes a loving heart has eyes of its own and she is a dear girl  he did not forget to restore the treasure with gratitude proportionate to what the loan had cost mary with a trembling voice she proffered it to him for the whole day and every day if she might only have it at night and she even looked black when he did not accept the proposal  it is exactly like said she  it cant help being so in a certain sense he answered kindly but after all mary dear he did not pout out his chin in that way  mary was somewhat mortified but she valued her photograph more than ever because no one else would admire it except daisy whom she had taught to regard it with unrivalled veneration  a letter soon arrived from captain gordon giving a fuller account of the loss of his ship and of the conduct of his officers speaking in the highest terms of alan ernescliffe for whom he said he mourned as for his own son and with scarcely less warmth of harry mentioning the high esteem all had felt for the boy and the good effect which the influence of his high and truthful spirit had produced on the other youngsters who keenly regretted him  captain gordon added that the will of the late captain ernescliffe had made him guardian of his sons and that he believed poor alan had died intestate he should therefore take upon himself the charge of young hector and he warmly thanked dr may and his family for all the kindness that the lad had received  though the loss of poor hectors visits was regretted it was on the whole a comforting letter and would give still more comfort in future time  richard contrived to come home through oxford and see norman whom he found calm and almost relieved by the cessation from suspense not inclined as his father had feared to drown sorrow in labour but regarding his grief as an additional call to devote himself to ministerial work in fact the blow had fallen when he first heard the rumour of danger and could not recur with the same force  richard was surprised to find that margaret was less cast down than he could have dared to hope it did not seem like an affliction to her her countenance wore the same gentle smile and she was as ready to participate in all that passed finding sympathy for the little pleasures of aubrey and gertrude and delighting in floras baby as well as going over cocksmoor politics with a clearness and accuracy that astonished him and asking questions about his parish and occupations so as fully to enjoy his short visit which she truly called the greatest possible treat  if it had not been for the momentary consternation that she had seen upon dr spencers face ethel would have been perfectly satisfied but she could not help sometimes entertaining a dim fancy that this composure came from a sense that she was too near alan to mourn for him could it be true that her frame was more wasted that there was less capability of exertion that her hours became later in the morning and that her nights were more wakeful would she fade away ethel longed to know what her father thought but she could neither bear to inspire him with the apprehension nor to ask dr spencers opinion lest she should be confirmed in her own  the present affliction altered dr may more visibly than the death of his wife perhaps because there was not the same need of exertion if he often rose high in faith and resignation he would also sink very low under the sense of bereavement and disappointment though richard was his stay and norman his pride there was something in harry more congenial to his own temper and he could not but be bowed down by the ruin of such bright hopes with all his real submission he was weak and gave way to outbursts of grief for which he blamed himself as unthankful and his whole demeanour was so saddened and depressed that ethel and dr spencer consulted mournfully over him whenever they walked to cocksmoor together  this was not as often as usual though the walls of the school were rising for dr spencer had taken a large share of his friends work for the present and both physicians were much occupied by the condition of mr ramsden who was fast sinking and for some weeks seemed only kept alive by their skill the struggle ended at last and his forty years cure of stoneborough was closed it made dr may very sadhis affections had tendrils for anything that he had known from boyhood and though he had often spoken strong words of the vicar he now sat sorrowfully moralising and making excuses people in former times had not so high an estimate of pastoral dutypoor mr ramsden had not much educationhe was already old when better times came inhe might have done better in a less difficult parish with better laity to support him etc yet after all he exclaimed with one of his impatient gestures better have my harrys seventeen years than his sixtyseven  better improve a talent than lay it by said ethel  hush ethel how do you know what he may have done if he acted up to his own standard he did more than most of us  which is best said ethel a high standard not acted up to or a lower one fulfilled  i think it depends on the will said margaret  some people are angry with those whose example would show that there is a higher standard said ethel  and said margaret some who have the high one set before them content themselves with knowing that it cannot be fully attained and will not try  the standard is the effect of early impression said dr may i should be very sorry to think it could not be raised  faithful in a little said ethel i suppose all good peoples standard is always going higher  as they comprehend more of absolute perfection said margaret     chapter xv         the citys golden spire it was        when hope and health were strongest      but now it is the churchyard grass        we look upon the longeste b browning   a disinclination for exertion or going into public hung upon dr may but he was obliged to rouse himself to attend the town council meeting which was held a few days after the vicars funeral to decide on the next appointment if it had depended on himself alone his choice would have been mr edward wilmot whom the death of his good old father had uprooted from settlesham and the girls had much hope but he was too much out of spirits to be sanguine he said that he should only hear a great deal of offensive stuff from tomkins the brewer and that in the desire to displease nobody the votes should settle down on some nonentity was the best which was likely to happen thus grumbling he set off and his daughters watched anxiously for his return they saw him come through the garden with a quick light step that made them augur well and he entered the room with the corners of his mouth turning up i see said ethel it is all right  they were going to have made a very absurd choice  but you prevented it who was it  ah i told you master ritchie was turning out a popular preacher  you dont mean that they chose richard cried margaret breathlessly  as sure as my name is dick may they did every man of them except tomkins and even he held his tongue i did not think it of them said the doctor almost overcome but there is much more goodness of heart in the world than one gives it credit for  and good dr may was not one to give the least credit for all that was like himself  but it was richards own doing he continued those sermons made a great impression and they love the boy because he has grown up among them the old mayor waddled up to me as i came in telling me that they had been talking it over and they were unanimously agreed that they could not have a parson they should like better than mr richard  good old mr doddesley i can see him cried ethel  i expected it so little that i thought he meant some richards but no he said mr richard may if he had nothing better in viewthey liked him and knew he was a very steady good young gentleman and if he took after his fathers that went before himand they thought we might like to have him settled near  how very kind said margaret as the tears came we shall love our own townsfolk better than ever  i always told you so if you would but believe it they have warm sound hearts every one of them i declare i did not know which way to look i was so sorry to disappoint them  disappoint them cried margaret in consternation  i was thinking said ethel i do not believe richard would think himself equal to this place in such a state as it is he is so diffident  yes said dr may if he were ten or twelve years older it would be another thing but here where everything is to be done he would not bring weight or force enough he would only work himself to death for individuals without going to the root margaret my darling i am very sorry to have disappointed you so muchit would have been as great a pleasure as we could have had in this world to have the lad here  and cocksmoor sighed ethel  i shall be grateful all my life to those good people for thinking of it continued the doctor but look you here it was my business to get the best man chosen in my power and though as to goodness i believe the dear ritchie has not many equals i dont think we can conscientiously say he would be at present the best vicar for stoneborough  ethel would not say no for fear she should pain margaret  besides continued dr may after having staved off the sale of the presentation as a sin it would hardly have been handsome to have let my own son profit by it it would have seemed as if we had our private ends when richard helped poor old mr ramsden  margaret owned this and ethel said richard would be glad to be spared the refusal  i was sure of it the poor fellow would have been perplexed between the right and consideration for us a vicar here ought to carry things with a high hand and that is hardest to do at a mans own home especially for a quiet lad like him  yes papa it was quite right said margaret recovering herself it has spared richard a great deal  but are we to have mr wilmot said ethel think of our not having heard  ay if they would not have had wilmot or a man of his calibre perhaps i might have let them offer it to richard i almost wish i had with help and ethel  no no papa said margaret you are making me angry with myself for my folly it is much better for richard himself and for us all as well as the town think how long we have wished for mr wilmot  he will be in time for the opening of cocksmoor school cried ethel how did you manage it  i did not manage at all said the doctor i told them exactly my mind that richard was not old enough for such arduous work and though no words could tell how obliged i was if they asked me who was the best man for it i knew i should say edward wilmot and i thought he deserved something from us for the work he did gratis when he was second master tomkins growled a little but fortunately no one was prepared with another proposal so they all came round and the mayor is to write by this evenings post and so shall i if we could only have given richard a dozen more years  margaret was somewhat comforted to find that the sacrifice had cost her father a good deal she was always slightly jealous for richard and now that alan was gone she clung to him more than ever his soft calm manner supported her more than any other human comforter and she always yearned after him when absent more than for all the other brothers but her fathers decision had been too highminded for her to dare to wish it recalled and she could not but own that richard would have had to undergo more toil and annoyance than perhaps his health would have endured  flora had discontinued comments to her sisters on her fathers proceedings finding that observations mortified margaret and did not tend to peace with ethel but she told her husband that she did not regret it much for richard would have exhausted his own income and his fathers likewise in paying curates and raising funds for charities she scarcely expected mr edward wilmot to accept the offer aware as he was of the many disadvantages he should have to contend with and unsuccessful as he had been in dealing with the ladies committee  however mr wilmot signified his thankful acceptance and in due time his familiar tap was heard at the drawingroom door at teatime as if he had just returned after the holidays he was most gladly welcomed and soon was installed in his own place with his goddaughter mary blushing with pleasure at pouring out his coffee  well ethel how is cocksmoor how like old times  oh cried ethel we are so glad you will see the beginning of the school  i hear you are finishing cherry elwood too  much against ethels will said margaret but we thought cherry not easily spoiled and whitford school seems to be in very good order dr spencer went and had an inspection of it and conferred with all the authorities  ah we have a jewel of a parishioner for you said dr may i have some hopes of stoneborough now  mr wilmot did not look too hopeful but he smiled and asked after granny hall and the children  polly grew up quite civilised said ethel she lives at whitford with some very respectable people and sends granny presents which make her merrier than ever last time it was a bonnet and jenny persuaded her to go to church in it though she said what she called the moon of it was too small  how do the people go on  i cannot say much for them it is disheartening we really have done nothing so very few go to church regularly  none at all went in my time said mr wilmot  elwood always goes said mary and taylor yes and sam hall very often and many of the women in the evening because they like to walk home with the children  the children the sunday scholars  oh every one that is big enough comes to school now here on sunday if only the teaching were better  have you sent out any more pupils to service  not many there is willie brown trying to be dr spencers little groom said ethel  but i am afraid it will take a great deal of the doctors patience to train him added margaret  it is hard said dr may he did it purely to oblige ethel and i tell her when he lames the pony i shall expect her to buy another for him out of the cocksmoor funds  ethel and mary broke out in a chorus of defence of willie brown  there was ben wheeler said mary who went to work in the quarries and the men could not teach him to say bad words because the young ladies told him not  the young ladies have not quite done nothing said dr may smiling  these are only little stray things and cherry has done the chief of them said ethel oh it is grievously bad still she added sighing such want of truth such ungoverned tongues and tempers such godlessness altogether it is only surfacework taming the children at school while they have such homes and their parents even if they do come where they might learn better are always liable to be upset as they call itturned out of their places in church and they will not run the chance  the church must come to them said mr wilmot could the school be made fit to be licensed for service  ask our architect said dr may there can be little doubt  i have been settling that i must have a curate specially for cocksmoor said mr wilmot can you tell me of one ethelor perhaps margaret could  margaret could only smile faintly for her heart was beating  seriously said mr wilmot turning to dr may do you think richard would come and help us here  this seems to be his destiny said the doctor smiling only it would not be fair to tell you lest you should be jealousthat the town council had a great mind for him  the matter was explained and mr wilmot was a great deal more struck by dr mays conduct than the good doctor thought it deserved every one was only too glad that richard should come as cocksmoor curate and though the stipend was very smallsince mr wilmot meant to have other assistanceyet by living at home it might be feasible  margarets last words that night to ethel were the last wish i had dared to make is granted  mr wilmot wrote to richard who joyfully accepted his proposal and engaged to come home as soon as his present rector could find a substitute  dr spencer was delighted and it appeared had already had a view to such possibilities in designing the plan of the school  the first good effect of mr wilmots coming was that dr spencer was cured of the vagrant habits of going to church at abbotstoke or fordholm that had greatly concerned his friend dr may who could never get any answer from him except that he was not a town councillor and as to example it was no way to set that to sleep through the sermon  to say that dr may never slept under the new dynasty would be an overstatement but slumber certainly prevailed in the minster to a far less degree than formerly one cause might be that it was not shut up unaired from one sunday to another but that the chime of the bells was no longer an extraordinary sound on a weekday it was at first pronounced that time could not be found for going to church on weekdays without neglecting other things but mary who had lately sat very loose to the schoolroom began gradually to slip down to church whenever the service was neither too early nor too late and gertrude was often found trotting by her sidegoing to mamma as the little daisy called it from some confusion between the church and the cloister which ethel was in no hurry to disturb  lectures in lent filled the church a good deal as much perhaps from the novelty as from better motives and altogether there was a renewal of energy in parish work the poor had become so little accustomed to pastoral care that the doctors and the district visitors were obliged to report cases of sickness to the clergy and vainly tried to rouse the people to send of their own accord however the better leaven began to work and of course there was a ferment though less violent than ethel had expected  mr wilmot set more cautiously to work than he had done in his younger days and did not attack prejudices so openly and he had an admirable assistant in dr spencer every one respected the opinion of the travelled doctor and he had a courteous clever process of the reduction to the absurd which seldom failed to tell while it never gave offence as to the ladies committee though there had been expressions of dismay when the tidings of the appointment first went abroad not one of the whole aonian choir liked to dissent from dr spencer and he talked them over individually into a most conformable state merely by taking their compliance for granted and showing that he deemed it only the natural state of things that the vicar should reign over the charities of the place  the committee was not dissolvedthat would have been an act of violencebut it was henceforth subject to mr wilmot and he and his curates undertook the religious instruction in the week and chose the booksa state of affairs brought about with so much quietness that ethel knew not whether flora dr spencer or mr wilmot had been the chief mover  mrs ledwich was made treasurer of a new coal club and miss rich keeper of the lendinglibrary occupations which delighted them greatly and ethel was surprised to find how much unity of action was springing up now that the period was over of each doing right in her own eyes  in fact said dr spencer when women have enough to do they are perfectly tractable  the cocksmoor accounts were ethels chief anxiety it seemed as if now there might be a schoolhouse but with little income to depend upon since poor alan ernescliffes annual ten pounds was at an end however dr may leaned over her as she was puzzling over her pounds shillings and pence and laid a cheque upon her desk she looked up in his face we must make cocksmoor harrys heir he said  by and by it appeared that cocksmoor was not out of hector ernescliffes mind the boys letters to margaret had been brief matteroffact and discouraging as long as the halfyear lasted and there was not much to be gathered about him from tom on his return for the easter holidays but soon poor hector wrote a long dismal letter to margaret  captain gordon had taken him to maplewood where the recollection of his brother and the happy hopes with which they had taken possession came thronging upon him the house was forlorn and the corner that had been unpacked for their reception was as dreary a contrast to the bright home at stoneborough as was the dry stern captain to the fatherly warmhearted doctor poor hector had little or nothing to do and the pleasure of possession had not come yet he had no companion of his own age and bashfulness made him shrink with dislike from introduction to his tenants and neighbours  there was not an entertaining book in the house he declared and the captain snubbed him if he bought anything he cared to read the captain was always at him to read musty old improving books and talking about the position he would occupy the evenings were altogether unbearable and if it were not for rabbit shooting now and the halfyear soon beginning again hector declared he should be ready to cut and run and leave captain gordon and maplewood to each otherand very well matched too he was nearly in a state of mind to imitate that unprecedented boy who wrote a letter to the times complaining of extra weeks  as to cocksmoor ethel must not think it forgotten he had spoken to the captain about it and the old woodenhead had gone and answered that it was not incumbent on him that cocksmoor had no claims upon him and he could not make it up out of his allowance for the old fellow would not give him a farthing more than he had before and had said that was too much  there was a great blur over the words woodenhead as if hector had known that margaret would disapprove and had tried to scratch it out she wrote all the consolation in her power and exhorted him to patience apparently without much effect she would not show his subsequent letters and the reading and answering them fatigued her so much that hectors writing was an unwelcome sight at stoneborough each letter as ethel said seemed so much taken out of her and she begged her not to think about them  nothing can do me much good or harm now said margaret and seeing ethels anxious looks is it not my greatest comfort that hector can still treat me as his sister or if i can only be of any use in keeping him patient only think of the danger of a boy in his situation being left without sympathy  there was nothing more to be said they all felt it was good for them that the building at cocksmoor gave full occupation to thoughts and conversation indeed tom declared they never walked in any other direction nor talked of anything else and that without hector or george rivers he had nobody to speak to however he was a good deal tranquillised by an introduction to dr spencers laboratory where he compounded mixtures that dr spencer promised should do no more harm than was reasonable to himself or any one else ethel suspected that if tom had chanced to singe his eyebrows his friend would not have regretted a blight to his nascent coxcombry but he was far too careful of his own beauty to do any such thing  richard was set at liberty just before easter and came home to his new charge he was aware of what had taken place and heartily grateful for the part his father had taken to work at cocksmoor under mr wilmot and to live at home was felicity and he fitted at once into his old place and resumed all the little home services for which he had been always famed ethel was certain that margaret was content when she saw her brother bending over her and the sense of reliance and security that the presence of the silent richard imparted to the whole family was something very peculiar especially as they were so much more active and demonstrative than he was  mr wilmot put him at once in charge of the hamlet the inhabitants were still a hard rude unpromising race and there were many flagrant evils amongst them but the last few years had not been without some effectsome were less obdurate a few really touched and almost all glad of instruction for their children if ethels perseverance had done nothing else it had at least been a witness and her immediate scholars showed the influence of her lessons     chapter xvi       then out into the world my course i did determine    though to be rich was not my wish yet to be great was charming    my talents they were not the worst nor yet my education    resolved was i at least to try to mend my situationburns   in the meantime the session of parliament had begun and the rivers party had since february inhabited park lane meta had looked pale and pensive as she bade her friends at stoneborough goodbye but only betrayed that she had rather have stayed at home by promising herself great enjoyment in meeting them again at easter  flora was on the other hand in the state of calm patronage that betokened perfect satisfaction she promised wonders for miss bracys sisterstalked of inviting mary and blanche to see sights and take lessons and undertook to send all the apparatus needed by cocksmoor school and she did accordingly send down so many wonderful articles that curate and schoolmistress were both frightened mrs taylor thought the easels were newfashioned instruments of torture and ethel found herself in a condition to be liberal to stoneborough national school  flora was a capital correspondent and made it her business to keep margaret amused so that the homeparty were well informed of the doings of each of her daysand very clever her descriptions were she had given herself a dispensation from general society until after easter but in the meantime both she and meta seemed to find great enjoyment in country rides and drives and in quiet little dinners at home to georges agreeable political friends with the help of two such ladies as mrs and miss rivers ethel could imagine georges house pleasant enough to attract clever people but she was surprised to find how full her sisters letters were of political news  it was a period when great interests were in agitation and the details of london talk and opinions were extremely welcome dr spencer used to come in to ask after mrs riverss intelligencer and when he heard the lucid statements would say she ought to have been a special correspondent and her father declared that her news made him twice as welcome to his patients but her cleverest sentences always were prefaced with george says or george thinks in a manner that made her appear merely the dutiful echo of his sentiments  in an early letter flora mentioned how she had been reminded of poor harry by finding miss walkinghames card that lady lived with her mother at richmond and on returning the visit flora was warmly welcomed by the kind old lady walkinghame who insisted on her bringing her baby and spending a long day the sistersinlaw had been enchanted with miss walkinghame whose manners wrote flora certainly merited papas encomium  on the promised long day they found an unexpected addition to the party sir henry walkinghame who had newly returned from the continent a finelooking agreeable man about fiveandthirty flora described him very lively and entertaining he talked a great deal of dr spencer and of the life in the caves at thebes and he asked me whether that unfortunate place cocksmoor did not owe a great deal to me or to one of my sisters i left meta to tell him that story and they became very sociable over it  a day or two aftersir henry walkinghame has been dining with us he has a very good voice and we had some delightful music in the evening  by and by sir henry was the second cavalier when they went to an oratorio and metas letter overflowed with the descriptions she had heard from him of italian church music he always went to rome for easter and had been going as usual this spring but he lingered and for once remained in england where he had only intended to spend a few days on necessary business  the easter recess was not spent at the grange but at lady leonoras pretty house in surrey she had invited the party in so pressing a manner that flora did not think it right to decline meta expressed some disappointment at missing easter among her schoolchildren but she said a great deal about the primroses and the green cornfields and nightingalesall which ethel would have set down to her trick of universal content if it had not appeared that sir henry was there too and shared in all the delicious rides  what would ethel say wrote flora to have our little meta as lady of the manor of cocksmoor he has begun to talk about drydale and there are various suspicious circumstances that lady leonora marks with the eyes of a discreet dowager it was edifying to see how from smiles we came to looks and by and by to confidential talks which have made her entirely forgive me for having so many tall brothers poor dear old mr rivers lady leonora owns that it was the best thing possible for that sweet girl that he did not live any longer to keep her in seclusion it is so delightful to see her appreciated as she deserves and with her beauty and fortune she might make any choice she pleases in fact i believe lady leonora would like to look still higher for her but this would be mere ambition and we should be far better satisfied with such a connection as this founded on mutual and increasing esteem with a man so well suited to her and fixing her so close to us you must not however launch out into an ocean of possibilities for the good aunt has only infected me with the castlebuilding propensities of chaperons and meta is perfectly unconscious looking on him as too hopelessly middleaged to entertain any such evil designs avowing freely that she likes him and treating him very nearly as she does papa it is my business to keep our aunt who between ourselves has below the surface the vulgarity of nature that highbreeding cannot eradicate from startling the little hummingbird before the net has been properly twined round her bright little heart as far as i can see he is much smitten but very cautious in his approaches and he is wise  margaret did not know what dismay she conveyed as she handed this letter to her sister there was no rest for ethel till she could be alone with her father could nothing prevent it could not flora be told of mr riverss wishes she asked  his wishes would have lain this way  i do not know that  it is no concern of ours there is nothing objectionable here and though i cant say it is not a disappointment it ought not to be the long and short of it is that i never ought to have told you anything about it  poor norman  absurd the lad is hardly oneandtwenty very few marry a first love ah ethel poor old rivers only mentioned it as a refuge from fortunehunters and it stands to reason that he would have preferred this anyway it is awkward for a man with empty pockets to marry an heiress and it is wholesomer for him to work for his living better that it should be out of his head at once if it were there at all i trust it was all our fancy i would not have him grieved now for worlds when his heart is sore  somehow said ethel though he is depressed and silent i like it better than i did last christmas  of course when we were laughing out of the bitterness of our hearts said dr may sighing it is a luxury to let oneself alone to be sorrowful  ethel did not know whether she desired a teteatete with norman or not she was aware that he had seen floras letter and she did not believe that he would ever mention the hopes that must have been dashed by it or if he should do so how could she ever guard her fathers secret at least she had the comfort of recognising the accustomed norman in his manner lowspirited indeed and more than ever dreamy and melancholy but not in the unnatural and excited state that had made her unhappy about him she could not help telling dr spencer that this was much more the real brother  i dare say was the answer not quite satisfactory in tone  i thought you would like it better  truth is better than fiction certainly but i am afraid he has a tendency to morbid selfcontemplation and you ought to shake him out of it  what is the difference between selfcontemplation and selfexamination  the difference between your brother and yourself ah you think that no answer will you have a medical simile selfexamination notes the symptoms and combats them selfcontemplation does as i did when i was unstrung by that illness at poonshedagore and was always feeling my own pulse it dwells on them and perpetually deplores itself oh dear this is no betterwhat a wretch i am it is always studying its deformities in a moral lookingglass  yes i think poor norman does that but i thought it right and humble  the humility of a selfconscious mind it is the very reverse of your father who is the most really humble man in existence  do you call selfconsciousness a fault  no i call it a misfortune in the vain it leads to prudent vanity in the good to a painful effort of humility  i dont think i quite understand what it is  no and you have so much of your father in you that you never will but take care of your brother and dont let his brains work  how ethel was to take care of him she did not know she could only keep a heedful eye on him and rejoice when he took tom out for a long walka companion certainly not likely to promote the working of the brainbut though it was in the opposite direction to cocksmoor tom came home desperately cross snubbed gertrude and fagged aubrey but then as blanche observed perhaps that was only because his trousers were splashed  in her next solitary walk to cocksmoor norman joined ethel she was gratified but she could not think of one safe word worth saying to him and for a mile they preserved an absolute silence until he first began ethel i have been thinking  that you have said she between hope and dread and the thrill of being again treated as his friend  i want to consult you dont you think now that richard is settled at home and if tom will study medicine that i could be spared  spared exclaimed ethel you are not much at home  i meant more than my present absences it is my earnest wish he paused and the continuation took her by surprise do you think it would give my father too much pain to part with me as a missionary to new zealand  she could only gaze at him in mute amazement  do you think he could bear it said norman hastily  he would consent she replied oh norman it is the most glorious thing man can do how i wish i could go with you  your mission is here said norman affectionately  i know it isi am contented with it said ethel but oh norman after all our talks about races and gifts you have found the more excellent way  hush charity finds room at home and mine are not such unmixed motives as yours  she made a sound of inquiry  i cannot tell you all some you shall hear i am weary of this feverish life of competition and controversy  i thought you were so happy with your fellowship i thought oxford was your delight  she will always be nearer my heart than any place save this it is not her fault that i am not like the simple and dutiful who are not fretted or perplexed  perplexed repeated ethel  it is not so now he replied god forbid but where better men have been led astray i have been bewildered till ethel i have felt as if the ground were slipping from beneath my feet and i have only been able to hide my eyes and entreat that i might know the truth  you knew it said ethel looking pale and gazing searchingly at him  i did i do but it was a time of misery when for my presumption i suppose i was allowed to doubt whether it were the truth  ethel recoiled but came nearer saying very low it is past  yes thank him who is truth you all saved me though you did not know it  when was this she asked timidly  the worst time was before the long vacation they told me i ought to read this book and that harvey anderson used to come primed with arguments i could always overthrow them but when i came to glory in doing so perhaps i prayed less anyway they left a sting it might be that i doubted my own sincerity from knowing that i had got to argue chiefly because i liked to be looked on as a champion  ethel saw the truth of what her friend had said of the morbid habit of selfcontemplation  i read and i mystified myself the better i talked the more my own convictions failed me and by the time you came up to oxford i knew how you would have shrunk from him who was your pride if you could have seen into the secrets beneath  ethel took hold of his hand you seemed bright she said  it melted like a bad dream beforebefore the hummingbird and with my father it was weeks ere i dared to face the subject again  how could you was it safe  i could not have gone on as i was sometimes the sight of my father or the mountains and lakes in scotland ororthings at the grange would bring peace back but there were dark hours and i knew that there could be no comfort till i had examined and fought it out  i suppose examination was right said ethel for a man and defender of the faith i should only have tried to pray the terrible thought away but i cant tell how it feels  worse than you have power to imagine said norman shuddering it is over now i worked out their fallacies and went over the reasoning on our side  and prayed said ethel  indeed i did and the confidence returned firmer i hope than ever it had never gone for a whole day  ethel breathed freely it was life or death she said and we never knew it  perhaps not but i know your prayers were angelwings ever round me and far more than argument was the thought of my fathers heartwhole christian love and strength  norman you believed all the time with your heart this was only a bewilderment of your intellect  i think you are right said norman to me the doubt was cruel agonynot the amusement it seems to some  because our dear home has made the truth our joy our union said ethel and you are sure the cloud is gone and for ever she still asked anxiously  he stood still for ever i trust he said i hold the faith of my childhood in all its fullness as surely asas ever i loved my mother and harry  i know you do said ethel it was only a bad dream  i hope i may be forgiven for it said norman i do not know how far it was sin it was gone so far as that my mind was convinced last christmas but the shame and sting remained i was not at peace again till the news of this spring came and brought with the grief this compensationthat i could cast behind me and forget the criticisms and doubts that those miserable debates had connected with sacred words  you will be the sounder for having fought the fight said ethel  i do not dread the like shocks said her brother but i long to leave this world of argument and discussion it is right that there should be a constant defence and battle but i am not fit for it i argue for my own triumph and in heat and harassing devotion is lost besides the comparison of intellectual power has been my bane all my life  i thought praise was your penance here  i would fain render it so butin short i must be away from it all and go to the simplest hardest work beginning from the rudiments and forgetting subtle arguments  forgetting yourself said ethel  right i want to have no leisure to think about myself said norman i am never so happy as at such times  and you want to find work so far away  i cannot help feeling drawn towards those southern seas i am glad you can give me goodspeed but what do you think about my father  ethel thought and thought i know he would not hinder you she repeated  but you dread the pain for him i had talked to tom about taking his profession but the poor boy thinks he dislikes it greatly though i believe his real taste lies that way and his aversion only arises a few grand notions he has picked up out of which i could soon talk him  tom will not stand in your place said ethel  he will be more equable and more to be depended upon said norman none of you appreciate tom however you must hear my alternative if you think my going would be too much grief for papa or if tom be set against helping him in his practice there is an evident leading of providence showing that i am unworthy of this work in that case i would go abroad and throw myself at once with all my might into the study of medicine and get ready to give my father some rest it is a shame that all his sons should turn away from his profession  i am more than ever amazed cried ethel i thought you detested it i thought papa never wished it for you he said you had not nerve  he was always full of the tenderest consideration for me said norman with heaven to help him a man may have nerve for whatever is his duty  how he would like to have you to watch and help but new zealand would be so glorious  glory is not for me said norman understand ethel the choice is new zealand or going at onceat once mindto study at edinburgh or paris  new zealand at once said ethel  i suppose i mast stay for divinity lectures but my intention must be avowed said norman hastily and now will you sound my father i cannot  i cant sound said ethel i can only do things pointblank  do then said norman any way you can only let me know which is best for him you get all the disagreeable things to do good old unready one he added kindly i believe you are the one who would be shoved in front if we were obliged to face a basilisk  the brightness that had come over norman when he had discharged his cares upon her was encouragement enough for ethel she only asked how much she was to repeat of their conversation  whatever you think best i do not want to grieve him but he must not think it fine in me  ethel privately thought that no power on earth could prevent him from doing that  it was not consistent with cautious sounding that norman was always looking appealingly towards her and indeed she could not wait long with such a question on her mind she remained with her father in the drawingroom when the rest were gone upstairs and plunging at once into the matter she said papa there is something that norman cannot bear to say to you himself  hummingbirds to wit said dr may  no indeed but he wants to be doing something at once what should you think ofofthere are two things one isgoing out as a missionary  hummingbirds in another shape said the doctor startled but smiling so as to pique her  you mean to treat it as a boys fancy said she  it is rather suspicious he said well what is the other of his two things  the other is to begin studying medicine at once so as to help you  heyday cried dr may drawing up his tall vigorous figure does he think me so very ancient and superannuated  what could possess him to be so provoking and unsentimental tonight was it her own bad management she longed to put an end to the conversation and answered no but he thinks it hard that none of your sons should be willing to relieve you  it wont be norman said dr may he is not made of the stuff if he survived the course of study every patient he lost he would bring himself in guilty of murder and there would soon be an end of him  he says that a man can force himself to anything that is his duty  this is not going to be his duty if i can make it otherwise what is the meaning of all this no i need not ask poor boy it is what i was afraid of  it is far deeper said ethel and she related great part of what she had heard in the afternoon it was not easy to make her father listenhis line was to be positively indignant rather than compassionate when he heard of the doubts that had assailed poor norman foolish boy what business had he to meddle with those accursed books when he knew what they were made ofit was tasting poison it was running into temptation he had no right to expect to come out safe and then he grasped tightly hold of ethels hands and as if the terror had suddenly flashed on him asked her with dilated eye and trembling voice whether she were sure that he was safe and held the faith  ethel repeated his asseveration and her father covered his face with his hands in thanksgiving  after this he seemed somewhat inclined to hold poor oxford in horror only as he observed it would be going out of the fryingpan into the fire to take refuge at parisa recurrence to the notion of normans medical studies that showed him rather enticed by the proposal  he sent ethel to bed saying he should talk to norman and find out what was the meaning of it and she walked upstairs much ashamed of having so ill served her brother as almost to have made him ridiculous  dr may and norman never failed to come to an understanding and after they had had a long drive into the country together dr may told ethel that he was afraid of what he ought not to be afraid of that she was right that the lad was very much in earnest now at any rate and if he should continue in the same mind he hoped he should not be so weak as to hold him from a blessed work  from norman ethel heard the warmest gratitude for his fathers kindness nothing could be done yet he must wait patiently for the present but he was to write to his uncle mr arnott in new zealand and without pledging himself to make inquiries as to the mission and in the meantime return to oxford where to his other studies he was to add a course of medical lectures which as dr may said would do him no harm would occupy his mind and might turn to use wherever he was  ethel was surprised to find that norman wrote to flora an expression of his resolution that if he found he could be spared from assisting his father as a physician he would give himself up to the mission in new zealand why should he tell any one so unsympathetic as flora who would think him wasted in either case     chapter xvii         do not fear heaven is as near      by water as by landlongfellow   the fifth of may was poor harrys eighteenth birthday and as usual was a holiday etheldred privately thought his memory more likely to be respected if blanche and aubrey were employed than if they were left in idleness but mary would have been wretched had the celebration been omitted and a leisure day was never unwelcome  dr spencer carried off blanche and aubrey for a walk and ethel found mary at her great resortharrys cupboarddusting and arranging his books and the array of birthday gifts to which even today she had not failed to add the marker that had been in hand at christmas ethel entreated her to come down and mary promised and presently appeared looking so melancholy that as a sedative ethel set her down to the basket of scraps to find materials for a tippet for some one at cocksmoor intending as soon as margaret should be dressed to resign her morning to the others invite miss bracy to the drawingroom and read aloud  gertrude was waiting for her walk till nurse should have dressed margaret and was frisking about the lawn sometimes looking in at the drawingroom window at her sisters sometimes chattering to adams at his work or laughing to herself and the flowers in that overflow of mirth that seemed always bubbling up within her  she was standing in rapt contemplation of a peartree in full blossom her hands tightly clasped behind the back for greater safety from the temptation when hearing the shrubbery gate open she turned expecting to see her papa but was frightened at the sight of two strangers and began to run off at full speed  stop blanche blanche dont you know me the voice was that tone of her brothers and she stood and looked but it came from a tall ruddy youth in a shabby rough blue coat followed by a grizzled old seaman she was too much terrified and perplexed even to run  whats the matter blanche it is i why dont you know meharry  poor brother harry is drowned she answered and with one bound he was beside her and snatching her up devoured her with kisses  put me downput me down please was all she could say  it is not blanche what the little daisy i do believe  yes i am gertrude but please let me go and at the same time adams hurried up as if he thought her being kidnapped but his aspect changed at the glad cry ha adams how are you are they all well  tisnt never master harry bless me as harrys hand gave him sensible proof when we had given you up for lost  my father well harry asked hurrying the words one over the other  quite well sir but he never held up his head since he heard it and poor miss mary has so moped about if ever i thought to see the like  so they did not get my letter but i cant stop jennings will tell you take care of him come daisy for he had kept her unwilling hand all the time but whats that for pointing to the black ribbons and stopping short startled  because of poor harry said the bewildered child  oh thats right cried he striding on and dragging her in a breathless run as he threw open the wellknown doors and she escaping from him hid her face in marys lap screaming he says he is harry he says he is not drowned  at the same moment ethel was in his arms and his voice was sobbing ethel mary home wheres papa one moments almost agonising joy in the certainty of his identity but ere she could look or think he was crying mary oh ethel see  mary had not moved but sat as if turned to stone with breath suspended widestretched eyes and deathlike cheeksethel sprang to her mary mary dear it is harry it is himself dont you see speak to her harry  he seemed almost afraid to do so but recovering himself exclaimed mary dear old polly here i am oh wont you speak to me he added piteously as he threw his arm round her and kissed her startled at the cold touch of her cheek  the spell seemed broken and with a wild hoarse shriek that rang through the house she struggled to regain her breath but it would only come in painful audible catches as she held harrys hand convulsively  what have i done he exclaimed in distress  whats this who is this frightening my dear was old nurses exclamation as she and james came at the outcry  oh nurse what have i done to her repeated harry  it is joyit is sudden joy said ethel see she is better now  master harry well i never and james with one wring of the hand retreated while old nurse was nearly hugged to death declaring all the time that he didnt ought to have come in such a way terrifying every one out of their senses and as for poor miss may  where is she cried harry starting at the sight of the vacant sofa  only upstairs said ethel but wheres alan is not he come  oh ethel dont you know his face told but too plainly  nurse nurse how shall we tell her said ethel  poor dear exclaimed nurse sounding her tongue on the roof of her mouth shell never abear it without her papa wait for him i should say but bless me miss mary to see you go on like that when master harry is come back such a bonny man  im better now said mary with an effort oh harry speak to me again  but margaret said ethel while the brother was holding mary in his embrace and she lay tremulous with the new ecstasy upon his breastbut margaret nurse you must go up or she will suspect ill come when i can speak quietly oh poor margaret if richard would but come in  ethel walked up and down the room divided between a tumult of joy grief dread and perplexity at that moment a little voice said at the door please margaret wants harry to come up directly  they looked one upon another in consternation they had never thought of the child who of course had flown up at once with the tidings  go up miss ethel said nurse  oh nurse i cant be the first come harry come  handinhand they silently ascended the stairs and ethel pushed open the door margaret was on her couch her whole form and face in one throb of expectation  she looked into harrys facethe eagerness flitted like sunshine on the hillside before a cloud and without a word she held out her arms  he threw himself on his knees and her fingers were clasped among his thick curls while his frame heaved with suppressed sobs oh if he could only have come back to you  thank god she said then slightly pushing him back she lay holding his hand in one of hers and resting the other on his shoulder and gazing in silence into his face each was stillshe was gathering strengthhe dreaded word or look  tell me how and where she said at last  it was in the loyalty isles it was feverthe exertions for us his head was lying here and he pointed to his own breast he sent his love to youhe bade me tell you there would be meeting by and by in the haven where he would bei laid his head in the graveunder the great palmi said some of the prayersthere are christians round it  he said this in short disconnected phrases often pausing to gather voice but forced to resume by her inquiring looks and pressure of his hand  she asked no more kiss me she said and when he had done so thank you go down please all of you you have brought great relief thank you but i cant talk yet you shall tell me the rest by and by  she sent them all away even ethel who would have lingered  go to him dearest let me be alone dont be uneasy this is peacebut go  ethel found mary and harry interlaced into one moving figure and harry greedily asking for his father and norman as if famishing for the sight of them he wanted to set out to seek the former in the town but his movements were too uncertain and the girls clung to the newlyfound as if they could not trust him away from them they wandered about speaking all three at random without power of attending to the answers it was enough to see him and touch him they could not yet care where he had been  dr may was in the midst of them ere they were aware one look and he flung his arms round his son but suddenly letting him go he burst away and banged his study door harry would have followed  no dont said ethel then seeing him disappointed she came nearer and murmured he entered into his chamber and  harry silenced her with another embrace but their father was with them again to verify that he had really seen his boy and ask alas whether alan were with margaret the brief sad answer sent him to see how it was with her she would not let him stay she said it was infinite comfort and joy was coming but she would rather be still and not come down till evening  perhaps others would fain have been still could they have borne an instants deprivation of the sight of their dear sailor while greetings came thickly on him the children burst in having heard a report in the town and dr spencer waited at the door for the confirmation but when ethel would have flown out to him he waved his hand shut the door and hurried away as if a word to her would have been an intrusion  the brothers had been summoned by a headlong apparition of will adams in cocksmoor school shouting that master harry was come home and normans long legs outspeeding richard had brought him back flushed and too happy for one word while well harry was richards utmost and his care for margaret seemed to overpower everything else as he went up and was not so soon sent away  words were few downstairs blanche and aubrey agreed that they thought people would have been much happier but in fact the joy was oppressive from very newness ethel roamed about she could not sit still without feeling giddy in the strangeness of the revulsion her father sat as if a word would break the blest illusion and harry stood before each of them in turn as if about to speak but turned his address into a sudden caress or blow on the shoulder and tried to laugh little gertrude not understanding the confusion had taken up her station under the table and peeped out from beneath the cover  there was more composure as they sat at dinner and yet there was very little talking or eating afterwards dr may and norman exultingly walked away to show their harry to dr spencer and mr wilmot and ethel would gladly have tried to calm herself and recover the balance of her mind by giving thanks where they were due but she did not know what to do with her sisters blanche was wild and mary still in so shaky a state of excitement that she went off into mad laughing when blanche discovered that they were in mourning for harry  nothing would satisfy blanche but breaking in on margaret and climbing to the top of the great wardrobe to disinter the coloured raiment beseeching that each favourite might be at once put on to do honour to harry mary chimed in with her in begging for the wedding merinoswould not margaret wear her beautiful blue  no my dear i cannot said margaret gently  mary looked at her and was again in a flood of tears incoherently protesting together with ethel that they would not change  no dears said margaret i had rather you did so you must not be unkind to harry he will not think i do not welcome him i am only too glad that richard would not let my impatience take away my right to wear this  ethel knew that it was for life  mary could not check her tears and would go on making heroic protests against leaving off her black sobbing the more at each margarets gentle caresses seemed to make her worse and ethel afraid that margarets own composure would be overthrown exclaimed how can you be so silly come away and rather roughly pulled her out of the room when she collapsed entirely at the top of the stairs and sat crying helplessly  i cant think whats the use of harrys coming home gertrude was heard saying to richard it is very disagreeable whereat mary relapsed into a giggle and ethel felt frantic  richard richard what is to be done with mary she cant help it i believe but this is not the way to treat the mercy that  mary had better go and lie down in her own room said richard tenderly and gravely  oh please please began mary i shall not see him when he comes back  if you cant behave properly when he does come said richard there is no use in being there  remember ritchie said ethel thinking him severe she has not been well this long time  mary began to plead but with his own pretty persuasive manner he took her by the hand and drew her into his room and when he came down after an interval it was to check blanche who would have gone up to interrupt her with queries about the perpetual blue merino he sat down with blanche on the staircase windowseat and did not let her go till he had gently talked her out of flighty spirits into the soberness of thankfulness  ethel meanwhile had still done nothing but stray about long for loneliness find herself too unsteady to finish her letters to flora and tom and while she tried to make gertrude think harry a pleasant acquisition she hated her own wild heart that could not rejoice nor give thanks aright  by and by mary came down with her bonnet on quite quiet now i am going to church with ritchie she said ethel caught at the notion and it spread through the house dr may who just then came in with his two sons looked at harry saying what do you think of it shall we go my boy and harry as soon as he understood declared that he should like nothing better it seemed what they all needed even aubrey and gertrude begged to come and when the solemn old minster was above their heads and the hallowed stillness around them the tightened sense of halfrealised joy began to find relief in the chant of glory the voices of the sanctuary ever uplifting notes of praise seemed to gather together and soften their emotions and agitation was soothed away and all that was oppressive and tumultuous gave place to sweet peace and thankfulness ethel dimly remembered the like sense of relief when her mother had hushed her wild ecstasy while sympathising with her joy richard could not trust his voice but mr wilmot offered the special thanksgiving  harry was indeed at home and his tears fell fast over his book as he heard his fathers amen so fervent and so deep and he gazed up and around with fond and earnest looks as thoughts and resolutions formed there of old came gathering thick upon him and there little gertrude seemed first to accept him she whispered to her papa as they stood up to go away that it was very good in god almighty to have sent harry home and as they left the cloister she slipped into harrys hand a daisy from the grave such a gift as she had never carried to any one else save her father and margaret and she shrank no longer from being lifted up in his arms and carried home through the twilight street  he hurried into the drawingroom and was heard declaring that all was right for margaret was on the sofa but he stopped short grieved at her altered looks she smiled as he stooped to kiss her and then made him stand erect and measure himself against norman whose height he had almost reached the little curly midshipman had come back as nurse said a finegrowed young man his rosy cheeks brown and ruddy and his countenance  you are much more like papa and norman than i thought you would be said margaret  he has left his snub nose and yellow locks behind said his father though the shaggy mane seems to remain i believe lions grow darker with age so there stand june and july together again  dr may walked backwards to look at them it was good to see his face  i shall see flora and tom tomorrow said harry after nodding with satisfaction as they all took their wonted places  going exclaimed richard  why dont you know said ethel it is current in the nursery that he is going to be tried by courtmartial for living with the king of the cannibal islands  aubrey says he had a desert island with jennings for his man friday said blanche  harry said little gertrude who had established herself on his knee did you really poke out the giants eye with the top of a firtree  who told you so daisy was the general cry but she became shy and would not answer more than by a whisper about aubrey who indignantly declared that he never said so only gertrude was so foolish that she did not know harry from ulysses  after all said ethel i dont think our notions are much more defined papa and norman may know more but we have heard almost nothing i have been waiting to hear more to close up my letters to flora and tom what a shame that has not been done  ill finish said mary running to the sidetable  and tell her ill be there tomorrow said harry i must report myself and what fun to see flora a member of parliament come with me june ill be back next day i wish you all would come  yes i must come with you said norman i shall have to go to oxford on thursday and very reluctant he looked tell flora i am coming mary  how did you know that flora was a married lady asked blanche in her wouldbe grownup manner  i heard that from aunt flora a famous lot of news i picked up there  aunt flora  did you not know he had been at auckland said dr may aunt flora had to nurse him well after all he had undergone did you not think her very like mamma harry  mamma never looked half so old cried harry indignantly  flora was five years younger  she has got her voice and way with her said harry but you will soon see she is coming home soon  there was a great outcry of delight  yes there is some money of uncle arnotts that must be looked after but he does not like the voyage and cant leave his office so perhaps aunt flora may come alone she had a great mind to come with me but there was no good berth for her in this schooner and i could not wait for another chance i cant think what possessed the letters not to come she would not write by the first packet because i was so ill but we both wrote by the next and i made sure you had them or i would have written before i came  the words were not out of his mouth before the second post was brought in and there were two letters from new zealand what would they not have been yesterday harry would have burned his own but the long closelywritten sheets were eagerly seized as affording the best hope of understanding his adventures as it had been written at intervals from auckland and the papers passing from one to the other formed the text for interrogations on further details though much more was gleaned incidentally in teteatetes by margaret norman or his father and no one person ever heard the whole connectedly from harry himself  what was the first you knew of the fire harry asked dr may looking up from the letter  owen shaking me awake and i thought it was a hoax said harry but it was true enough and when we got on deck there were clouds of smoke coming up the main hatchway  margarets eyes were upon him and her lips formed the question and he  he met us and told us to be steadybut there was little need for that every man there was as cool and collected as if it had been no more than the cooks stoveand we should have scorned to be otherwise he put his hand on my shoulder and said keep by me and i did  then there was never much hope of extinguishing the fire  no if you looked down below the forecastle it was like a furnace and though the pumps were at work it was only to gain time while the boats were lowered the first lieutenant told off the men and they went down the side without one word only shaking hands with those that were left  oh harry what were you thinking of cried blanche  of the powder said harry  ethel thought there was more in that answer than met the ear and that harry at least had thought of the powder tonight at church  mr ernescliffe had the command of the second cutter he asked to take me with him i was glad enough and owenhe is mate you knowwent with us  as to telling how he felt when he saw the good ship alcestis blown to fragments that was past harry and all but blanche were wise enough not to ask she had by way of answer very glad to be safe out of her  nor was harry willing to dwell on the subsequent days when the unclouded sun had been a cruel foe and the insufficient stores of food and water did indeed sustain life but a life of extreme suffering what he told was of the kindness that strove to save him as the youngest from all that could be spared him if i dropped asleep at the bottom of the boat i was sure to find some one shading me from the sun if there was an extra drop of water they wanted me to have it  tell me their names harry cried dr may if ever i meet one of them  but the storm harry the storm asked blanche was that not terrible  very comfortable at first blanche was the answer oh that rain  but when it grew so very bad  we did not reck much what happened to us said harry it could not be worse than starving when we missed the others in the morning most of us thought them the best off  mary could not help coming round to kiss him as if eyes alone were not enough to satisfy her that here he was  dr may shuddered and went on reading and margaret drew harry down to her and once more by looks craved for more minute tidings  all that you can think murmured harry the very life and soul of us allso kind and yet discipline as perfect as on board but dont now margaret  the tone of the dont the reddening cheek liquid eye and heaving chest told enough of what the lieutenant had been to one at least of the desolate boats crew  oh harry harry i cant bear it exclaimed mary how long did it last how did it end  fifteen days said harry it was time it should end for all the water we had caught in the storm was gonewe gave the last drop to jones for we thought him dying ones tongue was like a dry sponge  how did it end repeated mary in an agony  jennings saw a sail we thought it all a fancy of weakness but twas true enough and they saw our signal of distress  the vessel proved to be an american whaler which had just parted with her cargo to a homeward bound ship and was going to refit and take in provisions and water at one of the milanesian islands before returning for further captures the master was a man of the shrewd hard moneymaking cast but at the price of mr ernescliffes chronometer and of the services of the sailors he undertook to convey them where they might fall in with packets bound for australia  the distressed alcestes at first thought themselves in paradise but the vessel built with no view save to whales and with a considerable reminiscence of the blubber lately parted with proved no wholesome abode when overcrowded and in the tropics mr ernescliffes science resolution and constancy had saved his men so far but with the need for exertion his powers gave way and he fell a prey to a return of the fever which had been his introduction to dr may  there he was said harry laid up in a little bit of a stifling cabin just like an oven without the possibility of a breath of air the skinflint skipper carried no medicine the watershocking stuff it waswas getting so low that there was only a pint a day served out to each and though all of us alcestes clubbed every drop we could spare for himit was bad work owen and i never were more glad in our lives than when we heard we were to cast anchor at the loyalty isles such a place as it was you little know what it was to see anything green and there was this isle fringed down close to the sea with cocoanut trees and the bay as clearyou could see every shell and wonderful fishes swimming in it well every one was for going ashore and some of the natives swam out to us and brought things in their canoes but not many it is not encouraged by the mission nor by davidfor those yankee traders are not the most edifying societyand the crew vowed they were cannibals and had eaten a man three years ago so they all went ashore armed  you stayed with him said margaret  ay it was my turn and i was glad enough to have some fresh fruit and water for him but he could not take any notice of it did not i want you papa well by and by owen came back in a perfect rapture with the place and the people and said it was the only hope for mr ernescliffe to take him on shore  then you did really go amongst the cannibals exclaimed blanche  that is all nonsense said harry some of them may once have been and i fancy the heathens might not mind a bit of long pig still but these have been converted by the samoans  the samoans it was further explained are the inhabitants of the navigator islands who having been converted by the church missionary society have sent out great numbers of most active and admirable teachers among the scattered islands braving martyrdom and disease never shrinking from their work and by teaching and example preparing the way for fuller doctrine than they can yet impart a station of these devoted men had for some years been settled in this island and had since been visited by the missions of newcastle and new zealand the young chief whom harry called david and another youth had spent two summers under instruction at new zealand and had been baptised they were spending the colder part of the year at home and hoped shortly to be called for by the missionship to return and resume their course of instruction  owen had come to an understanding with the chief and the samoans and had decided on landing his lieutenant and it was accordingly done with very little consciousness on the patients part black figures with woolly mopheads and sometimes decorated with whitewash of lime crowded round to assist in the transport of the sick man through the surf and david himself in a white european garb met his guests with dignified manners that would have suited a prince of any land and conducted them through the grove of palms interspersed with white huts to a beautiful house consisting of a central room with many others opening from it floored with white coral lime and lined with soft shining mats of samoan manufacture this harry learned had been erected by them in hopes of an english missionary taking up his abode amongst them  they were a kindly people and had shown hospitality to other englishmen who had less appreciated it than these young officers could they lavished every kindness in their power upon them and mr ernescliffe at first revived so much that he seemed likely to recover  but the ship had completed her repairs and was ready to sail the two midshipmen thought it would be certain death to their lieutenant to bring him back to such an atmosphere and so continued harrys letter to his father i thought there was nothing for it but for me to stay with him and that you would say so i got owen to consent after some trouble as we were sure to be fetched off one time or another we said not a word to mr ernescliffe for he was only sensible now and then so that owen had the command owen made the skipper leave me a pistol and some powder but i was ashamed david should know it and stowed it away as to the quartermaster old jennings whose boy you remember we picked up at the roman camp he had not forgotten that and when we were shaking hands and wishing goodbye he leaped up and vowed he would never leave the young gentleman that had befriended his boy to be eaten up by them black savage niggers if they made roastpork of mr may he would be eaten first though he reckoned they would find him a tougher morsel i dont think owen was sorry he volunteered and no words can tell what a blessing the good old fellow was to us both  so there we stayed and at first mr ernescliffe seemed mending the delirium went off he could talk quite clearly and comfortably and he used to lie listening when david and i had our odd sort of talks i believe if you had been there or we could have strengthened him any way he might have got over it but he never thought he should and he used to talk to me about all of you and said stoneborough had been the most blessed spot in his life he had never had so much of a home and that sharing our grief and knowing you had done him great good just when he might have been getting elated i cannot recollect it all though i tried hard for margarets sake but he said hector would have a great deal of temptation and he hoped you would be a father to him and norman an elder brother you would not think how much he talked of cocksmoor about a church being built there as ethel wished and little daisy laying the first stone i remember one night i dont know whether he was quite himself for he looked full at me with his eyes that had grown so large till i did not know what was coming and he said i have seen a ship built by a sailors vow the roof was like the timbers of a shipthat was right mind it is so that is the ship that bears through the waves there is the anchor that enters within the veil i believe that was what he said i could not forget thathe looked at me so but much more he said that i dimly remember and chiefly about poor dear margaret he bade me tell herhis own precious pearl as he used to call herthat he was quite content and believed it was best for her and him both that all should be thus settled for they did not part for ever and he trustedbut i cant write all that there was a great tearblot just here it is too good to recollect anywhere but at church i have been there today with my uncle and aunt and i thought i could have told it when i came home but i was too tired to write then and now i dont seem as if it could be written anyhow when i come home i will try to tell margaret the most part was about her only what was better seemed to swallow that up  the narrative broke off here but had been subsequently resumed  for all mr ernescliffe talked as i told you he was so quiet and happy that i made sure he was getting well but jennings did not and there came an old heathen native once to see us who asked why we did not bury him alive because he got no better and gave trouble at last one nightit was the third of augusthe was very restless and could not breathe nor lie easily i lifted him up in my arms for he was very light and thin and tried to make him more comfortable but presently he said is it you harry god bless you and in a minute i knew he was dead you will tell margaret all about it i dont think she can love him more than i did and she did not half know him for she never saw him on board nor in all that dreadful time nor in his illness she will never know what she has lost  there was another break here and the story was continued  we buried him the next day where one could see the sea close under the great palm where david hopes to have a church one of these days david helped us and said the lords prayer and the glory with us there i little thought when i used to grumble at my two verses of the psalms every day when i should want the ninetieth or how glad i should be to know so many by heart for they were such a comfort to mr ernescliffe  david got us a nice bit of wood and jennings carved the cross and his name and all about him i should have liked to have done it but i knocked up after that jennings thinks i had a sunstroke i dont know but my head was so bad whenever i moved that i thought only jennings would ever have come to tell you about it jennings looked after me as if i had been his own son and there was david too as kind as if he had been richard himselfalways sitting by to bathe my forehead or when i was a little better to talk to me and ask me questions about his christian teaching you must not think of him like a savage for he is my friend and a far more perfect gentleman than i ever saw any one but you papa holding the command over his people so easily and courteously and then coming to me with little easy first questions about the belief and such things like what we used to ask mamma he liked nothing so well as for me to tell him about king david and we had learned a good deal of each others languages by that time the notion of his heartlike cocksmoor to ethelis to get a real english mission and have all his people christians ethel talked of good kings being davids to their line i think that is what he will be if he lives but those islanders have been dying off since europeans came among them  but harrys letter could not tell what he confessed one night to his father the next time he was out with him by starlight how desolate he had been and how he had yearned after his home and one evening he had been utterly overcome by illness and loneliness and had cried most bitterly and uncontrollably and though jennings thought it was for his friends death it really was homesickness and the thought of his father and mary jennings had helped him out to the entrance of the hut that the cool night air might refresh his burning brow orion shone clear and bright and brought back the night when they had chosen the starry hunter as his friend it seemed he said as if you all were looking at me and smiling to me in the stars and there was the southern cross upright which was like the minster to me and i recollected it was sunday morning at home and knew you would be thinking about me i was so glad you had let me be confirmed and be with you that last sunday papa for it seemed to join me on so much the more and when i thought of the words in church they seemed somehow to float on me so much more than ever before and it was like the minster and your voice i should not have minded dying so much after that  at last harrys black prince had hurried into the hut with the tidings that his english fathers ship was in the bay and soon english voices again sounded in his ears bringing the forlorn boy such warmth of kindness that he could hardly believe himself a mere stranger if alan could but have shared the joy with him  he was carried down to the boat in the cool of the evening and paused on the way for a last farewell to the lonely grave under the palm treeone of the many sailors graves scattered from the tropics to the poles and which might be the first seed in a gods acre to that island becoming what the graves of holy men of old are to us  a short space more of kind care from his new friends and his christian chief and harry awoke from a feverish doze at sounds that seemed so like a dream of home that he was unwilling to break them by rousing himself but they approved themselves as real and he found himself in the embrace of his mothers sister  and here mrs arnotts story began of the note that reached her in the early morning with tidings that her nephew had been picked up by the missionship and how she and her husband had hastened at once on board  they sent me below to see a hero she wrote what i saw was a scarecrow sort of likeness of you dear richard but when he opened his eyes there was our maggie smiling at me i suppose he would not forgive me for telling how he sobbed and cried when he had his arms round my neck and his poor aching head on my shoulder poor fellow he was very weak and i believe he felt for the moment as if he had found his mother  we brought him home with us but when the next mail went the fever was still so high that i thought it would be only alarm to you to write and i had not half a story either though you may guess how proud i was of my nephew  harrys troubles were all over from that time he had thenceforth to recover under his aunts motherly care while talking endlessly over the home that she loved almost as well as he did he was well more quickly than she had ventured to hope and nothing could check his impatience to reach his home not even the hopes of having his aunt for a companion the very happiness he enjoyed with her only made him long the more ardently to be with his own family and he had taken his leave of her and of his dear david and sailed by the first packet leaving auckland  i never knew what the old great bear was to me till i saw him again said harry  it was late when the elders had finished all that was to be heard at present and the clock reminded them that they must part  and you go tomorrow sighed margaret  i must jennings has to go on to portsmouth and see after his son  oh let me see jennings exclaimed margaret may i not papa  richard who had been making friends with jennings whenever he had not been needed by his sisters that afternoon went to fetch him from the kitchen where all the servants and all their particular friends were listening to the yarn that made them hold their heads higher as belonging to master harry  harry stepped forward met jennings and said aside my sister jennings my sister that you have heard of  dr may had already seen the sailor but he could not help addressing him again come in come in and see my boy among us all without you we never should have had him  make him come to me said margaret breathlessly as the embarrassed sailor stood sleeking down his hair and when he had advanced to her couch she looked up in his face and put her hand into his great brown one  i could not help saying thank you she said  mr may sir cried jennings almost crying and looking round for harry as a sort of protectortell them sir please it was only my dutyi could not do no less and you knows it sir as if harry had been making an accusation against him  we know you could not said margaret and that is what we would thank you for if we could i know hemr ernescliffemust have been much more at rest for leaving my brother with so kind a friend and  please miss dont say no more about it mr ernescliffe was as fine an officer as ever stepped a quarterdeck and mr may here wont fall short of him and was i to be after leaving the like of them to the mercy of the black fellowsthat was not so bad neither if it had only pleased god that we had brought them both back to you miss but you see a man cant be everything at once and mr ernescliffe was not so stout as his heart  you did everything we know began dr may  twas a real pleasure said jennings hastily for two such real gentlemen as they was mr may sir i beg your pardon if i say it to your face never flinched nor spoke a word of complaint through it all and as to the other  margaret cannot bear this said richard coming near it is too much  the sailor shook his head and was retreating but margaret signed him to come near again and grasped his hand harry followed him out of the room to arrange their journey and presently returned  he says he is glad he has seen margaret he says she is the right sort of stuff for mr ernescliffe  harry had not intended margaret to hear but she caught the words smiled radiantly and whispered i wish i may be     chapter xviii    margaret had borne the meeting much too well for her own good and a wakeful night of palpitation was the consequence but she would not allow any one to take it to heart and declared that she should be ready to enjoy harry by the time he should return and meantime she should dwell on the delight of his meeting flora  no one had rested too soundly that night and dr may had not been able to help looking in at his sleeping boy at five in the morning to certify himself that he had not only figured his present bliss to himself in his ten minutes dream and looking in again at halfpast seven he found harry half dressed with his arm round mary laughing almost sobbing over the treasures in his cupboard which he had newly discovered in their fresh order  dr may looked like a new man that morning with his brightened eye and bearing as if there were a wellspring of joy within him ready to brim over at once in tear and in smile and finding an outlet in the praise and thanksgiving that his spirit chanted and his face expressed and in that sunny genial benevolence that must make all share his joy  he was going to run over half the townevery one would like to hear it from him ethel and mary must go to the restthe old women in the almshouses where lived an old cook who used to be fond of harrythey should have a feast all who were well enough in the hospital should have a teadrinking dr hoxton had already granted a holiday to the school every boy with whom they had any connection should come to dinner and edward anderson should be asked to meet harry on his return because poor fellow he was so improved  dr may was in such a transport of kindhearted schemes that he was not easily made to hear that harry had not a sixpence wherewith to reach london  ethel meanwhile was standing beside her brother tendering to him some gold as his last quarter  how did you get it ethel do you keep the purse  no but papa took cocksmoor in your stead when  nonsense ethel said harry i dont want it have i not all my pay and allowance for the whole time i was dead and as to robbing cocksmoor  yes keep it ethel said her father do you think i would take it now when if there were a thankoffering in the worldand by the bye your cocksmoor children must have something to remember this by  every one could have envied norman for travelling to london with harry but that he must proceed to oxford in two days when harry would return to them the stationmaster thinking he could not do enough for the returned mariner put the two brothers into the coupe as if they had been a bridal couple and they were very glad of the privacy having as yet hardly spoken to each other when harrys attention was dispersed among so many  norman asked many questions about the mission work in the southern hemisphere and ended by telling his brother of his design which met with harrys hearty approbation  thats right old june theres nothing they want so much as such as you how glad my aunt will be perhaps you will see david oh if you were to go out to the loyalty group  very possibly i might said norman  tell them you are my brother and how they will receive you i can see the mopheads they will dress in honour of you and what a feast of pork and yams you will have to eat but there is plenty of work among the maoris for youthey want a clergyman terribly at the next village to my uncles place i say norman it will go hard if i dont get a ship bound for the pacific and come and see you  i shall reckon on you that is if i have not to stay to help my father  to be sure exclaimed harry i thought you would have stayed at home and married little miss rivers  thus broadly and boyishly did he plunge into that most tender subject making his brother start and wince as if he had touched a wound  nonsense he cried almost angrily  well you used to seem very much smitten but so to be sure were some of the alcestes with the young ladies at valparaiso how we used to roast owen about that spanish donna and he was as bad at sydney about the young lady whose father we told him was a convict though he kept such a swell carriage he had no peace about his fatherinlaw the housebreaker dont i remember how you pinched her hand the night you were righted  you know nothing about it said norman shortly she is far beyond my reach  a fine lady ha well i should have thought you as good as flora any day said harry indignantly  she is what she always was said norman anxious to silence him but it is unreasonable to think of it she is all but engaged to sir henry walkinghame  walkinghame cried the volatile sailor i have half a mind to send in my name to flora as miss walkinghame and he laughed heartily over that adventure ending however with a sigh as he said it had nearly cost me a great deal but tell me norman how has that meta as they called her turned out i never saw anything prettier or nicer than she was that day of the roman encampment and i should be sorry if that fine fashionable aunt of hers had made her stuckup and disdainful  no such thing said norman  ha said harry to himself i see how it is she has gone and made poor old june unhappy with her scornful airsa little impertinent pussi wonder flora does not teach her better manners  norman meanwhile as the train sped over roofs and among chimneys was reproaching himself for running into the fascination of her presence and then recollecting that her situation as well as his destiny both guaranteed that they could meet only as friendly connections  no carriage awaited them at the station which surprised norman till he recollected that the horses had probably been out all day and it was eight oclock going to park lane in a cab the brothers were further surprised to find themselves evidently not expected the butler came to speak to them saying that mr and mrs rivers were gone out to dinner but would return probably at about eleven oclock he conducted them upstairs harry following his brother in towering vexation and disappointment trying to make him turn to hear that they would go directlyhometo etonanywherewhy would he go in at all  the door was opened mr may was announced and they were in a silklined boudoir where a little slender figure in black started up and came forward with outstretched hand  norman she cried how are you are you come on your way to oxford  has not flora had marys letter  yes she said she had one she was keeping it till she had time to read it  as she spoke meta had given her hand to harry as it was evidently expected she raised her eyes to his face and said smiling and blushing i am sure i ought to know you but i am afraid i dont  look again said norman see if you have ever seen him before  laughing glancing and casting down her eyes she raised them with a sudden start of joy but colouring more deeply said indeed i cannot remember i dare say i ought  i think you see a likeness said norman  oh yes i see she answered faltering but perceiving how bright were the looks of both no impossible yes it is  yes it is said both brothers with one voice she clasped her hands absolutely bounded with transport then grasped both harrys hands and then normans her whole countenance radiant with joy and sympathy beyond expression  dear dear dr may was her first exclamation oh how happy you must all be and margaret she looked up at norman and came nearer is not mr ernescliffe come she asked softly and trembling  no was the low answer which harry could not bear to hear and therefore walked to the window no meta but margaret is much comforted about him he died in great peacein his armsas he signed towards his brother and as harry continued to gaze out on the stars of gas on the opposite side of the park he was able to add a few of the particulars  metas eyes glistened with tears as she said perhaps it would have been too perfect if he had come but oh norman how good she is to bear it so patiently and how gloriously he behaved how can we make enough of him and flora out how sorry she will be  and she never opened marys letter said harry coming back to them  she little thought what it contained said meta marys letters are apt to bear keeping you know and she was so busy that she laid it aside for a treat after the days work but there inhospitable wretch that i am you have had no dinner  a refection of tea and cold meat was preferred and in her own pretty manner meta lavished her welcomes trying to cover any pain given by floras neglect  what makes her so busy asked harry looking round on the beautifully furnished apartment which to many eyes besides those fresh from a milanesian hut might have seemed a paradise of luxurious ease  you dont know what an important lady you have for a sister said meta merrily  but tell me what can she have to do i thought you london ladies had nothing to do but to sit with your hands before you entertaining company  meta laughed heartily shall i begin at the beginning ill describe today then and you must understand that this is what tom would call a mild specimenonly one evening engagement though perhaps i ought to start from last night at twelve oclock when she was at the austrian ambassadors ball and came home at two but she was up by eightshe always manages to get through her housekeeping matters before breakfast at nine breakfast and babyby the bye you have never inquired for our niece  i have not come to believe in her yet said harry  seeing is believing said meta but no i wont take an unfair advantage over her mamma and she will be fast asleep i never knew a child sleep as she does so to go on with our day the papers come and miss leonora is given over to me for you must know we are wonderful politicians flora studies all the debates till george finds out what he has heard in the house and baby and i profit baby goes out walking and the post comes flora always goes to the study with george and writes and does all sorts of things for him she is the most useful wife in the world at twelve we had our singing lesson  singing lesson exclaimed harry  yes you know she has a pretty voice and she is glad to cultivate it it is very useful at parties but it takes up a great deal of time and with all i can do to save her in notewriting the morning is gone directly after luncheon she had to ride with george and came back in a hurry to make some canvassing calls about the orphan asylum and miss bracys sister if we get her in at all it will be floras diplomacy and there was shopping to do and when we came in hoping for time for our letters there were the walkinghames who stayed a long time so that flora could only despatch the most important notes before george came in and wanted her she was reading something for him all the time she was dressing but as i say this is quite a quiet day  stop cried harry with a gesture of oppression it sounds harder than cleaning knives like aunt flora and what is an unquiet day like  you will see for we have a great evening party tomorrow  do you always stay at home asked harry  not always but i do not go to large parties or balls this year said meta glancing at her deep mourning i am very glad of a little time at home  so you dont like it  oh yes it is very pleasant said meta it is so entertaining when we talk it over afterwards and i like to hear how flora is admired and called the beauty of the season i tell george and we do so gloat over it together there was an old french marquis the other night a dear old man quite of the ancien regime who said she was exactly like the portraits of madame de maintenon and produced a beautiful miniature on a snuffbox positively like that very pretty form of face of hers the old man even declared that mistress rivers was worthy to be a frenchwoman  i should like to kick him amiably responded harry  i hope you wont tomorrow but dont let us waste our time over this i want so much to hear about new zealand  meta was well read in australasian literature and drew out a great deal more information from harry than norman had yet heard she made him talk about the maori pah near his uncles farm where the sunday services were conducted by an old gentleman tattooed elegantly in the face but dressed like an english clergyman and tell of his aunts troubles about the younger generation whom their elders though christians themselves could not educate and who she feared would relapse into heathenism for want of instruction though with excellent dispositions  how glad you must be that you are likely to go exclaimed meta to norman who had sat silently listening  the sound of the door bell was the first intimation that harrys histories had occupied them until long past twelve oclock  now then cried meta springing forward as if intending to meet flora with the tidings but checking herself as if she ought not to be the first there was a pause flora was hearing downstairs that mr norman may and another gentleman had arrived and while vexed at her own omission and annoyed at normans bringing friends without waiting for permission she was yet prepared to be courteous and amiable she entered in her rich black watered silk deeply trimmed with lace and with silver ornaments in her dark hair so graceful and distinguishedlooking that harry stood suspended hesitating for an instant whether he beheld his own sister especially as she made a dignified inclination towards him offering her hand to norman as she said meta has told you but there she broke off exclaiming ha is it possible no surely it cannot be  miss walkinghame said the sailor who had felt at home with her at the first word and she flew into his great rough arms  harry this is dear harry our own dear sailor come back cried she as her husband stood astonished and springing towards him she put harrys hand into his my brother harry our dear lost one  yourbrotherharry slowly pronounced george as he instinctively gave the grasp of greetingyour brother that was lost upon my word as the matter dawned fully on him and he became eager i am very glad to see you i never was more rejoiced in my life  when did you come have you been at home asked flora  i came home yesterdaymary wrote to tell you  poor dear old mary theres a lesson against taking a letter on trust i thought it would be all cocksmoor and would wait for a quiet moment how good to come to me so soon you dear old shipwrecked mariner  i was forced to come to report myself said harry or i could not have come away from my father so soon  the usual questions and their sad answers ensued and while flora talked to harry fondly holding his hand norman and meta explained the history to george who no sooner comprehended it that he opined it must have been a horrid nuisance and that harry was a gallant fellow then striking him over the shoulder welcomed him home with all his kind heart told him he was proud to receive him and falling into a state of rapturous hospitality rang the bell and wanted to order all sorts of eatables and drinkables but was sadly baffled to find him already satisfied  there was more open joy than even at home and flora was supremely happy as she sat between her brothers listening and inquiring till far past one oclock when she perceived poor george dozing off awakened every now and then by a great nod and casting a wishful glance of resigned remonstrance as if to appeal against sitting up all night  the meeting at breakfast was a renewal of pleasure flora was proud and happy in showing off her little girl a model baby as she called her a perfect doll for quietness so that she could be brought in at family prayers and said flora i am the more glad that she keeps no one away because we can only have evening prayers on sunday it is a serious thing to arrange for such a household  she is equal to anything said george  the long file of servants marched in george read sonorously and flora rose from her knees highly satisfied at the impression produced upon her brothers  i like to have the baby with us at breakfast she said it is the only time of day when we can be sure of seeing anything of her and i like her nurse to have some respite do you think her grown norman  not very much said norman who thought her more inanimate and like a pretty little waxen toy than when he had last seen her is she not rather pale  london makes children pale i shall soon take her home to acquire a little colour you must know sir henry has bitten us with his yachting tastes and as soon as we can leave london we are going to spend six weeks with the walkinghames at ryde and rival you harry i think miss leonora will be better at home so we must leave her there lodgings and irregularities dont suit people of her age  does home mean stoneborough asked norman  no old nurse has one of her deadly prejudices against preston and i would not be responsible for the consequences of shutting them up in the same nursery margaret would be distracted between them no miss you shall make her a visit every day and be fondled by your grandpapa  george began a conversation with harry on nautical matters and norman tried to discover how meta liked the yachting project and found her prepared to think it charming hopes were expressed that harry might be at portsmouth and a quantity of gay scheming ensued with reiterations of the name of walkinghame while norman had a sense of being wrapped in some gray mist excluding him from participation in their enjoyments and condemned his own temper as frivolous for being thus excited to discontent  presently he heard george insisting that he and harry should return in time for the evening party and on beginning to refuse was amazed to find harrys only objection was on the score of lack of uniform  i dont want you in one sir said flora  i have only one coat in the world besides this continued harry and that is all over tar  george will see to that said flora dont you think you would be welcome in matting with an orange cowry round your neck  norman however took a private opportunity of asking harry if he was aware of what he was undertaking and what kind of people they should meet  all english people behave much the same in a room said harry as if all society provided it was not cannibal were alike to him  i should have thought you would prefer finding out forder in his chambers or going to one of the theatres  as you please said harry but flora seems to want us and i should rather like to see what sort of company she keeps  since harry was impervious to shyness norman submitted and george took them to a wonderworker in cloth who undertook that full equipments should await the young gentleman harry next despatched his business at the admiralty and was made very happy by tidings of his friend owens safe arrival in america  thence the brothers went to eton where home letters had been more regarded and dr may having written to secure a holiday for the objects of their visit they were met at the station by the two boys hectors red face and prominent light eyebrows were instantly recognised but as to tom harry could hardly believe that the little dusty roundbacked grub be had left had been transformed into the wellmade gentlemanlike lad before him peculiarly trim and accurate in dress even to the extent of as much foppery as eton taste permitted  ten minutes had not passed before tom taking a survey of the newcomer began to exclaim at norman for letting him go about such a figure and before they knew what was doing they had all been conducted into the shop of the only living man who knew how to cut hair laughing and goodnatured harry believed his hair was rather long allowed himself to be seated and to be divested of a huge superfluous mass of sundried curls which tom particularly resenting that rather long kept on taking up and unrolling from their tight rings to measure the number of inches  that is better said he as they issued from the shop but as to that coat of yours the rogue who made it should never make another where could you have picked it up  at a shop at auckland said harry much amused  kept by a savage said tom to whom it was no laughing matter see that seam  have done may exclaimed hector he will think you a tailors apprentice  or worse said norman riverss tailor kept all strictures to himself  tom muttered that he only wanted harry to be fit to be seen by the fellows  the fellows are not such asses as you cried hector you dont deserve that he should come to see you if my  there poor hector broke off if his own only brother had been walking beside him how would he not have felt they had reached their tutors house and opening his own door he made an imploring sign to harry to enter with him on the table lay a letter from margaret and another which harry had written to him from auckland  oh harry you were with him he said tell me all about him  and he established himself with his face hidden on the table uttering nothing except go on whenever harrys voice failed in the narration when something was said of all for the best he burst out he might say so i suppose one ought to think so but is not it hard when i had nobody but him and there was maplewood and i might have been so happy there with him and margaret  they say nothing could have made margaret well said harry  i dont care he would have married her all the same and we should have made her so happy at maplewood i hate the place i wish it were at jericho  you are captain of the ship now said harry and you must make the best of it  i cant it will never be home home is with margaret and the rest of them  so alan said he hoped you would make it and you are just like one of us you know  whats the use of that when captain gordon will not let me go near you taking me to that abominable maplewood last easter with half the house shut up and all horrid and he is as dry as a stick  the captain cried harry angrily theres not a better captain to sail with in the whole navy and your brother would be the first to tell you so im not discharged yet hectoryou had better look out what you say  maybe he is the best to sail with but that is not being the best to live with said the heir of maplewood disconsolately alan himself always said he never knew what home was till he got to your father and margaret  so will you said harry why my father is your master or whatever you may call it  no captain gordon is my guardian  eh whats become of the will then  what will cried hector did alan make one after all  ay at valparaiso he had a touch of fever i went ashore to nurse him to a merchants who took us in for love of our scottish blood mr ernescliffe made a will there and left it in his charge  do you think he made dr may my guardian  he asked me whether i thought he would dislike it and i told him no  thats right cried hector thats like dear old alan i shall get back to the doctor and margaret after all mind you write to the captain harry  hector was quite inspirited and ready to return to the others but harry paused to express a hope that he did not let tom make such a fool of himself as he had done today  not he said hector he is liked as much as any one in the househe has been five times sent up for good see there in the eton list he is a real clever fellow  ay but whats the good of all that if you let him be a puppy  oh hell be cured a fellow that has been a sloven always is a puppy for a bit said hector philosophically  norman was meantime taking tom to task for these same airs and hearing it was from the desire to see his brother respectablestoneborough men never cared for what they looked like and he must have harry do himself credit  you need not fear said norman he did not require eton to make him a gentleman how now why tom old man you are not taking that to heart thats all over long ago  for that black spot in his life had never passed out of the lads memory and it might be from the lurking want of selfrespect that there was about him so much of selfassertion in attention to trifles he was very reserved and no one except norman had ever found the way to anything like confidence and norman had vexed him by the proposal he had made in the holidays  he made no answer but stood looking at norman with an odd undecided gaze  well what now old fellow said norman half fearing that might not be absolutely over one would think you were not glad to see harry  i suppose he has made you all the more set upon that mad notion of yours said tom  so far as making me feel that that part of the world has a strong claim on us replied norman  im sure you dont look as if you found your pleasure in it cried tom  pleasure is not what i seek said norman  what is the matter with you said tom you said i did not seem rejoicedyou look worse i am sure tom put his arm on normans shoulder and looked solicitously at himdemonstrations of affection very rare with him  i wonder which would really make you happiest to have your own way and go to these black villains  remember that but for others who have done so harry  pshaw said tom rubbing some invisible dust from his coat sleeve if it would keep you at home i would say i never would hear of doctoring  i thought you had said so  whats the use of my coming here if im to be a country doctor  i have told you i do not mean to victimise you if you have a distaste to it theres an end of iti am quite ready  tom gave a great sigh no he said if i must i must i dont mind the part of it that you do i only hate the name of it and the being tied down to a country place like that while you go out thousands of miles off to these savages but if it is the only thing to content you i wont stand in your way i cant bear your looking disconsolate  dont think yourself bound if you really dislike the profession  i dont said tom it is my free choice if it were not for horrid sick people i should like it  promising it must be confessed  perhaps tom had expected norman to brighten at once but it was a fallacious hope the gaining his point involved no pleasant prospect and his young brothers moody devotion to him suggested scruples whether he ought to exact the sacrifice though in his own mind convinced that it was toms vocation and knowing that would give him many of the advantages of an eldest son  eton fully justified hectors declaration that it would not regard the cut of harrys coat the hero of a lost ship and savage isle was the object of universal admiration and curiosity and inestimable were the favours conferred by hector and tom in giving introductions to him till he had shaken hands with half the school and departed amid deafening cheers  in spite of harry the day had been long and heavy to norman and though he chid himself for his depression he shrank from the sight of meta and sir henry walkinghame together and was ready to plead an aching head as an excuse for not appearing at the evening party but besides that this might attract notice he thought himself bound to take care of harry in so new a world where the boy must be at a great loss  i say old june cried a voice at his door are you ready  i have not begun dressing yet will you wait  not i the fun is beginning  norman heard the light foot scampering downstairs and prepared to follow to assume the protection of him  music sounded as norman left his room and he turned aside to avoid the stream of company flowing up the flowerdecked stairs and made his way into the rooms through floras boudoir he was almost dazzled by the bright lights and the gay murmurs of the brilliant throng young ladies with flowers and velvet streamers down their backs old ladies portly and bejewelled gentlemen looking civil abounded wherever he turned his eyes he could see floras graceful head bending as she received guest after guest and the smile with which she answered congratulations on her brothers return but harry he did not so quickly perceive and he was trying to discover in what corner he might have hidden himself when meta stood beside him asking whether their eton journey had prospered and how poor hector was feeling at harrys return  where is harry asked norman is he not rather out of his element  no indeed said meta smiling why he is the lion of the night  poor fellow how he must hate it  come this way into the front room there look at himis it not nice to see him so perfectly simple and at his ease neither shy nor elated and what a finelooking fellow he is  meta might well say so the trim wellknit broadchested form the rosy embrowned honest face the shining lightbrown curly locks the dancing wellopened blue eyes and merry hearty smile showed to the best advantage in array that even tom would not have spurned put on with naval neatness and his attitude and manner were so full of manly ease that it was no wonder that every eye rested on him with pleasure norman smiled at his own mistake and asked who were the lady and gentleman conversing with him meta mentioned one of the most distinguished of english names and shared his amusement in seeing harry talking to them with the same frank unembarrassed ease as when he had that morning shaken hands with their son in the capacity of hector ernescliffes fag no one present inspired him with a tithe of the awe he felt for a postcaptainit was simply a pleasant assembly of goodnatured folks glad to welcome home a battered sailor and of pretty girls for whom he had a sailors admiration but without forwardness or presumptionall in happy grateful simplicity  i suppose you cannot dance said flora to him  i was harrys interjection and while she was looking round for a partner to whom to present him he had turned to the young daughter of his new acquaintance and had her on his arm unconscious that george had been making his way to her  flora was somewhat uneasy but the mother was looking on smiling and expressed her delight in the young midshipman and mrs rivers while listening gladly to his praises watched heedfully and was reassured to see that dancing was as natural to him as everything else his steps were light as a feather his movement all freedom and joy without being boisterous and his boyish chivalry as pretty a sight as any one could wish to see  if the rest of the world enjoyed their dances a quarter as much as did mr may they were enviable people and he contributed not a little to their pleasure if merely by the sight of his blithe freshness and spirited simplicity as well as the general sympathy with his sisters joy and the interest in his adventures he would have been a general favourite if he had been far less personally engaging as it was every young lady was in raptures at dancing with him and he did his best to dance with them all and to try to stir up norman who after meta had been obliged to leave him and go to act her share of the part of hostess had disposed of himself against a wall where he might live out the night  ha june what makes you stand sentry there come and dance and have some of the fun some of these girls are the nicest partners in the world theres that lady alice something with the dangling things in her hair sitting down nowfamous at a polka come along ill introduce you it will do you good  i know nothing of dancing said norman beginning to apprehend that he might be dragged off as often he had been to cricket or football and by much the same means  comes by nature when you hear the music ha what a delicious polka come along or i must be off she will be waiting for me and she is the second prettiest girl here come  i have been trying to make something of him harry said the ubiquitous flora but i dont know whether it is mauvaise honte or headache  i see poor old june cried harry ill get you an ice at once old fellow nothing like one for setting a man going  before norman could protest harry had flown off  flora asked norman isare the walkinghames here  yes dont you see sir henry that finelooking man with the black moustache i want you to know him he is a great admirer of your prize poem and of dr spencer  harry returning administered his ice and then darted off to excuse himself to his partner by explanations about his brother whom everybody must have heard of as he was the cleverest fellow living and had written the best prize poem ever heard at oxford he firmly believed norman a much greater lion than himself  norman was forced to leave his friendly corner to dispose of the glass of his ice and thus encountered miss rivers of whom sir henry was asking questions about a beautiful collection of cameos which flora had laid out as a company trap  here is norman may said meta he knows them better than i do do you remember which of these is the head of diana norman  having set the two gentlemen to discuss them she glided away on fresh hospitable duties while norman repeated the comments that he had so enjoyed hearing from poor mr rivers hoping he was at least sparing meta some pain and wondering that flora should have risked hurting her feelings by exposing these treasures to the general gaze  if norman were wearied by sir henry it was his own fault for the baronet was a very agreeable person who thought a firstclass man worth cultivation so that the last halfhour might have compensated for all the rest if conversation were always the test  why meta cried harry coming up to her you have not once danced we are a sort of brother and sister to be sure but that is no hindrance is it  no said meta smiling thank you harry but you must find some one more worthy i do not dance this season at least not in public when we get home who knows what we may do  you dont dance poor little meta and you dont go out what a pity  i had rather not work quite so hard said meta think what good fortune i had by staying at home last night  i declare exclaimed harry bewitched by the beaming congratulation of her look i cant imagine why norman had said you had turned into a fine lady i cant see a bit of it  norman said i had turned into a fine lady repeated meta why  never mind i dont think so you are just like papas hummingbird as you always were not a bit more of a fine lady than any girl here and i am sure papa would say so only old june had got a bad headache and is in one of his old dumps such as i hoped he had left off but he cant help it poor fellow and he will come out of it by and byso never mind hallo why people are going away already theres that girl without any one to hand her downstairs  away ran harry and presently the brothers and sisters gathered round the firegeorge declaring that he was glad that nuisance was so well over and harry exclaiming well done flora it was capital fun i never saw a lot of prettier or more goodnatured people in my life if i am at home for the stoneborough ball i wonder whether my father will let me go to it  this result of harrys successful debut in high life struck his sister and norman as so absurd that both laughed  whats the matter now asked harry  your comparing floras party to a stoneborough ball said norman  it is all the same isnt it said harry im sure you are equally disgusted at both  much you know about it said flora patting him gaily im not going to put conceit in that lion head of yours but you were as good as an indian prince to my party do you know to whom you have been talking so coolly  of course you see norman it is just as i told you all civilised people are just alike when they get into a drawingroom  harry takes large views of the genus homo norman exerted himself to say being used to the black and brown species he takes little heed of the lesser varieties  it is enough for him that he does not furnish the entertainment in another way said flora but goodnight meta you look tired     chapter xix        let none henceforward shrink from daring dreams     for earnest hearts shall find their dreams fulfilledfouque   i have it began harry as he came down to breakfast i dont know how i came to forget it the will was to be sent home to mr mackintoshs english partner ill go and overhaul him this very morning they wont mind my coming by a later train when there is such a reason  what is his name where shall you find him asked flora  i cant be sure but youve a navy list of that sort of cattle have not you flora ill hunt him up  flora supposed he meant a directory and all possible south american merchants having been overlooked and the mackintoshes selected he next required a chart of london and wanted to attempt selfnavigation but was forced to accept of georges brougham and escort flora would not trust him otherwise and norman was obliged to go to oxford at once hurrying off to his train before breakfast was over  flora might have trusted harry alone george contributed no more than the dignity of his presence and indeed would have resigned the pursuit at the first blunder about the firm and still more when the right one had been found but the partner proved crusty and would not believe that any such document was in his hands george was consenting to let it rest till mr mackintosh could be written to but harry outrunning his management and regardless of rebuffs fairly teased the old gentleman into a search as the only means of getting rid of the troublesome sailor  in the midst of georges civil regrets at the fruitless trouble they were causing forth came a bundle of papers and forth from the bundle fell a packet on which harry pounced as he read will of alan halliday ernescliffe esquire of maplewood yorkshire lieutenant in h m s alcestis and in the corner the executors names captain john gordon of h m s alcestis and richard may esquire m d market stoneborough  as if in revenge the prudent merchant would not be induced to entrust him with the document saying he could not give it up till he had heard from the executors and had been certified of the death of the testator he withstood both the angry gentlemen who finally departed in a state of great resentmentharry declaring that the old landlubber would not believe that he was his own fathers son and mr rivers no less incensed that the house of commons had been insulted in his person because he did not carry all before him  flora laughed at their story and told them that she suspected that the old gentleman was in the right and she laid plans for having harry to teach them yachting at ryde while harry declared he would have nothing to do with such trumpery  harry found his home in a sort of agony of expectation for his nonarrival at the time expected had made his first appearance seem like an unsubstantial illusion though dr may or mary and aubrey had been at the station at the coming in of each train margaret had recovered the effects of the first shock and the welcome was far more joyous than the first had been with the mixed sensations that were now composed and showed little outwardly but gladness  dr may took floras view of the case and declared that if harry had brought home the will he should not have opened it without his coexecutor so he wrote to the captain while harry made the most of his time in learning his sisters over again he spent a short time alone with margaret every morning patiently and gently allowing himself to be recalled to the sad recollections that were all the world to her he kept ethel and mary merry with his droll desultory comments he made blanche keep up her dancing and taught gertrude to be a thorough little romp as to dr may his patients never were so well or so cheerful till dr spencer and ethel suspected that the very sight of his looks brightened themhow could they help it dr spencer was as happy as a king in seeing his friend freed from the heavy weight on his spirits and truly it was goodly to watch his perfect look of content as he leaned on his lionfaced boys arm and walked down to the minster whither it seemed to have become possible to go on most evenings good dr may was no musician but mr wilmot could not regret certain tones that now and then burst out in the chanting from the very bottom of a heart that assuredly sang with the full melody of thankfulness whatever the voice might do  captain gordon not only wrote but came to stoneborough whence harry was to go with him to the courtmartial at portsmouth  the girls wondered that after writing with so much warmth and affection both of and to harry he met him without any demonstration of feeling and his short peremptory manner removed all surprise that poor hector had been so forlorn with him at maplewood and turned with all his heart to dr may they were especially impressed at the immediate subsidence of all harrys noise and nonsense as if the drawingroom had been the quarterdeck of the alcestis  and yet said margaret harry will not hear a single word in dispraise of him i do believe he loves him with all his heart  i think said ethel that in a strong character there is an exulting fear in looking up to a superior in whose justice there is perfect reliance it is a germ of the higher feeling  i believe you are right said margaret but it is a serious thing for a man to have so little sympathy with those below him you see how hector feels it and i now understand how it told upon alan and how papas warmth was like a surprise to him  because captain gordon had to be a father to them and that is more than a captain i should not wonder if there were more similarity and fellowfeeling between him and harry than there could be with either of them harry though he has all papas tenderness is of a rougher sort that likes to feel itself mastered poor hector i wonder if he is to be given back to us  do you knowwhenwhether they will find out this morning said margaret catching her dress nervously as she was moving away  yes i believe so i was not to have told you but  there is no reason that it should do me any harm said margaret almost smiling and looking as if she was putting a restraint on something she wished to say go down dear ethelaubrey will be waiting for you  ethel went down to the difficult task of hearing aubreys lessons while harry was pretending to write to mrs arnott but in reality teaching gertrude the parts of a ship occasionally acting mast for her to climb  by and by dr may came in margaret not downstairs yet he said  she is dressed but will not come down till the evening said ethel  ill go to her she will be pleased come up presently ethel or wheres richard  gone out said harry what is it anything left to her  the best the best said dr may ethel listentwenty thousand to build and endow a church for cocksmoor  no need to bid ethel listen she gave a sort of leap in her chair then looked almost ready to faint  my dear child said her father this is your wish i give you joy indeed i do  ethel drew his arm round her and leaned against him my wish my wish she repeated as if questioning the drift of the words  im glad it is found cried harry now i know why he talked of cocksmoor and seemed to rest in planning for it you will mind the roof is as he said  you must talk to dr spencer about that said dr may the captain means to leave it entirely in our hands  dear alan exclaimed ethel my wish oh yes but how gained yet cocksmoor with a church i dont know how to be glad enough and yet  you shall read the sentence said dr may in testimony of thankfulness for mercy vouchsafed to him here poor dear boy  what does the captain say asked harry  he is rather astounded but he owns that the estate can bear it for old halliday had saved a great deal and there will be more before hector comes of age  and hector  yes we get him back i am fellowtrustee with captain gordon and as to personal guardianship i fancy the captain found he could not make the boy happy and thinks you no bad specimen of our training  famous cried harry hector will hurrah now is that all  except legacies to captain gordon and some scottish relations but poor margaret ought to hear it ethel dont be long in coming  with all ethels reputation for bluntness it was remarkable how her force of character made her always called for whenever there was the least dread of a scene  she turned abruptly from harry and going outside the window tried to realise and comprehend the tidings but all she could have time to discover was that alans memory was dearer to her than ever and she was obliged to hasten upstairs  her father quitted the room by one door as she entered by the other she believed that it was to hide his emotion but margarets fair wan face was beaming with the sweetest of congratulating smiles  i thought so she said as ethel came in dear ethel are you not glad  i think i am said ethel putting her hands to her brow  you think exclaimed margaret as if disappointed  i beg your pardon said ethel with quivering lip dear margaret i am gladdont you believe i am but somehow it is harder to deal with joy than grief it confuses one dear alanand then to have been set on it so longto have prayed so for it and to have it come in this wayby your  nay ethel had he come home it was his great wish to have done it he used to make projects when he was here but he would not let me tell you lest he should find duties at maplewoodwhereas this would have been his pleasure  dear alan repeated ethel if you are so kind so dear as to be glad margaret i think i shall be so presently  margaret almost grudged the lack of the girlish outbreak of rejoicing which would once have forgotten everything in the ecstasy of the fulfilled vision it did not seem to be what alan had intended he had figured to himself unmixed joy and she wanted to see it and something of the wayward impatience of weakness throbbed at her heart as ethel paced the room and disappeared in her own curtained recess  presently she came back saying you are sure you are glad  it would be strange if i were not said margaret see ethel here are blessings springing up from what i used to think had served for nothing but to bring him pain and grief i am so thankful that he could express his desire and so grateful to dear harry for bringing it to light how much better it is than i ever thought it could be he has been spared disappointment and surely the good that he will have done will follow him  and you said ethel sadly  i shall lie here and wait said margaret i shall see the plans and hear all about it and ohher eyes lighted upperhaps some day i may hear the bell  richards tap interrupted them had he heard  i have the deepened colour in his cheek betrayed how much he felt as he cast an anxious glance towards margaretan inquiring one on ethel  she is so pleased was all ethel could say  i thought she would be said richard approaching captain gordon seemed quite vexed that no special token of remembrance was left to her  margaret smiled in a peculiar way if he only knew how glad i am there was not and ethel knew that the church was his token to margaret and that any fading frail memorial would have lessened the force of the signification  ethel could speak better to her brother than to her sister oh richard richard richard she cried and a most unusual thing with both she flung her arms round his neck it is come at last if it had not been for you this would never have been how little likely it seemed that dirty day when i talked wildly and you checked me  you had faith and perseverance said richard or  you are right said margaret as ethel was about to disclaim it was ethels steadiness that brought it before alans mind if she had yielded when we almost wished it in the time of the distress about mrs green i do believe that all would have died away  i didnt keep steadyi was only crazy you and ritchie and mr wilmot said ethel half crying then as if unable to stay she exclaimed with a sort of petulance and theres harry playing all sorts of rigs with aubrey i shant get any more sense out of him today  and away she rushed to the wayfaring dust of her life of labour to find aubrey and daisy halfway up the tulip tree and harry mischievously unwilling to help them down again assuring her that such news deserved a holiday and that she was growing a worse tartar than miss winter she had better let the poor children alone put on her bonnet and come with him to tell mr wilmot  whereat ethel was demurring when dr may came forth and declared he should take her himself  poor mr wilmot laboured under a great burden of gratitude which no one would receive from him dr may and ethel repudiated thanks almost with terror and when he tried them with the captain he found very doubtful approval of the whole measure so that harry alone was a ready acceptant of a full meed of acknowledgments for his gallant extraction of the will  no one was more obliged to him than hector ernescliffe who wrote to margaret that it would be very jolly to come home again and that he was delighted that the captain could not hinder either that or cocksmoor church and as to maplewood i shall not hate it so much if that happens which i hope will happen of which oracular sentence margaret could make nothing  the house of may felt more at their ease when the uncongenial captain had departed although he carried off harry with him there was the better opportunity for a teadrinking consultation with dr spencer and mr wilmot when margaret lay on her sofa looking better than for months past and taking the keenest interest in every arrangement  dr spencer whose bright eyes glittered at every mention of the subject assumed that he was to be the architect while dr may was assuring him that it was a maxim that no one unpaid could be trusted and when he talked of beautiful german churches with pierced spires declared that the building must not make too large a hole in the twenty thousand at the expense of future curates because richard was the first  ill be prudent dick said dr spencer trust me not to rival the minster  we shall find work next for you there said mr wilmot  ay we shall have may out of his family packingbox before many years are over his head  dont mention it said dr may i know what i exposed myself to in bringing wilmot here  yes said dr spencer we shall put you in the van when we attack the corporation pen  i shall hold by the good old cause as if the galleries had not been there before you were born  as if poor people had a right to sit in their own church said ethel  sit you may well say said mr wilmot as if any one could do otherwise with those ingenious traps for hindering kneeling  well well i know the people must have room said dr may cutting short several further attacks which he saw impending  yes you would like to build another blue gallery blocking up another window and with richard may and christopher tomkins churchwardens on it in orangecoloured lettersthe rivers colours no disrespect to your father miss may but as a general observation it is a property of town councillors to be conservative only where they ought not  i brought you here to talk of building a church not of pulling one to pieces  poor dr may he knew it was inevitable and quite right but his affectionate heart and spirit of perpetuity which had an association connected with every marble cloud green baize pew and squareheaded panel anticipated tortures in the general sweep for which his ecclesiastical taste and sense of propriety would not soon compensate  margaret spared his feelings by bringing the cocksmoor subject back again dr spencer seemed to comprehend the ardour with which she pressed it on as if it were very near her heart that there should be no delay he said he could almost promise her that the first stone should be laid before the end of the summer and she thanked him in her own warm sweet way hoping that it would be while hector and harry were at home  harry soon returned having gone through the courtmartial with the utmost credit been patronised by captain gordon in an unheardof manner asked to dine with the admiral and promised to be quickly afloat again ere many days had passed he was appointed to one of the finest vessels in the fleet commanded by a captain to whom captain gordon had introduced him and who seemed to have taken a fancy to him as he said the bucephalus now the object of his pride was refitting and his sisters hoped to see a good deal of him before he should again sail besides flora would be at ryde before the end of july  it was singular that ethels vision should have been fulfilled simultaneously with floras having obtained a position so far beyond what could have been anticipated  she was evidently extremely happy and valuable much admired and respected and with full exercise for the energy and cleverness which were never more gratified than by finding scope for action her husband was devotedly attached to her and was entirely managed by her and though her good judgment kept her from appearing visibly in matters not pertaining to her own sphere she was in fact his understanding she read listened and thought for him imbued him with her own views and composed his letters for him ruling his affairs both political and private and undeniably making him fill a position which without her he would have left vacant nor was there any doubt that he was far happier for finding himself of consequence and being no longer left a charge upon his own hands he seemed fully to suffice to her as a companion although she was so far superior in power for it was perhaps her nature to love best that which depended upon her and gave her a sense of exercising protection as she had always loved margaret better than ethel  mrs rivers was an admirable woman so every one felt and her youthful beauty and success in the fashionable world made her qualities as a wife and mistress of a household the more appreciated she never set aside her religious habits or principles was an active member of various charitable associations and found her experience of the stoneborough ladies committee applicable among far greater names indeed lady leonora thought dear flora riverss only fault her overstrictness which encouraged meta in the same but there were points that flora could not have yielded on any account without failing in her own eyes  she made time for everything and though between business and fashion she seemed to undertake more than mortal could accomplish it was all effected and excellently she did indeed sigh over the briefness of the time that she could bestow on her child or on home correspondence and declared that she should rejoice in rest but at the same time her achievements were a positive pleasure to her  meta in the meantime had been living passively on the most affectionate terms with her brother and sister and though often secretly yearning after the dear old father whose darling she had been and longing for power of usefulness she took it on trust that her present lot had been ordered for her and was thankful like the bird of dr mays fable for the pleasures in her pathculling sweet morals and precious thoughts out of book painting or concert occasions for christian charities in each courtesy of society and opportunities for cheerful selfdenial and submission whenever any little wish was thwarted  so norman said she had turned into a fine lady it was a sudden and surprising intimation and made a change in the usually bright and calm current of her thoughts she was not aware that there had been any alteration in herself and it was a revelation that set her to examine where she had changedpoor little thing she was not angry she did not resent the charge she took it for granted that coming from such a source it must be true and reasonableand what did it mean did they think her too gay or neglectful of old friends what had they been saying to harry about her  ah thought meta i understand it i am living a life of ease and uselessness and with his higher aims and nobler purposes he shrinks from the frivolities among which i am cast i saw his saddened countenance among our gaieties and i know that to deep minds there is heaviness in the midst of display he withdraws from the follies that have no charms for him and iought i to be able to help being amused i dont seek these things but perhaps i ought to avoid them more than i do if i could be quite clear what is right i should not care what effort i made but i was born to be one of those who have trial of riches and such blessed tasks are not my portion but if he sees the vanities creeping into my heart i should be grateful for that warning  so meditated meta as she copied one of her own drawings of the grange for her dear old governess mrs larpent while each line and tint recalled the comments of her fond amateur father and the scenery carried her home in spite of the street sounds and the scratching of floras pen coursing over notepaper presently sir henry walkinghame called bringing a beautiful bouquet  delicious cried meta see flora it is in good time for those vases were sadly shabby  she began at once to arrange the flowers a task that seemed what she was born for and the choice roses and geraniums acquired fresh grace as she placed them in the slender glasses and classic vases but floras discerning eyes perceived some mortification on the part of the gentleman and on his departure playfully reproached meta for ingratitude  did we not thank him i thought i did them all due honour actually using the dresden bowl  you little wretch quite insensible to the sentiment of the thing  sentiment one would think you had been reading about the language of flowers  whatever there was poor sir henry did not mean it for the dresden bowl or bohemian glass  flora do pray tell me whether you are in fun  you ridiculous child said flora kissing her earnest forehead ringing the bell and gathering up her papers as she walked out of the room and gave her notes to the servant  what does she mean is it play oh no a hint would be far more like her but i hope it is nonsense he is very kind and pleasant and i should not know what to do  instances of his complaisance towards herself rose before her so as to excite some warmth and gratitude her lonely heart thrilled at the idea of being again the best beloved and her energetic spirit bounded at the thought of being no longer condemned to a life of idle ease still it was too new a light to her to be readily accepted after she had looked on him so long merely as a familiar of the house attentive to her because she fell to his share when flora was occupied she liked him decidedly she could possibly do more but she was far more inclined to dread than to desire any disturbance of their present terms of intercourse  however thought she i must see my way if he should have any such thing in his head to go on as we do now would be committing myself and i will not do that unless i am sure it is right oh papa you would settle it for me but i will have it out with flora she will find out what i cannothow far he is a man for whom one ought to care i do not think norman liked him but then norman has so keen a sense of the worldtouched i suppose i am that if any other life did but seem appointed for me but one cannot tell what is thwarting providential leading and if this be as good a man aswhat would ethel say if i could but talk to dr may but flora i will catch before i see him again that i may know how to behave  catching flora was not the easiest thing in the world among her multifarious occupations but meta was not the damsel to lose an opportunity for want of decision  flora saw what was coming and was annoyed with herself for having given the alarm but after all it must have come some time or other though she had rather that meta had been more involved first  it should be premised that mrs rivers had no notion of the degree of attachment felt by her brother for meta she only knew that lady leonora had a general distrust of her family and she felt it a point of honour to promote no dangerous meetings and to encourage sir henrya connection who would be most valuable both as conferring importance upon george in the county and as being himself related to persons of high influence whose interest might push on her brothers preferment for richard promotion for harry nay diplomatic appointments for tom came floating before her imagination even while she smiled at her alnaschar visions  but the tone of meta as she drew her almost forcibly into her room showed her that she had given a great shock to her basket  flora if you would only give me a minute and would tell me  what asked flora not inclined to spare her blushes  whether whether you meant anything in earnest  my dear little goose did no one ever make an innocent joke in their lives before  it was very silly of me said meta but you gave me a terrible fright  was it so very terrible poor little bird said flora in commiseration well then you may safely think of him as a man tame about the house it was much prettier of you not to appropriate the flowers as any other damsel would have done  do you really and truly think began meta but from the colour of her cheek and the timid resolution of her tone flora thought it safest not to hear the interrogation and answered i know what he comes here forit is only as a refuge from his mothers friend old lady drummond who would give the world to catch him for her daughtersthats all put my nonsense out of your head and be yourself my sweet one  flora had never gone so near an untruth as when she led meta to believe this was the sole reason but after all what did flora herself know to the contrary  meta recovered her ease and flora marked as weeks passed on that she grew more accustomed to sir henrys attentions a little while and she would find herself so far bound by the encouragement she had given that she could not reject him  my dear said george when do you think of going down to take the baby to the grange she looks dull i think  really i think it is hardly worth while to go down en masse said flora these last debates may be important and it is a bad time to quit ones post dont you think so  as you pleasethe train is a great bore  and we will send the baby down the last day before we go to ryde with preston and butts to take care of her we cant spare him to take them down till we shut up the house it is so much easier for us to go to portsmouth from hence  the lurking conviction was that one confidential talk with ethel would cause the hummingbird to break the toils that were being wound invisibly round her ethel and her father knew nothing of the world and were so unreasonable in their requirements meta would consult them all and all her scruples would awaken and perhaps dr spencer might be interrogated on sir henrys life abroad where flora had a suspicion that gossip had best not be raked up  not that she concealed anything positively known to her or that she was not acting just as she would have done by her own child she found herself happily married to one whom home notions would have rejected and she believed meta would be perfectly happy with a man of decided talent honour and unstained character even though he should not come up to her fathers or ethels standard  if meta were to marry as they would approve she would have far to seek among desirable connections meantime was not flora acting with exemplary judgment and selfdenial  so she wrote that she could not come home margaret was much disappointed and so was meta who had looked to ethel to unravel the tangles of her life  no no little miss said flora to herself you dont talk to ethel till your fate is irrevocable why if i had listened to her i should be thankful to be singing at mrs hoxtons parties at this minute and as for herself look at norman ogilvie no no after six weeks yachtingmoonlight sea and sympathyi defy her to rob sir henry of his prize and with meta lady of cocksmoor even ethel herself must be charmed     chapter xx         we barter life for pottage sell true bliss      for wealth or power for pleasure or renown      thus esaulike our fathers blessing miss      then wash with fruitless tears our faded crown                                           christian year   papa here is a message from flora for you said margaret holding up a letter she wants to know whom to consult about the baby  ha whats the matter  margaret readwill you ask papa whom i had better call in to see the baby there does not seem to be anything positively amiss but i am not happy about her there is a sleepiness about her which i do not understand and when roused she is fretful and will not be amused there is a look in her eyes which i do not like and i should wish to have some advice for her lady leonora recommends mr but i always distrust people who are very much the rage and i shall send for no one without papas advice  let me see said dr may startled and holding out his hand for the letter a look about the eyes i shall go up and see her myself why has not she brought her home  it would have been far better said margaret  sleepy and dull she was as lively a child when they took her away as i ever saw what is there no more about her the letter is crammed with somebodys fetevote of want of confidencedebate last night what is she about she fancies she knows everything and the fact is she knows no more about infantsi could see that when the poor little thing was a day old  do you think there is cause for fear said margaret anxiously  i cant tell with a first child one cant guess what may be mammas fancy or what may be serious but flora is not too fanciful and i must see her for my own satisfaction let some one write and say i will come up tomorrow by the twelve oclock trainand mind she opens the letter  dr may kept his word and the letter had evidently not been neglected for george was watching for him at the station and thanked him so eagerly for coming that dr may feared that he was indeed needed and inquired anxiously  flora is uneasy about hershe seems heavy and cries when she is disturbed replied george flora has not left her today and hardly yesterday  have you had no advice for her  flora preferred waiting till you should come  dr may made an impatient movement and thought the way long till they were set down in park lane meta came to meet them on the stairs and said that the baby was just the same and flora was in the nursery and thither they hastily ascended  oh papa i am so glad you are come said flora starting up from her low seat beside the cradle  dr may hardly paused to embrace his daughter and she anxiously led him to the cradle and tried to read his expression as his eyes fell on the little face somewhat puffed but of a waxy whiteness and the breathing seeming to come from the lips  how long has she been so he asked in a rapid professional manner  for about two or three hours she was very fretful before but i did not like to call in any one as you were coming is it from her teeth said flora more and more alarmed by his manner her complexion is always like thatshe cannot bear to be disturbed added she as the child feebly moaned on dr may beginning to take her from her cradle but without attending to the objection he lifted her up so that she lay as quietly as before on his arm flora had trusted that hope and confidence would come with him but on the contrary every lurking misgiving began to rush wildly over her as she watched his countenance while he carried his little granddaughter towards the light studied her intently raised her drooping eyelids and looked into her eyes scarcely eliciting another moan flora dared not ask a question but looked on with eyes open as it were stiffened  this is the effect of opium were dr mays first words breaking on all with startling suddenness but before any one could speak he added we must try some stimulant directly then looking round the room what have you nearest  godfreys cordial sir quickly suggested the nurse  ayanything to save timeshe is sinking for want of the drug that has he broke off to apportion the dose and to hold the child in a position to administer itflora tried to give itthe nurse triedin vain  do not torment her further said the doctor as flora would have renewed the trialit cannot be done what have you all been doing cried he as looking up his face changed from the tender compassion with which he had been regarding his little patient into a look of strong indignation and one of his sentences of hasty condemnation broke from him as it would not have done had flora been less externally calm i tell you this child has been destroyed with opium  they all recoiled the father turned fiercely round on the nurse with a violent exclamation but dr may checked him hush this is no presence for the wrath of man the solemn tone seemed to make george shrink into an awestruck quiescence he stood motionless and transfixed as if indeed conscious of some overwhelming presence  flora had come near with an imploring gesture to take the child in her own arms but dr may by a look of authority prevented it for indeed it would have been harassing and distressing the poor little sufferer again to move her as she lay with feeble gasps on his arm  so they remained for what space no one knewnot one word was uttered not a limb moved and the street noises sounded far off  dr may stooped his head closer to the babes face and seemed listening for a breath as he once more touched the little wrist he took away his finger he ceased to listen he looked up  flora gave one crynot loud not sharp but an exceeding bitter cryshe would have moved forward but reeled and her husbands arms supported her as she sank into a swoon  carry her to her room said dr may i will come and when george had borne her away he kissed the lifeless cheek and reverently placed the little corpse in the cradle but as he rose from doing so the sobbing nurse exclaimed oh sir oh sir indeed i never did  never did what said dr may sternly  i never gave the dear baby anything to do her harm cried preston vehemently  you gave her this said dr may pointing to the bottle of godfreys cordial  he could say no more for her master was hurrying back into the room anger was the first emotion that possessed him and he hardly gave an answer to dr mays question about flora meta is with her where is that woman have you given her up to the police  preston shrieked and sobbed made incoherent exclamations and was much disposed to cling to the doctor  silence said dr may lifting his hand and assuming a tone and manner that awed them both by reminding them that death was present in the chamber and taking his soninlaw out and shutting the door he said in a low voice  i believe this is no case for the policehave mercy on the poor woman  mercyill have no mercy on my childs murderer you said she had destroyed my child  ignorantly  i dont care for ignorance she destroyed herill have justice said george doggedly  you shall said dr may laying his hand on his arm but it must be investigated and you are in no state to investigate go downstairsdo not do anything till i come to you  his peremptory manner imposed on george who nevertheless turned round as he went saying with a fierce glare in his eyes you will not let her escape  no go downbe quiet  dr may returned to preston and had to assure her that mr rivers was not gone to call the police before he could bring her to any degree of coherence she regarded him as her only friend and soon undertook to tell the whole truth and he perceived that it was indeed the truth she had not known that the cordial was injurious deeming it a panacea against fretfulness precious to nurses but against which ladies always had a prejudice and therefore to be kept secret poor little leonora had been very fretful and uneasy when floras many avocations had first caused her to be set aside and preston had had recourse to the remedy which lulling her successfully was applied with less moderation and judgment than would have been shown by a more experienced person till gradually the poor child became dependent on it for every hour of rest when her mother at last became aware of her unsatisfactory condition and spent her time in watching her the nurse being prevented from continuing her drug she was of course so miserable without it that preston had ventured on proposing it to which mrs rivers had replied with displeasure sufficient to prevent her from declaring how much she had previously given preston was in an agony of distress for her little charge as well as of fear for herself and could hardly understand what her error had been dr may soon saw that though not highly principled her sorrow was sincere and that she still wept bitterly over the consequences of her treatment when he told her that she had nothing to fear from the law and that he would protect her from mr rivers  her confession was hardly over when meta knocked at the door pale and frightened oh dr may do come to poor flora i dont know what to do and george is in such a state  dr may made a sound of sorrow and perplexity and meta as she went down before him asked in a low horrorstricken whisper did preston really  not knowingly said dr may it is the way many children have gone but i never thought  they had come to floras dressingroom her bedroom door was open and george was pacing heavily up and down the length of both apartments fiercely indignant well said he advancing eagerly on dr may has she confessed  but flora said dr may instead of answering him flora lay on her bed her face hidden on her pillow only now and then moaning  flora my poor poor child said her father bending down to raise her and taking her hand  she moved away so as to bury her face more completely but there was life in the movement and he was sufficiently reassured on her situation to be able to attend to george who was only impatient to rush off to take his revenge he led him into the outer room where meta was waiting and forced upon his unwilling conviction that it was no case for the law the child had not been killed by any one dose but had rather sunk from the want of stimulus to which she had been accustomed as to any pity for the woman george would not hear of it she was still in his eyes the destroyer of his child and when he found the law would afford him no vengeance he insisted that she should be turned out of his house at once  george called a hollow voice from the next room and hurrying back they saw flora sitting up and as well as trembling limbs allowed endeavouring to rise to her feet while burning spots were in her cheeks  george turn me out of the house too if preston killed her i did and she gave a ghastly laugh  george threw his arms round her and laid her on her bed again with many fond words and strength which she had not power to withstand dr may in the meantime spoke quickly to meta in the doorway she must go they cannot see her again but has she any friends in london  i think not  find out she must not be sent adrift send her to the grange if nothing better offers you must judge  he felt that he could confide in metas discretion and promptitude and returned to the parents  is she gone said george in a whisper which he meant should be unheard by his wife who had sunk her face in her pillows again  going meta is seeing to it  and that woman gets off free cried george while my poor little girl and no longer occupied by the hope of retribution he gave way to an overpowering burst of grief  his wife did not rouse herself to comfort him but still lay motionless excepting for a convulsive movement that passed over her frame at each sound from him and her father felt her pulse bound at the same time with corresponding violence as if each of his deepdrawn sobs were a mortal thrust going to him dr may endeavoured to repress his agitation and lead him from the room but he could not at first prevail on him to listen or understand still less to quit flora the attempt to force on him the perception that his uncontrolled sorrow was injuring her and that he ought to bear up for her sake only did further harm for when he rose up and tried to caress her there was the same torpid passive resistance the same burying her face from the light and the only betrayal of consciousness in the agonised throbs of her pulse  he became excessively distressed at being thus repelled and at last yielded to the impatient signals of dr may who drew him into the next room and with brief strong though most affectionate and pitying words enforced on him that floras brainnay her life was risked and that he must leave her alone to his care for the present meta coming back at the same moment dr may put him in her charge with renewed orders to impress on him how much depended on tranquillity  dr may went back with his soft undisturbing physicians footfall and stood at the side of the bed in such intense anxiety as those only can endure who know how to pray and to pray in resignation and faith  all was still in the darkening twilight but the distant roar of the world surged without and a gaslight shone flickering through the branches of the trees and fell on the rich dress spread on the couch and the ornaments on the toilettable there was a sense of oppression and of being pursued by the incongruous world and dr may sighed to silence all around and see his poor daughter in the calm of her own country air but she had chosen for herself and here she lay stricken down in the midst of the prosperity that she had sought  he could hear every respiration tightened and almost sobbing and he was hesitating whether to run the risk of addressing her when as if it had occurred to her suddenly that she was alone and deserted she raised up her head with a startled movement but as she saw him she again hid her face as if his presence were still more intolerable than solitude  flora my own my dearestmy poor child you should not turn from me do i not carry with me the like selfreproachful conviction  flora let him turn her face towards him and kiss her forehead it was burning and he brought water and bathed it now and then speaking a few fond low gentle words which though she did not respond evidently had some soothing effect for she admitted his services still however keeping her eyes closed and her face turned towards the darkest side of the room when he went towards the door she murmured papa as if to detain him  i am not going darling i only wanted to speak to george  dont let him come said flora  not till you wish it my dear  georges step was heard his hand was on the lock and again dr may was conscious of the sudden rush of blood through all her veins he quickly went forward met him and shut him out persuading him with difficulty to remain outside and giving him the occupation of sending out for an anodynesince the best hope at present lay in encouraging the torpor that had benumbed her crushed faculties  her father would not even venture to rouse her to be undressed he gave her the medicine and let her lie still with as little movement as possible standing by till her regular breathings showed that she had sunk into a sleep when he went into the other room and found that george had also forgotten his sorrows in slumber on the sofa while meta sat sadly presiding over the tea equipage  she came up to meet him her question expressed in her looks  asleep he said i hope the pulses are quieter all depends on her wakening  poor poor flora said meta wiping away her tears  what have you done with the woman  i sent her to mrs larpents i knew she would receive her and keep her till she could write to her friends bellairs took her but i could hardly speak to her  she did it ignorantly said dr may  i could never be so merciful and forbearing as you said meta  ah my dear you will never have the same cause  they could say no more for george awoke and the argument of his exclusion had to be gone through again he could not enter into it by any means and when dr may would have made him understand that poor flora could not acquit herself of neglect and that even his affection was too painful for her in the present state he broke into a vehement angry defence of her devotion to her child treating dr may as if the accusation came from him and when the doctor and meta had persuaded him out of this he next imagined that his fatherinlaw feared that he was going to reproach his wife and there was no making him comprehend more than that if she were not kept quiet she might have a serious illness  even then he insisted on going to look at her and dr may could not prevent him from pressing his lips to her forehead she half opened her eyes and murmured goodnight and by this he was a little comforted but he would hear of nothing but sitting up and meta would have done the same but for an absolute decree of the doctor  it was a relief to dr may that georges vigil soon became a sound repose on the sofa in the dressingroom and he was left to read and muse uninterruptedly  it was far past two oclock before there was any movement then flora drew a long breath stirred and as her father came and drew her hand into his before she was well awake she gave a long wondering whisper oh papa papa then sitting up and passing her hand over her eyes is it all true  it is true my own poor dear said dr may supporting her as she rested against his arm and hid her face on his shoulder while her breath came short and she shivered under the renewed perceptionshe is gone to wait for you  hush oh dont papa said flora her voice shortened by anguish oh think why  nay flora do not do not speak as if that should exclude peace or hope said dr may entreatingly besides it was no wilful neglectyou had other duties  you dont know me papa said flora drawing her hands away from him and tightly clenching them in one another as thoughts far too terrible for words swept over her  if i do not the most merciful father does said dr may flora sat for a minute or two her hands locked together round her knees her head bowed down her lips compressed her father was so far satisfied that the bodily dangers he had dreaded were averted but the agony of mind was far more terrible especially in one who expressed so little and in whom it seemed as it were pent up  papa said flora presently with a resolution of tone as if she would prevent resistance i must see her  you shall my dear said the doctor at once and she seemed grateful not to be opposed speaking more gently as she said may it be nowwhile there is no daylight  if you wish it said dr may  the dawn and a yellow waning moon gave sufficient light for moving about and flora gained her feet but she was weak and trembling and needed the support of her fathers arm though hardly conscious of receiving it as she mounted the same stairs that she had so often lightly ascended in the like doubtful morning light for never after any party had she omitted her visit to the nursery  the door was locked and she looked piteously at her father as her weak push met the resistance and he was somewhat slow in turning the key with his left hand the whitewashed slightly furnished room reflected the light and the moonbeams showed the windowframe in pale and dim shades on the blinds the dewy air breathed in coolly from the park and there was a calm solemnity in the atmosphereno light no watcher present to tend the babe little leonora needed such no more she was with the keeper who shall neither slumber nor sleep  so it thrilled across her grandfather as he saw the little cradle drawn into the middle of the room and on the coverlet some pure white rosebuds and lilies of the valley gathered in the morning by mary and blanche little guessing the use that meta would make of them ere nightfall  the mother sank on her knees her hands clasped over her breast and rocking herself to and fro uneasily with a low irrepressible moaning  will you not see her face whispered dr may  i may not touch her was the answer in the hollow voice and with the wild eye that had before alarmed him but trusting to the soothing power of the mute face of the innocent he drew back the covering  the sight was such as he anticipated sadly lovely smiling and tranquilall oppression and suffering fled away for ever  it stilled the sounds of pain and the restless motion the compression of the hands became less tight and he began to hope that the look was passing into her heart he let her kneel on without interruption only once he said of such is the kingdom of heaven  she made no immediate answer and he had had time to doubt whether he ought to let her continue in that exhausting attitude any longer when she looked up and said you will all be with her there  she has flown on to point your aim more steadfastly said dr may  flora shuddered but spoke calmlyno i shall not meet her  my child he exclaimed do you know what you are saying  i know i am not in the way said flora still in the same fearfully quiet matteroffact tone i never have beenand she bent over her child as if taking her leave for eternity  his tongue almost clave to the roof of his mouth as he heard the wordswords elicited by one of those hours of true reality that like death rend aside every wilful cloak of selfdeceit and selfapprobation he had no power to speak at first when he recovered it his reply was not what his heart had at first prompted  flora how has this dear child been saved he said what has released her from the guilt she inherited through you through me through all is not the fountain open  she never wasted grace said flora  my child my flora he exclaimed losing the calmness he had gained by such an effort you must not talk thusit is wrong only your own morbid feeling can treat thisthisas a charge against you and if it were indeedhe sank his voicethat such consequences destroyed hope oh flora where should i be  no said flora this is not what i meant it is that i have never set my heart right i am not like you nor my sisters i have seemed to myself and to you to be trying to do right but it was all hollow for the sake of praise and credit i know it now it is too late and he has let me destroy my child here lest i should have destroyed her everlasting life like my own  the most terrible part of this sentence was to dr may that flora spoke as if she knew it all as a certainty and without apparent emotion with all the calmness of despair what she had never guessed before had come clearly and fully upon her now and without apparent novelty or perhaps there had been misgivings in the midst of her complacent selfsatisfaction she did not even seem to perceive how dreadfully she was shocking her father whose sole comfort was in believing her language the effect of exaggerated selfreproach his profession had rendered him not new to the sight of despondency and dismayed as he was he was able at once to speak to the point  if it were indeed so her removal would be the greatest blessing  yes said her mother and her assent was in the same tone of resigned despair owning it best for her child to be spared a worldly education and loving her truly enough to acquiesce  i meant the greatest blessing to you continued dr may if it be sent to open your eyes and raise your thoughts upwards oh flora are not afflictions tokens of infinite love  she could not accept the encouragement and only formed with her lips the words mercy to herwrath to me  the simplicity and hearty piety which with all dr mays faults had always been part of his character and had borne him in faith and trust through all his trials had never belonged to her where he had been sincere erring only from impulsiveness she had been doubleminded and calculating and now that her delusion had been broken down she had nothing to rest upon her whole religious life had been mechanical deceiving herself more than even others and all seemed now swept away except the sense of hypocrisy and of having cut herself off for ever from her innocent child her father saw that it was vain to argue with her and only said you will think otherwise by and by my dear now shall i say a prayer before we go down  as she made no reply he repeated the lords prayer but she did not join and then he added a broken hesitating intercession for the mourners which caused her to bury her face deeper in her hands but her dull wretchedness altered not  rising he said authoritatively come flora you must go to bed see it is morning  you have sat up all night with me said flora with somewhat of her anxious considerate self  so has george he had just dropped asleep on the sofa when you awoke  i thought he was in anger said she  not with you dearest  no i remember now not where it was justly due papa she said pausing as to recall her recollection what did i do i must have done something very unkind to make him go away and leave me  i insisted on his leaving you my dear you seemed oppressed and his affectionate ways were doing you harm so i was hardhearted and turned him out sadly against his will  poor george said flora has he been left to bear it alone all this time how much distressed he must have been i must have vexed him grievously you dont guess how fond he was of her i must go to him at once  that is right my dear  dont praise me said she as if she could not bear it all that is left for me is to do what i can for him  dr may felt cheered he was sure that hope must again rise out of unselfish love and duty  their return awoke george who started half sitting up wondering why he was spending the night in so unusual a manner and why flora looked so pale in the morning light with her loosened drooping hair  she went straight to him and kneeling by his side said george forgive the same moment he had caught her to his bosom but so impressed was his tardy mind with the peril of talking to her that he held her in his arms without a single word till dr may had unclosed his lipsa sign would not sufficehe must have a sentence to assure him and then it was such joy to have her restored and his fondness and solicitude were so tender and eager in their clumsiness that his fatherinlaw was touched to the heart  flora was quite herself again in presence of mind and power of dealing with him and dr may left them to each other and went to his own room for such rest as sorrow sympathy and the wakening city would permit him  when the house was astir in the morning and the doctor had met meta in the breakfastroom and held with her a sad affectionate conversation george came down with a fair report of his wife and took her father to see her  that night had been like an illness to her and though perfectly composed she was feeble and crushed keeping the room darkened and reluctant to move or speak indeed she did not seem able to give her attention to any ones voice except her husbands when dr may or meta spoke to her she would miss what they said beg their pardon and ask them to repeat it and sometimes even then become bewildered they tried reading to her but she did not seem to listen and her halfclosed eye had the expression of listless dejection that her father knew betokened that even as last night her heart refused to accept promises of comfort as meant for her  for george however her attention was always ready and was perpetually claimed he was forlorn and at a loss without her every moment and in the sorrow which he too felt most acutely could not have a minutes peace unless soothed by her presence he was dependent on her to a degree which amazed and almost provoked the doctor who could not bear to have her continually harassed and disturbed and yet was much affected by witnessing so much tenderness especially in flora always the cold utilitarian member of his family  in the middle of the day she rose and dressed because george was unhappy at having to sit without her though only in the next room she sat in the large armchair turned away from the blinded windows never speaking nor moving save when he came to her to make her look at his letters and notes when she would with the greatest patience and sweetness revise them suggest word or sentence rouse herself to consider each petty detail and then sink back into her attitude of listless dejection to all besides she appeared totally indifferent gently courteous to meta and to her father when they addressed her but otherwise showing little consciousness whether they were in the room and yet when something was passing about her fathers staying or returning she rose from her seat came up to him before he was aware and said papa papa you will not leave me in such an imploring tone that if he had ever thought of quitting her he could not have done so  he longed to see her left to perfect tranquillity but such could not be in london though theirs was called a quiet house the rushing stream of traffic wearied his country ears the door bell seemed ceaselessly ringing and though meta bore the brunt of the notes and messages great numbers necessarily came up to mr rivers and of these flora was not spared one dr may had his share too of messages and business and friends and relations the rivers kindred always ready to take offence with their rich connections and who would not be satisfied with inquiries at the door but must see meta and would have george fetched down to themold aunts who wanted the whole story of the childs illness and came imagining there was something to be hushed up lady leonora extremely polite but extremely disgusted at the encounter with them george ready to be persuaded to take every one up to see his wife and the prohibition to be made by dr may over and over againit was a most tedious wearing afternoon and at last when the visitors had gone and george had hurried back to his wife dr may threw himself into an armchair and said oh meta sorrow weighs more heavily in town than in the country  yes said meta if one only could go out and look at the flowers and take poor flora up a nosegay  i dont think it would make much difference to her sighed the doctor  yes i think it would said meta it did to me the sights there speak of the better sights  the power to look must come from within said dr may thinking of his poor daughter  ay said meta as mr ernescliffe said heaven is as near but the skirts of heaven are more easily traced in our mountain view than here where if i looked out of window i should only see that giddy string of carriages and people pursuing each other  well we shall get her home as soon as she is able to move and i hope it may soothe her what a turmoil it is there has not been one moment without noise in the twentytwo hours i have been here  what would you say if you were in the city  ah theres no talking of it but if i had been a fashionable london physician as my fatherinlaw wanted to make me i should have been dead long ago  no i think you would have liked it very much  why  loves a flower that will not die repeated meta half smiling you would have found so much good to do  and so much misery to rend ones heart said dr may but after all i suppose there is only a certain capacity of feeling  it is within not without as you said returned meta  ha theres another cried dr may almost petulant at the sound of the bell again breaking into the conversation that was a great refreshment  it was sir henry walkinghames ring said meta it is always his time of day  the doctor did not like it the better  sir henry sent up a message to ask whether he could see mr or miss rivers  i suppose we must said meta looking at the doctor lady walkinghame must be anxious about flora  she blushed greatly fancying that dr may was putting his own construction on the heightened colour which she could not control sir henry came in just what he ought to be kindly anxious but not overwhelming and with a ready pleased recognition of the doctor as an old acquaintance of his boyhood he did not stay many minutes but there was a perceptible difference between his real sympathy and friendly regard only afraid of obtruding and the oppressive curiosity of their former visitors dr may felt it due both from kindness and candour to say something in his praise when he was gone  that is a sensible superior man he said he will be an acquisition when he takes up his abode at drydale  yes said meta a very simple yes from which nothing could be gathered  the funeral was fixed for monday the next day but one at the church where mr rivers had been buried no one was invited to be present ethel wrote that much as she wished it she could not leave margaret and as the whole party were to return home on the following day they should soon see flora  flora had laid aside all privileges of illness after the first day she came downstairs to breakfast and dinner and though looking wretchedly ill and speaking very low and feebly she was as much as ever the mistress of her house her father could never draw her into conversation again on the subject nearest his heart and could only draw the sad conclusion that her state of mind was unchanged from the dreary indifference with which she allowed every word of cheer to pass by unheeded as if she could not bear to look beyond the grave he had some hope in the funeral which she was bent on attending and more in the influence of margaret and the counsel of richard or of mr wllmot  the burial however failed to bring any peaceful comfort to the mourning mother metas tears flowed freely as much for her father as for her little niece and georges sobs were deep and choking but flora externally only seemed absorbed in helping him to go through with it she herself never lost her fixed composed hopeless look  after her return she went up to the nursery and deliberately set apart and locked up every possession of her childs then coming down startled meta by laying her hand on her shoulder and saying meta dear preston is in the housekeepers room will you go and speak to her for a moment to reassure her before i come  oh flora  i sent for her said flora in answer i thought it would be a good opportunity while george is out will you be kind enough to prepare her my dear  meta wondered how flora had known whither to send but she could not but obey poor preston was an ordinary sort of woman kindhearted and not without a conscience but her error had arisen from the want of any high religious principle to teach her obedience or sincerity her grief was extreme and she had been so completely overcome by the forbearance and consideration shown to her that she was even more brokenhearted by the thought of them than by the terrible calamity she had occasioned  kindhearted mrs larpent had tried to console her as well as to turn the misfortune to the best account and dr may had once seen her and striven gently to point out the true evil of the course she had pursued she was now going to her home and they augured better of her that she had been as yet too utterly downcast to say one word of that first thought with a servant her character  meta found her sobbing uncontrollably at the associations of her masters house and dreadfully frightened at hearing that she was to see mrs rivers she began to entreat to the contrary with the vehemence of a person unused to any selfgovernment but in the midst the low calm tones were heard and her mistress stood before herher perfect stillness of demeanour far more effective in repressing agitation than had been metas coaxing attempts to soothe  you need not be afraid to see me preston said flora kindly i am very sorry for youyou knew no better and i should not have left so much to you  oh maamso kindthe dear dear little darlingi shall never forgive myself  i know you did love her continued flora i am sure you intended no harm and it was my leaving her that made her fretful  preston tried to thank  only remember henceforthand the clear tone grew fainter than ever with internal anguish though still steadyremember strict obedience and truth henceforth the want of them will have worse results by and by than even this now preston i shall always wish you well i ought not i believe to recommend you to the like place without saying why you left me but for any other i will give you a fair character i will see what i can do for you and if you are ever in any distress i hope you will let me know have your wages been paid  there was a sound in the affirmative but poor preston could not speak goodbye then and flora took her hand and shook it mind you let me hear if you want help keep this  meta was a little disappointed to see sovereigns instead of a book flora turned to go and put her hand out to lean on her sister as for support she stood still to gather strength before ascending the stairs and a groan of intense misery was wrung from her  dearest flora it has been too much  no said flora gently  poor thing i am glad for her sake but might she not have a booka bible  you may give her one if you like i could not  flora reached her own room went in and bolted the door     chapter xxi         oh where dwell ye my ain sweet bairns        im woe and weary grown      oh lady we live where woe never is        in a land to flesh unknownallan cunningham   it had been with a gentle sorrow that etheldred had expected to go and lay in her restingplace the little niece who had been kept from the evil of the world in a manner of which she had little dreamt poor flora she must be ennobled she thought by having a child where hers is when she is able to feel anything but the first grief and ethels heart yearned to be trying at least to comfort her and to be with her father who had loved his grandchild so fondly  it was not to be margaret had borne so many shocks with such calmness that ethel had no especial fears for her but there are some persons who have less fortitude for others than for themselves and she was one of these ethel had been her own companionsister and the baby had been the sunbeam of her life during the sad winter and spring  in the middle of the night ethel knocked at richards door margaret had been seized with faintness from which they could not bring her back and even when richard had summoned dr spencer it was long ere his remedies took effect but at last she revived enough to thank them and say she was glad that papa was not there  dr spencer sent them all to bed and the rest of the night was quiet but margaret could not deny in the morning that she felt terribly shattered and she was depressed in spirits to a degree such as they had never seen in her before her whole heart was with flora she was unhappy at being at a distance from her almost fretfully impatient for letters and insisting vehemently on ethels going to london  ethel had never felt so helpless and desolate as with margaret thus changed and broken and her father absent  my dear said dr spencer nothing can be better for both parties than that he should be away if he were here he ought to leave all attendance to me and she would suffer from the sight of his distress  i cannot think what he will do or feel sighed ethel  leave it to me i will write to him and we shall see her better before post time  you will tell him exactly how it was or i shall said ethel abruptly not to say fiercely  ho you dont trust me said dr spencer smiling so that she was ashamed of her speech you shall speak for yourself and i for myself and i shall say that nothing would so much hurt her as to have others sacrificed to her  that is true said ethel but she misses papa  of course she does but depend on it she would not have him leave your sister and she is under less restraint without him  i never saw her like this  the drop has made it overflow she has repressed more than was good for her and now that her guard is broken down she gives way under the whole weight  poor margaret i am pertinacious but if she is not better by post time papa will not bear to be away  ill tell you what i think of her by that time send up your brother richard if you wish to do her good richard would be a much better person to write than yourself i perceive that he is the reasonable member of the family  did not you know that before  all i knew of him till last night was that no one could by any possibility call him dick  dr spencer was glad to have dismissed ethel smiling and she was the better able to bear with poor margarets condition of petulance she had never before experienced the effects of bodily ailments on the temper and she was slow to understand the change in one usually so patient and submissive she was by turns displeased with her sister and with her own abruptness but though she knew it not her bluntness had a bracing effect she thought she had been cross in declaring it was nonsense to harp on her going to london but it made margaret feel that she had been unreasonable and keep silence  richard managed her much better being gentle and firm and less ready to speak than ethel and he succeeded in composing her into a sleep which restored her balance and so relieved ethel that she not only allowed dr spencer to say what he pleased but herself made light of the whole attack little knowing how perilous was any shock to that delicate frame  margarets whole purpose was to wind herself up for the first interview with flora and though she had returned to her usual state she would not go downstairs on the evening the party were expected believing it would be more grateful to her sisters feelings to meet her without witnesses  the travellers arrived and dr may hurried up to her she barely replied to his caresses and inquiries in her eagerness to hear of flora and to convince him that he must not forbid the meeting nor had he any mind so to do surely said he when he had seen the spiritualised look of her glistening blue eyes the flush on her transparent cheeks and her hands clasped over her breastsurely poor flora must feel as though an angel were waiting to comfort her  flora came but there was sore disappointment fond and tender she was as ever but neither by word or gesture would she admit the most remote allusion to her grief she withdrew her hand when margarets pressure became expressive she avoided her eye and spoke incessantly of different subjects all the time her voice was low and hollow her face had a settled expression of wretchedness and her glances wandered drearily and restlessly anywhere but to margarets face but her steadiness of manner was beyond her sisters power to break and her visit was shortened on account of her husband poor george had quite given way at the sight of gertrude whom his little girl had been thought to resemble and though dr may had soothed him almost like a child no one put any trust in his selfcontrol and all sat round fearing each word or look till flora came downstairs and they departed  richard and ethel each offered to go with them they could not bear to think of their spending that first evening in their childless home but flora gently but decidedly refused and dr may said that much as he wished to be with them he believed that flora preferred having no one but meta i hope i have done margaret no harm were floras last words to him and they seemed to explain her guarded manner but he found margaret weeping as she had never wept for herself and palpitation and faintness were the consequence  ethel looked on at flora as a sad and perplexing mystery during the weeks that ensued there were few opportunities of being alone together and flora shrank from such as they werenay she checked all expression of solicitude and made her very kisses rapid and formal  the sorrow that had fallen on the grange seemed to have changed none of the usual habits therevisiting riding driving dinners and music went on with little check flora was sure to be found the animated attentive lady of the house or else sharing her husbands pursuits helping him with his business or assisting him in seeking pleasure spending whole afternoons at the coachmakers over a carriage that they were building and it was reported playing ecarte in the evening  had grief come to be forgotten and cast aside without effecting any mission yet ethel could not believe that the presence of the awful messenger was unfelt when she heard poor georges heavy sigh or when she looked at floras countenance and heard the peculiar low subdued tone of her voice which when her words were most cheerful always seemed to ethel the resigned accent of despair  ethel could not talk her over with margaret for all seemed to make it a point that margaret should believe the best dr may turned from the subject with a sort of shuddering grief and said dont talk of her poor childonly pray for her  ethel though shocked by the unwonted manner of his answer was somewhat consoled by perceiving that a double measure of tenderness had sprung up between her father and his poor daughter if flora had seemed in her girlhood to rate him almost cheaply this was at an end now she met him as if his embrace were peace the gloom was lightened the attention less strained when he was beside her and she could not part with him without pressing for a speedy meeting yet she treated him with the same reserve since that one ghastly revelation of the secrets of her heart the veil had been closely drawn and he could not guess whether it had been but a horrible thought or were still an abiding impression ethel could gather no more than that her father was very unhappy about flora and that richard understood why for richard had told her that he had written to flora to try to persuade her to cease from this reserve but that he had no reply  norman was not at home he had undertaken the tutorship of two schoolboys for the holidays and his father owned with a sigh that he was doing wisely  as to meta she was ethels chief consolation by the redoubled assurances directed to ethels unexpressed dread lest flora should be rejecting the chastening hand meta had the most absolute certainty that floras apparent cheerfulness was all for georges sake and that it was a most painful exertion if ethel could only see how she let herself sink together as it were and her whole countenance relax as soon as he was out of sight meta said she could not doubt what misery these efforts were to her  why does she go on with them said ethel  george said meta what would become of him without her if he misses her for ten minutes he roams about lost and he cannot enjoy anything without her i cannot think how he can help seeing what hard work it is and how he can be contented with those dreadful sham smiles but as long as she can give him pleasure poor flora will toil for him  it is very selfish ethel caught herself saying  no no it is not cried meta it is not that he will not see but that he cannot see good honest fellow he really thinks it does her good and pleases her i was so sorry one evening when i tried to take her place at that perpetual ecarte and told him it teased her he went so wistfully to her and asked whether it did and she exerted herself into such painful enjoyment to persuade him to the contrary and afterwards she said to me let me alone dearestit is the only thing left me  there is something in being husband and wife that one cannot understand slowly said ethel so much in her quaint way that meta laughed  had it not been for normans absence ethel would in the warm sympathy and accustomed manner of meta rivers have forgotten all about the hopes and fears that in brighter days had centred on that small personage until one day as she came home from cocksmoor she found sir henry walkinghames card on the drawingroom table i should like to bite you coming here are you was her amiable reflection  meta in her ridinghabit peeped out of margarets room oh ethel there you are it is such a boon that you did not come home sooner or we should have had to ride home with him i heard him asking for the miss mays and now i am in hopes that he will go home without falling in with flora and george  i did not know he was in these parts  he came to drydale last week but the place is forlorn and george gave him a general invitation to the grange  do you like him said ethel while margaret looked on amazed at her audacity  i liked him very much in london said meta he is pleasant enough to talk to but somehow he is not congruous hereif you understand me and i think his coming oppresses florashe turned quite pale when he was announced and her voice was lower than ever when she spoke to him  does he come often said ethel  i dont think he has anything else to do returned meta for our house cannot be as pleasant as it was but he is very kind to george and for that we must be grateful one thing i am afraid of that he will persuade us off to the yachting after all  oh was the general exclamation  yes said meta george seemed to like the plan and i very much fear that he is taking a dislike to the dear old grange i heard him say anything to get away  poor george i know he is restless said margaret  at least said ethel you cant go till after your birthday miss heiress  no uncle cosham is coming said meta margaret you must have your stone laid before we go  dr spencer promises it before hectors holidays are over said margaret blushing as she always did with pleasure when they talked of the church  hector ernescliffe had revived margaret wonderfully she was seldom downstairs before the evening and ethel thought his habit of making her apartment his sittingroom must be as inconvenient to her as it was to herself but hector could not be de trop for margaret she exerted herself to fulfil for him all the little sisterly offices that with her brothers had been transferred to ethel and mary she threw herself into all his schemes tried to make him endure captain gordon and she even read his favourite book of wild sports though her feelings were constantly lacerated by the miseries of the slaughtered animals her couch was to him as a home and he had awakened her bright soft liveliness which had been only dimmed for a time  the church was her other great interest and dr spencer humoured her by showing her all his drawings consulting her on every ornament and making many a perspective elevation merely that she might see the effect  richard and tom made it their recreation to construct a model of the church as a present for her and tom developed a genius for carving which proved a beneficial interest to keep him from surliness he had voluntarily propounded his intended profession to his father who had been so much pleased by his choice that he could not but be gratified though now and then ambitious fancies and discontent with stoneborough combined to bring on his ordinary moody fits the more because his habitual reserve prevented any one from knowing what was working in his mind  finally the rivers party announced their intention of going to the isle of wight as soon as meta had come of age and the council of cocksmoor meeting at tea at dr mays house decided that the foundation stone of the church should be laid on the day after her birthday when there would be a gathering of the whole family as margaret wished dr spencer had worked incredibly hard to bring it forward and margarets sweet smiles and liquid eyes expressed how personally thankful she felt  what a blessing this church has been to that poor girl said dr spencer as he left the house with mr wilmot how it beguiles her out of her grief i am glad she has the pleasure of the foundation i doubt if she will see the consecration  indeed said mr wilmot shocked was that attack so serious  that recumbent position and want of exercise were certain to produce organic disease and suspense and sorrow have hastened it the death of mrs riverss poor child was the blow that called it into activity and if it last more than a year i shall be surprised  for such as she is one cannot presume to wish but her fatheris he aware of this  he knows there is extensive damage i think he does not open his eyes to the result but he will bear it never was there a man to whom it came so naturally to live like the fowls of the air or the lilies of the field as it does to dear dick may said dr spencer his voice faltering  there is a strength of faith and love in him that carries him through all said mr wilmot his childlike nature seems to have the trustfulness that is in itself consolation you said how cocksmoor had been blessed to margareti think it is the same with them allnot only ethel and richard who have been immediately concerned but that one object has been a centre and aim to elevate the whole family and give force and unity to their efforts even the good doctor much as i always looked up to himmuch good as he did me in my young daysi must confess that he was sometimes very provoking  if you had tried to be his keeper at cambridge you might say so rejoined dr spencer  he is so much less impetuousmore consistentless desultory i dare say you understand me said mr wilmot his good qualities do not entangle one another as they used to do  exactly so he was far more than i looked for when i came home though i might have guessed that such a disposition backed by such principles and suchcould not but shake off all the dross  one thing was said mr wilmot smiling that a man must take himself in hand at some time in his life and dr may only began to think himself responsible for himself when he lost his wife who was wise for both she was an admirable person but not easy to know well i think you knew her at  i say interrupted dr spencer it strikes me that we could not do better than get up our s p g demonstration on the day of the stone  hitherto the stoneborough subscribers to the society for the propagation of the gospel had been few and far between but under the new dynasty there was a talk of forming an association and having a meeting to bring the subject forward dr spencers proposal however took the vicar by surprise  never could there be a better time he argued you have naturally a gathering of clergypeople ought to be liberal on such an occasion and as cocksmoor is provided for why not give the benefit to the missions in their crying need  true but there is no time to send for any one to make a speech  husband your resources what could you have better than young harry and his islanders  harry would never make a speech  let him cram norman young lake tells me norman made a great sensation at the union at oxford and if his heart is in the work he must not shrink from the face of his townsmen  no doubt he had rather they were savages said the vicar and yourselfyou will tell them of the indian missions  with all my heart said dr spencer when my brahminhee godsonthe deacon i told you of comes to pay me his promised visit what doings we shall have seriously i have just had letters from him and from others that speak of such need that i could feel every moment wasted that is not spent on their behalf  mr wilmot was drawn into dr spencers house and heard the letters till his heart burned within him  the meeting was at once decided upon though ethel could not see why people could not give without speechifying and her two younger brothers declared it was humbugtom saying he wished all blackamoors were out of creation and harry that he could not stand palaver about his friend david dr may threatened him with being displayed on the platform as a living instance of the effects of missions at which he took alarm and so seriously declared that he should join the bucephalus at once that they pacified him by promising that he should do as he pleased  the archdeacon promised a sermon and the active dr spencer worked the nine muses and all the rest of the town and neighbourhood into a state of great enthusiasm and expectation he went to the grange as he said to collect his artillery primed flora that she might prime the m p made the willing meta promise to entrap the uncle who was noted for philanthropical speeches and himself captured sir henry walkinghame who looked somewhat rueful at what he found incumbent on him as a country gentleman though there might be some compensation in the eagerness of miss rivers  norman had hardly set foot in stoneborough before he was told what was in store for him and to the general surprise submitted as if it were a very simple matter as dr spencer told him it was only a foretaste of the penalty which every missionary has to pay for coming to england norman was altogether looking much better than when he had been last at home and his spirits were more even he had turned his whole soul to the career he had chosen cast his disappointment behind him or more truly made it his offering and gathered strength and calmness with which to set out on tasks of working for others with thoughts too much absorbed on them to give way to the propensity of making himself the primary object of study and contemplation the praise of god and love of man were the best cures for tendencies like his and he had found it out his calm though grave cheerfulness came as a refreshment to those who had been uneasy about him and mournfully watching poor flora  yes said dr spencer you have taken the best course for your own happiness  norman coloured as if he understood more than met the ear mary and blanche were very busy preparing presents for meta rivers and every one was anxious to soften to her the thought of this first birthday without her father each of the family contributed some pretty little trifle choice in workmanship or kind in device and each was sealed and marked with the initials of the giver and packed up by mary to be committed to floras charge blanche had however much trouble in extracting a gift from norman and he only yielded at last on finding that all his brothers had sent something so that his omission would be marked then he dived into the recesses of his desk and himself sealed up a little parcel of which he would not allow his sisters to inspect the contents  ethel had a shrewd guess she remembered his having in the flush of joy at margarets engagement rather prematurely caused a seal to be cut with a daisy and pearl of the meadow as the motto and his having said that he should keep it as a wedding present she could understand that he was willing to part with it without remark  flora met meta in her sittingroom on the morning of the day which rose somewhat sadly upon the young girl as she thought of past affection and new responsibilities if the fondness of a sister could have compensated for what she had lost meta received it in no scanty measure from flora who begged to call george because he would be pleased to see the display of gifts  his own was the only costly onealmost all the rest were homemade treasures of the greater price because the skill and fondness of the maker were evident in their construction and meta took home the kindness as it was meant and felt the affection that would not let her feel herself lonely she only wished to go and thank them all at once  do then said flora if lord cosham will spare you and your business should be over in time you could drive in and try to bring papa home with you  oh thank you flora that is a kind treat in case the morning should be very awful  margaret agatha rivers signed her documents listened to explanations and was complimented by her uncle on not thinking it necessary to be senseless on money matters like her cousin agatha langdale  still she looked a little oppressed as she locked up the tokens of her wealth and the sunshine of her face did not beam out again till she arrived at stoneborough and was dispensing her pretty thanks to the few she found at home  ethel out and norman his seal is only too pretty  they are all helping dr spencer at cocksmoor  what a pity but it is so very kind of him to treat me as a daisy in some ways i like his present for that the best of all said meta  i will tell him so said mary  yes no said meta i am not pretending to be anything half so nice  mary and blanche fell upon her for calling herself anything but the nicest flower in the world and she contended that she was nothing better than a parrottulip stuck up in a parterre and just as the discussion was becoming a game at romps dr may came in and the children shouted to him to say whether his hummingbird were a daisy or a tulip  that is as she comports herself he said playfully  which means that you dont think her quite done for said meta  not quite said the doctor with a droll intonation but i have not seen what this morning may have done to her  come and see then said meta flora told me to bring you homeand it is my birthday you know never mind waiting to tell ethel margaret will let her know that ill keep you out of mischief  as usual dr may could not withstand her and she carried him off in triumph in her pony carriage  then you dont give me up yet was the first thing she said as they were off the stones  what have you been doing to make me said he  doing or not doingone or the other she said but indeed i wanted to have you to myself i am in a great puzzle  sir henry i hope she wont consult me thought dr may as he answered well my dear  i fear it is a lasting puzzle she said what shall i do with all this money  keep it in the bank or buy railway shares said dr may looking arch  thank you thats a question for my cousins in the city i want you to answer me as no one else can do i want to know what is my duty now that i have my means in my own hands  there is need enough around  i do not mean only giving a little here and there but i want you to hear a few of my thoughts flora and george are kindness itselfbut you see i have no duties they are obliged to live a gay sort of lifeit is their position but i cannot make out whether it is mine i dont see that i am like those girls who have to go out as a matter of obedience  dr may considered but could only say you are very young  too young to be independent sighed meta i must grow old enough to be trusted alone and in the meantime  probably an answer will be found said the doctor you and your means will find theirtheir vocation  marriage said meta calmly speaking the word that he had avoided i think not  why he began  i do not think good men like heiresses  he became strongly interested in a cornfield and she resumed  perhaps i should only do harm it may be my duty to wait all i wish to know is whether it is  i see you are not like girls who know their duty and are restless because it is not the duty they like  oh i like everything it is my liking it so much that makes me afraid  even going to ryde  dont i like the sailing and seeing harry too i dont feel as if that were waste because i can sometimes spare poor flora a little we could not let her go alone  you need never fear to be without a mission of comfort said dr may your spirit full of glee was given you for something your presence is far more to my poor flora than you or she guess  i never meant to leave her now said meta earnestly i only wished to be clear whether i ought to seek for my work  it will seek you when the time comes  and meantime i must do what comes to hand and take it as humiliation that it is not in the more obviously blessed tasks a call might come as cocksmoor did to ethel but oh my money ought it to be laid up for myself  for your call when it comes said dr may smiling then gravely there are but too many calls for the interest the principal is your trust till the time comes  meta smiled and was pleased to think that her firstfruits would be offered tomorrow     chapter xxii    oh dear sighed etheldred as she fastened her white muslin im afraid it is my nature to hate my neighbour  my dear ethel what is coming next said margaret  i like my neighbour at home and whom i have to work for very much said ethel but oh my neighbour that i have to be civil to  poor old king i am afraid your day will be spoiled with all your toils as lady of the house i wish i could help you  let me have my grumble out and you will said ethel  indeed i am sorry you have this bustle and so many to entertain when i know you would rather have the peaceful feelings belonging to the day undisturbed i should like to shelter you up here  it is very ungrateful of me said ethel when dr spencer works so hard for us not to be willing to grant anything to him  andbut then i have none of the trouble of iti cant help liking the notion of sending out the church to the island whence the church came home to us  yes said ethel if we could do it without holding forth  come ethel it is much better than the bazaarit is no field for vanity  certainly not said ethel what a mess every one will make oh if i could but stay away like harry there will be dr hoxton being sonorous and prosy and mr lake will stammer and that will be nothing to the misery of our own peoples work george will flounder and look at flora and she will sit with her eyes on the ground and dr spencer will come out of his proper self and be complimentary to people who deserve it no moreand norman i wish i could run away  richard says we do not guess how well norman speaks  richard thinks norman can do anything he cant do himself it is all chancehe may do very well if he gets into his funny state but he always suffers for that and he will certainly put one into an agony at the outset i wish dr spencer would have let him alone and then there will be that sir henry whom i cant abide oh i wish i were more charitable like miss bracy and mary who will think all so beautiful  so will you when you come home said margaret  if i could only be talking to cherry and dame hall i think the school children enter into it very nicely margaret did i tell you how nicely ellen reid answered about the hymn from greenlands icy mountains she did not seem to have made it a mere geographical lesson like fanny grigg  ethels misanthropy was happily conducted off via the cocksmoor children and any lingering remains were dissipated by her amusement at dr spencers ecstasy on seeing dr may assume his red robe of office to go to the minster in state with the town council he walked round and round his friend called him nicholas randall redivivus quoted dogberry and affronted gertrude who had a dim idea that he was making game of papa  ethel was one of those to whom representation was such a penance that a festival necessitating hospitality to guests of her own rank was burden enough seriously to disturb the repose of thankfulness for the attainment of her object and to render difficult the recueillement which she needed for the praise and prayer that she felt due from her and which seemed to oppress her heart by a sense of inadequacy of her partial expression it was well for her that the day began with the calm service in the minster where it was her own fault if cares haunted her and she could confess the sin of her irritated sensations and wishes to have all her own way and then as ever be led aright into thanksgiving for the unlookedfor crowning of her labours  the archdeacons sermon amplified what margaret had that morning expressed so as to carry on her sense of appropriateness in the offerings of the day being bestowed on distant lands  but the ordeal was yet to come and though blaming herself she was anything but comfortable as the world repaired to the town hall the room where the same faces so often met for such diverse purposesnow an orrery displayed by a conceited lecturer now a ball now a magistrates meeting a concert or a poultry show where rival hamburg and dorking uplifted their voices in the places of mario and grisi all beneath the benignant portrait of nicholas randall ruffed robed squaretoed his endowment of the scholarship in his hand and a chequered pavement at his feet  who knows not an s p g meetingthe gaiety of the serious and the first public spectacle to the young who like blanche and aubrey gaze with admiration at the rows of bonnets and with awe at the black coats on the platform while the relations of the said black coats suffer like ethel from nervous dread of the public speaking of their best friends  her expectations were realised by the archdeacons speech which went round in a circle as if he could not find his way out of it lord cosham was fluent but a great many words went to very small substance and no wonder thought ethel when all they had to propose and second was the obvious fact that missions were very good things  dr hoxton pompously sir henry walkinghame creditably assisted the ladies and gentlemen to resolve that the s p g wanted help mr lake made a stammering and mr rivers with his goodnatured face hearty manner and good voice came in well after him with a straightforward speech so brief that ethel gave flora credit for the best she had yet heard  mr wilmot said something which the sharpest ears in the front row might perhaps have heard and which resulted in dr spencer standing up ethel hardly would have known who was speaking had her eyes been shut his voice was so different when raised and pitched so as to show its power and sweetness the fine polish of his manner was redoubled and every sentence had the most graceful turn it was like listening to a wellwritten book so smooth and so fluent and yet so earnesthis pictures of indian life so beautiful and his strong affection for the converts he described now and then making his eyes fill and his voice falter as if losing the thread of his studied compositiona true and dignified work of art that made dr may whisper to flora you see what he can do they would have given anything to have had him for a lecturer  with half a sigh ethel saw norman rise and step forward he began with eyes fixed on the ground and in a low modest tone to speak of the islands that harry had visited but gradually the poetic nature inherent in him gained the mastery and though his language was strikingly simple in contrast with dr spencers ornate periods and free from all trace of the lamp it rose in beauty and fervour at every sentence the feelings that had decided his lot gave energy to his discourse and repressed as they had been by reserve and diffidence now flowed forth and gave earnestness to natural gifts of eloquence of the highest order after his quiet unobtrusive beginning there was the more wonder to find how he seemed to raise up the audience with him in breathless attention as to a strain of sweet music carrying them without thought of the scene or of the speaker to the lovely isles and the inhabitants of noble promise but withering for lack of knowledge and finally closing his speech when they were wrought up to the highest pitch by an appeal that touched them all home for well did he know said he that the universal brotherhood was drawn closest in circles nearer home that beneath the shadow of their own old minster gladness and mourning floated alike for all and that all those who had shared in the welcome to one given back as it were from the grave would own the same debt of gratitude to the hospitable islanders  he ceased his father wiped his spectacles and almost audibly murmured bless him ethel who had sat like one enchanted forgetting who spoke forgetting all save the islanders half turned and met richards smiling eyes and his whisper i told you so  the impress of a man of true genius and power had been made throughout the whole assembly the archdeacon put norman out of countenance by the thanks of the meeting for his admirable speech and all the world except the oxford men were in a state of as much surprise as pleasure  splendid speaker norman may if he would oftener put himself out harvey anderson commented pity he has so many of the good doctors prejudices  well to be sure quoth mrs ledwich i knew mr norman was very clever but i declare i never thought of such as this i will try my poor utmost for those interesting natives  that youth has firstrate talents said lord cosham do you know what he is designed for i should like to bring him forward  ah said dr hoxton the year i sent off may and anderson was the proudest year of my life  upon my word declared mrs elwood that dr spencer is as good as a book but mr normani say father we will go without the new clock but well send somewhat to they men that built up the church and has no minister  a good move that said dr spencer worth at least twenty pounds that boy has the temperament of an orator if the morbid were but a grain less  oh margaret exclaimed blanche dr spencer made the finest speech you ever heard only it was rather tiresome and norman made everybody cryand mary worse than all  there is no speaking of it one should live such things not talk over them said meta rivers  margaret received the reports of the select few who visited her upstairs where she was kept quiet and only heard the hum of the swarm whom dr may in vehement hospitality had brought home to luncheon to ethels great dread lest there should not be enough for them to eat  margaret pitied her sisters but heard that all was going well that flora was taking care of the elders and harry and mary were making the younger fry very merry at the table on the lawn dr may had to start early to see a sick gardener at drydale before coming on to cocksmoor and came up to give his daughter a few minutes  we get on famously he said ethel does well when she is in for it like norman i had no notion what was in the lad they are perfectly amazed with his speech it seems hard to give such as he is up to those outlandish places but there his speech should have taught me betterones bestand now and then he seems my best  one comfort is said margaret smiling you would miss ethel more  gallant old king i am glad she has had her wish goodbye my margaret we will think of you i wish  i am very happy was margarets gentle reassurance the dear little daisy looks just as her godfather imagined her and happy was her face when her father quitted her  margarets next visitor was meta who came to reclaim her bonnet and with a merry smile to leave word that she was walking on to cocksmoor margaret remonstrated on the heat  let me alone said she making her pretty wilful gesture ethel and mary ought to have a lift and i have had no walking today  my dear you dont know how far it is you cant go alone  i am lying in wait for miss bracy or something innocent said meta in good timehere comes tom  tom entered declaring that he had come to escape from the clack downstairs  ill promise not to clack if you will be so kind as to take care of me to cocksmoor said meta  do you intend to walk  if you will let me be your companion  i shall be most happy said tom colouring with gratification such as he might not have felt had he known that he was chosen for his innocence  he took a passing glimpse at his necktie screwed up the nap of his glossy hat to the perfection of its central point armed himself with a knowing little stick and hurried his fair companion out by the back door as much afraid of losing the glory of being her sole protector as she was of falling in with an escort of as much consequence in other eyes as was mr thomas in his own  she knew him less than any of the rest and her first amusement was keeping silence to punish him for complaining of clack but he explained that he did not mean quiet sensible conversationhe only referred to those foolish womens raptures over the gabble they had been hearing at the town hall  she exclaimed whereupon he began to criticise the speakers with a good deal of acuteness exposing the weak points but magnanimously owning that it was tolerable for the style of thing and might go down at stoneborough  i wonder you did not stay away as harry did  i thought it would be marked observed the threadpaper tom as if he had been at least county member  you did quite right said meta really thinking so  i wished to hear dr spencer too said tom there is a man who does know how to speak he has seen something of the world and knows what he is talking of  but he did not come near norman  i hated listening to norman said tom why should he go and set his heart on those black savages  they are not savages in new zealand  they are all niggers together said tom vehemently i cannot think why norman should care for them more than for his own brothers and sisters all i know is that if i were my father i would never give my consent  it is lucky you are not said meta smiling defiance though a tear shone in her eye dr may makes the sacrifice with a free heart and willing mind  everybody goes and sacrifices somebody else grumbled tom  who are the victims now  all of us what are we to do without norman he is worth all of us put together and i meta was drawn to the boy as she had never been before as he broke off short his face full of emotion that made him remind her of his father  you might go out and follow in his steps said she as the most consoling hope she could suggest  not i dont you know what is to happen to me ah flora has not told you i thought she would not think it grand enough she talked about diplomacy  but what asked meta anxiously  only that i am to stick to the old shop said tom dont tell any one i would not have the fellows know it  do you mean your fathers profession  ay  oh tom you dont talk of that as if you despised it  if it is good enough for him it is good enough for me i suppose said tom i hate everything when i think of my brothers going over the world while i do what i will must be tied down to this slow place all the rest of my days  if you were away you would be longing after it  yes but i cant get away  surely if the notion is so unpleasant to you dr may would never insist  it is my free choice and thats the worst of it  i dont understand  dont you see norman told me it would be a great relief to him if i would turn my mind that wayand i cant go against norman i found he thought he must if i did not and you know he is fit for all sorts of things thatbesides he has a squeamishness about him that makes him turn white if one does but cut ones finger and how he would ever go through the hospitals  meta suspected that tom was inclined to launch into horrors so you wanted to spare him she said  ay and papa was so pleased by my offering that i cant say a word of the bore it is if i were to back out it would come upon aubrey and he is weakly and so young that he could not help my father for many years  meta was much struck at the motives that actuated the selfsacrifice veiled by the sullen manner which she almost began to respect what is done for such reasons must make you happy she said though there may be much that is disagreeable  not the study said tom the science is famous work i like what i see of it in my fathers books and theres a splendid skeleton at the hospital that i long to be at if it were not for stoneborough it would be all very well but if i should get on ever so well at the examinations it all ends there i must come back and go racing about this miserable circuit just like your gold pheasant rampaging in his cage seeing the same stupid people all my days  i think said meta in a low heartfelt voice it is a noble beautiful thing to curb down your ambition for such causes tom i like you for it  the glance of those beautiful eyes was worth having tom coloured a little but assumed his usual gruffness i cant bear sick people he said  it has always seemed to me said meta that few lives could come up to dr mays think of going about always watched for with hope often bringing gladness and relief if nothing else comfort and kindness his whole business doing good  one is paid for it said tom  nothing could ever repay dr may said meta can any one feel the fee anything but a mere form besides think of the numbers and numbers that he takes nothing from and oh to how many he has brought the most real good when they would have shut their doors against it in any other form oh tom i think none of you guess how every one feels about your father i recollect one poor woman saying after he had attended her brother he could not save his body but surely maam i think he was the saving of his soul  it is of no use to talk of my being like my father said tom  meta thought perhaps not but she was full of admiration of his generosity and said you will make it the same work of love and charity is the true glory  any inroad on toms reserved and depressed nature was a benefit and he was of an age to be susceptible of the sympathy of one so pretty and so engaging he had never been so much gratified or encouraged and wishing to prolong the teteatete he chose to take the short cut through the firplantations unfrequented on account of the perpendicular spiked railings that divided it from the lane  meta was hummingbird enough to be undismayed she put hand and foot wherever he desired flattered him by letting him handily help her up and bounded light as a feather down on the other side congratulating herself on the change from the dusty lane to the whispering pine woods between which wound the dark path bestrewn with brown slippery needleleaves and edged with the delicate feathering ling and tufts of soft grass  tom had miscalculated the chances of interruption meta was lingering to track the royal highway of some giant ants to their firleaf hillock when they were hailed from behind and her squire felt ferocious at the sight of norman and harry closing the perspective of firtrunks  hallo tom what a guide you are exclaimed norman that fence which even ethel and mary avoid  mary climbs like a cow and ethel like a fatherlonglegs said tom now meta flies like a bird  and tom helped me so cleverly said meta it was an excellent move to get into the shade and this delicious pine tree fragrance  halt said normanthis is too fast for meta  i cannot said harry i must get there in time to set dr spencers tackle to rights he is tolerably knowing about knots but there is a dodge beyond him come on tom  he drew on the reluctant etonian who looked repiningly back at the increasing distance between him and the other pair till a turn in the path cut off his view  i am afraid you do not know what you have undertaken said norman  i am a capital walker and i know or do not know how often ethel takes the same walk  ethel is no rule  she ought to be said meta to be like her has always been my ambition  circumstances have formed ethel  circumstances what an ambiguous word either providence pointing to duty or the world drawing us from it  steppingstones or stumblingblocks  and oh the difficult question when to bend them or to bend to them  there must be always some guiding said norman  i believe there is said meta but when trumpetpeals are ringing around it is hard to know whether one is really waiting beside the tent or only dawdling  it is great selfdenial in the immovable square not to join the charge said norman  yes but they being shot at are not deceiving themselves  i suppose selfdeception on those points is very common  especially among young ladies said meta i hear so much of what girls would do if they might or could that i long to see them like etheldo what they can and then it strikes me that i am doing the same living wilfully in indulgence and putting my trust in my own misgivings and discontent  i should have thought that discontent had as little to do with you as with any living creature  you dont know how i could growl said meta laughing though less from having anything to complain of than from having nothing to complain of  you mean he said pausing with a seriousness and hesitation that startled herdo you mean that this is not the course of life that you would choose  a sort of bashfulness made her put her answer playfully             all play and no work makes jack a mere toy   toys have a kindly mission and i may be good for nothing else but i would have rather been a coffeepot than a china shepherdess  the gaiety disconcerted him and he seemed to try to be silent or to reply in the same tone but he could not help returning to the subject then you find no charm in the refinements to which you have been brought up  only too much said meta  he was silent and fearing to have added to his finelady impression she resumed i mean that i never could dislike anything and kindness gives these things a soul but of course i should be better satisfied if i lived harder and had work to do  meta he exclaimed you tempt me very much would youno it is too unreasonable would you shareshare the work that i have undertaken  he turned aside and leaned against a tree as if not daring to watch the effect of the agitated words that had broken from him she had little imagined whither his last sayings had been tending and stood still breathless with the surprise  forgive me he said hastily it was very wrong i never meant to have vexed you by the betrayal of my vain affection  he seemed to be going and this roused her stay norman exclaimed she why should it vex me i should like it very much indeed  he faced suddenly towards hermeta meta is it possible do you know what you are saying  i think i do  you must understand me said norman striving to speak calmly you have beenwords will not express what you have been to me for years past but i thought you too far beyond my hopes i knew i ought to be removed from youi believed that those who are debarred from earthly happiness are marked for especial tasks i never intended you to know what actuated me and now the work is undertaken andand i cannot turn back he added quickly as if fearing himself  no indeed was her steady reply  then i may believe it cried norman you doyou willyou deliberately choose to share it with me  i will try not to be a weight on you answered the young girl with a sweet mixture of resolution and humility it would be the greatest possible privilege i really do not think i am a fine lady ingrain and you will teach me not to be too unworthy  i oh meta you know not what i am yet with you with you to inspire to strengthen to cheermeta meta life is so much changed before me that i cannot understand it yetafter the long dreary hopelessness  i cant think why meta had half said when feminine dignity checked the words consciousness and confusion suddenly assailed her dyed her cheeks crimson and stifled her voice  it was the same with norman and bashfulness making a sudden prey of bothon they went under its dominion in a condition partaking equally of discomfort and felicity dreading the sound of their own voices afraid of each others faces feeling they were treating each other very strangely and ungratefully yet without an idea what to say next or the power of speaking first and therefore pacing onwards looking gravely straight along the path as if to prevent the rabbits and foxgloves from guessing that anything had been passing between them  dr may had made his call at drydale and was driving up a rough lane between furzy banks leading to cocksmoor when he was aware of a tall gentleman on one side of the road and a little lady on the other with the whole space of the carttrack between them advancing soberly towards him  hallo why meta norman what brings you here where are you going  norman perceived that he had turned to the left instead of to the right and was covered with shame  that is all your wits are good for it is well i met you or you would have led poor meta a pretty dance you will know better than to trust yourself to the mercies of a scholar another time let me give you a lift  the courteous doctor sprang out to hand meta in but something made him suddenly desire adams to drive on and then turning round to the two young people he said oh  yes said norman taking her hand and drawing her towards him  what meta my pretty one is it really so is he to be happy after all are you to be a daisy of my own  if you will let me murmured meta clinging to her kind old friend  no flower on earth could come so naturally to us said dr may and dear child at last i may venture to tell you that you have a sanction that you will value more than mine yes my dear on the last day of your dear fathers life when some foreboding hung upon him he spoke to me of your prospects and singled out this very norman as such as he would prefer  metas tears prevented all save the two little words thank you but she put out her hand to norman as she still rested on the doctors arm more as if he had been her mother than normans father  did he from norman was equally inexpressive of the almost incredulous gratitude and tenderness of his feeling  it would not bear talking over at that moment and dr may presently broke the silence in a playful tone so meta good men dont like heiresses  quite true said meta it was very much against me  or it may be the other way said norman  eh good men dont like heiressesheres a man who likes an heiresstherefore heres a man that is not good ah ha meta you can see that is false logic though ive forgotten mine and pray miss what are we to say to your uncle  he cannot help it said meta quickly  ha said the doctor laughing we remember our twentyone years do we  i did not meani hope i said nothing wrong said meta in blushing distress only after what you said i can care for nothing else  if i could only thank him said norman fervently  i believe you know how to do that my boy said dr may looking tenderly at the fairy figure between them and ending with a sigh remembering perhaps the sense of protection with which he had felt another margaret lean on his arm  the clatter of horses hoofs caused meta to withdraw her hand and norman to retreat to his own side of the lane as sir henry walkinghame and his servant overtook them  we will be in good time for the proceedings called out the doctor tell them we are coming  i did not know you were walking said sir henry to meta  it is pleasant in the plantations dr may answered for her but i am afraid we are late and our punctual friends will be in despair will you kindly say we are at hand  sir henry rode on finding that he was not to be allowed to walk his horse with them and that miss rivers had never looked up  poor sir henry said dr may  he has no right to be surprised said meta very low  and so you were marching right upon drydale continued dr may not able to help laughing it was a happy dispensation that i met you  oh i am so glad of it said meta  though to be sure you were disarming suspicion by so cautiously keeping the road between you i should never have guessed what you had been at  there was a little pause then meta said rather tremulously pleasei think it should be known at once  our idle deeds confessed without loss of time miss  norman came across the path saying meta is rightit should be known  i dont think uncle cosham would object especially hearing it while he is here said metaand if he knew what you told us  he goes tomorrow does he not said dr may  a silence of perplexity ensued meta brave as she was hardly knew her uncle enough to volunteer and norman was privately devising a beginning by the way of george when dr may said well since it is not a case for putting ethel in the forefront i must een get it over for you i suppose  oh thank you they cried both at once feeling that he was the proper person in every way and norman added the sooner the better if meta  oh yes yes the sooner the better exclaimed meta and let me tell florapoor dear florashe is always so kind  a testimony that was welcome to dr may who had once at least been under the impression that flora courted sir henrys attentions to her sisterinlaw  further consultation was hindered by tom and blanche bursting upon them from the common both echoing normans former reproach of a pretty guide and while blanche explained the sufferings of all the assembly at their tardiness tom without knowing it elucidated what had been a mystery to the doctor namely how they ever met by his indignation at normans having assumed the guidance for which he was so unfit  a shocking leader meta will never trust him again said dr may  still blanche thought them not nearly sufficiently sensible of their enormities and preached eagerly about their danger of losing standingroom when they emerged on the moor and beheld a crowd above whose heads rose the apex of a triangle formed by three poles sustaining a rope and huge stone  here comes dr spencer she said i hope he will scold you  whatever dr spencer might have suffered he was far too polite to scold and a glance between the two physicians ended in a merry twinkle of his bright eyes  this way he said we are all ready  but wheres my little daisy said dr may  youll see her in a minute she is as good as gold  he drew them on up the bankpeople making way for themtill he had stationed them among the others of their own party beside the deep trench that traced the foundation around a space that seemed far too small  nearly at the same moment began the soft clear sound of chanting wafted upon the wind then dying awaycarried off by some eddying breeze then clear and coming nearer and nearer                i will not suffer mine eyes to sleep                 nor mine eyelids to slumber              neither the temples of my head to take any rest              until i find out a place for the temple of the lord              an habitation for the mighty god of jacob   few who knew the history of cocksmoor could help glancing towards the slight girl who stood with bent head her hand clasped over little aubreys while all that was not prayer and thanksgiving in her mind was applying the words to him whose head rested in the pacific isle while in the place which he had chosen was laid the foundation of the temple that he had given unto the lord  there came forth the procession the minster choristers dr spencer as architect and in her white dress little gertrude led between harry and hector margarets special choice for the occasion and followed by the stoneborough clergy                let thy priests be clothed with righteousness   it came in well with the gentle meek steadfast face of the young curate of cocksmoor as he moved on in his white robe and the sunlight shone upon his fair hair and calm brow thankful for the past and hoping more than fearing for the future  the prayers were said and there was a pause while dr spencer and the foreman advanced to the machine and adjusted it the two youths then led forward the little girl her innocent face and large blue eyes wearing a look of childish obedient solemnity only half understanding what she did yet knowing it was something great  it was very pretty to see her in the midst of the little gathering round the foundation the sturdy workman smiling over his hod of mortar dr spencers silver locks touching her flaxen curls as he held the shining trowel to her and harrys bright head and hardy face as he knelt on one knee to guide the little soft hand while hector stood by still and upright his eyes fixed far away as if his thoughts were roaming to the real founder  the victoria coins were placedgertrude scooped up the mass of mortar and spread it about with increasing satisfaction as it went so smoothly and easily prolonging the operation till harry drew her back while slowly down creaked the ponderous cornerstone into the bed that she had prepared for it and with a good will she gave three taps on it with her trowel  harry had taken her hand when at the sight of dr may she broke from him and as if taking sudden fright at her own unwonted part ran at full speed straight up to her father and clung to him hiding her face as he raised her in his arms and kissed her  meanwhile the strain arose                thou heavenly new jerusalem              vision of peace in prophets dream              with living stones built up on high              and rising to the starry sky   the blessing of peace seemed to linger softly and gently in the fragrant summer breeze and there was a pause ere the sounds of voices awoke again  etheldred mr wilmot stood beside her ere going to unrobe in the schooletheldred you must once let me say god bless you for this  as she knelt beside her sisters sofa on her return home margaret pressed something into her hand if you please dearest give this to dr spencer and ask him to let it be set round the stem of the chalice she whispered  ethel recognised alan ernescliffes pearl hoop the betrothal ring and looked at her sister without a word  i wish it said margaret gently i shall like best to know it there  so margaret joined in alans offering and ethel dared say no more as she thought how the relic of a frail love lost was becoming the token of endless love begun there was more true union in this than in clinging to the mere tangible emblemfor broken and weak is all affection that is not knit together above in the one infinite love     chapter xxiii         of lowly fields you think no scorn      yet gayest gardens would adorn         and grace wherever set      home seated in your lowly bower      or wedded a transplanted flower         i bless you margaretcharles lamb   george rivers had an antipathy to ladies last words keeping the horses standing and his wife and sister dutifully seated themselves in the carriage at once without an attempt to linger  four of the young gentlemen were to walk across to abbotstoke and dine at the grange and tom who reasoning from analogy had sent on his black tie and agate studs was so dismally disconcerted on finding that norman treated his own going as a matter of course that richard whose chief use of his right of primogeniture was to set himself aside discovered that he was wanted at home and that tom would be much better at the grange offering at the same time to send normans dressing things by dr spencer  which observed thomas he would never have recollected for himself  tom would have had to lend him the precious studshe would not have had them who would wear imitation i say tom what did you give for them better ask what the jew gave for them that bought them at windsor fair not a bad imitation eitherpity they werent malachite but no doubt the jew thought green would be personal as if they had any business to talk who didnt know a respectable stud when they saw itharry especially with his hat set on the back of his head like a sailor on the stagea leap to set it to rightsa skirmish knocking tom nearly into the ditch fine experience of the stageall came from windsor fair ay hector might talk but didnt he pay a shilling to see the irish giant he wouldnt confess but it was a famous take ingiant had potatoes in his shoes not he he was seven feet ten high ay when he stood upon a stoolhector would swallow anythingeven the lady of a million postage stamps had not stuck in his throathe had made margaret collect for her and had not tom himself got a bottle of ointment to get the red out of his hairgreat fury his hair wasnt reddidnt want to change the colournot half so red as hectors own what was it then lively auburn but for fear of normans losing his bearings harry would fetch a carrot to compare better colour than theirs could ever be then what was the ointment for to produce whiskers that was the reason tom oiled himself like a loyalty islanderhis hair was so shiny that harry recommended a topknot like theirs etc  norman was like the others in such towering glee and took so full a share of the witticisms that were the more noisily applauded the worse they were that harry suggested that old june had lost his way and found his spirits in drydalehe must have met with a private grogshop in the plantationswould not tom confessnot he it was all in private he thought it was laughinggas or the reaction of being fried all the morning holding forth in that town hall he had longed to make a speech himselfno end of the good it would have done the old stagers to come out with something to the purpose what would old hoxton have thought of it     they shall dive for alligators catch the wild goats by the beard   whistle to the cockatoos and mock the hairyfaced baboon   worship mighty mumbo jumbo in the mountains of the moon   i myself in far timbuctoo leopards blood shall daily quaff   ride a tiger hunting mounted on a thoroughbred giraffe   not you tom cried hector     you the swell the eton fellow  you to seek such horrid places   you to haunt with squalid negroes blubber lips and monkey faces   fool again the dream the fancy dont i know the words are mad   for you count the gray barbarian lower than the brocas cad   nay it is the consequence of misanthropy at the detection of the frauds of unsophisticated society said norman                       the edge of life is rusted  the agate studs and whisker ointment left him very much disgusted   perhaps it was miss rivers forsaking him was not that rather spiderhearted tom  come harry it is time to have done we are getting into civilised societyheres abbotstoke  poor norman he is very far gone he takes that scarecrow for civilised society  much better clothed than the society you have been accustomed to july what a prize his wardrobe would be to the black prince dont insult your betters which the scarecrow or the black prince  norman tried to call his companions to order for they were close upon the village and he began to tax himself with unbecoming levity the effect of spirits pitched rather low which did not easily find their balance under unwonted exhilaration but harrys antics were less easily repressed than excited and if tom had not heard the grange clock strike halfpast six and had not been afraid of not having time to array himself and watch over harrys neckcloth they would hardly have arrived in reasonable time dr may had gone home and there was no one in the drawingroom but as norman was following the boys upstairs flora opened her sittingroom door and attracted his attention by silently putting her cold fingers into his hand and drawing him into the room  dear norman this is pleasant she said affectionately but in a voice so sunken that all gladness seemed to be dead within and the effect was far more mournful than if she had not attempted to smile congratulation  i will give you till dr spencer comes she said then norman can dress and you must be a good child and come down to me  the playfulness ill suited the wan worn face that seemed to have caught a gray tint from her rich poplin her full toilet making the contrast almost more painful and as she closed the door her brother could only exclaim poor flora  she is so kind said the voice of the white figure that moved towards him oh if we could comfort her  i trust to her own kindness working comfort to her at last said norman but is she often thus  whenever she is not bearing up for georges sake said meta she never says anything when she is alone with me only she does not struggle with her looks  it must be very trying for you  nay i feel grateful to her for even so far relaxing the restraint if i could but do her any good  you cannot help doing her good said norman  meta sighed and shook her head slightly as she said she is so gentle and considerate i think this has been no fresh pain to her today but i cannot tell the whole day has been a strange intermixture  the two strands of joy and grief have been very closely twisted said norman that rose is shedding its fragrant leaves in its glory and there is much that should have chastened the overflowing gladness of today  as i was thinking whispered meta venturing nearer to him and looking into his face with the sweet reliance of union in thought she meant him to proceed but he paused saying you were thinking  i had rather hear it from you  was it not that we were taught today what is enduring and gives true permanence and blessedness to suchto what there was between ernescliffe and margaret  her dewy eyes and face of deep emotion owned that he had interpreted her thought  theirs would indeed be a disheartening example he said if it did not show the strength and peace that distance sickness death cannot destroy  yes to see that church making margaret happy as she lies smiling on her couch is a lesson of lessons  that what is hallowed must be blest said norman whatever the sundry and manifold changes  each was far too humble to deny aloud any inequality with the goodness of alan and margaret knowing that it would be at once disputed trusting to time to prevent the overestimate and each believing the other was the one to bring the blessing  but meta said norman have you heard nothing ofof the elders  oh yes said meta smiling have not you  i have seen no one  i have said meta merrily uncle cosham is delighted that speech of yours has captivated him he calls me a wise little woman to have found out your firstrate abilities theres for you sir  i dont understand it surely he must be aware of my intentions  he said nothing about them but of course dr may must have mentioned them  i should have thought so but i cannot suppose  that he would be willing to let me go said meta but then you know he cannot help it added she with a roguish look at finding herself making one of her saucy independent speeches  i believe you are taking a wouldbe missionary instead of norman may he answered with a sort of teasing sweetness  all wouldbe missionaries did not make dear papa so fond of them said meta very low and you would not be norman may without such purposes  the purpose was not inspired at first by the highest motive said norman but it brought me peace and after the kind of dedication that i inwardly made of myself in my time of trouble it would take some weighty reason amounting to a clear duty or physical impossibility to make me think i ought to turn back i believethe tears rose to his eyes and he brought out the words with difficultythat if this greatest of all joys were likely to hinder me from my calling i ought to seek strength to regard it as a temptation and to forgo it  you ought if it were so said meta nevertheless holding him tighter i could not bear to keep back a soldier if this were last year and i had any tie or duty here it would be very hard but no one needs me and if the health i have always had be continued to me i dont think i shall be much in the way theredrawing back a little and trying to laugh off her feelingonly tell me at once if you think me still too much of a fine lady  iyoua fine lady did anything ever give you the impression that i did  i shall not get poor harry into a scrape shall i he told me that you said so last spring and i feared you judged me too truly  after a few exclamations of utter surprise it flashed on norman i know i knowharry interpreted my words in his own blunt fashion  then you did say something like it  no butbutin short meta these sailors imaginations go to great lengths harry had guessed more than i knew myself before he had sailed and taxed me with it it was a subject i could not bear then and i answered that you were too far beyond my hopes  six years ago said meta slowly blushing deeper and deeper some eyes saw it all that time and youand she added laughing though rather tearfully i should never have known it if tom had not taken me through the plantations  not if i had not discovered that your preferences did not lie  among boudoirs and balls said meta harry was right you thought me a fine lady after all  the gay taunt was cut short by a tap at the door and flora looked in  dr spencer has brought your things norman i am sorry to disturb youbut come down metai ran away very uncivilly to fetch you i hope it is not too cruel as she drew metas arm into her own and added i have not been able speak to george  meta suspected that in the wish to spare her flora had abstained from seeking him  the evening went off like any other eveningpeople ate and talked thought mrs rivers looking very ill and miss rivers very prettyflora forced herself into being very friendly to sir henry commiserating the disappointment to which she had led him and she hoped that he suspected the state of affairs though tom no longer supplanted by his elder brother pursued meta into the sheltered nook where flora had favoured her seclusion to apologise for having left her to the guidance of poor norman whose head was with the blackamoors it was all harrys fault  nonsense tom said harry dont you think norman is better company than you any day  then why did you not walk him off instead of me said tom turning round sharply  out of consideration for meta she will tell you that she was very much obliged to me  harry checked himself for meta was colouring so painfully that his own sunburned face caught the glow he pushed toms slight figure aside with a commanding move of his broad hand and said i beg your pardon upon my word though i dont know what for  nor i said meta rallying herself and smiling you have no pardon to beg you will know it all tomorrow  then i know it now said harry sheltering his face by leaning over the back of a chair and taming the hearty gaiety of his voice well done meta theres nothing like old june in all the world you may take my word for it and i knew you would have the sense to find it out  they were well out of sight and meta only answered by a good tight squeeze of his kind hand between both her own tom suddenly recovering from his displeasure at being thrust aside whisked round dropped on a footstool before meta looked up in her face and said hallo in such utter amazement that there was nothing for it but to laugh more uncontrollably than was convenient come along tom said harry pulling him up by force she does not want any of your nonsense we will not plague her now  thank you harry said meta i cannot talk rationally just yet dont think me unkind tom  tom sat in a sort of trance all the rest of the evening  lord cosham talked to norman who felt as if he were being patronised on false pretences drew into his shell and displayed none of his firstrate abilities  dr spencer discussed his architecture with the archdeacon but his black eyes roamed heedfully after the young gentleman and lady in the opposite corners of the room and as he drove home afterwards with the youths he hummed scraps of scottish songs and indulged in silent smiles  those at home had been far more demonstrative dr may had arrived declaring himself the proudest doctor in her majestys dominions and ethel needed nothing but his face to explain why and tell her that dear old junes troubles were over and their pretty little meta was their owna joy little looked for to attend their foundationstone  the dreaded conference with lord cosham had proved highly gratifying there might be something in the fact that he could not help it which assisted in his ready acquiescence but he was also a sensible rightminded man who thought that the largeness of metas fortune was no reason that it should be doubled considered that in the matter of connection the may family had the advantage and saw in norman a young man whom any one might have pleasure in bringing forward oxford had established confidence both in his character and talents and his speech had been such as to impress an experienced man like lord cosham with an opinion of his powers that prepared a welcome for him such as no one could have dared to expect his lordship thought his niece not only likely to be happier but to occupy a more distinguished position with such a man as norman may than with most persons of readymade rank and fortune  the blushing and delighted dr may had thought himself bound to speak of his sons designs but he allowed that the project had been formed under great distress of mind and when he saw it treated by so good a man as a mere form of disappointed love he felt himself reprieved from the hardest sacrifice that he had ever been called on to make loved little meta the better for restoring his son and once more gave a free course to the aspirations that normans brilliant boyhood had inspired richard took the same view and the evening passed away in an argumentas if any one had been disputing with themthe father reasoning loud the son enforcing it low that it had become normans duty to stay at home to take care of meta whose father would have been horrified at his taking her to the antipodes they saw mighty tasks for her fortune to effect in england they enhanced each others anticipations of normans career overthrew abuses before him heaped distinctions upon him and had made him prime minister and settled his policy before ten oclock brought their schemes to a close  mary gazed and believed margaret lay still and gently assented ethel was silent at first and only when the fabric became extremely airy and magnificent put in her word with a vehement dash at the present abuses which grieved her spirit above all and whether vulnerable or not norman was to dispose of like so many giants before mr greatheart  she went upstairs unable to analyse her sentiments to be spared the separation would be infinite reliefall this prosperity made her exultthe fair girl at the grange was the delight of her heart and yet there was a sense of falling off she disliked herself for being either glad or sorry and could have quarrelled with the lovers for perplexing her feelings so uncomfortably  though she sat up till the party returned she was inclined to be supposed in bed so as to put off the moment of meeting but margaret who she hoped was asleep said from her pillow ask dear norman to let me give him one kiss  she ran down headlong clutched norman as he was taking off his greatcoat told him that margaret wanted him and dragged him up without letting him go till she reached the first landing where she stood still saying breathlessly new zealand  if i wished to fail she would keep me to it  i beg your pardon said ethel claiming heartily his caress i was wrong to doubt either of you now i know how to feel but margaret must not wait  the happy youth in the flush of love and joy bent gently almost tearfully down in silence to the white form half seen in the twilight whose hopes had fleeted away from earth and who was calmly softly gliding after them hardly a word was uttered but of all the many heartfelt thoughts that had passed while the face was pressed into margarets pillow and her sympathising arms round the neck surely none was ever deeper than was his prayer and vow that his affection should be like hers unearthly and therefore enduring  the embrace was all margaret must not be agitated and indeed the events of the day had been too much for her and the ensuing morning brought the fluttering of heart and prostration of strength no longer a novelty and occasion of immediate terror but the token of the waning power of life  till she was better her father had no thoughts for aught else but as with many another invalid the relief from present distress was as cheering as if it had been recovery and ere night her placid look of repose had returned and she was devising pretty greetings for her newest daisy  perhaps the sobering effect of these hours of anxiety was in normans favour on entering into conversation with his father those visions which had had their swing the night before belonged to the earlier more untamed period of dr mays life and had melted away in the dim room made sacred by lingering mementos of his wife and in the sound of that panting breath and throbbing heart his vehemence had been after all chiefly against his own misgivings and when he heard of his sons resolution and metas more than acquiescence he was greatly touched and recurred to his kind sorrowful promise that he would never be a stumblingblock in the path of his children still he owned himself greatly allured by the career proposed by lord cosham and thought norman should consider the opportunities of doing good in perhaps a still more important and extensive field than that which he had chosen  time was that i should have grasped at such a prospect said norman but i am not the man for it i have too much ambition and too little humility you know father how often you have had to come to my rescue when i was running after success as my prime object  vanity fair is a dangerous place but you who have sound principles and pure motives  how long would my motives be pure said norman rivalry and partyspirit make me distrust my motives and then my principles feel the shock other men are marked by station for such trials and may be carried through them but i am not  yet some of these men are far from your equals  not perhaps in speechifying said norman smiling but in steadiness of aim in patience in callousness in seeing one side of the question at once  you judge rightly for your own peace you will be the happier i always doubted whether you had nerve to make your wits available  it may be cowardice said norman but i think not i could burn for the combat and if i had no scruples i could enjoy bearing down such as  of course dr may burst in with a political name andi wish you were at him  whether i could is another matter said norman laughing but the fact is that i stand pledged and if i embraced what to me would be a worldly career i should be running into temptation and could not expect to be shielded from it  your old rule said dr may seek to be less rather than more but there is another choice why not a parsonage at home  pleasant parishes are not in the same need said norman  i wonder what poor old rivers would say to you if he knew what you want to do with his daughter brought up as she has beento expose her to the roughness of a colonial life such as i should hesitate about for your sisters  it is her own ardent desire  true but are girlish enthusiasms to be trusted take care norman take care of hershe is a bit of the choicest porcelain of human kind and not to be rudely dealt with  no indeed but she has the brave enterprising temper to which i fully believe that actual work in a good cause is far preferable to what she calls idleness i do not believe that we are likely to meet with more hardship than she would gladly encounter and would almostnay quite enjoy  you do not know what your aunt has had to go through  a few years make a great difference in a colony still it may be right for me to go out alone and judge for her but we shall know more if my aunt comes home  yes i could trust a good deal to her she has much of your mothers sense well you must settle it as you can with metas people i do not think they love the pretty creature better than i have done from the first minute we saw herdont you remember it norman  remember it do i not from the frosted cedar downwards it was the first gem of spring in that dreary winter what a fairyland the grange was to me  you may nearly say the same of me confessed dr may smiling the sight of that happy little sunny spirit full of sympathy and sweetness always sent me brighter on my way wherever you may be norman i am glad you have her being one apt to need a pocket sunbeam  i hope my tendencies are in no danger of depressing her said norman startled if so  no such thingshe will make a different man of you you have been depressed bythat early shock and the gap at our own firesideall that we have shared together norman to see you begin on a new score with a bright home of your own is the best in this world that i could wish for you though i shall live over my own twentytwo years in thinking of you and that sweet little fairy but now go normanshe will be watching for you and news of margaret give her all sorts of love from me  norman fared better with the uncle than he had expected lord cosham as a philanthropist could not with any consistency set his face against missions even when the cost came so near home and he knew that opposition made the like intentions assume a heroic aspect that maintained them in greater force he therefore went over the subject in a calm dispassionate manner which exacted full and grateful consideration from the young man  the final compromise was that nothing should be settled for a year during which norman would complete his course of study and the matter might be more fully weighed mrs arnott would probably return and bring experience and judgment which would or ought to decide the questionthough meta had a secret fear that it might render it more complicated than ever however the engagement and the mission views had both been treated so much more favourably than could have been hoped that they felt themselves bound to be patient and forbearing as meta said if they showed themselves wilful children they certainly did not deserve to be trusted anywhere  lord cosham made his niece listen to a kind exhortation not to press her influence towards a decision that might be repented when too late to be repaired without a degrading sense of failureputting her in mind of the privations that would lose romance by their pettiness and which money could not remedy and very sensibly representing that the effect of these on temper and health was to be duly considered as a serious impediment to usefulness  it would be worse for him alone said meta  that is not certain said her uncle a brokendown wife is a terrible drag  i know it is so said meta firmly but risks must be run and he is willing to take the chance i do not think it can be presumption for you know i am strong and dr may would say if he could not warrant me i fancy household work would be more satisfactory and less tiring than doing a season thoroughly and i mean to go through a course of finchley manuals in preparation  i hope you know what you are doing sighed her uncle you see it all couleur de rose  i think not it is because it is not couleur de rose that i am so much bent upon it i have had plenty of that all my life i expect much that will be very disagreeable and not at all heroic but if i can only make norman think it fun that will be one purpose answered i do believe he will do his work better for having me and at least i shall pay his passage  her uncle shook his head but did not try to say any more george had begun by loud exclamations against the project in which he was vehemently abetted by tom who primed him with all sorts of outrageous abuse of the niggers and cannibals who would make normans coats out of all shape and devour little meta at a mouthfulpredictions which meta accepted most merrily talking of herself so resignedly as bound upon a spit and calling out to be roasted slower and faster that she safely conducted off their opposition by way of a standing joke as to normans coats she threatened to make them herself and silenced tom for ever by supposing in malicious simplicity that he must be able to teach her the most unexceptional cut  flora kept her opinions to herself only once when urged to remonstrate she said i could noti would not  she was gently and touchingly considerate towards the lovers silently but unobtrusively obviating all that could jar on their feelings and employing her exquisite tact in the kindest manner  she released meta from the expedition to ryde silencing scruples on the one hand by a suggestion of poor sir henry and on the other by offering to exchange her for mary the first proposal made mary take such a spring in her chair with eyes so round and cheeks so red and such a shriek about harry and the bucephalus that no one could have borne to say one word in opposition even if it had not been the opinion of the council that sea air would best repair marys strength  ethel had some private fears of a scene since it was one of miss bracys idiosyncrasies to be hurt whenever mary was taken out of her hands and she went to announce the design in dread lest this shock should destroy the harmony that had prevailed for many months nay she almost believed since the loss of the alcestis had been known  she was agreeably surprised miss bracy thought mary in need of the change and discussed both her and blanche in so pleasant and sensible a manner that ethel was quite relieved she partook in marys anticipations of pleasure forwarded her preparations and was delighted with her promise of letterspromises that mary bestowed so largely in the fullness of her heart that there were fears lest her whole time should be spent in writing  her soft heart indulged in a shower of tears when she wished them all goodbye and ethel and blanche found the house was very empty without her but that was only till meta came in from a walk with norman and under the plea of trying to supply marys place did the work of five maries and a great deal besides  nothing could be happier than metas visit brightening the house so that the mays thought they had never known half her charms helping whatever was going on yet ready to play with daisy tell stories to aubrey hear toms confidences talk to margaret read with norman and teach richard singing for his school children the only vexation was that every one could not always engross her entirely and dr may used to threaten that they should never spare her to that longlegged fellow norman  she had persuaded bellairs to go and take care of flora and mary instead of the french maida plan which greatly satisfied margaret who had never liked the looks of coralie and which meta held to be a grand emancipation she persuaded old nurse to teach her to be useful and margaret used to declare that she witnessed scenes as good as a play in her room where the little dexterous scholar apparently in jest but really in sober earnest wiled instruction from the old woman and made her experiments between smiles and blushes and merrily glorying in results that promised that she would be a notable housewife whether it were novelty or not she certainly had an aptitude and delight in domestic details such as ethel never could attain and as dr may said the one performed by a little finger what the other laboured at with a great mind  in the schoolroom meta was as highly appreciated she found an hour for helping blanche in her music and for giving what was still more useful an interest and spirit to studies where it must be owned poor good mary had been a dead weight she enlivened miss bracy so much and so often contrived a walk or a talk with her that the saucy blanche told hector that she thought ethel would be quite secondfiddle with miss bracy  no such thing miss bracys great delight was in having a listener for her enthusiasm about miss ethel she had been lately having a correspondence with a former schoolfellow who was governess in a family less considerate than the mays and who poured out in her letters feelings much like those with which miss bracy had begun  nothing could be more salutary than to find herself repeating all ethels pieces of advice and one day when her friend had been more distressed than usual she called ethel herself to consult on her answer owning how much she was reminded of herself  indeed she added i am afraid it would only tease you to hear how much i am indebted to your decision and kindness  nay said ethel laughing her awkward laugh you have often had to forget my savage ways  pray dont say that  i think said ethel breaking in the philosophy is this i believe that it is a trying life i know teaching takes a great deal out of one and loneliness may cause tendencies to dwell on fancied slights in trifles that might otherwise be hurried over but i think the thing is to pass them over and make a conscience of turning ones mind to something fresh  as you made me do when you brought me amusing books and taught me botany  and still more when you took to working for the infant school yes i think the way to be happy and useful is to get up many interests so as to be fresh and vigorous and think not at all of personalities theres a truism  very true though said miss bracy indeed all your kindness and consideration would never have done me half the good they have dear miss ethel if you had not taught me that referring all to ones own feelings and self is the way to be unhappy  just so said ethel it is the surest way for any one to be miserable  if i could only persuade poor dear ellen to think that even if a slight were real it ought to be borne forgivingly and not brooded over ah you are laughing perhaps you have said the same about me  you would forgive it now i think said ethel  i never thought i did not forgive i did not see that brooding over vexations was not pardoning them i have told her so now and oh if she could but have seen how true sorrows are borne here she would be cured like me of making imaginary ones  none could help being better for living with papa said ethel  ethel made miss bracy happy by a kiss before she left her it was a cheering belief that whatever the future trials of her life might be the gentle little lady would meet them with a healthier mind more vigorous in overlooking troubles and without punctilious sensitiveness on the lookout for affronts believing all things bearing all things hoping all things enduring all things would be to her the true secret of serenity of spirits  ethel might not have been blameless or consistent in her dealings in this difficult intercourse but her kind heart upright intention and force of character had influence far beyond her own perception indeed she knew not that she had personal influence at all but went on in her own straightforward humility     chapter xxiv         enough of foresight sad too much       of retrospect have i      and well for me that i sometimes       can put those feelings by       there speaks the man we knew of yore       well pleased i hear them say      such was he in his lighter moods       before our heads were gray       buoyant he was in spirit quick       of fancy light of heart      and care and time and change have left       untouchd his better partsouthey   etheldred may and meta rivers were together in the drawingroom the timepiece pointed towards ten oclock but the teathings were on the table prepared for a meal the lamp shone with a sort of consciousness and ethel moved restlessly about sometimes settling her tea equipage sometimes putting away a stray book or resorting by turns to her book or to work a red and gold scroll on coarse canvas on the other end of which meta was employed  nervous ethel said meta looking up with a merry provoking smile knowing how much the word would displease  that is for you retorted ethel preferring to carry the war into the enemys quarters what dont you know that prudent people say that your fate depends on her report  at least said meta laughing she is a living instance that every one is not eaten up and we shall see if she fulfils toms prediction of being tattooed or of having a slice out of the fattest part of her cheek  i know very well said ethel the worst she said it would be the more you would go  not quite that said meta blushing and looking down  come dont be deceitful said ethel you know very well that you are still more bent on it than you were last year  to be sure i am said meta looking up with a sudden beamy flash of her dark eyes norman and i know each other so much better now she added rather falteringly  ay i know you are ready to go through thick and thin and that is why i give my consent and approbation you are not to be stopped for nonsense  not for nonsense certainly said meta butand her voice became tremulousif dr may deliberately said it would be wrong and that i should be an encumbrance and perplexity i am making up my mind to the chance  but what would you do asked ethel  i dont know you should not ask such questions ethel  well it wont happen so it is no use to talk about it said ethel fancy my having made you cry  very silly of me said meta brightening and laughing but sighing i am only afraid mrs arnott may think me individually unfit for the kind of life as if i could not do what other women can do i look so  you look as if you were meant to be put under a glass case said ethel surveying the little elegant figure whose great characteristic was a look of exquisite finish not only in the features and colouring the turn of the head and the shape of the small rosytipped fingers but in everything she wore from the braids of black silk hair to the little shoe on her foot and even in the very lightness and gaiety of her movements  oh ethel cried meta springing up in dismay and looking at herself in the glass what is the matter with me do tell me  youll never get rid of it said ethel unless you get yourself tattooed even separation from bellairs hasnt answered and after all i dont think it would be any satisfaction to norman or papa i assure you meta whatever you may think of it it is not so much bother to be prettier than needful as it is to be uglier than needful  what is needful said meta much amused  i suppose to be like mary so that nobody should take notice of one but that ones own people may have the satisfaction of saying she is pleasing or she is in good looks i think gertrude will come to that thats one comfort  that is your own case ethel i have heard those very things said of you  of my hatchet face said ethel contemptuously some one must have been desperately bent on flattering the members family  i could repeat more said meta if i were to go back to the commemoration and to the day you went home  ethel crimsoned and made a sign with her hand exclaiming hark  it went past  it was the omnibus she must be walking down ethel breathed short and wandered aimlessly about meta put her arm round her waist  i did not think this would be so much to you she said  oh meta it seems like dear mamma coming to see how we have been going on and then papa i wish i had gone up to the station with him  he has richard  ay but i am afraid margaret is listening and will be restless and have a palpitation and i cant go and see or i shall disturb her oh i wish it were over  meta stroked her and soothed her and assured her that all would do well and presently they heard the click of the door ethel flew into the hall where she stopped short her heart beating high at the sound of overpoweringly familiar accents  she was almost relieved by detecting otherwise little resemblance the height was nearly the same but there was not the plump softness of outline mrs arnott was small thin brisk and active with a vivacious countenance once evidently very fair and pretty but aged and worn by toil not trouble for the furrows were the traces of smiles around her merry mouth and beautiful blue eyes that had a tendency lo laugh and cry both at once dr may who had led her into the light seemed to be looking her all over while richard was taking the wraps from her and ethel tried to encourage herself to go forward  ay said the doctor kissing her i see you flora now i have found you again  i found you as soon as i heard your voice richard said she and now for the bairnies  here is one but there is but a poor show forthcoming tonight do you know her  there was an unspeakable joy in being pressed in aunt floras arms like a returning beam from the sunshine of seven years ago  this must be ethel my dear how you tower above meyou that i left in arms and as she advanced into the drawingroomwhy surely this is not margaret  a margaretnot the margaret i wish i were said meta as mrs arnott stood with an arm on her shoulder in the midst of an embrace dr may enjoying her perplexity and metas blushes see flora these black locks never belonged to calton hill daisies yet a daisy of my own she is cant you guess  miss rivers exclaimed mrs arnott and though she kissed her cordially meta suspected a little doubt and disappointment  yes said dr may we change mary for this little woman as floras ladyinwaiting when she and her husband go out yachting and shooting  flora and her husband theres a marvellous sound where are they  they are staying at eccleswood castle said ethel and mary with them they would have been at home to receive you but your note yesterday took us all by surprise norman is away too at a college meeting  and margaretmy margaret does not she come downstairs  ah poor dear said dr may she has not been in this room since that sultry day in july  the eighteenth said richard the precision of the date marking but too well the consciousness that it was an epoch  we can keep her quieter upstairs said dr may but you must not see her tonight she will enjoy you very much tomorrow but excitement at night always does her harm so we put her to bed and told her to think about no one  mrs arnott looked at him as if longing but dreading to ask further and allowed her nephew and niece to seat her at the table and attend to her wants before she spoke again then the babies  we dont keep babies gertrude would tell you said dr may there are three great creatures whom ethel barbarously ordered off to bed ethel is master here you must know florawe all mind what she says  oh papa pleaded ethel distressed you know it was because i thought numbers might be oppressive  i never dispute said dr may we bow to a beneficial despotism and never rebel do we meta  seeing that ethel took the imputation to heart meta rejoined you are making mrs arnott think her the strongminded woman of the family who winds up the clock and cuts the bread  no that she makes you do when the boys are away  of course said ethel i cant be vituperated about hunches of bread i have quite enough to bear on the score of tea  your tea is very good said richard  see how they propitiate her maliciously observed the doctor  not at all it is richard standing up for his pupil said ethel it is all very well now with people who know the capacities of mortal tea but the boys expect it to last from seven oclock to ten through an unlimited number of cups till i have announced that a teapot must be carved on my tombstone with an epitaph died of unreasonable requirements  mrs arnott looked from one to the other amused observant and perceiving that they were all under that form of shyness which brings up family wit to hide embarrassment or emotion  is harry one of these unreasonable boys she asked my dear harryi presume ethel has not sent him to bed is there any hope of my seeing him  great hope said dr may he has been in the baltic fleet a pretty little summer trip from which we expect him to return any day my old lion i am glad you had him for a little while flora  dear fellow his only fault was being homesick and making me catch the infection  i am glad you did not put off your coming said dr may gravely  you are in time for the consecration said richard  ah cocksmoor when will it take place  on st andrews day it is st andrews church and the bishop fixed the day otherwise it is a disappointment that hector cannot be present  hector  hector ernescliffepoor alans brother whom we dont well know from ourselves  and you are curate ritchie said his auntif i may still call you so you are not a bit altered from the mouse you used to be  church mouse to cocksmoor said dr may nearly as poor we are to invest his patrimony in a parsonage as soon as our architect in ordinary can find time for it spenceryou remember him  i remember how you and he used to be inseparable and he has settled down at last by your side  the two old doctors hope to bolster each other up till mr tom comes down with modern science in full force that boy will do great thingshe has as clear a head as i ever knew  and more said ethel  ay as sound a heart i must find you his tutors letter flora they have had a row in his tutors house at eton and our boys made a gallant stand for the right tom especially guarding the little fellows in a way that does one good to hear of  i must express my strong sense of gratitude for his truth uprightness and moral courage quoted meta  ah ha you have learned it by heart i know you copied it out for norman who has the best right to rejoice  you have a set of children to be proud of richard exclaimed mrs arnott  to be surprised atto be thankful for said dr may almost inarticulately  to see her father so happy with mrs arnott necessarily drew ethels heart towards her and when they had bidden him goodnight the aunt instantly assumed a caressing confidence towards ethel particularly comfortable to one consciously backward and awkward and making her feel as intimate as if the whole space of her rational life had not elapsed since their last meeting  must you go my dear said her aunt detaining her over her fire i cant tell how to spare you i want to hear of your dear father he looks aged and thin ethel and yet that sweet expression is the same as ever is he very anxious about poor margaret  not exactly anxious said ethel mournfullythere is not much room for that  my dear ethelyou dont meani thought  i suppose we ought to have written more fully said ethel but it has been very gradual and we never say it to ourselves she is as bright and happy and comfortable as ever in general and perhaps may be so for a long time yet but each attack weakens her  what kind of attack  faintnesssinking it is suspended action of the heart the injury to the spine deranged the system and then the long suspense and the shockit is not one thing more than another but it must go on dr spencer will tell you you wont ask papa too much about it  no indeed and he bears it  he bears everything strength comes up out of his great lovingness but oh i sometimes long that he may never have any more sorrows  my poor child said mrs arnott putting her arm round her nieces waist  ethel rested her head on her shoulder aunt flora aunt flora if any words could tell what margaret has been ever since we were left oh dont make me talk or think of ourselves without her it is wrong to wish and when you see her that dear face of hers will make you happy in the present then added ethel not able to leave off with such a subject you have our norman to see  ah normans project is too delightful to us but i fear what it may be to your father  he gives dear norman as his most precious gift the flower and pride of us all  but ethel i am quite frightened at miss riverss looks is it possible that  aunt flora broke in ethel dont say a word against it the choicest goods wear the best and whatever woman can do meta rivers can norman is a great tall fellow as clever as possible but perfectly feckless if you had him there alone he would be a bee without a queen  well but  listen continued ethel meta is a concentration of spirit and energy delights in practical matters is twice the housewife i am and does all like an accomplishment between them they will make a noble missionary  but she looks  hush continued the niece you will think me domineering but please dont give any judgment without seeing for they look to you as an arbitrator and casual words will weigh  thank you ethel perhaps you are right when does he think of coming out  when he is ordainedsome time next year  does she live with you  i suppose she lives with flora but we always manage to get her when norman is at home  you have told me nothing of flora or mary  i have little real to tell good old mary i dare say harry talked to you plentifully of her she is aa nice old darling said ethel fondly we want her again very much and did not quite bargain for the succession of smart visits that she has been paying  with flora  yes unluckily george rivers has taken an aversion to the grange and i have not seen flora this whole year  ethel stopped short and said that she must not keep margaret expecting her perhaps her aunt guessed that she had touched the true chord of anxiety  the morning brought a cheering account of margaret and mrs arnott was to see her directly after breakfast in the meantime the firm limbs blue eyes and rosy face of gertrude seemed a fair representation of the little bridesmaid whom she remembered  a very different niece did she find upstairs though the smiling overflowing eyes and the fond eager look of recognition as if asking to be taken to her bosom had in them all the familiarity of old tenderness auntie dear auntie that you should have come back to me again  mrs arnott fondly caressed her but could not speak at first for even her conversation with ethel had not prepared her for so wasted and broken an appearance dr may spoke briskly of margarets having behaved very well and slept like a good child told margaret where he had to go that morning and pointed out to mrs arnott some relics of herself still remaining but the nervous tremulousness of manner did not much comfort her although margaret answered cheerfully nothing was so effectual in composing the aunt as aubreys coming headlong in to announce the gig and to explain to margaret his last design for a cathedraldrawing plans being just now his favourite sport  architecture is all our rage at present said margaret as her father hurried away  i am so glad to have come in time for the consecration said mrs arnott following her nieces lead is that a model of the church  oh yes cried margaret lighting up richard made it for me  may i show it to aunt flora said aubrey  bring it here if you can lift it said margaret and aunt flora helping the great cumbersome thing was placed beside her whilst she smiled and welcomed it like a child and began an eager exhibition was it not a beautiful little pierced spirethat was an extravagance of dr spencers own papa said he could not ask captain gordon to sanction itthe model did it no justice but it was so very beautiful in the rich creamy stone rising up on the moor and the blue sky looking through and it caught the sunset lights so beautifully so animated was her description that mrs arnott could not help asking why my dear when have you seen it  never said margaret with her sweet smile i have never seen cocksmoor but dr spencer and meta are always sketching it for me and ethel would not let an effect pass without telling me i shall hear how it strikes you next  i hope to see it by and by what a comfortable deep porch if we could build such churches in the colonies margaret  see what little meta will do for you yes we had the porch deep for a shelterthat is copied from the west door of the minster and is it not a fine highpitched roof john taylor who is to be clerk could not understand its being open he said when he saw the timbers that a man and his family might live up among them they are noble oak beams we would not have any shamhere aubrey take off the roof and auntie will see the shape  like the ribs of a ship explained aubrey unconscious that the meaning was deeper than his sister could express and he continued such fine oak beams i rode with dr spencer one day last year to choose them it is a twoaisled church you see that a third may be added  ethel came up as aubrey began to absorb the conversation lessons aubrey she said so margaret you are over your dear model  not forestalling you too much i hope ethel dear said margaret as you will show her the church itself  you have the best right said ethel but come aubrey we must not dawdle  i will show you the stones i laid myself aunt flora said aubrey running off without much reluctance  ethel has him in excellent order said mrs arnott  that she has she brings him on beautifully and makes him enjoy it she teaches him arithmetic in some wonderful scientific way that nobody can understand but norman and he not the details but he says it is all coming right and will make him a capital mathematical scholar though he cannot add up pounds shillings and pence  i expected to be struck with ethel said mrs arnott and  well said margaret waiting  yes she does exceed my expectations there is something curiously winning in that quaint quick decisive manner of hers there is so much soul in the least thing she does as if she could not be indifferent for a moment  exactlyexactly so said margaret delighted it is really doing everything with all her might little simple everyday matters did not come naturally to her as to other people and the having had to make them duties has taught her to do them with that earnest manner as if there were a right and a wrong to her in each little mechanical household office  harry described her to me thus said mrs arnott smiling as to ethel she is an odd fish but cocksmoor will make a woman of her after all  quite true cried margaret i should not have thought harry had so much discernment in those days cocksmoor gave the stimulus and made ethel what she is look thereover the mantelpiece are the designs for the painted glass all gifts except the east window that one of st andrew introducing the lad with the loaves and fishes is ethels window it is the produce of the hoard she began this time seven years when she had but one sovereign in the world she kept steadily on with it spending nothing on herself that she could avoid always intending it for the church and it was just enough to pay for this window  most suitable said mrs arnott  yes mr wilmot and i persuaded her into it but i do not think she would have allowed it if she had seen the application we made of itthe gift of her girlhood blessed and extended dear king etheldred it is the only time i ever cheated her  this is a beautiful east window and this little onest margaret i see  ah papa would not be denied choosing that for his subject we reproached him with legendary saints and overwhelmed him with antiquarianism to show that the margaret of the dragon was not the margaret of the daisy but he would have it and said we might thank him for not setting his heart on st etheldreda  this one  that is mine said margaret very low and her aunt abstained from remark though unable to look without tears at the ship of the apostles the calming of the storm and the scroll with the verse            he bringeth them unto the haven where they would be   beneath were the initials a h e and the date of the year the only memorials of the founder  margaret next drew attention to st andrew with his crossmetas gift and besides she said george rivers made us a beautiful present which meta hunted up old mr rivers knowing no better once bought all the beautiful carved fittings of a chapel in france meaning to fit up a library with them but happily he never did and a happy notion came into metas head so she found them out and dr spencer has adapted them and set them all to rights and they are most exquisite you never saw such foliage  thus margaret proceeded with the description of everything in the church and all the little adventures of the building as if she could not turn away from the subject and her aunt listened and wondered and when called away that margaret might rest before nurse came to dress her she expressed her wonder to meta  yes was the answer it is her chief occupation and interest i do not mean that she has not always her own dear full sympathy for every ones concerns but cocksmoor is her concern almost more than even ethels i think she could chronicle every stage in the building better than dr spencer himself and it is her daily delight to hear his histories of his progress and not only with the church but the people she knows all about every family richard and ethel tell her all their news she talks over the school with the mistress every sunday and you cannot think what a feeling there is for her at cocksmoor a kind message from miss may has an effect that the active workers cannot always produce  mrs arnott saw that meta was right when in the afternoon she walked with her nieces to see cocksmoor it was not a desolate sight as in old times for the fair edifice rising on the slope gave an air of protection to the cottages which seemed now to have a centre of unity instead of lying forlorn and scattered nor were they as wretched in themselves for the impulse of civilisation had caused windows to be mended and railings to be tidied and richard promoted to the utmost cottage gardening so that though there was an air of poverty there was no longer an appearance of reckless destitution and hopeless neglect  in the cottages mrs taylor had not entirely ceased to speak with a piteous voice even though she told of the welldoing of her girls at service but granny halls merry content had in it something now of principle and sam had married a young fordholm wife who promised to be a pattern for cocksmoor every one asked after miss may with a tenderness and affection that mrs arnott well appreciated and when they went into the large fresh school where richard was hearing a class cherry elwood looked quite cheered and enlivened by hearing that she had been able to enjoy seeing her aunt mrs arnott was set to enlighten the children about the little brown girls whom she was wont to teach and came away with a more brilliant impression of their intelligence than she might have had if she had not come to them fresh from the antipodes  she had to tell margaret all her impressions on her return and very pretty smiles repaid her commendations she understood better the constant dwelling on the subject as she perceived how little capable margaret was of any employment the book the writing materials and workbasket were indeed placed by her side but very seldom did the feeble fingers engage in any of the occupations once so familiarnow and then a pencilled note would be sent to flora or to hector ernescliffe or a few stitches be set in her work or a page or two turned of a book but she was far more often perfectly still living assuredly in no ordinary sphere of human life but never otherwise than cheerful and open to the various tidings and interests which as ethel had formerly said shifted before her like scenes in a magic lantern and perhaps with less of substance than in those earlier days when her work among them was not yet done and she was not as it were set aside from them they were now little more than shadows reflected from the world whence she was passing  yet her home was not sad when dr spencer came in the evening and old edinburgh stories were discussed dr may talked with spirit and laughed with the merry note that mrs amott so well remembered and meta rivers chimed in with her gay saucy repartees nor though richard was always silent and ethels brow seemed to bear a weight of thought did it seem as if their spirits were depressed while there was certainly no restraint on the glee of blanche aubrey and gertrude who were running into margarets room and making as much noise there as they chose  mrs arnott was at home with the whole family from the first and in every ones confidence but what she enjoyed above all was the sitting in margarets room in the morning when there was no danger of interruption the three children being all safe captives to their lessons and meta in richards workshop illuminating texts on zinc scrolls for the church  margaret came out more in these interviews it had been a kind of shyness that made her talk so exclusively of the church at the first meeting she had now felt her way and knew againand realisedthe same kind aunt with whom she had parted in her childhood and now far dearer since she herself was better able to appreciate her and with a certain resemblance to her mother that was unspeakably precious and soothing to one deprived as margaret had been at the commencement of her illness and anxiety  she could hardly see her aunt come near her without thanking her for having come home and saying how every time she awoke it was with the sense that something was comfortable then remembering it was aunt floras being in the house she seemed to have a feeling as if telling everything to her aunt were like rendering up her account to her mother and at different times she related the whole looking back on the various decisions she had had to make or to influence and reviewing her own judgments though often with selfblame not with acuteness of distress but rather with a humble trust in the infinite mercy that would atone for all shortcomings and infirmities truly sorrowed for  on the whole it was a peaceful and grateful retrospect the brothers all doing so well in their several ways and such a comfort to their father tom concerning whom she had made the greatest mistake might be looked upon as rescued by norman aubrey margaret said smiling was ethels child and had long been off her mind hector to her quite a brother would miss her almost more than her own brothers but good honest fellow he had a home here and whispered margaret smiling and glowing a little dont tell any one for it is a secret of secrets hector told me one evening that if he could be very steady he hoped he might yet have blanche at maplewood poor little white mayflower it wont be for want of liking on her part and she so blushes and watches when hector comes near that i sometimes think that he might have said something like it to her  mrs arnott gave no opinion on the plan for norman and meta but margaret however took all for granted and expressed warm hopes for their sakes that they would go out with mrs arnott then when the suggestion seemed to astonish her aunt who thought they were waiting for his ordination she said the fact is that he would like to be ordained where he is to work but i believe they do not like to say anything about the wedding because of me now of all persons i must chiefly rejoice in what may help to teach in those islands i cannot bear to be a hindrance whatever happens aunt flora will you take care that they know this  as to her father margaret was at rest he had much more calmness than when he was more new to grief and could bear far more patiently and hopefully than at first he lived more on his affections above and much as he loved those below he did not rest in them as once and could better afford to have been removed besides said margaret serenely it has been good for him to have been gradually weaned from depending on me so that it is ethel who is really necessary to him  for herself margaret was perfectly content and happy she knew the temptation of her character had been to be the ruler and manager of everything and she saw it had been well for her to have been thus assigned the part of mary rather than of martha she remembered with thankful joy the engagement with alan ernescliffe and though she still wore tokens of mourning for him it was with a kind of pleasure in them there had been so little promise of happiness from the first that there was far more peace in thinking of him as sinking into rest in harrys arms than as returning to grieve over her decline and that last gift of his the church had afforded her continual delight and above all other earthly pursuits smoothed away the languor and weariness of disease as she slowly sank to join him now that her aunt had come to bring back a sunbeam of her childhood margaret declared that she had no more grief or care except one and that a very deep and sad onenamely poor flora  mrs arnott had at first been inclined to fear that her goddaughter was neglecting her own family since she had not been at home this whole year but the slightest betrayal of this suspicion roused margaret to an eager defence she had not a doubt that flora would gladly have been with her but she believed that she was not acting by her own choice or more truly that her husband was so devoted to her that she felt the more bound to follow his slightest wishes however contrary to her own the season had been spent in the same whirl that had last year been almost beyond human power even when stimulated by enjoyment and success and now when her spirits were lowered and her health weakened meta had watched and trembled for her though never able to obtain an avowal that it was an overstrain and while treated most affectionately never admitted within her barrier of reserve  if i could see poor flora comforted or if even she would only let me enter into her troubles margaret said sighing i should be content  the consecration day came near and the travellers began to return meta was in a state of restlessness which in her was very pretty under the disguise of a great desire to be useful she fluttered about the house visited margaret played with gertrude set the drawingroom ornaments to rightsa task which ethel was very glad to depute to her and made a great many expeditions into the garden to put together autumn nosegays for the vasesfinally discovering that ethels potichomanie vases on the staircase window must have some red and brown leaves  she did not come back quite so soon with them and mrs arnott slyly looking out of window reported ha he is come then at least i see the little thing has found  something extremely unlike itself said dr may laughing something i could easily set down as a student at edinburgh thirty years ago thats the very smile i remember dear maggie being more angry than i ever saw her before because mr fleet said that you smiled to show your white teeth  that is the best shadow of maggie i ever saw said dr may she has taught the lad to smile that is what i call a pretty sight  come richard it is a shame for old folks like us to stand spying them  they care very little for me said dr may but i shall have them in cold winds blowing about that little head ah here they are fine leaves you gather miss very red and brown  meta rather liked than otherwise those pretty teasings of dr may but they always made norman colour extremely and he parried them by announcing news no not the bucephalus a marriage in high life a relation  not poor mary cried ethel  mary what could make you think of her  as a hen thinks of her ducklings when they go into waters beyond her ken said ethel well as long as it is not mary i dont care  high life repeated meta oh it can be only agatha langdale  theres only lord cosham further to guess said ethel  eh why not young ogilvie said dr may i am right i see well who is the lady  a miss dunbara nice girl that i met at glenbracken her property fits in with theirs and i believe his father has been wishing it for a long time  it does not sound too romantic said meta  he writes as if he had the sense of having been extremely dutiful said norman  no doubt thinking it needful in addressing a namesake who has had an eye to the main chance said the doctor dont throw stones young people  well exclaimed meta he did not look as if he would go and do such a stupid thing as that  probably it is anything but a stupid thing said dr may  you are using him very ill among you said norman eagerly i believe her to be excellent in every way he has known her from childhood he writes as if he were perfectly contented and saw every chance of happiness  none the less for having followed his fathers wishesi am glad he did said ethel coming to her brothers side  i dare say you are right was metas answer but i am disappointed in him he always promised to come and stay with you and made such friends at oxford and he never came  i fancy there was a good deal to hinder him said norman and as mrs arnott proceeded to inquiries after the ogilvies in general the master of glenbracken was allowed to drop  meta however renewed the subject when walking to the minster that evening with norman  you may defend mr ogilvie norman but it is not what i should have expected from him why did he make promises and then neglect his relations  i believe that conscientiously he did not dare to come said norman i know that he was greatly struck with ethel at the time of the commemoration and therefore i could never again press him to come here  oh norman you hardhearted monster what a bad conductor  i do not wish to be a conductor said norman if you had seen glenbracken and the old people you would perceive that it would not have been suitable on our part to promote anything of the kind  would they have been so violent  not violent but it would have been a severe struggle they are good kind people but with strong prejudices and though i have no doubt they would have yielded to steady attachment on their sons part and such conduct as ethels would have been i could not lead in that direction  is that pride norman  i hope not  it is doing by others as you were doing by yourself half whispered meta but after all if he had no constancy ethel had an escape  i was afraid that she had been rather touched but i am glad to find myself mistaken  if you thought so how could you make such a public announcement  he laughed i had made myself so nervous as to the effect that in desperation i took her own way and came out at once with it as unconsciously as i could  very naturally you acted unconsciousness it was better than insulting her by seeming to condole not that i do though for she deserves more steadiness than he has shown if a man could appreciate her at all i should have thought that it would have been once and for ever  remember he had barely known her a fortnight and probably had no reason to believe that he had made any impression on her he knew how such an attachment would grieve his parents and surely he was acting dutifully and with selfdenial and consideration in not putting himself in the way of being further attracted  umph you make a good defence norman but i cannot forgive him for marrying somebody else who cannot be ethels equal  she is a good little girl he will form her and be very happy perhaps more so than with a great soul and strong nature like ethels  only he is a canny scot and not a dr spencer  too short acquaintance besides there were the parents moreover what would become of home without ethel  the unanswerable argument to make one contented said meta and certainly to be wife to a member of parliament is not so very delightful that one would covet it for her  any more than she does for herself  norman was right in his view of his friends motives as well as of ethels present feelings if there had ever been any disappointment about norman ogilvie it had long since faded away she had never given away the depths of her heart though the upper surface had been stirred all had long subsided and she could think freely of him as an agreeable cousin in whose brilliant public career she should always be interested without either a wish to partake it or a sense of injury or neglect she had her vocation in her father margaret the children home and cocksmoor her mind and affections were occupied and she never thought of wishing herself elsewhere  the new church and the expected return of her sisters engrossed many more of her thoughts than did anything relating to glenbracken  she could not bear to talk of flora though almost as uneasy as was margaret and not able to lay aside misgivings lest even her good simple mary might have had her head turned by gaiety  mr and mrs rivers arrived on the saturday before the tuesday fixed for the consecration and stopped on their way that they might see margaret deposit mary and resume meta  it was a short visit and all that ethel could discover was that flora was looking very ill no longer able to conceal the worn and fagged expression of her countenance and evidently dreadfully shocked by the sight of the havoc made by disease on margarets frame yet she talked with composure of indifferent subjectsthe yacht the visits the bucephalus the church and the arrangements for st andrews day she owned herself overworked and in need of rest and as she was not well enough to venture on being present at the consecration she undertook to spend the day with margaret thus setting the others at liberty this settled she took her leave for the journey had fatigued her greatly  during the short visit mary had moved and spoken so quietly and looked so welldressed and youngladylike that in spite of her comfortable plump cheeks ethel felt quite afraid  but the instant the carriage had driven off there was a skipping a hugging a screaming oh it is so nice to be at home againand ethel knew she had her own mary it was only a much better looking and more mannerly mary in the full bloom of seventeen open and honestfaced her profuse light hair prettily disposed her hands and arms more civilised and her powers of conversation and selfpossession developed marylike were her caresses of gertrude marylike her inquiries for cocksmoor marylike her insisting on bringing her boxes into margarets room her exulting exhibition of all the pretty things that flora and george had given to her and the still more joyous bestowal of presents upon everybody  her tastes were not a whit altered nor her simplicity diminished if she was pleased by joining a large dinnerparty her satisfaction was in the amusement of seeing welldressed people and a grand table her knowledge of the world only reached to pronouncing everything unlike home so funny she had relished most freshly and innocently every pleasure that she could understand she had learned every variety of fancy work to teach blanche and miss bracy had been the delight of every schoolroom and nursery had struck up numberless eternal friendships and correspondences with girls younger and shyer than herself and her chief vexations seemed to have been first that flora insisted on her being called miss may secondly that all her delights could not be shared by every one at home and thirdly that poor flora could not bear to look at little children  grievous complaints were preferred by the dwellers in the attics the next morning that mary and blanche had talked to an unmentionable hour of the night but on the whole blanche was rather doubtful whether mary had made the most of her opportunities of observation     chapter xxv         behold with pearls they glittering stand      thy peaceful gates to all expand      by grace and strength divinely shed      each mortal thither may be led      who kindled by christs love will dare      all earthly sufferings now to bear       by many a salutary stroke      by many a weary blow that broke      or polished with a workmans skill      the stones that form that glorious pile      they all are fitly framed to lie      in their appointed place on high              ancient hymn for the dedication of a church   the thirtieth of november dawned with the grave brightness of an autumn day as the sun slowly mounted from the golden east drinking up the mists that rose tardily leaving the grass thickly bedewed  the bells of stoneborough minster were ringing gladsome peals and the sunshine had newly touched the lime trees whose last bright yellow leaves were gently floating down as the carriage from the grange drew up at dr mays door  norman opened it to claim meta at once for the walk mrs arnott and mary had gone on to assist richard in his final arrangements but even before cocksmoor with ethel was now the care of margaret and she had waited with her father to keep all bustle from her room and to commit her into the charge of flora and of nurse ethel seemed quite unwilling to go there was that strange oppressed feeling on her as if the attainment of her wishes were joy too great to be realas if she would fain hold off from it at the climax and linger with the sister who had shared all with her and to whom that church was even more than to herself she came back and back again with fresh injunctions sometimes forgetting the very purpose of her return as if it had been only an excuse for looking at margarets countenance and drinking in her sympathy from her face but she was to go in georges carriage and he was not a man to allow of loitering he became so impatient of ethels delays that she perceived that he could bear them no longer gave her final kiss and whispered in spirit with us then ran down and was seized on by george who had already packed in the children and miss bracy and was whirled away  flora dear said margaret do you dislike having the window opened  flora threw it up protesting in reply to her sisters scruples that she liked the air you always spoiled me said margaret fondly come and lie down by me it is very nice to have you here she added as flora complied and she took her hand and fondled it it is like the old times to have you here taking care of me  very unlike them in some ways said flora  it has been a great renewal of still older times said margaret to have aunt flora here i hope you will get to know her flora it is so like having mamma here and she looked in her sisters face as she spoke  flora did not reply but she lay quite still as if there were a charm in the perfect rest of being alone with margaret making no effort and being able to be silent time passed on how long they knew not but suddenly a thrill shot through margarets frame she raised her hand and lifted her head with an eager hark  flora could hear nothing  the bellshis bells said margaret all one radiant look of listening as flora opened the window further and the breeze wafted in the chime softened by distance the carnation tinted those thin white cheeks eyes and smile beamed with joy and uplifted finger and parted lips seemed marking every note of the cadence  it ceased alan alan said she it is enough i am ready  the somewhat alarmed look on floras face recalled her and smiling she held out her hands for the consecration books saying let us follow the service it will be best for us both  slowly softly and rather monotonously flora read on till she had come more than half through the first lesson her voice grew husky and she sometimes paused as if she could not easily proceed margaret begged her to stop but she would not cease and went on reading though almost whispering till she came to if they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity whither they have carried them captives and pray toward their land which thou gavest unto their fathers and toward the city which thou hast chosen and toward the house which i have built for thy name then hearing from the heavens even from thy dwellingplace  flora could go no further she strove but one of her tearless sobs cut her short she turned her face aside and as margaret began to say something tender she exclaimed with low hasty utterance margaret margaret pray for me for it is a hard captivity and my heart is very very sore oh pray for me that it may all be forgiven meand that i may see my child again  my flora my own poor dear flora do i not pray oh look up look up think how he loves you if i love you so much how much more does not he come near me flora be patient and i know peace will come  the words had burst from flora uncontrollably she was aware the next instant that she had given way to harmful agitation and resuming her quiescence partly by her own will partly from the soothing effect of margarets words and tone she allowed herself to be drawn close to her sister and hid her face in the pillow while margarets hands were folded over her and words of blessing and prayer were whispered with a fervency that made them broken  ethel meanwhile stood between aubrey and gertrude hardly able to believe it was not a dream as she beheld the procession enter the aisle and heard the psalm that called on those doors to lift up their heads for him who should enter there was an almost bewildered feelingcould it indeed be true as she followed the earlier part of the service which set apart that building as a temple for ever separate from all common uses she had imagined the scene so often that she could almost have supposed the present one of her many imaginations but by and by the strangeness passed off and she was able to enter into not merely to follow the prayers and to feel the deep thanksgiving that such had been the crown of her feeble efforts margaret was in her mind the whole time woven as it were into every supplication and every note of praise and when there came the intercession for those in sickness and suffering flowing into the commemoration of those departed in faith and fear ethels spirit sank for a moment at the conviction that soon margaret like him whom all must bear in mind on that day might be included in that thanksgiving yet as the service proceeded leaving more and more of earth behind and the voices joined with angel and archangel ethel could lose the present grief and only retain the certainty that come what might there was joy and union amid those who sung that hymn of praise never had ethel been so happynot in the sense of the finished workno she had lost all that but in being more carried out of herself than ever she had been before the free spirit of praise so bearing up her heart that the cry of glory came from her with such an exultant gladness as might surely be reckoned as one of those foretastes of our everlasting life not often vouchsafed even to the faithful and usually sent to prepare strength for what may be in store  the blessing brought the sense of peace which hung on her even while the sounds of movement began and the congregation were emerging as she came out greetings sentences of admiration of the church and of inquiry for her absent sisters were crowded upon her as people moved towards the school where a luncheon was provided for them to pass away the interval until evening service the halfdozen oldest cocksmoorites were meantime to have a dinner in the former schoolroom at the elwoods house and ethel was anxious so see that all was right there so while the rest of her party were doing civil things she gave her arm to cherry whose limping walk showed her to be very tired  oh miss ethel said cherry if miss may could only have been here  her heart is said ethel  well maam i believe it is you would not think maam how all the children take heed to anything about her if i only begin to say miss may told me they are all like mice  she has done more for the real good of cocksmoor than any one else said ethel  more might have been said but they perceived that they were being overtaken by the body of clergy who had been unrobing in the vestry ethel hastened to retreat within mrs elwoods wicket gate but she was arrested by richard and found herself being presented to the bishop and the bishop shaking hands with her and saying that he had much wished to be introduced to her  of course that was because she was her fathers daughter and by way of something to say she mentioned what was going on at the cottage whereupon the bishop wished to go in and see the old people and entering they found the very comfortablelooking party just sitting down to roastbeef and goose john taylor in a new black coat on account of his clerkship presiding at one end and mr elwood at the other and dame hall finding conversation for the whole assembly while blanche aubrey gertrude the little larkinses and the abbotstoke wilmots were ready to act as waiters with infinite delight not a bit daunted by the bishop who was much entertained by her merry manner old granny told him she had never seen nothing like it since the jubilee when the squire roasted an ox whole and there wasnt none of it fit to eat and when her poor father got his head broken well to be sure who would have thought what would come of sams bringing in the young gentleman and lady to see her the day her back was so bad  the bishop said grace and left granny to the goose while he gave ethel his arm which she would have thought an unaccountable proceeding if she had not recollected that richard might be considered as host and that she was his eldest sister forthcoming   no sooner however had they come beyond the wicket than she saw her father speaking to will adams and there was that in the air of both which made it no surprise when dr may came up saying ethel i must carry you away and in explanation to the bishop my poor girl at home is not so well  all was inquiry and sympathy ethel was frantic to be at home and would have rushed off at once if richard had not held her fast asking what good she would do by hurrying in breathless and exhausted so as to add to floras fright and distress the anxiety which was most upon their minds since she had never before witnessed one of the seizures that were only too ordinary matters in the eyes of the home party no one but dr may and ethel should go richard undertook to tell the rest and the gig making its appearance ethel felt that the peculiarly kind manner with which the bishop pressed her hand and gave them all good wishes was like a continuation of his blessing to aid her in her home scene of trial  perhaps it was well for her that her part in the consecration festivities should end here at least so thought mr wilmot who though very sorry for the cause could not wish her to have been present at the luncheon she had not thought of self hitherto the church was the gift of alan and margaret the work of preparing the people belonged to all alike and she did not guess that in the sight of others she was not the nobody that she believed herself her share in the work at cocksmoor was pretty well known and dr hoxton could not allow a public occasion to pass without speeches such as must either have been very painful or very hurtful to her the absence of herself and her father however permitted a more free utterance to the general feeling and things were said that did indeed make the rest of the family extremely hot and uncomfortable but which gave them extreme pleasure norman was obliged to spare richard the answer and said exactly what he ought and so beautifully that meta could not find it in her heart to echo the fervent wish which he whispered as he sat down that speechifying could be abolished by act of parliament  mrs arnott began to perceive that her nephew was something to be proud of and to understand how much was sacrificed while george rivers expressed his opinion to her that norman would be a crack speaker in the house and he hoped she would say everything to hinder his going out for it was a regular shame to waste him on the niggers  owing to george having constituted himself her squire mrs arnott had not arrived at an understanding of the state of affairs at home but as soon as they rose up from luncheon and she learned the truth from richard and mary nothing would hinder her from walking home at once to see whether she could be useful mary was easily persuaded to remain for she was accustomed to margarets having these attacks and had always been kept out of her room the while so she had little uneasiness to prevent her from being very happy in receiving in her own simple goodhumoured way all the attentions that lapsed upon her in the place of her elder sisters  cocksmoor really has a church was note enough of joy for her and no one could look at her round face without seeing perfect happiness moreover when after evening service the november mist turned into decided rain she was as happy as a queen in her foresight which had provided what seemed an unlimited supply of cloaks and umbrellas she appeared to have an original genius for making the right people give a lift in their carriages to the distressed and regarding the abbotstoke britska as her own packed in mrs anderson and fanny in addition to all their own little ones meta thrusting miss bracy into the demicorner destined for herself at the last minute and remaining with mary the only ladies obliged to walk back to stoneborough so delighted were they at the fun that it might have been thought the most charming of adventures and they laughed all the more at the lack of umbrellas they went to mrs elwoods divested themselves of all possible finery and tucked up the rest meta was rolled up from head to foot in a great old plaid shawl of mrs elwoods and mary had a cloak of richards the one took normans arm the other dr spencers and they trudged home through the darkness and the mud in the highest glee quite sorry when the carriage met them halfway  it was the last mirth that they enjoyed for many weeks when they reached home a sense of selfreproach for their glee thrilled over them when they found a sort of hush pervading the drawingroom and saw the faces of awe and consternation worn by blanche and george rivers  it was a much worse attack than usual and it did not go off was all that blanche knew but her father had desired to be told when dr spencer came home and she went up with the tidings  this brought flora down looking dreadfully pale and with her voice sunk away as it had been when she lost her child her husband started up exclaiming at her aspect she let him support her to the sofa and gave the few particulars margaret had been as placid and comfortable as usual till nurse came to dress her but the first move had brought on the faintness and loss of breath it did not yield to remedies and she had neither looked nor spoken since only moaned flora thought her father much alarmed and then after an interval she began to entreat that they might stay there sending miss bracy and the children to the grange to make room  meantime dr spencer had come to the sickroom but he could only suggest remedies that were already in course of application to the insensible sufferer mrs arnott and ethel were watching and trying everything to relieve her but with little effect and ethel presently stood by the fire with her father as dr spencer turned towards him and he said in a very low but calm voice it wont doi believe it is the deathstroke  not immediate said dr spencer  no said dr may and he quietly spoke of what the disease had effected and what yet remained for it to do ere the silver bowl should be broken  dr spencer put in a word of agreement  will there be no rally said ethel in the same tone  probably not said dr may the brain is generally reached at this stage i have seen it coming for a long time the thing was done seven years ago there was a rally for a time when youth was strong but suspense and sorrow accelerated what began from the injury to the spine  dr spencer bowed his head and looked at him anxiously saying i do not think there will be much acute suffering  i fear it may be as trying said dr may sighing and then turning to ethel and throwing his arm round her may god make it easy to her and grant us patient hearts we will not grudge her to all that she loves best my ethel  ethel clung to him as if to derive strength from him but the strength that was in them then did not come from earth dr spencer wrung his hand and stepped back to the bed to try another resource vain again they only seemed to be tormenting her and the silent helplessness prevailed again then dr may went down to flora told her the true state of the case and urged on her to give up her plan of remaining george joined with him and she yielded submissively but would not be refused going up once again and kissing her sister standing beside her gazing at her till her father came softly and drew her away i shall be here tomorrow she said to ethel and went  the morrow however brought no flora the agitation and distress of that day had broken her down completely and she was so ill as to be unable to move her aunt went at once to see her and finding that her presence at the grange relieved some of dr mays anxieties chiefly devoted herself to her flora was grateful and gentle but as silent and impenetrable as ever while day after day she lay on her couch uncomplaining and undemonstrative visited by her father and watched over by her aunt and sisterinlaw who began to know each other much better though flora less than ever in that deep fixed grief she only roused herself to return her husbands affection or to listen to the daily reports of margaret poor george he was very forlorn though meta did her best to wait on him and he rode over twice a day to inquire at stoneborough  the doctors were right and the consecration morning was her last of full consciousness from the hour when she had heard the sound of alans bells her ears were closed to earthly sounds there was very little power of intercourse with her as she lingered on the borders of the land very far away where skill and tenderness could not either reach body or spirit often the watchers could not tell whether she was conscious or only incapacitated from expression by the fearful weight on her breath which caused a restlessness most piteous in the exhausted helpless frame wasted till the softest touch was anguish now and then came precious gleams when a familiar voice or some momentary alleviation would gain a smile or thanks and they thought her less restless when richard read prayers beside her but words were very rare only now and then a name and when in most distress it will be soon over it will soon be over occurred so often that they began to think it once her solace and now repeated habitually without a meaning  they could not follow her into the valley of the shadow of death but could only watch the frail earthly prisonhouse being broken down as if the doom of sin must be borne though faith could trust that it was but her full share in the cross calmly did those days pass ethel richard and mary divided between them the watching and the household cares and their father bore up bravely in the fullness of his love and faith resigning her daughter to the hands which were bearing her whither her joys had long since departed  hector ernescliffe arrived when the holidays began and his agony of sorrow when she failed to recognise him moved dr may to exert himself earnestly for his consolation and at the same time tom in a gentle almost humble manner paid a sort of daughterlike attention to the smallest services for his father as if already accepting him as his especial charge  it was midnight on the longest night of the year ethel was lying on her bed and had fallen into a brief slumber when her fathers low clear voice summoned her ethel she is going  there was a change on the face and the breath came in labouring gasps richard lifted her head and her eyes once more opened she smiled once more  papa she said dear papa  he threw himself on his knees beside her but she looked beyond him mamma alan oh there they are more more and as though the unspeakable dawned on her she gasped for utterance then looked with a consoling smile on her father over now she saidand the last struggle was ended that which richard laid down was no longer margaret may  over now the twentyfive years life the seven years captivity on her couch the anxious headship of the motherless household the hopeless betrothal the long suspense the efforts for resignation the widowed affections the slow decay the tardy painful death agonyall was over nothing left save what they had rendered the undying spirit and the impress her example had left on those around her  the long continuance of the last suffering had softened the actual parting and it was with thankfulness for the cessation of her pain that they turned away and bade each other goodnight  ethel would not have believed that her first wakening to the knowledge that margaret was gone could have been more fraught with relief than with misery and for her father it seemed as if it were a homelike comfortable thought to him that her mother had one of her children with her he called her the first link of his daisy chain drawn up out of sight and during the quiet days that ensued he seemed as it were to be lifted above grief dwelling upon hope his calmness impressed the same on his children as they moved about in the solemn stillness of the house and when harry pale and shocked at the blow to him so sudden came home the grave silence soothed his violence of grief and he sat beside his father or mary speaking in undertones of what margaret had loved to hear from him of alan ernescliffes last moments  mary gave way to a burst of weeping when she sought in vain for daisies in the wintry garden but hector ernescliffe went down to the cloisters and brought back the lingering blossoms to be placed on margarets bosom  the dog toby had followed him unseen to the cloister and he was entering the garden when he was struck by seeing the animal bounding in irrepressible ecstasy round a lad whose tarpaulin hat bluebordered collar and dark blue dress showed him to be a sailor as well as the broadshouldered grizzled elderly man who stood beside him  i say sir said the latter as hectors hand was on the door do you belong to dr may  hector unhesitatingly answered that he did  then maybe sir you have heard of one bill jennings  hector was all in one flush almost choking as he told that he was mr ernescliffes brother and gave his hand to the sailor what could he do for him  jennings had heard from one of the crew of the bucephalus that mr may had been met on his return to portsmouth by the news of his sisters death the mays had helped his boy he had been with mr may in the island he had laid mr ernescliffe in his grave and some notion had crossed the sailor that he must be at miss margarets funeralit might be they would let him lend a handand in this expedition he was spending his time on shore  how he was welcomed need not be told nor how the tears came forth from full hearts as dr may granted his wish and thanked him for doing what margaret herself would indeed have chosen and in his blue sailor garb was jennings added to the bearers their own men and two cocksmoor labourers who early on christmas eve carried her to the minster last time she had been there alan ernescliffe had supported her now what was mortal of him lay beneath the palm tree beneath the glowing summer sky while the first snowflakes hung like pearls on her pall but as they laid her by her mothers side who could doubt that they were together     chapter xxvi         at length i got unto the gladsome hill              where lay my hope        where lay my heart and climbing still        when i had gained the brow and top      a lake of brackish waters on the ground              was all i found                            george herbert   late in the evening of the same snowy 24th of december a little daughter awoke to life at abbotstoke grange and not long after mrs arnott came to summon dr may from the anxious vigil in the sittingroom come and see if you can do anything to soothe her she said with much alarm the first sight of the baby has put her into such a state of agitation that we do not know what to do with her  it was so when he came to her bedside that fixed stony look of despair was gone the source of tears so long dried up had opened again and there she lay weeping quietly indeed but profusely and with deep heaving sobs to speak or to leave her alone seemed equally perilous but he chose the firsthe kissed and blessed her and gave her joy she looked up at him as if his blessing once more brought peace and said faintly now it is pardonnow i can die  the cloud is gone thanks for that above all said dr may fervently now my dear rest in thankful gladnessyou are too weak to talk or think  i am weaki am tired of it all said flora i am glad to be going while i am so happythere are margaretmy own darlingrestpeace  you are not going dearest said her father at least i trust not if you will not give way here is a darling given to you instead of the first who needs you more  he would have taken the infant from the nurse and held her to her mother but recollecting how little leonora had drawn her last breath in his arms he feared the association and signed to mrs arnott to show her the child but she seemed as yet only able to feel that it was not leonora and the long sealedup grief would have its way the tears burst out again tell ethel she will be the best mother to her name her margaretmake her a daisy of your owndont call her after me she said with such passionate caresses that mrs arnott was glad to take the babe away  dr mays next expedient was to speak to her of her husband who needed her more than all and to call him in there seemed to be something tranquillising in his wistful manner of repeating dont cry flora and she was at last reduced by her extreme exhaustion to stillness but there were still many fears for her  dr mays prediction was accomplishedthat she would suffer for having overexerted herself her constitution had been severely tried by the grief and despondency that she had so long endured in silence and the fresh sorrow for her favourite sister coming at such a crisis there was a weariness of life and an unwillingness to resume her ordinary routine that made her almost welcome her weakness and sinking and now that the black terror had cleared away from the future she seemed to long to follow margaret at once and to yearn after her lost child while appeals to the affection that surrounded her often seemed to oppress her as if there were nothing but weariness and toil in store  the state of her mind made her father very anxious though it was but too well accounted for poor flora had voluntarily assumed the trammels that galled her worldly motives had prompted her marriage and though she faithfully loved her husband he was a heavy weight on her hands and she had made it more onerous by thrusting him into a position for which he was not calculated and inspiring him with a selfconsequence that would not recede from it the shock of her childs death had taken away the zest and energy which had rejoiced in her chosen way of life and opened her eyes to see what master she had been serving and the perception of the hollowness of all that had been apparently good in her had filled her with remorse and despair her sufferings had been the more bitter because she had not parted with her proud reserve she had refused council and denied her confidence to those who could have guided her repentance her natural good sense and the sound principle in which she had been brought up had taught her to distrust her gloomy feelings as possibly morbid and she had prayed keeping her hold of faith in the infinite mercy though she could not feel her own part in it and thus that faith was beginning at last to clear her path  it was the harder to deal with her because her hysterical agitation was so easily excited that her father hardly dared to let a word be spoken to her and she was allowed to see no one else except her aunt and the dear old nurse whose tears for her child margaret had been checked by the urgent requirements of another of her nurslings and whom george rivers would have paid with her weight in gold for taking care of his new daughter regarding her as the only woman in the world that could be trusted  those were heavy days with every one though each brought some shade of improvement they were harder to bear than the peaceful days that had immediately followed the loss of margaret and ethel was especially unhappy and forlorn under the new anxiety where she could be of no service and with her precious occupation gone her father absent instead of resting upon her and her room deserted she was grieved with herself because her feelings were unable to soar at the christmas feast as erst on st andrews day and she was bewildered and distressed by the fear that she had then been only uplifted by vanity and elation  she told richard so and he said kindly that he thought a good deal of that she complained of arose from bodily weariness  this hurt her a little but when he said i think that the blessings of st andrews day helped us through what was to follow she owned that it had indeed been so and added i am going to work again tell me what will be most useful to you at cocksmoor  sick at heart as she was she bravely set herself to appropriate the hours now left vacant and manfully walked with richard and harry to church at cocksmoor on st stephens day but the church brought back the sense of contrast next she insisted on fulfilling their intention of coming home by abbotstoke to hear how flora was when the unfavourable account only added lead to the burden that weighed her down though they were sent home in the carriage she was so completely spent that the effect of returning home to her room without its dear inhabitant was quite overwhelming and she sat on her bed for half an hour struggling with repinings she came downstairs without having gained the victory and was so physically overcome with lassitude that richard insisted on her lying on the sofa and leaving everything to him and mary  richard seemed to make her his object in life and was an unspeakable help and comforter to her not only by taking every care for her for her sake but by turning to her as his own friend and confidante the best able to replace what they had lost there were many plans to be put in operation for cocksmoor on which much consultation was needed though every word reminded them sadly of margarets ever ready interest in those schemes it was very unlike ethels vision of the first weeks of st andrews church but it might be safer for her than that aught should tempt her to say see what my perseverance has wrought perhaps her margaret had begun to admire her too much to be her safest confidanteat any rate it was good still to sow in tears rather than on earth to reap in confident joy  norman was as brotherly and kind as possible but it was one of the dreary feelings of those days that ethel then first became aware of the difference that his engagement had made and saw that he resorted elsewhere for sympathy she was not jealous and acquiesced submissively and resolutely but they had been so much to each other that it was a trial especially at such a time as this when freshly deprived of margaret  normans own prospect was not cheerful he had received a letter from new zealand begging him to hasten his coming out as there was educational work much wanting him and according to his original wish he could be ordained there in the autumnal ember week  he was in much perplexity since according to this request he ought to sail with his aunt in the last week of february and he knew not how to reconcile the conflicting claims  meta was not long in finding out the whole of his trouble as they paced up and down the terrace together on a frosty afternoon  you will go was her first exclamation  i ought said norman i believe i ought and if it had only been at any other time it would have been easy my aunts company would have been such a comfort for you  it cannot be helped said meta  considering the circumstances began norman with lingering looks at the little hummingbird on his arm i believe i should be justified in waiting till such time as you could go with me i could see what mr wilmot thinks  you dont think so yourself said meta nobody else can give a judgment in a thing like this asking is what you once called seeking opinions as balaam inquired  turning my words against me said norman smiling still meta perhaps older heads would be fitter to judge what would be right for a little person not far off  she can be the best judge of that herself said meta norman and her dark eyes were steadfastly fixed i always resolved that with gods help i would not be a stumblingblock in the way of your call to your work i will not go out nowperhaps you will be freer for it without me and i suppose i have a longer apprenticeship to serve to all sorts of things before i come to help you  oh meta you are a rebuke to me  what when i am going to stay by my own fireside said meta trying to laugh but not very successfully seriously i have much to do here when poor flora gets well she must be spared all exertion for a long time to come and i flatter myself that they want me at stoneborough sometimes if your father can bear to spare you there is no doubt that you ought to go  my father is as unselfish as you are meta but i cannot speak to him until he is more easy about flora we always think the required sacrifice the hardest but i must own that i could not grieve if he laid his commands on me to wait till the autumn  oh that would make it a duty and all easy said meta smiling but i dont think he will and aunt flora will be only too glad to carry you out without encumbrance  has not aunt flora come to her senses about you  i believe she would rather i belonged to any of her nephews but you she is such a dear sincere kindhearted person and we are so comfortable together that it will be quite like home to come out to her i mean there to convince her that i can be of something like use  meta talked so as to brighten and invigorate norman when they were together but they both grew lowspirited when apart the hummingbird had hardly ever been so downcast as at presentthat is whenever she was not engaged in waiting on her brother or in cheering up dr may or in any of the many gentle offices that she was ever fulfilling she was greatly disappointed and full of fears for norman and dread of the separation but she would not give way and only now and then when off her guard would the sadness reign on her face without an effort alone she fought and prayed for resignation for herself and protection and strength for him and chid herself for the foolish feeling that he would be safer with her  she told aunt flora how it was one evening as they sat over the fire together speaking with a wouldbe tone of congratulation  indeed exclaimed mrs arnott but that is a great pity  meta looked quite brightened by her saying so i thought you would be glad she rejoined  did you think me so hardhearted  i thought you believed he would be better without me  my dear we have not kept house and nursed together for a month for nothing said mrs arnott smiling  thank you said meta trying to answer the smile you have taken a load off me  i dont like it at all said mrs arnott it is a very uncomfortable plan for every one and yet when i know how great is the want of him out there i can say nothing against it without high treason well my dear ill take all the care i can of norman and when you come i shall be almost as glad as if we were coming home for good poor flora she is one person who will not regret the arrangement  poor florayou think her really better this evening  much better indeed if we could only raise her spirits i think she would recover very well but she is so sadly depressed i must try to talk to ethelshe may better understand her  i have never understood flora said meta she has been as kind to me as possible and i very soon came to a certain point with her but i never have known her thoroughly i doubt whether any one did but dear margaret  flora was however much softened and less reserved than she had been she found great repose in her aunts attendance retracing as it did her mothers presence and she responded to her tenderness with increasing reliance and comfort while as her strength began to revive and there was more disposition to talk she became gradually drawn into greater confidence  the seeing of ethel was one of the difficult questions flora had begun to wish it very much and yet the bare idea threw her into a nervous tremor that caused it to be put off again and again her aunt found her one day almost faint with agitationshe had heard ethels voice in the next room and had been winding up her expectations and now was as much grieved as relieved to find that she had been there seeing the baby but was now gone  how does the dear ethel look asked flora presently  she is looking better today she has looked very worn and harassed but i thought her brighter today she walked over by aubrey on his pony and i think it did her good  dear old ethel aunt it is a thing that no one has told me yet can you tell me how she bore the news of norman ogilvies engagement  do you mean and mrs arnott stopped short in her interrogation  yes said flora answering the pause  but i thought young ogilvie a most unexceptionable person  so he is said flora i was much annoyed at the time but she was resolute  in rejecting him  in running away as soon as she found what was likely to happen and flora in a few words told what had passed at oxford  then it was entirely out of devotion to your father  entirely said flora no one could look at her without seeing that she liked him i had left her to be the only effective one at home and she sacrificed herself  i am glad that i have seen her said mrs arnott i should never have understood her by description i always said that i must come home to set my correspondence going rightly  aunt flora said her niece do you remember my dear mothers unfinished letter to you  to be sure i do my dear  nothing ever was more true said flora i read it over some little time ago when i set my papers in order and understood it then i never did before i used to think it very good for the others  it is what one generally does with good advice  do you recollect the comparison between norman ethel and me it is so curious norman who was ambitious and loved praise but now dreads nothing so much ethel who never cared for anything of the kind but went straight on her own brave way and oh aunt florame  indeed my dear i should have thought you had her most full approbation  ah dont you see the tone as if she were not fully satisfied as if she only could not see surface faults in me said flora and how she said she dreaded my love of praise and of being liked i wonder how it would have been if she had lived i have looked back so often in the past year and i think the hollowness began from that time it might have been there before but i am not so sure you see at that dreadful time after the accident i was the eldest who was able to be efficient and much more useful than poor ethel i think the credit i gained made me think myself perfection and i never did anything afterwards but seek my own honour  mrs arnott began better to understand floras continued depression but she thought her selfreproach exaggerated and said something at once soothing and calculated to encourage her to undraw the curtain of reserve  you do not know continued flora how greedy i was of credit and affection it made me jealous of ethel herself as long as we were in the same sphere and when i felt that she was more to papa than i could be i looked beyond home for praise i dont think the things i did were bad in themselvesbrought up as i have been they could hardly be so i knew what merits praise and blame too well for thatbut oh the motive i do believe i cared very much for cocksmoor i thought it would be a grand thing to bring about but you see as it has turned out all i thought i had done for it was in vain and ethel has been the real person and does not know it i used to think ethel so inferior to me i left her all my work at home if it had not been for that she might have been happy with norman ogilviefor never were two people better matched and now she has done what i never thought to have left to anotherwatched over our own margaret oh how shall i ever bear to see her  my dear i am sure nothing can be more affectionate than ethel she does not think these things  she does said flora she always knew me better than i did myself her straightforward words should often have been rebukes to me i shall see in every look and tone the opinion i have deserved i have shrunk from her steadfast looks ever since i myself learned what i was i could not bear them nowand yetoh aunt you must bring her ethel my dear dear old kingmy darlings godmotherthe last who was with margaret  she had fallen into one of those fits of weeping when it was impossible to attempt anything but soothing her but though she was so much exhausted that mrs arnott expected to be in great disgrace with dr may for having let her talk herself into this condition she found that he was satisfied to find that she had so far relieved her mind and declared that she would be better now  the effect of the conversation was that the next day the last of the twelve christmas days when ethel whose yearning after her sister was almost equally divided between dread and eagernesseagerness for her embrace and dread of the chill of her reserve came once again in hopes of an interview dr may called her at once i shall take you in without any preparation he said that she may not have time to be flurried only be quiet and natural  did he know what a mountain there was in her throat when he seemed to think it so easy to be natural  she found him leading her into a darkened room and heard his cheerful tones saying i have brought ethel to you  ethel oh said a low weak voice with a sound as of expecting a treat and ethel was within a curtain where she began in the dimness to see something white moving and her hands were clasped by two long thin ones there said dr may now if you will be good i will leave you alone nurse is by to look after you and you know she always separates naughty children  either the recurrence to nursery language or the mere sisterly touch after long separation seemed to annihilate all the imaginary mutual dread and as ethel bent lower and lower and floras arms were round her the only feeling was of being together again and both at once made the childish gesture of affection and murmured the old pet names of flossy and king that belonged to almost forgotten days when they were baby sisters then kissed each other again  i cant see you said ethel drawing herself up a little why flora you look like a little white shadow  i have had such weak eyes said flora and this dim light is comfortable i see your old sharp face quite plain  but what can you do here  do oh dear ethel i have not had much of doing papa says i have three years rest to make up  poor flora said ethel but i should have thought it tiresome especially for you  i have only now been able to think again said flora and you will say i am taking to quoting poetry do you remember some lines in that drama that norman admired so much  philip von artevelde  yes i cant recollect them now though they used to be always running in my headsomething about time to mend and time to mourn  these said ethel                 he that lacks time to mourn lacks time to mend                eternity mourns that   i never had time before for either said flora you cannot think how i used to be haunted by those when i was chased from one thing to another all these long long eighteen months i am in no haste to take up work again  mending as well as mourning said ethel thoughtfully  flora sighed  and now you have that dear little christmas gift to ethel paused  she is not nearly so fine and healthy as her sister was said flora poor little dear you know ethel even now i shall have very little time with her in that london life her papa wants me so much and i must leave her toto the nurses floras voice trembled again  our own dear old nurse said ethel  oh i wanted to thank you all for sparing her to us said flora george wished it so much but how does poor little daisy bear it  very magnanimously said ethel smiling in fact nurse has had but little to do with daisy of late and would have been very forlorn at home it is better for aubrey and for her not to return to be babies to comfort poor nurse i have been breaking up the nursery and taking gertrude to live with me  have you gone back there again  it would not have been better for waiting said ethel and gertrude was so proud to come to me i could not have done it without her but papa must not have vacancy next to him  it has been hard on you for me to engross him said flora but oh ethel i could not spare him i dont think even you can tell what papa is  you have found it out said ethel in an odd dry manner which in sound though not in feeling was a contrast to the soft whispering tearful murmurs of her sister  and my aunt continued florathat i should have taken up such a great piece of her short visit  ah it is coming to an end very fast said ethel sighing but you had the best right to her and she and meta have seen so much of each other she tells me she is quite satisfied about meta now  i am sorry to see meta looking out of spirits said flora i almost made her cry by saying something about norman is there anything going wrong  ethel as usual blundered into the subject only about normans going out  flora asked further questions and she was obliged to explain it roused floras energies at once  this will never do she said they must marry and go with my aunt  ethel was aghast they would not hear of it now  they must it is the only reasonable thing why norman would be miserable and as to metaimagine his going out and returninga years work such an expense and loss of time besides the missing aunt flora  if it were not wrong  the waste would be the wrong thing besides and she told of margarets wishes  but flora thinkthe last week in februaryand you so ill  i am not to marry them said flora smiling if it could be in a fortnight they could go and get their outfit afterwards and come back to us when i am stronger let me seethere need be no fuss about settlementsmr riverss will arranges everything for her  it would be a good thing to get rid of a fine wedding said ethel but they will never consent  yes they will and be grateful  papa would be happier about norman said ethel but i cannot fancy his liking it and youyou cant spare meta for aunt flora must go to the arnotts in a week or two more  suppose papa was to let me have you said flora if he wants you he must come after you  ethel gasped at the thought that her occupation at home was gone but she said if i am not too awkward for you dear flora you will miss meta terribly  i cant keep the hummingbird caged with her heart far away said flora  dr may came in to break up the conversation and ethel quickly guessed from his manner that norman had been talking to him flora told him that she had been agreeing with ethel that meta had much better not miss this opportunity he was far less startled than ethel had expected indeed the proposal was rather a relief to his mind and his chief objection was the fear that flora would be fatigued by the extra bustle but she promised not to trouble herself about it otherwise than that if norman could not persuade meta she would the sisters parted much more comfortable than before ethel felt as if she had found something like a dim reflection of margaret and floras fear of ethel had fled away from the mere force of sisterhood  as to norman he declared that he had not the audacity to make the proposal to meta though he was only too grateful so his father carried it to the hummingbird and as soon as she found that it was not improper nor would hurt any ones feelings she gave ready consentonly begging that it might be as best suited every one especially flora and ending by a whisper to her dear fatherly friend owning that she was very gladshe meant she was very glad there would be nobody there  so norman and meta settled their plans as they walked home together from evening service after listening to the prophecies of the blessings to be spread into the waste and desolate places which should yet become the heritage of the chosen and with the evening star shining on them like a faint reflex of the star of the east who came to be a light to lighten the gentiles     chapter xxvii      euna delle facolta singolari ed incommunicabili della religione   cristiana questa di poter dare indirizzo e quiete a chiunoque in

le   gioje della vocazionemanzoni   the weddingday was fixed for the 20th of january since it was less risk to flora as an absolute invalid than as convalescent enough to take any share in the doings  meta managed her correspondence with her own relatives and obtained her uncles kind approval since he saw there could be nothing else while her aunt treated her as an infatuated victim but wished for her mothers sake to meet her in london before she sailed  the worst stroke of all was to bellairs who had never chosen to believe that her mistress could move without her and though mortally afraid in crossing to the isle of wight and utterly abhorring all natives went into hysterics on finding that her young lady would take out no maid but a little hardworking village girl and though transferred in the most flattering manner to mrs riverss service shed a tear for every stitch she set in the trousseau and assured her betrothed butler that if miss rivers would only have heard reason she would have followed her to the worlds end rather than that her beautiful hair should never look like anything again  so the weddingday came and grass and trees wore a fitting suit of crisp hoariness nothing could be quieter meta was arrayed by the sobbing bellairs in her simple bridal white wrapped herself in a large shawl took her brothers arm and walked down the frosty path with him and mrs arnott as if going merely to the daily service  the time had not been made known and there was hardly an addition to the ordinary congregation except the may family and dr spencer but the christmas evergreens still adorned aisle and chancel and over the altar stood the motto that meta herself had woven of holly on that christmas eve of grief and anxiety without knowing how it would speak to her     fear not for behold i bring unto you glad tidings of great joy   that shall be unto you and to all people   fear not for length of voyage for distance from kindred for hardship privation misunderstanding disappointment the glad tidings are to all people even to the utmost parts of the earth ye have your portion in the great joyye have freely cast in your lot with those whose feet are beautiful on the mountains who bear the good tidings fear not for he is with you who will never forsake  thus dr may read the words with swelling heart as he looked at his sons clear grave manful look even as it had been when he made his confirmation vowhis natural nervous excitability quelled by a spirit not his own and chastened into strong purpose and the bride her young face the more lovely for the depth of enthusiasm restrained by awe and humility as she stood without trembling or faltering the strength of innocence expressed in the whole bearing of her slight figure in her white drapery around were the four sisterly bridesmaids their black dresses showing that these were still the twilight days of mourning and that none would forget her whose prayers might still bless their labour of love  when margaret agatha may on her husbands arm turned for a last look at the altar of her own church fear not in evergreen letters was the greeting she bore away  ethel was left at the grange for the ensuing fortnighta time of unusual leisure both to her and to flora which they both prized highly for it taught them to know each other as they had never done before floras confidence to her aunt had been a good thing for her though so partial it opened the way for further unreserve to one who knew the circumstances better and as to dread of ethel that could seldom prevail in her presence partly from long habit partly from her deficiency of manner and still more from her true humility and affection gradually she arrived at the perception of the history of her sisters mind understood what gloom had once overshadowed it and how since light had once shone upon her she shrank not merely from the tasks that had become wearisome to her but from the dread of losing among them her present peace  they are your duty argued ethel duty brings peace  they were not said flora  they are now said ethel  dinners and parties empty talk and vain show said flora languidly are you come to their defence ethel if you could guess how sick one gets of them and how much worse it is for them not to be hateful and to think of bringing my poor little girl up to the like if she is spared  if they are not duties i would not do them said ethel  ethel cried her sister raising herself from her couch eagerly i will say it to you what should you think of george resigning his seat and living in peace here  would he said ethel  if i wished it  but what would he do with himself said ethel not in too complimentary a strain  yachting farming cochinchineseor something said flora anything not so wearing as this  that abominable candidate of tomkinss would come in exclaimed ethel oh flora that would be horrid  that might be guarded against said flora perhaps sir henrybut oh let us leave politics in peace while we can i thought we should do some great good but it is all a maze of confusion it is so hard to know principles from parties and everything goes wrong it is of no use to contend with it  it is never vain to contend with evil said ethel  we are not generalising said flora there is evil nearer home than the state of parties and i cant see that georges being in parliamentbeing what he isis anything like the benefit to things in generalthat it is temptation and plague to me besides the risk of london life for the baby now and hereafter  i cant say that i think it is said ethel how nice it would be to have you here i am so glad you are willing to give it up  it would have been better to have given it up untastedlike norman sighed flora i will talk to george  but flora said ethel a little startled you ought not to do such a thing without advice  there will be worry enough before it is done sighed flora no fear of that  stop a minute said ethel as if poor flora could have done anything but lie still on her sofa i think you ought to consider well before you set it going  have not i longed for it day and night it is an escape from peril for ourselves and our child  i cant be sure said ethel it may be more wrong to make george desert the post which  which i thrust him into said flora my father told me as much  i did not mean you to say that but it is a puzzle it seems as if it were right to give up such things yet when i recollect the difficulty of carrying an election right at stoneborough i think papa would be very sorry i dont think his interest would bring in any sound man but his soninlaw and george himself seems to like his parliamentary life better than anything else  yes said flora hesitatingly for she knew it was truehe liked to think himself important and it gave him something to think of and regular occupationnot too active or onerous but she could not tell ethel what she herself felt that all she could do for him could not prevent him from being held cheap by the men among whom she had placed him  then said ethel as she heard her affirmative i dont think it is for his dignity for you to put him into parliament to please you and then take him out to please you  ill take care of his dignity said flora shortly  i know you would do it well  i am sick of doing things well said poor flora you little know how i dread reading up all i must read presently i shall lose all i have scarcely gained i cannot find peace any way but by throwing down the load i gave my peace for  whether this is truth or fancy said ethel thoughtfully if you would ask some one competent  dont you know there are some things one cannot ask said flora i dont know why i spoke to you ah come in why george that is a finer egg than ever as he entered with a shanghai egg in each hand for her to mark with the date when it had been laid poultry was a new hobby and ethel had been hearing in her teteatete dinners with george a great deal about the perfections of the hideous monsters that had obtained fabulous prices they had been the best resource for conversation but she watched with something between vexation and softness how flora roused herself to give her full attention and interest to his prosing about his pets really pleased as it seemed and at last encouraging him actually to fetch his favourite cock to show her when she went through the points of perfection of the ungainly mass of feathers and did not at all allow ethel to laugh at the unearthly sounds of disapproval which handling elicited  and this is our senator thought ethel i wonder whether honoriuss hen was a shanghai poor flora is rightit is poor work to make a silk purse out of a sows ear but putting him into the place is one thing taking him out another i wish she would take advice but i never knew her do that except as a civil way of communicating her intentions however she is not quite what she was poor dear aunt flora will never believe what a beautiful creature she used to be it seems wrong to think of her going back to that horrid london but i cant judge for my part id rather do work than no work for george and he is a good kindhearted fellow after all i wont be a crab  so ethel did her best and said the cock had a bright eyeall she could say for himand george instructed her to admire the awkward legs and invited her to a poultry show at whitford in two days timeand they sent him away to continue his consultations with the poultry woman which pullets should be preferred as candidates for a prize  meta set him upon this said flora i hope you will go ethel you see he can be very happy here  still said ethel the more i think the more sure i am that you ought to ask advice  i have asked yours said flora as if it were a great effort you dont know what to sayi shall do what i see to be the only way to rest  i do know what to say said ethel and that is do as the prayerbook tells you in any perplexity  i am not perplexed said flora  dont say so this is either the station to which god has called you or it is not  he never called me to it  but you dont know whether you ought to leave it if you ought not you would be ten times more miserable go to richard florahe belongs to you as much as ihe has authority besides  richard  he is the clearest of us all in practical matters said ethel preventing what she feared would be disparaging i dont mean only that you should ask him about this parliament matter alone but i am sure you would be happier and more settled if you talked things over with him beforebefore you go to church  you dont know what you propose  i do said ethel growing bolder you have been going all this time by feeling you have never cleared up and got to the bottom of your troubles  i could not talk to any one  not to any one but a clergyman now to enter on such a thing is most averse to your nature and i do believe that for that very reason it would be what would do you most good you say you have recovered sense ofoh flora i cant talk of what you have gone through but if you have only a vague feeling that seems as if lying still would be the only way to keep it i dont think it can be altogether sound or the quiet conscience that is meant  oh ethel ethel i have never told you what i have undergone since i knew my former quietness of conscience was but sleep i have gone on in agony with the sense of hypocrisy and despair because i was afraid for georges sake to do otherwise  ethel felt herself utterly powerless to advise and after a kind sound of sympathy sat shocked pondering on what none could answer whether this were indeed what poor flora imagined or whether it had been a holdingfast to the thread through the darkness the proud reserve was the true evil and ethel prayed and trusted it might give way  she went very amiably to whitford with george and gained great credit with him for admiring the prettiest speckled hamburgh present indeed george was becoming very fond of poor ethel as he still called her and sometimes predicted that she would turn out a fine figure of a woman after all  ethel heard on her return that richard had been there and three days after when flora was making arrangements for going to church a moment of confidence came over her and she said i did it ethel i have spoken to richard  i am so glad  you were right he is as clear as he is kind said flora he showed me that for georges sake i must bear with my present life and do the best i can with it unless some leading comes for an escape and that the glare and weariness and being spoken well of must be taken as punishment for having sought after these things  i was afraid he would say so said ethel but you will find happiness again flora dear  scarcelybefore i come to margaret and to my child sighed flora i suppose it was mercy that would not let me follow when i wished it i must work till the time of rest comes  and your own little margaret will cheer you said ethel more hopefully as she saw flora bend over her baby with a face that might one day be bright  she trusted that patient continuance in welldoing would one day win peace and joy even in the dreary world that poor flora had chosen  for her own part ethel found floras practical good sense and sympathy very useful in her present need of the counsel she had always had from margaret  the visit to flora lasted a fortnight and ethel was much benefited by the leisure for reading and the repose after the long nursing though before the end her refreshed energies began to pine for daisy and her hymns for aubrey and his virgil for cherry and her scholars and above all for her father for come as often as he would it was not papa at home  on the other hand mary was at a loss for ethel every hour richard was putting off his affairs till ethel should come home miss bracy and blanche longed for her to relieve the schoolroom from the children aubrey could not perform a lesson in comfort with any one elsenever ended a sum without groaning for ethel and sometimes rode to abbotstoke for the mere purpose of appealing to her in short no one could get on without her and the doctor least of all  dr spencer and mr wilmot and all his sons and daughters had done their best for him but in spite of his satisfaction at seeing the two sisters so happy together he could not help missing ethel every minute as the very light of his home and when at last flora brought her back she was received with uproarious joy by aubrey and daisy while the rest of the household felt a revival and refreshment of spiritsthe first drawing aside of the cloud that had hung over the winter the pearl of their home might be missed every hour but they could thankfully rest in the trust that she was a jewel stored up in safety and peace to shine as a star for evermore  a few weeks more and there were other partings sad indeed yet cheery dr may told mrs arnott that though he grieved that so much of sorrow had come to dim her visit he could not but own that it was the very time when her coming could be most comforting and this as she truly said was satisfaction enough for her besides that she could not rejoice enough that her arrival had been in time to see their dear margaret she should carry away most precious recollections and she further told dr spencer that she was far more comfortable about her brotherinlaw than if she had only known him in his youthful character which had seemed so little calculated to bear sorrow or care she looked at him now only to wonder at and reverence the change that had been gradually wrought by the affections placed above  norman and his wife went with herthe one grave but hopeful the other trying to wile away the pain of parting by her tearful mirthmaking all sorts of odd promises and touching requests between jest and earnest and clinging to the last to her dear fatherinlaw as if the separation from him were the hardest of all  well hummingbirds must be let fly said he at last ah ha meta are they of no use  stay till you hear said meta archlythen turning back once more oh how i have thanked you ethel for those first hints you gave me how to make my life real if i had only sat still and wished instead of trying what could be done as i was how unhappy i should have been  come take your sprite away norman if you dont want me to keep her for good god bless you my dear children goodbye who knows but when doctor tom sets up in my place ethel and i may come out and pay you a visit  it had all been over for some weeks and the homeparty had settled down again into what was likely to be their usual course excepting in the holidays to which the doctor looked forward with redoubled interest as tom was fast becoming a very agreeable and sensible companion for his moodiness had been charmed away by meta and principle was teaching him true command of temper he seemed to take his father as a special charge bequeathed to him by norman and had already acquired that value and importance at home which comes of the laying aside of all selfimportance  it was a clear evening in march full of promise of spring and ethel was standing in the church porch at cocksmoor after making some visits in the parish waiting for richard while the bell was ringing for the wednesday evening service and the pearly tints of a cloudless sunset were fading into the western sky  ethel began to wonder where norman might be looking at the sun dipping into the western sea and thence arose before her the visions of her girlhood when she had first dreamt of a church on cocksmoor and of richard ministering before a willing congregation so strange did the accomplishment seem that she even touched the stone to assure herself of the reality and therewith came intense thanksgiving that the work had been taken out of her hands to be the more fully blessed and accomplishedthat is as far as the building went as to the people there was far more labour in store and the same hand must be looked to for the increase  for herself ethel looked back and looked on norman ogilvies marriage seemed to her to have fixed her lot in life and what was that lot home and cocksmoor had been her choice and they were before her home but her eyes had been opened to see that earthly homes may not endure nor fill the heart her dear father might indeed claim her fullhearted devotion but to him she was only one of many norman was no longer solely hers and she had begun to understand that the unmarried woman must not seek undivided return of affection and must not set her love with exclusive eagerness on aught below but must be ready to cease in turn to be first with any ethel was truly a mother to the younger ones but she faced the probability that they would find others to whom she would have the second place to love each heartily to do her utmost for each in turn and to be grateful for their fondness was her call but never to count on their affection as her sole right and inalienable possession she felt that this was the probable course and that she might look to becoming comparatively solitary in the course of yearsthen tried to realise what her lonely life might be but broke off smiling at herself what is that to me what will it be when it is over my course and aim are straight on and he will direct my paths i dont know that i shall be alone and i shall have the memorythe communion with them if not their presence some one there must be to be loved and helped and the poor for certain only i must have my treasure above and when i think what is there and ofoh that bliss of being perfectly able to praisewith no bad old self to mar the full joy of giving thanks and blessing and honour and power need i dread a few short yearsand they have not begun yetperhaps they wontoh here is actually papa coming home this way how delightful papa are you coming to church here  ay ethel that weathercock of spencers is a magnet i believe it draws me from all parts of the country to hear richard in st andrews church
