at the mission of san carmel       a bluegrass penelope       left out on lone star mountain       a ship of 49    flip a california romance    chapter i  just where the red track of the los gatos road streams on and upward like the sinuous trail of a fiery rocket until it is extinguished in the blue shadows of the coast range there is an embayed terrace near the summit hedged by dwarf firs at every bend of the heatladen road the eye rested upon it wistfully all along the flank of the mountain which seemed to pant and quiver in the ovenlike air through rising dust the slow creaking of dragging wheels the monotonous cry of tired springs and the muffled beat of plunging hoofs it held out a promise of sheltered coolness and green silences beyond sunburned and anxious faces yearned toward it from the dizzy swaying tops of stagecoaches from lagging teams far below from the blinding white canvas covers of mountain schooners and from scorching saddles that seemed to weigh down the scrambling sweating animals beneath but it would seem that the hope was vain the promise illusive when the terrace was reached it appeared not only to have caught and gathered all the heat of the valley below but to have evolved a fire of its own from some hidden craterlike source unknown nevertheless instead of prostrating and enervating man and beast it was said to have induced the wildest exaltation the heated air was filled and stifling with resinous exhalations the delirious spices of balm bay spruce juniper yerba buena wild syringa and strange aromatic herbs as yet unclassified distilled and evaporated in that mighty heat and seemed to fire with a midsummer madness all who breathed their fumes they stung smarted stimulated intoxicated it was said that the most jaded and footsore horses became furious and ungovernable under their influence wearied teamsters and muleteers who had exhausted their profanity in the ascent drank fresh draughts of inspiration in this fiery air extended their vocabulary and created new and startling forms of objurgation it is recorded that one bibulous stagedriver exhausted description and condensed its virtues in a single phrase gin and ginger this felicitous epithet flung out in a generous comparison with his favorite drink rum and gum clung to it ever after  such was the current comment on this vale of spices like most human criticism it was hasty and superficial no one yet had been known to have penetrated deeply its mysterious recesses it was still far below the summit and its wayside inn it had escaped the intruding foot of hunter and prospector and the inquisitive patrol of the county surveyor had only skirted its boundary it remained for mr lance harriott to complete its exploration his reasons for so doing were simple he had made the journey thither underneath the stagecoach and clinging to its axle he had chosen this hazardous mode of conveyance at night as the coach crept by his place of concealment in the wayside brush to elude the sheriff of monterey county and his posse who were after him he had not made himself known to his fellowpassengers as they already knew him as a gambler an outlaw and a desperado he deemed it unwise to present himself in his newer reputation of a man who had just slain a brother gambler in a quarrel and for whom a reward was offered he slipped from the axle as the stagecoach swirled past the brushing branches of fir and for an instant lay unnoticed a scarcely distinguishable mound of dust in the broken furrows of the road then more like a beast than a man he crept on his hands and knees into the steaming underbrush here he lay still until the clatter of harness and the sound of voices faded in the distance had he been followed it would have been difficult to detect in that inert mass of rags any semblance to a known form or figure a hideous reddish mask of dust and clay obliterated his face his hands were shapeless stumps exaggerated in his trailing sleeves and when he rose staggering like a drunken man and plunged wildly into the recesses of the wood a cloud of dust followed him and pieces and patches of his frayed and rotten garments clung to the impeding branches twice he fell but maddened and upheld by the smarting spices and stimulating aroma of the air he kept on his course  gradually the heat became less oppressive once when he stopped and leaned exhaustedly against a sapling he fancied he saw the zephyr he could not yet feel in the glittering and trembling of leaves in the distance before him again the deep stillness was moved with a faint sighing rustle and he knew he must be nearing the edge of the thicket the spell of silence thus broken was followed by a fainter more musical interruptionthe glassy tinkle of water a step further his foot trembled on the verge of a slight ravine still closely canopied by the interlacing boughs overhead a tiny stream that he could have dammed with his hand yet lingered in this parched red gash in the hillside and trickled into a deep irregular welllike cavity that again overflowed and sent its slight surplus on it had been the luxurious retreat of many a spotted trout it was to be the bath of lance harriott without a moments hesitation without removing a single garment he slipped cautiously into it as if fearful of losing a single drop his head disappeared from the level of the bank the solitude was again unbroken only two objects remained upon the edge of the ravinehis revolver and tobacco pouch  a few minutes elapsed a fearless bluejay alighted on the bank and made a prospecting peck at the tobacco pouch it yielded in favor of a gopher who endeavored to draw it toward his hole but in turn gave way to a red squirrel whose attention was divided however between the pouch and the revolver which he regarded with mischievous fascination then there was a splash a grunt a sudden dispersion of animated nature and the head of mr lance harriott appeared above the bank it was a startling transformation not only that he had by this wholesale process washed himself and his light drill garments entirely clean but that he had apparently by the same operation morally cleansed himself and left every stain and ugly blot of his late misdeeds and reputation in his bath his face albeit scratched here and there was rosy round shining with irrepressible goodhumor and youthful levity his large blue eyes were infantine in their innocent surprise and thoughtlessness dripping yet with water and panting he rested his elbows lazily on the bank and became instantly absorbed with a boys delight in the movements of the gopher who after the first alarm returned cautiously to abduct the tobacco pouch if any familiar had failed to detect lance harriott in this hideous masquerade of dust and grime and tatters still less would any passing stranger have recognized in this blonde faun the possible outcast and murderer and when with a swirl of his spattering sleeve he drove back the gopher in a shower of spray and leaped to the bank he seemed to have accepted his felonious hidingplace as a mere picnicking bower  a slight breeze was unmistakably permeating the wood from the west looking in that direction lance imagined that the shadow was less dark and although the undergrowth was denser he struck off carelessly toward it as he went on the wood became lighter and lighter branches and presently leaves were painted against the vivid blue of the sky he knew he must be near the summit stopped felt for his revolver and then lightly put the few remaining branches aside  the full glare of the noonday sun at first blinded him when he could see more clearly he found himself on the open western slope of the mountain which in the coast range was seldom wooded the spiced thicket stretched between him and the summit and again between him and the stage road that plunges from the terrace like forked lightning into the valley below he could command all the approaches without being seen not that this seemed to occupy his thoughts or cause him any anxiety his first act was to disencumber himself of his tattered coat he then filled and lighted his pipe and stretched himself fulllength on the open hillside as if to bleach in the fierce sun while smoking he carelessly perused the fragment of a newspaper which had enveloped his tobacco and being struck with some amusing paragraph read it half aloud again to some imaginary auditor emphasizing its humor with an hilarious slap upon his leg  possibly from the relaxation of fatigue and the bath which had become a vapor one as he alternately rolled and dried himself in the baking grass his eyes closed dreamily he was awakened by the sound of voices they were distant they were vague they approached no nearer he rolled himself to the verge of the first precipitous grassy descent there was another bank or plateau below him and then a confused depth of olive shadows pierced here and there by the spiked helmets of pines there was no trace of habitation yet the voices were those of some monotonous occupation and lance distinctly heard through them the click of crockery and the ring of some household utensil it appeared to be the interjectional half listless half perfunctory domestic dialogue of an old man and a girl of which the words were unintelligible their voices indicated the solitude of the mountain but without sadness they were mysterious without being aweinspiring they might have uttered the dreariest commonplaces but in their vast isolation they seemed musical and eloquent lance drew his first sighthey had suggested dinner  careless as his nature was he was too cautious to risk detection in broad daylight he contented himself for the present with endeavoring to locate that particular part of the depths from which the voices seemed to rise it was more difficult however to select some other way of penetrating it than by the stage road theyre bound to have a fire or show a light when its dark he reasoned and satisfied with that reflection lay down again presently he began to amuse himself by tossing some silver coins in the air then his attention was directed to a spur of the coast range which had been sharply silhouetted against the cloudless western sky something intensely white something so small that it was scarcely larger than the silver coin in his hand was appearing in a slight cleft of the range  while he looked it gradually filled and obliterated the cleft in another moment the whole serrated line of mountain had disappeared the dense dazzling white encompassing host began to pour over and down every ravine and pass of the coast lance recognized the seafog and knew that scarcely twenty miles away lay the oceanand safety the drooping sun was now caught and hidden in its soft embraces a sudden chill breathed over the mountain he shivered rose and plunged again for very warmth into the spiceladen thicket the heated balsamic air began to affect him like a powerful sedative his hunger was forgotten in the languor of fatigue he slumbered when he awoke it was dark he groped his way through the thicket a few stars were shining directly above him but beyond and below everything was lost in the soft white fleecy veil of fog whatever light or fire might have betokened human habitation was hidden to push on blindly would be madness he could only wait for morning it suited the outcasts lazy philosophy he crept back again to his bed in the hollow and slept in that profound silence and shadow shut out from human association and sympathy by the ghostly fog what torturing visions conjured up by remorse and fear should have pursued him what spirit passed before him or slowly shaped itself out of the infinite blackness of the wood none as he slipped gently into that blackness he remembered with a slight regret some biscuits that were dropped from the coach by a careless luncheonconsuming passenger that pang over he slept as sweetly as profoundly as divinely as a child   chapter ii  he awoke with the aroma of the woods still steeping his senses his first instinct was that of all young animals he seized a few of the young tender green leaves of the yerba buena vine that crept over his mossy pillow and ate them being rewarded by a half berrylike flavor that seemed to soothe the cravings of his appetite the languor of sleep being still upon him he lazily watched the quivering of a sunbeam that was caught in the canopying boughs above then he dozed again hovering between sleeping and waking he became conscious of a slight movement among the dead leaves on the bank beside the hollow in which he lay the movement appeared to be intelligent and directed toward his revolver which glittered on the bank amused at this evident return of his larcenious friend of the previous day he lay perfectly still the movement and rustle continued and it now seemed long and undulating lances eyes suddenly became set he was intensely keenly awake it was not a snake but the hand of a human arm half hidden in the moss groping for the weapon in that flash of perception he saw that it was small bare and deeply freckled in an instant he grasped it firmly and rose to his feet dragging to his own level as he did so the struggling figure of a young girl  leave me go she said more ashamed than frightened  lance looked at her she was scarcely more than fifteen slight and lithe with a boyish flatness of breast and back her flushed face and bare throat were absolutely peppered with minute brown freckles like grains of spent gunpowder her eyes which were large and gray presented the singular spectacle of being also freckledat least they were shot through in pupil and cornea with tiny spots like powdered allspice her hair was even more remarkable in its tawny deerskin color full of lighter shades and bleached to the faintest of blondes on the crown of her head as if by the action of the sun she had evidently outgrown her dress which was made for a smaller child and the too brief skirt disclosed a bare freckled and sandy desert of shapely limb for which the darned stockings were equally too scant lance let his grasp slip from her thin wrist to her hand and then with a goodhumored gesture tossed it lightly back to her  she did not retreat but continued looking at him in a halfsurly embarrassment  i aint a bit frightened she said im not going to run awaydont you fear  glad to hear it said lance with unmistakable satisfaction but why did you go for my revolver  she flushed again and was silent presently she began to kick the earth at the roots of the tree and said as if confidentially to her foot  i wanted to get hold of it before you did  you didand why  oh you know why  every tooth in lances head showed that he did perfectly but he was discreetly silent  i didnt know what you were hiding there for she went on still addressing the tree and looking at him sideways under her white lashes i didnt see your face  this subtle compliment was the first suggestion of her artful sex it actually sent the blood into the careless rascals face and for a moment confused him he coughed so you thought youd freeze on to that sixshooter of mine until you saw my hand  she nodded then she picked up a broken hazel branch fitted it into the small of her back threw her tanned bare arms over the ends of it and expanded her chest and her biceps at the same moment this simple action was supposed to convey an impression at once of ease and muscular force  perhaps youd like to take it now said lance handing her the pistol  ive seen sixshooters before now said the girl evading the proffered weapon and its suggestion dad has one and my brother had two derringers before he was half as big as me  she stopped to observe in her companion the effect of this capacity of her family to bear arms lance only regarded her amusedly presently she again spoke abruptly  what made you eat that grass just now  grass echoed lance  yes there pointing to the yerba buena  lance laughed i was hungry look he said gayly tossing some silver into the air do you think you could get me some breakfast for that and have enough left to buy something for yourself  the girl eyed the money and the man with halfbashful curiosity  i reckon dad might give ye suthing if he had a mind ter though ez a rule hes down on tramps ever since they run off his chickens ye might try  but i want you to try you can bring it to me here  the girl retreated a step dropped her eyes and with a smile that was a charming hesitation between bashfulness and impudence said so you are hidin are ye  thats just it your heads level i am laughed lance unconcernedly  yur aint one o the mccarthy gangare ye  mr lance harriott felt a momentary moral exaltation in declaring truthfully that he was not one of a notorious band of mountain freebooters known in the district under that name  nor ye aint one of them chicken lifters that raided hendersons ranch we dont go much on that kind o cattle yer  no said lance cheerfully  nor ye aint that chap ez beat his wife unto death at santa clara  lance honestly scorned the imputation such conjugal ill treatment as he had indulged in had not been physical and had been with other mens wives  there was a moments further hesitation on the part of the girl then she said shortly  well then i reckon you kin come along with me  where asked lance  to the ranch she replied simply  then you wont bring me anything to eat here  what for you kin get it down there lance hesitated i tell you its all right she continued ill make it all right with dad  but suppose i reckon id rather stay here persisted lance with a perfect consciousness however of affectation in his caution  stay away then said the girl coolly only as dad perempted this yer woods  preempted suggested lance  perempted or preempted as you like continued the girl scornfullyez hes got a holt on this yer woods ye might ez well see him down thar ez here for here hes like to come any minit you can bet your life on that  she must have read lances amusement in his eyes for she again dropped her own with a frown of brusque embarrassment come along then im your man said lance gayly extending his hand  she would not accept it eying it however furtively like a horse about to shy hand me your pistol first she said  he handed it to her with an assumption of gayety she received it on her part with unfeigned seriousness and threw it over her shoulder like a gun this combined action of the child and heroine it is quite unnecessary to say afforded lance undiluted joy  you go first she said  lance stepped promptly out with a broad grin looks kinder as if i was a prisner dont it he suggested  go on and dont fool she replied  the two fared onward through the wood for one moment he entertained the facetious idea of appearing to rush frantically away just to see what the girl would do but abandoned it its an even thing if she wouldnt spot me the first pop he reflected admiringly  when they had reached the open hillside lance stopped inquiringly this way she said pointing toward the summit and in quite an opposite direction to the valley where he had heard the voices one of which he now recognized as hers they skirted the thicket for a few moments and then turned sharply into a trail which began to dip toward a ravine leading to the valley  why do you have to go all the way round he asked  we dont the girl replied with emphasis theres a shorter cut  where  thats telling she answered shortly  whats your name asked lance after a steep scramble and a drop into the ravine  flip  what  flip  i mean your first nameyour front name  flip  flip oh short for felipa  it aint flipperits flip and she relapsed into silence  you dont ask me mine suggested lance  she did not vouchsafe a reply  then you dont want to know  maybe dad will you can lie to him  this direct answer apparently sustained the agreeable homicide for some moments he moved onward silently exuding admiration  only added flip with a sudden caution youd better agree with me  the trail here turned again abruptly and reëntered the cañon lance looked up and noticed they were almost directly beneath the bay thicket and the plateau that towered far above them the trail here showed signs of clearing and the way was marked by felled trees and stumps of pines  what does your father do here he finally asked flip remained silent swinging the revolver lance repeated his question  burns charcoal and makes diamonds said flip looking at him from the corners of her eyes  makes diamonds echoed lance  flip nodded her head  many of em he continued carelessly  lots but theyre not big she returned with a sidelong glance  oh theyre not big said lance gravely  they had by this time reached a small staked inclosure whence the sudden fluttering and cackle of poultry welcomed the return of the evident mistress of this sylvan retreat it was scarcely imposing further on a cooking stove under a tree a saddle and bridle a few household implements scattered about indicated the ranch like most pioneer clearings it was simply a disorganized raid upon nature that had left behind a desolate battlefield strewn with waste and decay the fallen trees the crushed thicket the splintered limbs the rudely tornup soil were made hideous by their grotesque juxtaposition with the wrecked fragments of civilization in empty cans broken bottles battered hats soleless boots frayed stockings castoff rags and the crowning absurdity of the twistedwire skeleton of a hooped skirt hanging from a branch the wildest defile the densest thicket the most virgin solitude was less dreary and forlorn than this first footprint of man the only redeeming feature of this prolonged bivouac was the cabin itself built of the halfcylindrical strips of pine bark and thatched with the same material it had a certain picturesque rusticity but this was an accident of economy rather than taste for which flip apologized by saying that the bark of the pine was no good for charcoal  i reckon dads in the woods she added pausing before the open door of the cabin oh dad her voice clear and high seemed to fill the whole long cañon and echoed from the green plateau above the monotonous strokes of an axe were suddenly intermitted and somewhere from the depths of the closeset pines a voice answered flip there was a pause of a few moments with some muttering stumbling and crackling in the underbrush and then the appearance of dad  had lance first met him in the thicket he would have been puzzled to assign his race to mongolian indian or ethiopian origin perfunctory but incomplete washings of his hands and face after charcoal burning had gradually ground into his skin a grayish slatepencil pallor grotesquely relieved at the edges where the washing had left off with a border of a darker color he looked like an overworked christy minstrel with the briefest of intervals between his performances there were black rims in the orbits of his eyes as if he gazed feebly out of unglazed spectacles which heightened his simian resemblance already grotesquely exaggerated by what appeared to be repeated and spasmodic experiments in dyeing his gray hair without the slightest notice of lance he inflicted his protesting and querulous presence entirely on his daughter  well whats up now yer ye are calling me from work an hour before noon dog my skin ef i ever get fairly limbered up afore its dad and oh dad  to lances intense satisfaction the girl received this harangue with an air of supreme indifference and when dad had relapsed into an unintelligible and as it seemed to lance a halffrightened muttering she said coolly  yed better drop that axe and scoot round getten this stranger some breakfast and some grub to take with him hes one of them san francisco sports out here troutfishing in the branch hes got adrift from his party has lost his rod and fixins and had to camp out last night in the gin and ginger woods  thats just it its allers suthin like that screamed the old man dashing his fist on his leg in a feeble impotent passion but without looking at lance why in blazes dont he go up to that there blamed hotel on the summit why in thunderbut here he caught his daughters large freckled eyes full in his own he blinked feebly his voice fell into a tone of whining entreaty now look yer flip its playing it rather low down on the old man this yer running in o tramps and desarted emigrants and castashore sailors and forlorn widders and ravin lunatics on this yer ranch i put it to you mister he said abruptly turning to lance for the first time but as if he had already taken an active part in the conversationi put it as a gentleman yourself and a fairminded sportin man if this is the square thing  before lance could reply flip had already begun thats just it dye reckon being a sportin man and a a 1 feller hes goin to waltz down inter that hotel rigged out ez he is dye reckon hes goin to let his partners get the laugh onter him dye reckon hes goin to show his head outer this yer ranch till he can do it square not much go long dad youre talking silly  the old man weakened he feebly trailed his axe between his legs to a stump and sat down wiping his forehead with his sleeve and imparting to it the appearance of a slate with a difficult sum partly rubbed out he looked despairingly at lance in course he said with a deep sigh you naturally aint got any money in course you left your pocketbook containing fifty dollars under a stone and cant find it in course he continued as he observed lance put his hand to his pocket youve only got a blank check on wells fargo  co for a hundred dollars and youd like me to give you the difference  amused as lance evidently was at this his absolute admiration for flip absorbed everything else with his eyes fixed upon the girl he briefly assured the old man that he would pay for everything he wanted he did this with a manner quite different from the careless easy attitude he had assumed toward flip at least the quickwitted girl noticed it and wondered if he was angry it was quite true that ever since his eye had fallen upon another of his own sex its glance had been less frank and careless certain traits of possible impatience which might develop into manslaying were coming to the fore yet a word or a gesture of flips was sufficient to change that manner and when with the fretful assistance of her father she had prepared a somewhat sketchy and primitive repast he questioned the old man about diamondmaking the eye of dad kindled  i want ter know how ye knew i was making diamonds he asked with a certain bashful pettishness not unlike his daughters  heard it in frisco replied lance with glib mendacity glancing at the girl  i reckon theyre gettin sort of skeert down therethem jewelers chuckled dad yet its in nater that their figgers will have to come down its only a question of the price of charcoal i suppose they didnt tell you how i made the discovery  lance would have stopped the old mans narrative by saying that he knew the story but he wished to see how far flip lent herself to her fathers delusion  ye see one night about two years ago i had a pit o charcoal burning out there and tho it had been asmouldering and asmoking and ablazing for nigh unto a month somehow it didnt charcoal worth a cent and yet dog my skin but the heat o that er pit was suthin hidyus and frightful ye couldnt stand within a hundred yards of it and they could feel it on the stage road three miles over yon tother side the mountain there was nights when me and flip had to take our blankets up the ravine and camp out all night and the back of this yer hut shriveled up like that bacon it was about as nigh on to hell as any sample ye kin get here now mebbe you think i built that air fire mebbe youll allow the heat was just the natral burning of that pit  certainly said lance trying to see flips eyes which were resolutely averted  thets whar youd be lyin that yar heat kem out of the bowels of the yearthkem up like out of a chimbley or a blast and kep up that yar fire and when she cools down a month after and i got to strip her there was a hole in the yearth and a spring o bilin scaldin water pourin out of it ez big as your waist and right in the middle of it was this yer he rose with the instinct of a skillful raconteur and whisked from under his bunk a chamois leather bag which he emptied on the table before them it contained a small fragment of native rock crystal halffused upon a petrified bit of pine it was so glaringly truthful so really what it purported to be that the most unscientific woodman or pioneer would have understood it at a glance lance raised his mirthful eyes to flip  it was cooled suddintstunted by the water said the girl eagerly she stopped and as abruptly turned away her eyes and her reddened face  thats it thats just it continued the old man thars flip thar knows it she aint no fool lance did not speak but turned a hard unsympathizing look upon the old man and rose almost roughly the old man clutched his coat thats it ye see the carbons just turning to dimens and stunted and why cos the heat wasnt kep up long enough mebbe yer think i stopped thar that aint me thars a pit out yar in the woods ez hez been burning six months it haint in course got the advantages o the old one for its natral heat but im keeping that heat up ive got a hole where i kin watch it every four hours when the time comes im thar dont you see thats me thats david fairleythats the old manyou bet  thats so said lance curtly and now mr fairley if youll hand me over a coat or jacket till i can get past these fogs on the monterey road i wont keep you from your diamond pit he threw down a handful of silver on the table  thers a deerskin jacket yer said the old man that one o them vaqueros left for the price of a bottle of whiskey  i reckon it wouldnt suit the stranger said flip dubiously producing a muchworn slashed and braided vaqueros jacket but it did suit lance who found it warm and also had suddenly found a certain satisfaction in opposing flip when he had put it on and nodded coldly to the old man and carelessly to flip he walked to the door  if youre going to take the monterey road i can show you a short cut to it said flip with a certain kind of shy civility  the paternal fairley groaned thats it let the chickens and the ranch go to thunder as long as theres a stranger to trapse round with go on  lance would have made some savage reply but flip interrupted you know yourself dad its a blind trail and as that ere constable that kem out here hunting french pete couldnt find it and had to go round by the cañon like ez not the stranger would lose his way and have to come back this dangerous prospect silenced the old man and flip and lance stepped into the road together they walked on for some moments without speaking suddenly lance turned upon his companion  you did nt swallow all that rot about the diamond did you he asked crossly  flip ran a little ahead as if to avoid a reply  you dont mean to say thats the sort of hog wash the old man serves out to you regularly continued lance becoming more slangy in his ill temper  i dont know that its any consarn o yours what i think replied flip hopping from boulder to boulder as they crossed the bed of a dry watercourse  and i suppose youve piloted round and drynussed every tramp and deadbeat youve met since you came here continued lance with unmistakable ill humor how many have you helped over this road  its a year since there was a chinaman chased by some irishmen from the crossing into the brush about yer and he was too afeered to come out and nigh most starved to death in thar i had to drag him out and start him on the mountain for you couldnt get him back to the road he was the last one but you  do you reckon its the right thing for a girl like you to run about with trash of this kind and mix herself up with all sorts of roughs and bad company said lance  flip stopped short look if youre goin to talk like dad ill go back  the ridiculousness of such a resemblance struck him more keenly than a consciousness of his own ingratitude he hastened to assure flip that he was joking when he had made his peace they fell into talk again lance becoming unselfish enough to inquire into one or two facts concerning her life which did not immediately affect him her mother had died on the plains when she was a baby and her brother had run away from home at twelve she fully expected to see him again and thought he might sometime stray into their cañon that is why then you take so much stock in tramps said lance  you expect to recognize him  well replied flip gravely there is suthing in that and theres suthing in this some o these chaps might run across brother and do him a good turn for the sake of me  like me for instance suggested lance  like you youd do him a good turn wouldnt you  you bet said lance with a sudden emotion that quite startled him only dont you go to throwing yourself round promiscuously he was half conscious of an irritating sense of jealousy as he asked if any of her protégés had ever returned  no said flip no one ever did it shows she added with sublime simplicity i had done em good and they could get on alone dont it  it does responded lance grimly have you any other friends that come  only the postmaster at the crossing  the postmaster  yes hes reckonin to marry me next year if im big enough  and what do you reckon asked lance earnestly  flip began a series of distortions with her shoulders ran on ahead picked up a few pebbles and threw them into the wood glanced back at lance with swimming mottled eyes that seemed a piquant incarnation of everything suggestive and tantalizing and said  thats telling  they had by this time reached the spot where they were to separate look said flip pointing to a faint deflection of their path which seemed however to lose itself in the underbrush a dozen yards away thers your trail it gets plainer and broader the further you get on but you must use your eyes here and get to know it well afore you get into the fog goodby  goodby lance took her hand and drew her beside him she was still redolent of the spices of the thicket and to the young mans excited fancy seemed at that moment to personify the perfume and intoxication of her native woods half laughingly half earnestly he tried to kiss her she struggled for some time strongly but at the last moment yielded with a slight return and the exchange of a subtle fire that thrilled him and left him standing confused and astounded as she ran away he watched her lithe nymphlike figure disappear in the checkered shadows of the wood and then he turned briskly down the halfhidden trail his eyesight was keen he made good progress and was soon well on his way toward the distant ridge  but flips return had not been as rapid when she reached the wood she crept to its beetling verge and looking across the cañon watched lances figure as it vanished and reappeared in the shadows and sinuosities of the ascent when he reached the ridge the outlying fog crept across the summit caught him in its embrace and wrapped him from her gaze flip sighed raised herself put her alternate foot on a stump and took a long pull at her toobrief stockings when she had pulled down her skirt and endeavored once more to renew the intimacy that had existed in previous years between the edge of her petticoat and the top of her stockings she sighed again and went home   chapter iii  for six months the sea fogs monotonously came and went along the monterey coast for six months they beleaguered the coast range with afternoon sorties of white hosts that regularly swept over the mountain crest and were as regularly beaten back again by the leveled lances of the morning sun for six months that white veil which had once hidden lance harriott in its folds returned without him for that amiable outlaw no longer needed disguise or hidingplace the swift wave of pursuit that had dashed him on the summit had fallen back and the next day was broken and scattered before the week had passed a regular judicial inquiry relieved his crime of premeditation and showed it to be a rude duel of two armed and equally desperate men from a secure vantage in a seacoast town lance challenged a trial by his peers and as an already prejudged man escaping from his executioners obtained a change of venue regular justice seated by the calm pacific found the action of an interior irregular jury rash and hasty lance was liberated on bail  the postmaster at fishers crossing had just received the weekly mail and express from san francisco and was engaged in examining it it consisted of five letters and two parcels of these three of the letters and the two parcels were directed to flip it was not the first time during the last six months that this extraordinary event had occurred and the curiosity of the crossing was duly excited as flip had never called personally for the letters or parcels but had sent one of her wild irregular scouts or henchmen to bring them and as she was seldom seen at the crossing or on the stage road that curiosity was never satisfied the disappointment to the postmastera man past the middle agepartook of a sentimental nature he looked at the letters and parcels he looked at his watch it was yet early he could return by noon he again examined the addresses they were in the same handwriting as the previous letters his mind was made up he would deliver them himself the poetic soulful side of his mission was delicately indicated by a pale blue necktie a clean shirt and a small package of gingernuts of which flip was extravagantly fond  the common road to fairleys ranch was by the stage turnpike to a point below the gin and ginger woods where the prudent horseman usually left his beast and followed the intersecting trail afoot it was here that the postmaster suddenly observed on the edge of the wood the figure of an elegantly dressed woman she was walking slowly and apparently at her ease one hand held her skirts lightly gathered between her gloved fingers the other slowly swung a ridingwhip was it a picnic of some people from monterey or santa cruz the spectacle was novel enough to justify his coming nearer suddenly she withdrew into the wood he lost sight of her she was gone he remembered however that flip was still to be seen and as the steep trail was beginning to tax all his energies he was fain to hurry forward the sun was nearly vertical when he turned into the cañon and saw the bark roof of the cabin beyond at almost the same moment flip appeared flushed and panting in the road before him  youve got something for me she said pointing to the parcel and letter completely taken by surprise the postmaster mechanically yielded them up and as instantly regretted it theyre paid for continued flip observing his hesitation  thats so stammered the official of the crossing seeing his last chance of knowing the contents of the parcel vanish but i thought ez its a valooable package maybe ye might want to examine it to see that it was all right afore ye receipted for it  ill risk it said flip coolly and if it aint right ill let ye know  as the girl seemed inclined to retire with her property the postmaster was driven to other conversation we aint had the pleasure of seeing you down at the crossing for a month o sundays he began with airy yet pronounced gallantry some folks let on you was keepin company with some feller like bijah brown and you were getting a little too set up for the crossing the individual here mentioned being the county butcher and supposed to exhibit his hopeless affection for flip by making a long and useless divergence from his weekly route to enter the cañon for orders flip did not deem it necessary to reply then i allowed how ez you might have company he continued i reckon theres some city folks up at the summit i saw a mighty smart fashnble gal cavorting round hed no end o style and fancy fixins thats my kind i tell you i just weaken on that sort o gal he continued in the firm belief that he had awakened flips jealousy as he glanced at her wellworn homespun frock and found her eyes suddenly fixed on his own  strange i aint got to see her yet she replied coolly shouldering her parcel and quite ignoring any sense of obligation to him for his extraofficial act  but you might get to see her at the edge of the gin and ginger woods he persisted feebly in a last effort to detain her if youll take a pasear there with me  flips only response was to walk on toward the cabin whence with a vague complimentary suggestion of dropin in to pass the time o day with her father the postmaster meekly followed  the paternal fairley once convinced that his daughters new companion required no pecuniary or material assistance from his hands relaxed to the extent of entering into a querulous confidence with him during which flip took the opportunity of slipping away as fairley had that infelicitous tendency of most weak natures to unconsciously exaggerate unimportant details in their talk the postmaster presently became convinced that the butcher was a constant and assiduous suitor of flips the absurdity of his sending parcels and letters by post when he might bring them himself did not strike the official on the contrary he believed it to be a masterstroke of cunning fired by jealousy and flips indifference he deemed it his dutyusing that facile form of cowardly offensivenessto betray flip  of which she was happily oblivious once away from the cabin she plunged into the woods with the parcel swung behind her like a knapsack leaving the trail she presently struck off in a straight line through cover and underbrush with the unerring instinct of an animal climbing hand over hand the steepest ascent or fluttering like a bird from branch to branch down the deepest declivity she soon reached that part of the trail where the susceptible postmaster had seen the fascinating unknown assuring herself she was not followed she crept through the thicket until she reached a little waterfall and basin that had served the fugitive lance for a bath the spot bore signs of later and more frequent occupancy and when flip carefully removed some bark and brushwood from a cavity in the rock and drew forth various folded garments it was evident she used it as a sylvan dressingroom here she opened the parcel it contained a small and delicate shawl of yellow china crèpe flip instantly threw it over her shoulders and stepped hurriedly toward the edge of the wood then she began to pass backward and forward before the trunk of a tree at first nothing was visible on the tree but a closer inspection showed a large pane of ordinary window glass stuck in the fork of the branches it was placed at such a cunning angle against the darkness of the forest opening that it made a soft and mysterious mirror not unlike a claude lorraine glass wherein not only the passing figure of the young girl was seen but the dazzling green and gold of the hillside and the faroff silhouetted crests of the coast range  but this was evidently only a prelude to a severer rehearsal when she returned to the waterfall she unearthed from her stores a large piece of yellow soap and some yards of rough cotton sheeting these she deposited beside the basin and again crept to the edge of the wood to assure herself that she was alone satisfied that no intruding foot had invaded that virgin bower she returned to her bath and began to undress a slight wind followed her and seemed to whisper to the circumjacent trees it appeared to waken her sister naiads and nymphs who joining their leafy fingers softly drew around her a gently moving band of trembling lights and shadows of flecked sprays and inextricably mingled branches and involved her in a chaste sylvan obscurity veiled alike from pursuing god or stumbling shepherd within these hallowed precincts was the musical ripple of laughter and falling water and at times the glimpse of a lithe briercaught limb or a ray of sunlight trembling over bright flanks or the white austere outline of a childish bosom  when she drew again the leafy curtain and once more stepped out of the wood she was completely transformed  it was the figure that had appeared to the postmaster the slight erect graceful form of a young woman modishly attired it was flip but flip made taller by the lengthened skirt and clinging habiliments of fashion flip freckled but through the cunning of a relief of yellow color in her gown her piquant brownshot face and eyes brightened and intensified until she seemed like a spicy odor made visible i cannot affirm that the judgment of flips mysterious modiste was infallible or that the taste of mr lance harriott her patron was fastidious enough that it was picturesque and perhaps not more glaring and extravagant than the color in which spring herself had once clothed the sere hillside where flip was now seated the phantom mirror in the tree fork caught and held her with the sky the green leaves the sunlight and all the graciousness of her surroundings and the wind gently tossed her hair and the gay ribbons of her gypsy hat suddenly she started some remote sound in the trail below inaudible to any ear less fine than hers arrested her breathing she rose swiftly and darted into cover  ten minutes passed the sun was declining the white fog was beginning to creep over the coast range from the edge of the wood cinderella appeared disenchanted and in her homespun garments the clock had struckthe spell was past as she disappeared down the trail even the magic mirror moved by the wind slipped from the treetop to the ground and became a piece of common glass   chapter iv  the events of the day had produced a remarkable impression on the facial aspect of the charcoalburning fairley extraordinary processes of thought indicated by repeated rubbing of his forehead had produced a high light in the middle and a corresponding deepening of shadow at the sides until it bore the appearance of a perfect sphere it was this forehead that confronted flip reproachfully as became a deceived comrade menacingly as became an outraged parent in the presence of a third party anda postmaster  fine doins this yer receivin clandecent bundles and letters eh he began flip sent one swift withering look of contempt at the postmaster who at once becoming invertebrate and groveling mumbled that he must get on to the crossing and rose to go but the old man who had counted on his presence for moral support and was clearly beginning to hate him for precipitating this scene with his daughter whom he feared violently protested  sit down cant ye dont you see youre a witness he screamed hysterically  it was a fatal suggestion witness repeated flip scornfully  yes a witness he gave ye letters and bundles  werent they directed to me asked flip  yes said the postmaster hesitatingly in course yes  do you lay claim to them she said turning to her father  no responded the old man  do you sharply to the postmaster  no he replied  then said flip coolly if youre not claimin em for yourself and you hear father say they aint his i reckon the less you have to say about em the better  thars suthin in that said the old man shamelessly abandoning the postmaster  then why dont she say who sent em and what they are like said the postmaster if theres nothing in it  yes echoed dad flip why dont you  without answering the direct question flip turned upon her father  maybe you forget how you used to row and tear round here because tramps and such like came to the ranch for suthin and i gave it to em maybe youll quit tearin round and letting yourself be made a fool of now by that man just because one of those tramps gets up and sends us some presents back in turn  twasnt me flip said the old man deprecatingly but glaring at the astonished postmaster twasnt my doin i allus said if you cast your bread on the waters it would come back to you by return mail the fact is the govment is getting too highhanded some o these bloated officials had better climb down before next leckshen  maybe continued flip to her father without looking at her discomfited visitor yed better find out whether one of those officials comes up to this yer ranch to steal away a gal about my own size or to get points about diamondmaking i reckon he dont travel round to find out who writes all the letters that go through the post office  the postmaster had seemingly miscalculated the old mans infirm temper and the daughters skillful use of it he was unprepared for flips boldness and audacity and when he saw that both barrels of the accusation had taken effect on the charcoalburner who was rising with epileptic rage he fairly turned and fled the old man would have followed him with objurgation beyond the door but for the restraining hand of flip  baffled and beaten nevertheless fate was not wholly unkind to the retreating suitor near the gin and ginger woods he picked up a letter which had fallen from flips packet he recognized the writing and did not scruple to read it it was not a love epistleat least not such a one as he would have writtenit did not give the address nor the name of the correspondent but he read the following with greedy eyes  perhaps its just as well that you dont rig yourself out for the benefit of those deadbeats at the crossing or any tramp that might hang round the ranch keep all your style for me when i come i cant tell you when its mighty uncertain before the rainy season but im coming soon dont go back on your promise about lettin up on the tramps and being a little more hightoned and dont you give em so much its true i sent you hats twice i clean forgot all about the first but i wouldnt have given a tendollar hat to a nigger woman who had a sick baby because i had an extra hat id have let that baby slide i forgot to ask whether the skirt is worn separately i must see that dressmaker sharp about it but i think youll want something on besides a jacket and skirt at least it looks like it up here i dont think you could manage a piano down there without the old man knowing it and raisin the devil generally i promised you id let up on him mind you keep all your promises to me im glad youre gettin on with the sixshooter tin cans are good at fifteen yards but try it on suthin that moves i forgot to say that i am on the track of your big brother its a three years old track and he was in arizona the friend who told me didnt expatiate much on what he did there but i reckon they had a high old time if hes above the earth ill find him you bet the yerba buena and the southern wood came all rightthey smelt like you say flip do you remember the lastthe very lastthing that happened when you said goodby on the trail dont let me ever find out that youve let anybody else kiss  but here the virtuous indignation of the postmaster found vent in an oath he threw the letter away he retained of it only two factsflip had a brother who was missing she had a lover present in the flesh  how much of the substance of this and previous letters flip had confided to her father i cannot say if she suppressed anything it was probably that which affected lances secret alone and it was doubtful how much of that she herself knew in her own affairs she was frank without being communicative and never lost her shy obstinacy even with her father governing the old man as completely as she did she appeared most embarrassed when she was most dominant she had her own way without lifting her voice or her eyes she seemed oppressed by mauvaise honte when she was most triumphant she would end a discussion with a shy murmur addressed to herself or a single gesture of selfconsciousness  the disclosure of her strange relations with an unknown man and the exchange of presents and confidences seemed to suddenly awake fairley to a vague uneasy sense of some unfulfilled duties as a parent the first effect of this on his weak nature was a peevish antagonism to the cause of it he had long fretful monologues on the vanity of diamondmaking if accompanied with pestering by interlopers on the wickedness of concealment and conspiracy and their effects on charcoalburning on the nurturing of spies and adders in the family circle and on the seditiousness of dark and mysterious councils in which a grayhaired father was left out it was true that a word or look from flip generally brought these monologues to an inglorious and abrupt termination but they were none the less lugubrious as long as they lasted in time they were succeeded by an affectation of contrite apology and selfdepreciation dont go out o the way to ask the old man he would say referring to the quantity of bacon to be ordered its natral a young gal should have her own advisers the state of the flourbarrel would also produce a like selfabasement unless yere already in correspondence about more flour ye might take the opinion o the first tramp ye meet ez to whether santa cruz mills is a good brand but dont ask the old man if flip was in conversation with the butcher fairley would obtrusively retire with the hope he wasnt intrudin on their secrets  these phases of her fathers weakness were not frequent enough to excite her alarm but she could not help noticing they were accompanied with a seriousness unusual to him he began to be tremulously watchful of her returning often from work at an earlier hour and lingering by the cabin in the morning he brought absurd and useless presents for her and presented them with a nervous anxiety poorly concealed by an assumption of careless paternal generosity suthin i picked up at the crossin for ye today he would say airily and retire to watch the effect of a pair of shoes two sizes too large or a fur cap in september he would have hired a cheap parlor organ for her but for the apparently unexpected revelation that she couldnt play he had received the news of a clue to his longlost son without emotion but lately he seemed to look upon it as a foregone conclusion and one that necessarily solved the question of companionship for flip in course when youve got your own flesh and blood with ye ye cant go foolin around with strangers these autumnal blossoms of affection i fear came too late for any effect upon flip precociously matured by her fathers indifference and selfishness but she was goodhumored and seeing him seriously concerned gave him more of her time even visited him in the sacred seclusion of the diamond pit and listened with faroff eyes to his fitful indictment of all things outside his grimy laboratory much of this patient indifference came with a capricious change in her own habits she no longer indulged in the rehearsal of dress she packed away her most treasured garments and her leafy boudoir knew her no more she sometimes walked on the hillside and often followed the trail she had taken with lance when she led him to the ranch she once or twice extended her walk to the spot where she had parted from him and as often came shyly away her eyes downcast and her face warm with color perhaps because these experiences and some mysterious instinct of maturing womanhood had left a story in her eyes which her two adorers the postmaster and the butcher read with passion she became famous without knowing it extravagant stories of her fascinations brought strangers into the valley the effect upon her father may be imagined lance could not have desired a more effective guardian than he proved to be in this emergency those who had been told of this hidden pearl were surprised to find it so jealously protected   chapter v  the long parched summer had drawn to its dusty close much of it was already blown abroad and dissipated on trail and turnpike or crackled in harsh unelastic fibres on hillside and meadow some of it had disappeared in the palpable smoke by day and fiery crests by night of burning forests the besieging fogs on the coast range daily thinned their hosts and at last vanished the wind changed from northwest to southwest the salt breath of the sea was on the summit and then one day the staring unchanged sky was faintly touched with remote mysterious clouds and grew tremulous in expression the next morning dawned upon a newer face in the heavens on changed woods on altered outlines on vanished crests on forgotten distances it was raining  four weeks of this change with broken spaces of sunlight and intense blue aerial islands and then a storm set in all day the summit pines and redwoods rocked in the blast at times the onset of the rain seemed to be held back by the fury of the gale or was visibly seen in sharp waves on the hillside unknown and concealed watercourses suddenly overflowed the trails pools became lakes and brooks rivers hidden from the storm the sylvan silence of sheltered valleys was broken by the impetuous rush of waters even the tiny streamlet that traversed flips retreat in the gin and ginger woods became a cascade  the storm drove fairley from his couch early the falling of a large tree across the trail and the sudden overflow of a small stream beside it hastened his steps  but he was doomed to encounter what was to him a more disagreeable objecta human figure by the bedraggled drapery that flapped and fluttered in the wind by the long unkempt hair that hid the face and eyes and by the grotesquely misplaced bonnet the old man recognized one of his old trespassersan indian squaw  clear out er that come make tracks will ye the old man screamed but here the wind stopped his voice and drove him against a hazelbush  me heap sick answered the squaw shivering through her muddy shawl  ill make ye a heap sicker if ye dont vamose the ranch continued fairley advancing  me wantee wangee girl wangee girl give me heap grub said the squaw without moving  you bet your life groaned the old man to himself nevertheless an idea struck him ye aint brought no presents hev ye he asked cautiously ye aint got no pooty things for poor wangee girl he continued insinuatingly  me got heap cache nuts and berries said the squaw  oh in course in course thats just it screamed fairley youve got em cached only two mile from yer and youll go and get em for a half dollar cash down  me bring wangee girl to cache replied the indian pointing to the wood honest injin  another bright idea struck mr fairley but it required some elaboration hurrying the squaw with him through the pelting rain he reached the shelter of the corral vainly the shivering aborigine drew her tightly bandaged papoose closer to her square flat breast and looked longingly toward the cabin the old man backed her against the palisade here he cautiously imparted his dark intentions to employ her to keep watch and ward over the ranch and especially over its young mistressclear out all the tramps ceptin yourself and ill keep ye in grub and rum many and deliberate repetitions of this offer in various forms at last seemed to affect the squaw she nodded violently and echoed the last word rum now she added the old man hesitated she was in possession of his secret he groaned and promising an immediate installment of liquor led her to the cabin  the door was so securely fastened against the impact of the storm that some moments elapsed before the bar was drawn and the old man had become impatient and profane when it was partly opened by flip he hastily slipped in dragging the squaw after him and cast one single suspicious glance around the rude apartment which served as a sittingroom flip had apparently been writing a small inkstand was still on the board table but her paper had evidently been concealed before she allowed them to enter the squaw instantly squatted before the adobe hearth warmed her bundled baby and left the ceremony of introduction to her companion flip regarded the two with calm preoccupation and indifference the only thing that touched her interest was the old squaws draggled skirt and limp neckerchief they were flips own long since abandoned and cast off in the gin and ginger woods secrets again whined fairley still eying flip furtively secrets again in coursein coursejiss so secrets that must be kep from the ole man dark doins by ones own flesh and blood go on go on dont mind me flip did not reply she had even lost the interest in her old dress perhaps it had only touched some note in unison with her revery  cant ye get the poor critter some whiskey he queried fretfully ye used to be peart enuff before as flip turned to the corner to lift the demijohn fairley took occasion to kick the squaw with his foot and indicate by extravagant pantomime that the bargain was not to be alluded to before the girl flip poured out some whiskey in a tin cup and approaching the squaw handed it to her its like ez not continued fairley to his daughter but looking at the squaw that shell be huntin the woods off and on and kinder looking after the last pit near the madroños yell give her grub and licker ez she likes well dye hear flip are ye moonin agin with yer secrets whats gone with ye  if the child were dreaming it was a delicious dream her magnetic eyes were suffused by a strange light as though the eye itself had blushed her full pulse showed itself more in the rounding outline of her cheek than in any deepening of color indeed if there was any heightening of tint it was in her freckles which fairly glistened like tiny spangles her eyes were downcast her shoulders slightly bent but her voice was low and clear and thoughtful as ever  one o the big pines above the madroño pit has blown over into the run she said its choked up the water and its risin fast like ez not its pourin over into the pit by this time  the old man rose with a fretful cry and why in blazes didnt you say so first he screamed catching up his axe and rushing to the door  ye didnt give me a chance said flip raising her eyes for the first time with an impatient imprecation fairley darted by her and rushed into the wood in an instant she had shut the door and bolted it in the same instant the squaw arose dashed the long hair not only from her eyes but from her head tore away her shawl and blanket and revealed the square shoulders of lance harriott flip remained leaning against the door but the young man in rising dropped the bandaged papoose which rolled from his lap into the fire flip with a cry sprang toward it but lance caught her by the waist with one arm as with the other he dragged the bundle from the flames  dont be alarmed he said gayly its only  what said flip trying to disengage herself  my coat and trousers  flip laughed which encouraged lance to another attempt to kiss her she evaded it by diving her head into his waistcoat and saying theres father  but hes gone to clear away that tree suggested lance  one of flips significant silences followed  oh i see he laughed that was a plan to get him away ah she had released herself  why did you come like that she said pointing to his wig and blanket  to see if youd know me he responded  no said flip dropping her eyes its to keep other people from knowing you youre hidin agin  i am returned lance but he interrupted its only the same old thing  but you wrote from monterey that it was all over she persisted  so it would have been he said gloomily but for some dog down here who is hunting up an old scent ill spot him yet andhe stopped suddenly with such utter abstraction of hatred in his fixed and glittering eyes that she almost feared him she laid her hand quite unconsciously on his arm he grasped it his face changed  i couldnt wait any longer to see you flip so i came here anyway he went on i thought to hang round and get a chance to speak to you first when i fell afoul of the old man he didnt know me and tumbled right in my little game why do you believe he wants to hire me for my grub and liquor to act as a sort of sentry over you and the ranch and here he related with great gusto the substance of his interview i reckon as hes that suspicious he concluded id better play it out now as ive begun only its mighty hard i cant see you here before the fire in your fancy toggery flip but must dodge in and out of the wet underbrush in these yer duds of yours that i picked up in the old place in the gin and ginger woods  then you came here just to see me asked flip  i did  for only that  only that  flip dropped her eyes lance had got his other arm around her waist but her resisting little hand was still potent  listen she said at last without looking up but apparently talking to the intruding arm when dad comes ill get him to send you to watch the diamond pit it isnt far its warm and  what  ill come after a bit and see you quit foolin now if youd only have come here like yourselflikelikea white man  the old man interrupted lance would have just passed me on to the summit i couldnt have played the lost fisherman on him at this time of year  ye could have been stopped at the crossing by high water you silly said the girl it was this grammatical obscurity referred to the stagecoach  yes but i might have been tracked to this cabin and look here flip he said suddenly straightening himself and lifting the girls face to a level with his own i dont want you to lie any more for me it aint right  all right ye neednt go to the pit then and i wont come  flip  and heres dad coming quick  lance chose to put his own interpretation on this last adjuration the resisting little hand was now lying quite limp on his shoulder he drew her brown bright face near his own felt her spiced breath on his lips his cheeks his hot eyelids his swimming eyes kissed her hurriedly replaced his wig and blanket and dropped beside the fire with the tremulous laugh of youth and innocent first passion flip had withdrawn to the window and was looking out upon the rocking pines  he dont seem to be coming said lance with a halfshy laugh  no responded flip demurely pressing her hot oval cheek against the wet panes i reckon i was mistaken youre sure she added looking resolutely another way but still trembling like a magnetic needle toward lance as he moved slightly before the fire youre sure youd like me to come to you  sure flip  hush said flip as this reassuring query of reproachful astonishment appeared about to be emphasized by a forward amatory dash of lances hush hes coming this time sure  it was indeed fairley exceedingly wet exceedingly bedraggled exceedingly sponged out as to color and exceedingly profane it appeared that there was indeed a tree that had fallen in the run but that far from diverting the overflow into the pit it had established back water which had forced another outlet all this might have been detected at once by any human intellect not distracted by correspondence with strangers and enfeebled by habitually scorning the intellect of its own progenitor this reckless selfishness had further only resulted in giving rheumatics to that progenitor who now required the external administration of opodeldoc to his limbs and the internal administration of whiskey having thus spoken mr fairley with great promptitude and infantine simplicity at once bared two legs of entirely different colors and mutely waited for his daughter to rub them if flip did this all unconsciously and with the mechanical dexterity of previous habit it was because she did not quite understand the savage eyes and impatient gestures of lance in his encompassing wig and blanket and because it helped her to voice her thought  yell never be able to take yer watch at the diamond pit tonight dad she said and ive been recknin you might set the squaw there instead i can show her what to do  but to flips momentary discomfiture her father promptly objected mebbe ive got suthin else for her to do mebbe i may have my secrets tooeh he said with dark significance at the same time administering a significant nudge to lance which kept up the young mans exasperation no shell rest yer a bit just now ill set her to watchin suthin else like as not when i want her flip fell into one of her suggestive silences lance watched her earnestly mollified by a single furtive glance from her significant eyes the rain dashed against the windows and occasionally spattered and hissed in the hearth of the broad chimney and mr david fairley somewhat assuaged by the internal administration of whiskey grew more loquacious the genius of incongruity and inconsistency which generally ruled his conduct came out with freshened vigor under the gentle stimulation of spirit on an evening like this he began comfortably settling himself on the floor beside the chimney ye might rig yerself out in them new duds and fancy fixins that that sacramento shrimp sent ye and let your own flesh and blood see ye if thats too much to do for your old dad ye might do it to please that digger squaw as a christian act whether in the hidden depths of the old mans consciousness there was a feeling of paternal vanity in showing this wretched aborigine the value and importance of the treasure she was about to guard i cannot say flip darted an interrogatory look at lance who nodded a quiet assent and she flew into the inner room she did not linger on the details of her toilet but reappeared almost the next moment in her new finery buttoning the neck of her gown as she entered the room and chastely stopping at the window to characteristically pull up her stocking the peculiarity of her situation increased her usual shyness she played with the black and gold beads of a handsome necklacelances last giftas the merest child might her unbuckled shoe gave the squaw a natural opportunity of showing her admiration and devotion by insisting upon buckling it and gave lance under that disguise an opportunity of covertly kissing the little foot and ankle in the shadow of the chimney an event which provoked slight hysterical symptoms in flip and caused her to sit suddenly down in spite of the remonstrances of her parent ef you cant quit gigglin and squirmin like an injin baby yourself yed better get rid o them duds he ejaculated with peevish scorn  yet under this perfunctory rebuke his weak vanity could not be hidden and he enjoyed the evident admiration of a creature whom he believed to be halfwitted and degraded all the more keenly because it did not make him jealous she could not take flip from him rendered garrulous by liquor he went to voice his contempt for those who might attempt it taking advantage of his daughters absence to resume her homely garments he whispered confidentially to lance  ye see these yer fine dresses ye might think is presents praps flip lets on they are praps she dont know any better but they aint presents theyre only samples o dressmaking and jewelry that a vain conceited shrimp of a feller up in sacramento sends down here to get customers for in course im to pay for em in course he reckons im to do it in course i calkilate to do it but he neednt try to play em off as presents he talks suthin o coming down here sportin hisself off on flip as a fancy buck not ez long ez the old mans here you bet thoroughly carried away by his fancied wrongs it was perhaps fortunate that he did not observe the flashing eyes of lance behind his lank and lustreless wig but seeing only the figure of lance as he had conjured him he went on thats why i want you to hang around her hang around her ontil my boyhim thats comin home on a visitgets here and i reckon hell clear out that yar sacramento counterjumper only let me get a sight o him afore flip does eh dye hear dog my skin if i dont believe the dd injins drunk it was fortunate that at that moment flip reappeared and dropping on the hearth between her father and the infuriated lance let her hand slip in his with a warning pressure the light touch momentarily recalled him to himself and her but not until the quickwitted girl had revealed to her in one startled wave of consciousness the full extent of lances infirmity of temper with the instinct of awakened tenderness came a sense of responsibility and a vague premonition of danger the coy blossom of her heart was scarce unfolded before it was chilled by approaching shadows fearful of she knew not what she hesitated every moment of lances stay was imperiled by a single word that might spring from his suppressed white lips beyond and above the suspicions his sudden withdrawal might awaken in her fathers breast she was dimly conscious of some mysterious terror without that awaited him she listened to the furious onslaught of the wind upon the sycamores beside their cabin and thought she heard it there she listened to the sharp fusillade of rain upon roof and pane and the turbulent roar and rush of leaping mountain torrents at their very feet and fancied it was there she suddenly sprang to the window and pressing her eyes to the pane saw through the misty turmoil of tossing boughs and swaying branches the scintillating intermittent flames of torches moving on the trail above and knew it was there  in an instant she was collected and calm dad she said in her ordinary indifferent tone theres torches movin up toward the diamond pit likely its tramps ill take the squaw and see and before the old man could stagger to his feet she had dragged lance with her into the road   chapter vi  the wind charged down upon them slamming the door at their backs extinguishing the broad shaft of light that had momentarily shot out into the darkness and swept them a dozen yards away gaining the lee of a madroño tree lance opened his blanketed arms enfolded the girl and felt her for one brief moment tremble and nestle in his bosom like some frightened animal well he said gayly what next flip recovered herself youre safe now anywhere outside the house but did you expect them tonight lance shrugged his shoulders why not hush returned the girl theyre coming this way  the four flickering scattered lights presently dropped into line the trail had been found they were coming nearer flip breathed quickly the spiced aroma of her presence filled the blanket as he drew her tightly beside him he had forgotten the storm that raged around them the mysterious foe that was approaching until flip caught his sleeve with a slight laugh why its kennedy and bijah  whos kennedy and bijah asked lance curtly  kennedys the postmaster and bijahs the butcher  what do they want continued lance  me said flip coyly  you  yes lets run away  half leading half dragging her friend flip made her way with unerring woodcraft down the ravine the sound of voices and even the tumult of the storm became fainter an acrid smell of burning green wood smarted lances lips and eyes in the midst of the darkness beneath him gradually a faint gigantic nimbus like a lurid eye glowed and sank quivered and faded with the spent breath of the gale as it penetrated their retreat the pit whispered flip its safe on the other side she added cautiously skirting the orbit of the great eye and leading him to a sheltered nest of bark and sawdust it was warm and odorous nevertheless they both deemed it necessary to enwrap themselves in the single blanket the eye beamed fitfully upon them occasionally a wave of lambent tremulousness passed across it its weirdness was an excuse for their drawing nearer each other in playful terror  flip  well  what did the other two want to see you too  likely said flip without the least trace of coquetry theres been a lot of strangers yer off and on  perhaps youd like to go back and see them  do you want me to  lances reply was a kiss nevertheless he was vaguely uneasy looks a little as if i were running away dont it he suggested  no said flip they think youre only a squaw its me theyre after lance smarted a little at this infelicitous speech a strange and irritating sensation had been creeping over himit was his first experience of shame and remorse i reckon ill go back and see he said rising abruptly  flip was silent she was thinking believing that the men were seeking her only she knew that their intention would be directed from her companion when it was found out he was no longer with her and she dreaded to meet them in his irritable presence  go she said tell dad somethings wrong in the diamond pit and say im watching it for him here  and you  ill go there and wait for him if he cant get rid of them and they follow him there ill come back here and meet you anyhow ill manage to have dad wait there a spell  she took his hand and led him back by a different path to the trail he was surprised to find that the cabin its window glowing from the fire was only a hundred yards away go in the back way by the shed dont go in the room nor near the light if you can dont talk inside but call or beckon to dad remember she said with a laugh youre keeping watch of me for him pull your hair down on your eyes so this operation like most feminine embellishments of the masculine toilet was attended by a kiss and flip stepping back into the shadow vanished in the storm  lances first movements were inconsistent with his assumed sex he picked up his draggled skirt and drew a bowieknife from his boot from his bosom he took a revolver turning the chambers noiselessly as he felt the caps he then crept toward the cabin softly and gained the shed it was quite dark but for a pencil of light piercing a crack of the rude illfitting door that opened on the sittingroom a single voice not unfamiliar to him raised in halfbrutal triumph greeted his ears a name was mentionedhis own his angry hand was on the latch one moment more and he would have burst the door but in that instant another name was uttereda name that dropped his hand from the latch and the blood from his cheeks he staggered backward passed his hand swiftly across his forehead recovered himself with a gesture of mingled rage and despair and sinking on his knees beside the door pressed his hot temples against the crack  do i know lance harriott said the voice do i know the dd ruffian didnt i hunt him a year ago into the brush three miles from the crossing didnt we lose sight of him the very day he turned up yer at this ranch and got smuggled over into monterey aint it the same man as killed arkansaw bobbob ridleythe name he went by in sonora and who was bob ridley eh who why you dd old fool it was bob fairleyyour son  the old mans voice rose querulous and indistinct  what are ye talkin about interrupted the first speaker i tell you i know look at these pictures i found em on his body look at em pictures of you and your girl praps youll deny them praps youll tell me i lie when i tell you he told me he was your son told me how he ran away from you how you were livin somewhere in the mountains makin gold or suthin else outer charcoal he told me who he was as a secret he never let on he told it to any one else and when i found that the man who killed him lance harriott had been hidin here had been sendin spies all around to find out all about your son had been foolin you and tryin to ruin your gal as he had killed your boy i knew that he knew it too  liar  the door fell in with a crash there was the sudden apparition of the demoniac face still half hidden by the long trailing black locks of hair that curled like medusas around it a cry of terror filled the room three of the men dashed from the door and fled precipitately the man who had spoken sprang toward his rifle in the chimney corner but the movement was his last a blinding flash and shattering report interposed between him and his weapon the impulse carried him forward headlong into the fire that hissed and spluttered with his blood and lance harriott with his smoking pistol strode past him to the door already far down the trail there were hurried voices the crack and crackling of impending branches growing fainter and fainter in the distance lance turned back to the solitary living figurethe old man  yet he might have been dead too he sat so rigid and motionless his fixed eyes staring vacantly at the body on the hearth before him on the table lay the cheap photographs one evidently of himself taken in some remote epoch of complexion one of a child which lance recognized as flip  tell me said lance hoarsely laying his quivering hand on the table was bob ridley your son  my son echoed the old man in a strange faroff voice without turning his eyes from the corpsemy sonisisis there pointing to the dead man hush didnt he tell you so didnt you hear him say it deaddeadshotshot  silence are you crazy man interposed lance tremblingly that is not bob ridley but a dog a coward a liar gone to his reckoning hear me if your son was bob ridley i swear to god i never knew it now ororthen do you hear me tell me do you believe me speak you shall speak  he laid his hand almost menacingly on the old mans shoulder fairley slowly raised his head lance fell back with a groan of horror the weak lips were wreathed with a feeble imploring smile but the eyes wherein the fretful peevish suspicious spirit had dwelt were blank and tenantless the flickering intellect that had lit them was blown out and vanished  lance walked toward the door and remained motionless for a moment gazing into the night when he turned back again toward the fire his face was as colorless as the dead mans on the hearth the fire of passion was gone from his beaten eyes his step was hesitating and slow he went up to the table  i say old man he said with a strange smile and an odd premature suggestion of the infinite weariness of death in his voice you wouldnt mind giving me this would you and he took up the picture of flip the old man nodded repeatedly thank you said lance he went to the door paused a moment and returned goodby old man he said holding out his hand fairley took it with a childish smile hes dead said the old man softly holding lances hand but pointing to the hearth yes said lance with the faintest of smiles on the palest of faces you feel sorry for any one thats dead dont you fairley nodded again lance looked at him with eyes as remote as his own shook his head and turned away when he reached the door he laid his revolver carefully and indeed somewhat ostentatiously upon a chair but when he stepped from the threshold he stopped a moment in the light of the open door to examine the lock of a small derringer which he drew from his pocket he then shut the door carefully and with the same slow hesitating step felt his way into the night  he had but one idea in his mind to find some lonely spot some spot where the footsteps of man would never penetrate some spot that would yield him rest sleep obliteration forgetfulness and above all where he would be forgotten he had seen such places surely there were manywhere bones were picked up of dead men who had faded from the earth and had left no other record if he could only keep his senses now he might find such a spot but he must be careful for her little feet went everywhere and she must never see him again alive or dead and in the midst of his thoughts and the darkness and the storm he heard a voice at his side lance how long you have been                                       left to himself the old man again fell into a vacant contemplation of the dead body before him until a stronger blast swept down like an avalanche upon the cabin burst through the illfastened door and broken chimney and dashing the ashes and living embers over the floor filled the room with blinding smoke and flame fairley rose with a feeble cry and then as if acted upon by some dominant memory groped under the bed until he found his buckskin bag and his precious crystal and fled precipitately from the room lifted by this second shock from his apathy he returned to the fixed idea of his lifethe discovery and creation of the diamondand forgot all else the feeble grasp that his shaken intellect kept of the events of the night relaxed the disguised lance the story of his son the murder slipped into nothingness there remained only the one idea his nightly watch by the diamond pit the instinct of long habit was stronger than the darkness or the onset of the storm and he kept his tottering way over stream and fallen timber until he reached the spot a sudden tremor seemed to shake the lambent flame that had lured him on he thought he heard the sound of voices there were signs of recent disturbancefootprints in the sawdust with a cry of rage and suspicion fairley slipped into the pit and sprang toward the nearest opening to his frenzied fancy it had been tampered with his secret discovered the fruit of his long labors stolen from him that very night with superhuman strength he began to open the pit scattering the halfcharred logs right and left and giving vent to the suffocating gases that rose from the now incandescent charcoal at times the fury of the gale would drive it back and hold it against the sides of the pit leaving the opening free at times following the blind instinct of habit the demented man would fall upon his face and bury his nose and mouth in the wet bark and sawdust at last the paroxysm past he sank back again into his old apathetic attitude of watching the attitude he had so often kept beside his sylvan crucible in this attitude and in silence he waited for the dawn  it came with a hush in the storm it came with blue openings in the broken up and tumbled heavens it came with stars that glistened first and then paled and at last sank drowning in those deep cerulean lakes it came with those cerulean lakes broadening into vaster seas whose shores expanded at last into one illimitable ocean cerulean no more but flecked with crimson and opal dyes it came with the lightly lifted misty curtain of the day torn and rent on crag and pinetop but always lifting lifting it came with the sparkle of emerald in the grasses and the flash of diamonds in every spray with a whisper in the awakening woods and voices in the traveled roads and trails  the sound of these voices stopped before the pit and seemed to interrogate the old man he came and putting his finger on his lips made a sign of caution when three or four men had descended he bade them follow him saying weakly and disjointedly but persistently my boymy son robertcame homecame home at lasthere with flipboth of themcome and see  he had reached a little niche or nest in the hillside and stopped and suddenly drew aside a blanket beneath it side by side lay flip and lance dead with their cold hands clasped in each others  suffocated said two or three turning with horror toward the broken up and still smouldering pit  asleep said the old man asleep ive seen em lying that way when they were babies together dont tell me dont say i dont know my own flesh and blood so so so my pretty ones he stooped and kissed them then drawing the blanket over them gently he rose and said softly good night    found at blazing star   the rain had only ceased with the gray streaks of morning at blazing star and the settlement awoke to a moral sense of cleanliness and the finding of forgotten knives tin cups and smaller camp utensils where the heavy showers had washed away the débris and dust heaps before the cabindoors indeed it was recorded in blazing star that a fortunate early riser had once picked up on the highway a solid chunk of gold quartz which the rain had freed from its incumbering soil and washed into immediate and glittering popularity possibly this may have been the reason why early risers in that locality during the rainy season adopted a thoughtful habit of body and seldom lifted their eyes to the rifted or indiaink washed skies above them  cass beard had risen early that morning but not with a view to discovery a leak in his cabin roofquite consistent with his careless improvident habitshad roused him at 4 am with a flooded bunk and wet blankets the chips from his wood pile refused to kindle a fire to dry his bedclothes and he had recourse to a more provident neighbors to supply the deficiency this was nearly opposite mr cassius crossed the highway and stopped suddenly something glittered in the nearest red pool before him gold surely but wonderful to relate not an irregular shapeless fragment of crude ore fresh from natures crucible but a bit of jewelers handicraft in the form of a plain gold ring looking at it more attentively he saw that it bore the inscription may to cass  like most of his fellow goldseekers cass was superstitious cass his own name he tried the ring it fitted his little finger closely it was evidently a womans ring he looked up and down the highway no one was yet stirring little pools of water in the red road were beginning to glitter and grow rosy from the farflushing east but there was no trace of the owner of the shining waif he knew that there was no woman in camp and among his few comrades in the settlement he remembered to have seen none wearing an ornament like that again the coincidence of the inscription to his rather peculiar nickname would have been a perennial source of playful comment in a camp that made no allowance for sentimental memories he slipped the glittering little hoop into his pocket and thoughtfully returned to his cabin  two hours later when the long straggling procession which every morning wended its way to blazing star gulchthe seat of mining operations in the settlementbegan to move cass saw fit to interrogate his fellows  ye didnt none on ye happen to drop anything round yer last night he asked cautiously  i dropped a pocketbook containing government bonds and some other securities with between fifty and sixty thousand dollars responded peter drummond carelessly but no matter if any man will return a few autograph letters from foreign potentates that happened to be in itof no value to anybody but the ownerhe can keep the money thars nothin mean about me he concluded languidly  this statement bearing every evidence of the grossest mendacity was lightly passed over and the men walked on with the deepest gravity  but hev you cass presently asked of another  i lost my pile to jack hamlin at drawpoker over at wingdam last night returned the other pensively but i dont calkilate to find it lying round loose  forced at last by this kind of irony into more detailed explanation cass confided to them his discovery and produced his treasure the result was a dozen vague surmisesonly one of which seemed to be popular and to suit the dyspeptic despondency of the partya despondency born of hastily masticated fried pork and flapjacks the ring was believed to have been dropped by some passing road agent laden with guilty spoil  ef i was you said drummond gloomily i wouldnt flourish that yer ring around much afore folks ive seen better men nor you strung up a tree by vigilantés for having even less than that in their possession  and i wouldnt say much about bein up so dd early this morning added an even more pessimistic comrade it might look bad before a jury  with this the men sadly dispersed leaving the innocent cass with the ring in his hand and a general impression on his mind that he was already an object of suspicion to his comradesan impression it is hardly necessary to say they fully intended should be left to rankle in his guileless bosom  notwithstanding casss first hopeful superstition the ring did not seem to bring him nor the camp any luck daily the clean up brought the same scant rewards to their labors and deepened the sardonic gravity of blazing star but if cass found no material result from his treasure it stimulated his lazy imagination and albeit a dangerous and seductive stimulant at least lifted him out of the monotonous grooves of his halfcareless halfslovenly but always selfcontented camp life heeding the wise caution of his comrades he took the habit of wearing the ring only at night wrapped in his blanket he stealthily slipped the golden circlet over his little finger and as he averred slept all the better for it whether it ever evoked any warmer dream or vision during those calm cold virginlike spring nights when even the moon and the greater planets retreated into the icy blue steellike firmament i cannot say enough that this superstition began to be colored a little by fancy and his fatalism somewhat mitigated by hope dreams of this kind did not tend to promote his efficiency in the communistic labors of the camp and brought him a selfisolation that however gratifying at first soon debarred him the benefits of that hard practical wisdom which underlaid the grumbling of his fellowworkers  im doggoned said one commentator ef i dont believe that cass is looney over that yer ring he found wears it on a string under his shirt  meantime the seasons did not wait the discovery of the secret the red pools in blazing star highway were soon dried up in the fervent june sun and riotous night winds of those altitudes the ephemeral grasses that had quickly supplanted these pools and the chocolatecolored mud were as quickly parched and withered the footprints of spring became vague and indefinite and were finally lost in the impalpable dust of the summer highway  in one of his long aimless excursions cass had penetrated a thick undergrowth of buckeye and hazel and found himself quite unexpectedly upon the high road to red chiefs crossing cass knew by the lurid cloud of dust that hid the distance that the up coach had passed he had already reached that stage of superstition when the most trivial occurrence seemed to point in some way to an elucidation of the mystery of his treasure his eyes had mechanically fallen to the ground again as if he half expected to find in some other waif a hint or corroboration of his imaginings thus abstracted the figure of a young girl on horseback in the road directly before the bushes he emerged from appeared to have sprung directly from the ground  oh come here please do quick  cass stared and then moved hesitatingly toward her  i heard some one coming through the bushes and i waited she went on come quick its something too awful for anything  in spite of this appalling introduction cass could not but notice that the voice although hurried and excited was by no means agitated or frightened that the eyes which looked into his sparkled with a certain kind of pleased curiosity  it was just here she went on vivaciously just here that i went into the bush and cut a switch for my mareandleading him along at a brisk trot by her sidejust here look see this is what i found  it was scarcely thirty feet from the road the only object that met casss eye was a mans stiff tall hat lying emptily and vacantly in the grass it was new shiny and of modish shape but it was so incongruous so perkily smart and yet so feeble and helpless lying there so ghastly ludicrous in its very appropriateness and incapacity to adjust itself to the surrounding landscape that it affected him with something more than a sense of its grotesqueness and he could only stare at it blankly  but youre not looking the right way the girl went on sharply look there  cass followed the direction of her whip at last what might have seemed a coat thrown carelessly on the ground met his eye but presently he became aware of a white rigid aimlesslyclinched hand protruding from the flaccid sleeve mingled with it in some absurd way and half hidden by the grass lay what might have been a pair of castoff trousers but for two rigid boots that pointed in opposite angles to the sky it was a dead man so palpably dead that life seemed to have taken flight from his very clothes so impotent feeble and degraded by them that the naked subject of a dissecting table would have been less insulting to humanity the head had fallen back and was partly hidden in a gopher burrow but the white upturned face and closed eyes had less of helpless death in them than those wretched enwrappings indeed one limp hand that lay across the swollen abdomen lent itself to the grotesquely hideous suggestion of a gentleman sleeping off the excesses of a hearty dinner  aint he horrid continued the girl but what killed him  struggling between a certain fascination at the girls coldblooded curiosity and horror of the murdered man cass hesitatingly lifted the helpless head a bluish hole above the right temple and a few brown paintlike spots on the forehead shirt collar and matted hair proved the only record  turn him over again said the girl impatiently as cass was about to relinquish his burden maybe youll find another wound  but cass was dimly remembering certain formalities that in older civilizations attend the discovery of dead bodies and postponed a present inquest  perhaps youd better ride on miss afore you get summoned as a witness ill give warning at red chiefs crossing and send the coroner down here  let me go with you she said earnestly it would be such fun i dont mind being a witness or she added without heeding casss look of astonishment ill wait here till you come back  but you see miss it wouldnt seem rightbegan cass  but i found him first interrupted the girl with a pout  staggered by this preemptive right sacred to all miners cass stopped  who is the coroner she asked  joe hornsby  the tall lame man who was half eaten by a grizzly  yes  well look now ill ride on and bring him back in half an hour there  but miss  oh dont mind me i never saw anything of this kind before and i want to see it all  do you know hornsby asked cass unconsciously a trifle irritated  no but ill bring him she wheeled her horse into the road  in the presence of this living energy cass quite forgot the helpless dead have you been long in these parts miss he asked  about two weeks she answered shortly goodby just now look around for the pistol or anything else you can find although i have been over the whole ground twice already  a little puff of dust as the horse sprang into the road a muffled shuffle struggle then the regular beat of hoofs and she was gone  after five minutes had passed cass regretted that he had not accompanied her waiting in such a spot was an irksome task not that there was anything in the scene itself to awaken gloomy imaginings the bright truthful californian sunshine scoffed at any illusion of creeping shadows or waving branches once in the rising wind the empty hat rolled overbut only in a ludicrous drunken way a search for any further sign or token had proved futile and cass grew impatient he began to hate himself for having stayed he would have fled but for shame nor was his goodhumor restored when at the close of a weary half hour two galloping figures emerged from the dusty horizonhornsby and the young girl  his vague annoyance increased as he fancied that both seemed to ignore him the coroner barely acknowledging his presence with a nod assisted by the young girl whose energy and enthusiasm evidently delighted him hornsby raised the body for a more careful examination the dead mans pockets were carefully searched a few coins a silver pencil knife and tobaccobox were all they found it gave no clew to his identity suddenly the young girl who had with unabashed curiosity knelt beside the exploring official hands of the red chief uttered a cry of gratification  heres something it dropped from the bosom of his shirt on the ground look  she was holding in the air between her thumb and forefinger a folded bit of wellworn newspaper her eyes sparkled  shall i open it she asked  yes  its a little ring she said looks like an engagement ring something is written on it look may to cass  cass darted forward its mine he stammered mine i dropped it its nothingnothing he went on after a pause embarrassed and blushing as the girl and her companion both stared at hima mere trifle ill take it  but the coroner opposed his outstretched hand not much he said significantly  but its mine continued cass indignation taking the place of shame at his discovered secret i found it six months ago in the road ipicked it up  with your name already written on it how handy said the coroner grimly  its an old story said cass blushing again under the half mischievous half searching eyes of the girl all blazing star knows i found it  then yell have no difficulty in provin it said hornsby coolly just now however weve found it and we propose to keep it for the inquest  cass shrugged his shoulders further altercation would have only heightened his ludicrous situation in the girls eyes he turned away leaving his treasure in the coroners hands  the inquest a day or two later was prompt and final no clew to the dead mans identity no evidence sufficiently strong to prove murder or suicide no trace of any kind inculpating any party known or unknown were found but much publicity and interest were given to the proceedings by the presence of the principal witness a handsome girl to the pluck persistency and intellect of miss porter said the red chief recorder tuolumne county owes the recovery of the body  no one who was present at the inquest failed to be charmed with the appearance and conduct of this beautiful young lady  miss porter has but lately arrived in this district in which it is hoped she will become an honored resident and continue to set an example to all lackadaisical and sentimental members of the socalled sterner sex after this universally recognized allusion to cass beard the recorder returned to its record some interest was excited by what appeared to be a clew to the mystery in the discovery of a small gold engagement ring on the body evidence was afterward offered to show it was the property of a mr cass beard of blazing star who appeared upon the scene after the discovery of the corpse by miss porter he alleged he had dropped it in lifting the unfortunate remains of the deceased much amusement was created in court by the sentimental confusion of the claimant and a certain partisan spirit shown by his fellowminers of blazing star it appearing however by the admission of this sighing strephon of the foot hills that he had himself found this pledge of affection lying in the highway six months previous the coroner wisely placed it in the safekeeping of the county court until the appearance of the rightful owner  thus on the 13th of september 186 the treasure found at blazing star passed out of the hands of its finder                                       autumn brought an abrupt explanation of the mystery kanaka joe had been arrested for horsestealing but had with noble candor confessed to the finer offense of manslaughter that swift and sure justice which overtook the horsestealer in these altitudes was stayed a moment and hesitated for the victim was clearly the mysterious unknown curiosity got the better of an extempore judge and jury  it was a fair fight said the accused not without some human vanity feeling that the camp hung upon his words and was settled by the man az was peartest and liveliest with his weapon we had a sort of unpleasantness over at lagrange the night afore along of our both hevin a monotony of four aces we had a clinch and a stamp around and when we was separated it was only a question of shootin on sight he left lagrange at sun up the next morning and i struck across a bit o buckeye and underbrush and came upon him accidental like on the red chief road i drawed when i sighted him and called out he slipped from his mare and covered himself with her flanks reaching for his holster but she rared and backed down on him across the road and into the grass where i got in another shot and fetched him  and you stole his mare suggested the judge  i got away said the gambler simply  further questioning only elicited the fact that joe did not know the name or condition of his victim he was a stranger in lagrange  it was a breezy afternoon with some turbulency in the camp and much windy discussion over this unwonted delay of justice the suggestion that joe should be first hanged for horse stealing and then tried for murder was angrily discussed but milder counsels were offeredthat the fact of the killing should be admitted only as proof of the theft a large party from red chief had come over to assist in judgment among them the coroner  cass beard had avoided these proceedings which only recalled an unpleasant experience and was wandering with pick pan and wallet far from the camp these accoutrements as i have before intimated justified any form of aimless idleness under the equally aimless title of prospecting he had at the end of three hours relaxation reached the highway to red chief half hidden by blinding clouds of dust torn from the crumbling red road at every gust which swept down the mountain side the spot had a familiar aspect to cass although some freshlydug holes near the wayside with scattered earth beside them showed the presence of a recent prospector he was struggling with his memory when the dust was suddenly dispersed and he found himself again at the scene of the murder he started he had not put foot on the road since the inquest there lacked only the helpless dead man and the contrasting figure of the alert young woman to restore the picture the body was gone it was true but as he turned he beheld miss porter at a few paces distant sitting her horse as energetic and observant as on the first morning they had met a superstitious thrill passed over him and awoke his old antagonism  she nodded to him slightly i came here to refresh my memory she said as mr hornsby thought i might be asked to give my evidence again at blazing star  cass carelessly struck an aimless blow with his pick against the sod and did not reply  and you she queried  i stumbled upon the place just now while prospecting or i shouldnt be here  then it was you made these holes  no said cass with illconcealed disgust nobody but a stranger would go foolin round such a spot  he stopped as the rude significance of his speech struck him and added surlily i meanno one would dig here  the girl laughed and showed a set of very white teeth in her square jaw cass averted his face  do you mean to say that every miner doesnt know that its lucky to dig wherever human blood has been spilt  cass felt a return of his superstition but he did not look up i never heard it before he said severely  and you call yourself a california miner  i do  it was impossible for miss porter to misunderstand his curt speech and unsocial manner she stared at him and colored slightly lifting her reins lightly she said you certainly do not seem like most of the miners i have met  nor you like any girl from the east i ever met he responded  what do you mean she asked checking her horse  what i say he answered doggedly reasonable as this reply was it immediately struck him that it was scarcely dignified or manly but before he could explain himself miss porter was gone  he met her again that very evening the trial had been summarily suspended by the appearance of the sheriff of calaveras and his posse who took joe from that selfconstituted tribunal of blazing star and set his face southward and toward authoritative although more cautious justice but not before the evidence of the previous inquest had been read and the incident of the ring again delivered to the public it is said the prisoner burst into an incredulous laugh and asked to see this mysterious waif it was handed to him standing in the very shadow of the gallows treewhich might have been one of the pines that sheltered the billiard room in which the vigilance committee held their conclavethe prisoner gave way to a burst of merriment so genuine and honest that the judge and jury joined in automatic sympathy when silence was restored an explanation was asked by the judge but there was no response from the prisoner except a subdued chuckle  did this ring belong to you asked the judge severely the jury and spectators craning their ears forward with an expectant smile already on their faces but the prisoners eyes only sparkled maliciously as he looked around the court  tell us joe said a sympathetic and laughterloving juror under his breath let it out and well make it easy for you  prisoner said the judge with a return of official dignity remember that your life is in peril do you refuse  joe lazily laid his arm on the back of his chair with to quote the words of an animated observer the air of having a christian hope and a sequence flush in his hand and said well as i reckon im not up yer for stealin a ring that another man lets on to have found and as fur as i kin see hez nothin to do with the case i do and as it was here that the sheriff of calaveras made a precipitate entry into the room the mystery remained unsolved  the effect of this freshlyimportant ridicule on the sensitive mind of cass might have been foretold by blazing star had it ever taken that sensitiveness into consideration he had lost the goodhumor and easy pliability which had tempted him to frankness and he had gradually become bitter and hard he had at first affected amusement over his own vanished day dreamhiding his virgin disappointment in his own breast but when he began to turn upon his feelings he turned upon his comrades also cass was for a while unpopular there is no ingratitude so revolting to the human mind as that of the butt who refuses to be one any longer the man who rejects that immunity which laughter generally casts upon him and demands to be seriously considered deserves no mercy  it was under these hard conditions that cass beard convicted of overt sentimentalism aggravated by inconsistency stepped into the red chief coach that evening it was his habit usually to ride with the driver but the presence of hornsby and miss porter on the box seat changed his intention yet he had the satisfaction of seeing that neither had noticed him and as there was no other passenger inside he stretched himself on the cushion of the back seat and gave way to moody reflections he quite determined to leave blazing star to settle himself seriously to the task of moneygetting and to return to his comrades some day a sarcastic cynical successful man and so overwhelm them with confusion for poor cass had not yet reached that superiority of knowing that success would depend upon his ability to forego his past indeed part of his boyhood had been cast among these men and he was not old enough to have learned that success was not to be gauged by their standard the moon lit up the dark interior of the coach with a faint poetic light the lazy swinging of the vehicle that was bearing him awayalbeit only for a night and a daythe solitude the glimpses from the window of great distances full of vague possibilities made the abused ring potent as that of gyges he dreamed with his eyes open from an alnaschar vision he suddenly awoke the coach had stopped the voices of men one in entreaty one in expostulation came from the box cass mechanically put his hand to his pistol pocket  thank you but i insist upon getting down  it was miss porters voice this was followed by a rapid half restrained interchange of words between hornsby and the driver then the latter said gruffly  if the lady wants to ride inside let her  miss porter fluttered to the ground she was followed by hornsby just a minit miss he expostulated half shamedly half brusquely ye dont onderstand me i only  but miss porter had jumped into the coach  hornsby placed his hand on the handle of the door miss porter grasped it firmly from the inside there was a slight struggle  all of which was part of a dream to the boyish cass but he awoke from ita man do you he asked in a voice he scarcely recognized himselfdo you want this man inside  no  cass caught at hornsbys wrist like a young tiger but alas what availed instinctive chivalry against main strength he only succeeded in forcing the door open in spite of miss porters superior strategy andi fear i must add muscle alsoand threw himself passionately at hornsbys throat where he hung on and calmly awaited dissolution but he had in the onset driven hornsby out into the road and the moonlight  here somebody take my lines the voice was mountain charleys the driver the figure that jumped from the box and separated the struggling men belonged to this singularly direct person  youre riding inside said charley interrogatively to cass before he could reply miss porters voice came from the window  he is  charley promptly bundled cass into the coach  and you to hornsby onless youre kalkilatin to take a little pasear youre booked outside get up  it is probable that charley assisted mr hornsby as promptly to his seat for the next moment the coach was rolling on  meanwhile cass by reason of his forced entry had been deposited in miss porters lap whence freeing himself he had attempted to climb over the middle seat but in the starting of the coach was again thrown heavily against her hat and shoulder all of which was inconsistent with the attitude of dignified reserve he had intended to display miss porter meanwhile recovered her goodhumor  what a brute he was ugh she said retying the ribbons of her bonnet under her square chin and smoothing out her linen duster  cass tried to look as if he had forgotten the whole affair who oh yes i see he responded absently  i suppose i ought to thank you she went on with a smile but you know really i could have kept him out if you hadnt pulled his wrist from outside ill show you look put your hand on the handle there now ill hold the lock inside firmly you see you cant turn the catch  she indeed held the lock fast it was a firm hand yet softtheir fingers had touched over the handleand looked white in the moonlight he made no reply but sank back again in his seat with a singular sensation in the fingers that had touched hers he was in the shadow and without being seen could abandon his reserve and glance at her face it struck him that he had never really seen her before she was not so tall as she had appeared to be her eyes were not large but her pupils were black moist velvety and so convex as to seem embossed on the white she had an indistinctive nose a rather colorless facewhiter at the angles of the mouth and nose through the relief of tiny freckles like grains of pepper her mouth was straight dark red but moist as her eyes she had drawn herself into the corner of the back seat her wrist put through and hanging over the swinging strap the easy lines of her plump figure swaying from side to side with the motion of the coach finally forgetful of any presence in the dark corner opposite she threw her head a little farther back slipped a trifle lower and placing two wellbooted feet upon the middle seat completed a charming and wholesome picture  five minutes elapsed she was looking straight at the moon cass beard felt his dignified reserve becoming very much like awkwardness he ought to be coldly polite  i hope youre not flustered miss by theby thehe began  i she straightened herself up in the seat cast a curious glance into the dark corner and then letting herself down again said oh dear no  another five minutes elapsed she had evidently forgotten him she might at least have been civil he took refuge again in his reserve but it was now mixed with a certain pique  yet how much softer her face looked in the moonlight even her square jaw had lost that hard matteroffact practical indication which was so distasteful to him and always had suggested a harsh criticism of his weakness how moist her eyes wereactually shining in the light how that light seemed to concentrate in the corners of the lashes and then slippeda flashaway was she yes she was crying  cass melted he moved miss porter put her head out of the window and drew it back in a moment dryeyed  one meets all sorts of folks traveling said cass with what he wished to make appear a cheerful philosophy  i dare say i dont know i never before met any one who was rude to me i have traveled all over the country alone and with all kinds of people ever since i was so high i have always gone my own way without hindrance or trouble i always do i dont see why i shouldnt perhaps other people maynt like it i do i like excitement i like to see all that there is to see because im a girl i dont see why i cant go out without a keeper and why i cannot do what any man can do that isnt wrong do you perhaps you doperhaps you dont perhaps you like a girl to be always in the house dawdling or thumping a piano or reading novels perhaps you think im bold because i dont like it and wont lie and say i do  she spoke sharply and aggressively and so evidently in answer to casss unspoken indictment against her that he was not surprised when she became more direct  you know you were shocked when i went to fetch that hornsby the coroner after we found the dead body  hornsby wasnt shocked said cass a little viciously  what do you mean she said abruptly  you were good friends enough until  until he insulted me just now is that it  until he thought stammered cass that because you wereyou knownot sososo careful as other girls he could be a little freer  and so because i preferred to ride a mile with him to see something real that had happened and tried to be useful instead of looking in shopwindows in main street or promenading before the hotel  and being ornamental interrupted cass but this feeble and uncasslike attempt at playful gallantry met with a sudden check  miss porter drew herself together and looked out of the window do you wish me to walk the rest of the way home  no said cass hurriedly with a crimson face and a sense of gratuitous rudeness  then stop that kind of talk right there  there was an awkward silence i wish i was a man she said half bitterly half earnestly cass beard was not old and cynical enough to observe that this devout aspiration is usually uttered by those who have least reason to deplore their own femininity and but for the rebuff he had just received would have made the usual emphatic dissent of our sex when the wish is uttered by warm red lips and tender voicesa dissent it may be remarked generally withheld however when the masculine spinster dwells on the perfection of woman i dare say miss porter was sincere for a moment later she continued poutingly  and yet i used to go to fires in sacramento when i was only ten years old i saw the theatre burnt down nobody found fault with me then  something made cass ask if her father and mother objected to her boyish tastes the reply was characteristic if not satisfactory  object id like to see them do it  the direction of the road had changed the fickle moon now abandoned miss porter and sought out cass on the front seat it caressed the young fellows silky moustache and long eyelashes and took some of the sunburn from his cheek  whats the matter with your neck said the girl suddenly  cass looked down blushing to find that the collar of his smart duck sailor shirt was torn open but something more than his white soft girlish skin was exposed the shirt front was dyed quite red with blood from a slight cut on the shoulder he remembered to have felt a scratch while struggling with hornsby  the girls soft eyes sparkled let me she said vivaciously do im good at wounds come over here nostay there ill come over to you  she did bestriding the back of the middle seat and dropping at his side the magnetic fingers again touched his he felt her warm breath on his neck as she bent toward him  its nothing he said hastily more agitated by the treatment than the wound  give me your flask she responded without heeding a stinging sensation as she bathed the edges of the cut with the spirit brought him back to common sense again there she said skillfully extemporizing a bandage from her handkerchief and a compress from his cravat now button your coat over your chest so and dont take cold she insisted upon buttoning it for him greater even than the feminine delight in a mans strength is the ministration to his weakness yet when this was finished she drew a little away from him in some embarrassmentan embarrassment she wondered at as his skin was finer his touch gentler his clothes cleaner andnot to put too fine a point upon ithe exhaled an atmosphere much sweeter than belonged to most of the men her boyish habits had brought her in contact withnot excepting her own father later she even exempted her mother from the possession of this divine effluence after a moment she asked suddenly what are you going to do with hornsby  cass had not thought of him his shortlived rage was past with the occasion that provoked it without any fear of his adversary he would have been content quite willing to meet him no more he only said that will depend upon him  oh you wont hear from him again said she confidently but you really ought to get up a little more muscle youve no more than a girl she stopped a little confused  what shall i do with your handkerchief asked the uneasy cass anxious to change the subject  oh keep it if you want to only dont show it to everybody as you did that ring you found seeing signs of distress in his face she added of course that was all nonsense if you had cared so much for the ring you couldnt have talked about it or shown it could you  it relieved him to think that this might be true he certainly had not looked at it in that light before  but did you really find it she asked with sudden gravity really now  yes  and there was no real may in the case  not that i know of laughed cass secretly pleased  but miss porter after eying him critically for a moment jumped up and climbed back again to her seat perhaps you had better give me that handkerchief back  cass began to unbutton his coat  no no do you want to take your death of cold she screamed and cass to avoid this direful possibility rebuttoned his coat again over the handkerchief and a peculiarly pleasing sensation  very little now was said until the rattling bounding descent of the coach denoted the approach to red chief the straggling main street disclosed itself light by light in the flash of glittering windows and the sound of eager voices miss porter descended without waiting for casss proffered assistance and anticipated mountain charleys descent from the box a few undistinguishable words passed between them  you kin freeze to me miss said charley and miss porter turning her frank laugh and frankly opened palm to cass half returned the pressure of his hand and slipped away  a few days after the stagecoach incident mountain charley drew up beside cass on the blazing star turnpike and handed him a small packet i was told to give ye that by miss porter hushlisten its that rather old doggoned ring o yours thats bin in all the papers shes bamboozled that sapheaded county judge boompointer into givin it to her take my advice and sling it away for some other feller to pick up and get looney over thats all  did she say anything asked cass anxiously as he received his lost treasure somewhat coldly  well yes i reckon she asked me to stand betwixt hornsby and you so dont you tackle him and ill see he dont tackle you and with a portentous wink mountain charley whipped up his horses and was gone  cass opened the packet it contained nothing but the ring unmitigated by any word of greeting remembrance or even raillery it seemed almost an insult had she intended to flaunt his folly in his face or had she believed he still mourned for it and deemed its recovery a sufficient reward for his slight service for an instant he felt tempted to follow charleys advice and cast this symbol of folly and contempt in the dust of the mountain road and had she not made his humiliation complete by begging charleys interference between him and his enemy he would go home and send her back the handkerchief she had given him but here the unromantic reflection that although he had washed it that very afternoon in the solitude of his own cabin he could not possibly iron it but must send it rough dried stayed his indignant feet  two or three days a week a fortnight even of this hopeless resentment filled casss breast then the news of kanaka joes acquittal in the state court momentarily revived the story of the ring and revamped a few stale jokes in the camp but the interest soon flagged the fortunes of the little community of blazing star had been for some months failing and with early snows in the mountain and wasted capital in fruitless schemes on the river there was little room for the indulgence of that lazy and original humor which belonged to their lost youth and prosperity blazing star truly in the grim figure of their slang was played out not dug out worked out or washed out but dissipated in a year of speculation and chance  against this tide of fortune cass struggled manfully and even evoked the slow praise of his companions better still he won a certain praise for himself in himself in a consciousness of increased strength health power and selfreliance he began to turn his quick imagination and perception to some practical account and made one or two discoveries which quite startled his more experienced but more conservative companions nevertheless casss discoveries and labors were not of a kind that produced immediate pecuniary realization and blazing star which consumed so many pounds of pork and flour daily did not unfortunately produce the daily equivalent in gold blazing star lost its credit blazing star was hungry dirty and ragged blazing star was beginning to set  participating in the general illluck of the camp cass was not without his own individual mischance he had resolutely determined to forget miss porter and all that tended to recall the unlucky ring but cruelly enough she was the only thing that refused to be forgottenwhose undulating figure reclined opposite to him in the weird moonlight of his ruined cabin whose voice mingled with the song of the river by whose banks he toiled and whose eyes and touch thrilled him in his dreams partly for this reason and partly because his clothes were beginning to be patched and torn he avoided red chief and any place where he would be likely to meet her in spite of this precaution he had once seen her driving in a pony carriage but so smartly and fashionably dressed that he drew back in the cover of a wayside willow that she might pass without recognition he looked down upon his redsplashed clothes and grimy soilstreaked hands and for a moment half hated her his comrades seldom spoke of herinstinctively fearing some temptation that might beset his spartan resolutions but he heard from time to time that she had been seen at balls and parties apparently enjoying those very frivolities of her sex she affected to condemn it was a sabbath morning in early spring that he was returning from an ineffectual attempt to enlist a capitalist at the county town to redeem the fortunes of blazing star he was pondering over the narrowness of that capitalist who had evidently but illogically connected casss present appearance with the future of that struggling camp when he became so footsore that he was obliged to accept a lift from a wayfaring teamster as the slowly lumbering vehicle passed the new church on the outskirts of the town the congregation were sallying forth it was too late to jump down and run away and cass dared not ask his newfound friend to whip up his cattle conscious of his unshorn beard and ragged garments he kept his eyes fixed upon the road a voice that thrilled him called his name it was miss porter a resplendent vision of silk laces and easter flowersyet actually running with something of her old dash and freedom beside the wagon as the astonished teamster drew up before this elegant apparition she panted  why did you make me run so far and why didnt you look up  cass trying to hide the patches on his knees beneath a newspaper stammered that he had not seen her  and you did not hold down your head purposely  no said cass  why have you not been to red chief why didnt you answer my message about the ring she asked swiftly  you sent nothing but the ring said cass coloring as he glanced at the teamster  why that was a message you born idiot  cass stared the teamster smiled miss porter gazed anxiously at the wagon i think id like a ride in there it looks awfully good she glanced mischievously around at the lingering and curious congregation may i  but cass deprecated that proceeding strongly it was dirty he was not sure it was even wholesome she would be so uncomfortable he himself was only going a few rods farther and in that time she might ruin her dress  oh yes she said a little bitterly certainly my dress must be looked after andwhat else  people might think it strange and believe i had invited you continued cass hesitatingly  when i had only invited myself thank you goodby  she waved her hand and stepped back from the wagon cass would have given worlds to recall her but he sat still and the vehicle moved on in moody silence at the first cross road he jumped down thank you he said to the teamster youre welcome returned that gentleman regarding him curiously but the next time a gal like that asks to ride in this yer wagon i reckon i wont take the vote of any deadhead passenger adios young fellow dont stay out late ye might be ran off by some gal and what would your mother say of course the young man could only look unutterable things and walk away but even in that dignified action he was conscious that its effect was somewhat mitigated by a large patch from a material originally used as a floursack which had repaired his trousers but still bore the ironical legend best superfine  the summer brought warmth and promise and some blossom if not absolute fruition to blazing star the long days drew nature into closer communion with the men and hopefulness followed the discontent of their winter seclusion it was easier too for capital to be wooed and won into making a picnic in these mountain solitudes than when high water stayed the fords and drifting snow the sierran trails at the close of one of these arcadian days cass was smoking before the door of his lonely cabin when he was astounded by the onset of a dozen of his companions peter drummond far in the van was waving a newspaper like a victorious banner alls right now cass old man he panted as he stopped before cass and shoved back his eager followers  whats all right asked cass dubiously  you you kin rake down the pile now youre hunky youre on velvet listen  he opened the newspaper and read with annoying deliberation as follows  lostif the finder of a plain gold ring bearing the engraved inscription may to cass alleged to have been picked up on the high road near blazing star on the 4th march 186 will apply to bookham  sons bankers 1007 y street sacramento he will be suitably rewarded either for the recovery of the ring or for such facts as may identify it or the locality where it was found  cass rose and frowned savagely on his comrades no no cried a dozen voices assuringly its all right honest injun true as gospel no joke cass  heres the paper sacramento union of yesterday look for yourself said drummond handing him the wellworn journal and you see he added how darned lucky you are it aint necessary for you to produce the ring so if that old biled owl of a boompointer dont giv it back to ye its all the same  and they say nobody but the finder need apply interrupted another that shuts out boompointer or kanaka joe for the matter o that  its clar that it means you cass ez much ez if theyd given your name added a third  for miss porters sake and his own cass had never told them of the restoration of the ring and it was evident that mountain charley had also kept silent cass could not speak now without violating a secret and he was pleased that the ring itself no longer played an important part in the mystery but what was that mystery and why was the ring secondary to himself why was so much stress laid upon his finding it  you see said drummond as if answering his unspoken thought thatar galfor it is a gal in coursehez read all about it in the papers and hez sort o took a shine to ye it dont make a bit o difference who in thunder cass is or waz for i reckon shes kicked him over by this time  sarved him right too for losing the girls ring and then lying low and keeping dark about it interrupted a sympathizer  and shes just weakened over the romantic hightoned way you stuck to it continued drummond forgetting the sarcasms he had previously hurled at this romance indeed the whole camp by this time had become convinced that it had fostered and developed a chivalrous devotion which was now on the point of pecuniary realization it was generally accepted that she was the daughter of this banker and also felt that in the circumstances the happy father could not do less than develop the resources of blazing star at once even if there were no relationship what opportunity could be more fit for presenting to capital a locality that even produced engagement rings and as jim fauquier put it the men ez knew how to keep em it was this sympathetic virginian who took cass aside with the following generous suggestion if you find that you and the old gal couldnt hitch hosses owin to your not likin red hair or a game leg it may be here recorded that blazing star had for no reason whatever attributed these unprepossessing qualities to the mysterious advertiser you might let me in you might say ez how i used to jest worship that ring with you and allers wanted to borrow it on sundays if anything comes of itwhywere pardners  a serious question was the outfitting of cass for what now was felt to be a diplomatic representation of the community his garments it hardly need be said were inappropriate to any wooing except that of the maiden all forlorn which the advertiser clearly was not he might suggested fauquier drop in jest as he iskinder as if hed got keerless of the world being lovesick but cass objected strongly and was borne out in his objection by his younger comrades at last a pair of white duck trousers a red shirt a flowing black silk scarf and a panama hat were procured at red chief on credit after a judicious exhibition of the advertisement a heavy weddingring the property of drummond who was not married was also lent as a graceful suggestion and at the last moment fauquier affixed to casss scarf an enormous specimen pin of gold and quartz it sorter indicates the auriferous wealth o this yer region and the old man the senior member of bookham  sons neednt know i won it at drawpoker in frisco said fauqier ef you pass on the gal you kin hand it back to me and ill try it on  forty dollars for expenses was put into casss hands and the entire community accompanied him to the cross roads where he was to meet the sacramento coach which eventually carried him away followed by a benediction of waving hats and exploding revolvers  that cass did not participate in the extravagant hopes of his comrades and that he rejected utterly their matrimonial speculations in his behalf need not be said  outwardly he kept his own counsel with goodhumored assent but there was something fascinating in the situation and while he felt he had forever abandoned his romantic dream he was not displeased to know that it might have proved a reality nor was it distasteful to him to think that miss porter would hear of it and regret her late inability to appreciate his sentiment if he really were the object of some opulent maidens passion he would show miss porter how he could sacrifice the most brilliant prospects for her sake alone on the top of the coach he projected one of those satisfying conversations in which imaginative people delight but which unfortunately never come quite up to rehearsal dear miss porter he would say addressing the back of the driver if i could remain faithful to a dream of my youth however illusive and unreal can you believe that for the sake of lucre i could be false to the one real passion that alone supplanted it in the composition and delivery of this eloquent statement an hour was happily forgotten the only drawback to its complete effect was that a misplacing of epithets in rapid repetition did not seem to make the slightest difference and cass found himself saying dear miss porter if i could be false to a dream of my youth etc etc can you believe i could be faithful to the one real passion etc etc with equal and perfect satisfaction as miss porter was reputed to be well off if the unknown were poor that might be another drawback  the banking house of bookham  sons did not present an illusive nor mysterious appearance it was eminently practical and matter of fact it was obtrusively open and glassy nobody would have thought of leaving a secret there that would have been inevitably circulated over the counter cass felt an uncomfortable sense of incongruity in himself in his story in his treasure to this temple of disenchanting realism with the awkwardness of an embarrassed man he was holding prominently in his hand an envelope containing the ring and advertisement as a voucher for his intrusion when the nearest clerk took the envelope from his hand opened it took out the ring returned it said briskly t other shop next door young man and turned to another customer  cass stepped to the door saw that tother shop was a pawnbrokers and returned again with a flashing eye and heightened color its an advertisement i have come to answer he began again  the clerk cast a glance at casss scarf and pin place taken yesterdayno room for any more he said abruptly  cass grew quite white but his old experience in blazing star repartee stood him in good stead if its your place you mean he said coolly i reckon you might put a dozen men in the hole youre rattlin round inbut its this advertisement im after if bookham isnt in maybe youll send me one of the grownup sons the production of the advertisement and some laughter from the bystanders had its effect the pert young clerk retired and returned to lead the way to the bank parlor casss heart sank again as he was confronted by a dark irongray manin dress features speech and actionuncompromisingly opposed to casshis ring and his romance when the young man had told his story and produced his treasure he paused the banker scarcely glanced at it but said impatiently  well your papers  my papers  yes proof of your identity you say your name is cass beard good what have you got to prove it how can i tell who you are  to a sensitive man there is no form of suspicion that is as bewildering and demoralizing at the moment as the question of his identity cass felt the insult in the doubt of his word and the palpable sense of his present inability to prove it the banker watched him keenly but not unkindly  come he said at length this is not my affair if you can legally satisfy the lady for whom i am only agent well and good i believe you can i only warn you that you must and my present inquiry was to keep her from losing her time with impostors a class i dont think you belong to theres her card good day  miss mortimer  it was not the bankers daughter the first illusion of blazing star was rudely dispelled but the care taken by the capitalist to shield her from imposture indicated a person of wealth of her youth and beauty cass no longer thought  the address given was not distant with a beating heart he rung the bell of a respectablelooking house and was ushered into a private drawingroom instinctively he felt that the room was only temporarily inhabited an air peculiar to the best lodgings and when the door opened upon a tall lady in deep mourning he was still more convinced of an incongruity between the occupant and her surroundings with a smile that vacillated between a habit of familiarity and ease and a recent restraint she motioned him to a chair  miss mortimer was still young still handsome still fashionably dressed and still attractive from her first greeting to the end of the interview cass felt that she knew all about him this relieved him from the onus of proving his identity but seemed to put him vaguely at a disadvantage it increased his sense of inexperience and youthfulness  i hope you will believe she began that the few questions i have to ask you are to satisfy my own heart and for no other purpose she smiled sadly as she went on had it been otherwise i should have instituted a legal inquiry and left this interview to some one cooler calmer and less interested than myself but i think i know i can trust you perhaps we women are weak and foolish to talk of an instinct and when you know my story you may have reason to believe that but little dependence can be placed on that but i am not wrong in sayingam i with a sad smile that you are not above that weakness she paused closed her lips tightly and grasped her hands before her you say you found that ring in the road some three months beforethetheyou know what i meanthe bodywas discovered  yes  you thought it might have been dropped by some one in passing  i thought so yesit belonged to no one in the camp  before your cabin or on the highway  before my cabin  you are sure there was something so very sweet and sad in her smile that it oddly made cass color  but my cabin is near the road he suggested  i see and there was nothing else no paper nor envelope  nothing  and you kept it because of the odd resemblance one of the names bore to yours  yes  for no other reason  none yet cass felt he was blushing  youll forgive my repeating a question you have already answered but i am so anxious there was some attempt to prove at the inquest that the ring had been found on the body ofthe unfortunate man but you tell me it was not so  i can swear it  good godthe traitor she took a hurried step forward turned to the window and then came back to cass with a voice broken with emotion i have told you i could trust you that ring was mine  she stopped and then went on hurriedly years ago i gave it to a man who deceived and wronged me a man whose life since then has been a shame and disgrace to all who knew him a man who once a gentleman sank so low as to become the associate of thieves and ruffians sank so low that when he died by violencea traitor even to themhis own confederates shrunk from him and left him to fill a nameless grave that mans body you found  cass started and his name was  part of your surname casshenry cass  you see why providence seems to have brought that ring to you she went on but you ask me why knowing this i am so eager to know if the ring was found by you in the road or if it were found on his body listen it is part of my mortification that the story goes that this man once showed this ring boasted of it staked and lost it at a gambling table to one of his vile comrades  kanaka joe said cass overcome by a vivid recollection of joes merriment at the trial  the same dont you see she said hurriedly if the ring had been found on him i could believe that somewhere in his heart he still kept respect for the woman he had wronged i am a womana foolish woman i knowbut you have crushed that hope forever  but why have you sent for me asked cass touched by her emotion  to know it for certain she said almost fiercely can you not understand that a woman like me must know a thing once and forever but you can help me i did not send for you only to pour my wrongs in your ears you must take me with you to this placeto the spot where you found the ringto the spot where you found the bodyto the spot wherewhere he lies you must do it secretly that none shall know me  cass hesitated he was thinking of his companions and the collapse of their painted bubble how could he keep the secret from them  if it is money you need let not that stop you i have no right to your time without recompense do not misunderstand me there has been a thousand dollars awaiting my order at bookhams when the ring should be delivered it shall be doubled if you help me in this last moment  it was possible he could convey her safely there invent some story of a reward delayed for want of proofs and afterward share that reward with his friends he answered promptly i will take you there  she took his hands in both of hers raised them to her lips and smiled the shadow of grief and restraint seemed to have fallen from her face and a half mischievous half coquettish gleam in her dark eyes touched the susceptible cass in so subtle a fashion that he regained the street in some confusion he wondered what miss porter would have thought but was he not returning to her a fortunate man with one thousand dollars in his pocket why should he remember he was handicapped by a pretty woman and a pathetic episode it did not make the proximity less pleasant as he helped her into the coach that evening nor did the recollection of another ride with another woman obtrude itself upon those consolations which he felt it his duty from time to time to offer it was arranged that he should leave her at the red chief hotel while he continued on to blazing star returning at noon to bring her with him when he could do it without exposing her to recognition the gray dawn came soon enough and the coach drew up at red chief while the lights in the barroom and diningroom of the hotel were still struggling with the far flushing east cass alighted placed miss mortimer in the hands of the landlady and returned to the vehicle it was still musty close and frowzy with half awakened passengers there was a vacated seat on the top which cass climbed up to and abstractedly threw himself beside a figure muffled in shawls and rugs there was a slight movement among the multitudinous enwrappings and then the figure turned to him and said dryly good morning it was miss porter  have you been long here he stammered  all night  he would have given worlds to leave her at that moment he would have jumped from the starting coach to save himself any explanation of the embarrassment he was furiously conscious of showing without as he believed any adequate cause and yet like all inexperienced sensitive men he dashed blindly into that explanation worse he even told his secret at once then and there and then sat abashed and consciencestricken with an added sense of its utter futility  and this summed up the young girl with a slight shrug of her pretty shoulders is your may  cass would have recommenced his story  no dont pray it isnt interesting nor original do you believe it  i do said cass indignantly  how lucky then let me go to sleep  cass still furious but uneasy did not again address her when the coach stopped at blazing star she asked him indifferently when does this sentimental pilgrimage begin  i return for her at one oclock replied cass stiffly he kept his word he appeased his eager companions with a promise of future fortune and exhibited the present and tangible reward by a circuitous route known only to himself he led miss mortimer to the road before the cabin there was a pink flush of excitement on her somewhat faded cheek  and it was here she asked eagerly  i found it here  and the body  that was afterward over in that direction beyond the clump of buckeyes on the red chief turnpike  and any one coming from the road we left just now and going totothat place would have to cross just here tell me she said with a strange laugh laying her cold nervous hand on his wouldnt they  they would  let us go to that place  cass stepped out briskly to avoid observation and gain the woods beyond the highway you have crossed here before she said there seems to be a trail  i may have made it its a short cut to the buckeyes  you never found anything else on the trail  you remember i told you before the ring was all i found  ah true she smiled sweetly it was that which made it seem so odd to you i forgot  in half an hour they reached the buckeyes during the walk she had taken rapid recognizance of everything in her path when they crossed the road and cass had pointed out the scene of the murder she looked anxiously around you are sure we are not seen  quite  you will not think me foolish if i ask you to wait here while i go in thereshe pointed to the ominous thicket near themalone she was quite white  casss heart which had grown somewhat cold since his interview with miss porter melted at once  go i will stay here  he waited five minutes she did not return what if the poor creature had determined upon suicide on the spot where her faithless lover had fallen he was reassured in another moment by the rustle of skirts in the undergrowth  i was becoming quite alarmed he said aloud  you have reason to be returned a hurried voice he started it was miss porter who stepped swiftly out of the cover look she said look at that man down the road he has been tracking you two ever since you left the cabin do you know who he is  no  then listen it is threefingered dick one of the escaped road agents i know him  let us go and warn her said cass eagerly  miss porter laid her hand upon his shoulder  i dont think shell thank you she said dryly perhaps youd better see what shes doing first  utterly bewildered yet with a strong sense of the masterfulness of his companion he followed her she crept like a cat through the thicket suddenly she paused look she whispered viciously look at the tender vigils of your heartbroken may  cass saw the woman who had left him a moment before on her knees on the grass with long thin fingers digging like a ghoul in the earth he had scarce time to notice her eager face and eyes cast now and then back toward the spot where she had left him before there was a crash in the bushes and a manthe stranger of the roadleaped to her side run he said run for it now youre watched  oh that man beard she said contemptuously  no another in a wagon quick fool you know the place nowyou can come later run and halfdragging halflifting her he bore her through the bushes scarcely had they closed behind the pair when miss porter ran to the spot vacated by the woman look she cried triumphantly look  cass looked and sank on his knees beside her  it was worth a thousand dollars wasnt it she repeated maliciously wasnt it but you ought to return it really you ought  cass could scarcely articulate but how did you know it he finally gasped  oh i suspected something there was a woman and you know youre such a fool  cass rose stiffly  dont be a greater fool now but go and bring my horse and wagon from the hill and dont say anything to the driver  then you did not come alone  no it would have been bold and improper  please  and to think it was the ring after all that pointed to this she said  the ring that you returned to me  what did you say  nothing  dont please the wagon is coming                                       in the next mornings edition of the red chief chronicle appeared the following startling intelligence  extraordinary discovery  finding of the stolen treasure of wells fargo  co over 300000 recovered  our readers will remember the notorious robbery of wells fargo  cos treasure from the sacramento and red chief pioneer coach on the night of september 1 although most of the gang were arrested it is known that two escaped who it was presumed cached the treasure amounting to nearly 500000 in gold drafts and jewelry as no trace of the property was found yesterday our esteemed fellow citizen mr cass beard long and favorably known in this county succeeded in exhuming the treasure in a copse of hazel near the red chief turnpikeadjacent to the spot where an unknown body was lately discovered this body is now strongly suspected to be that of one henry cass a disreputable character who has since been ascertained to have been one of the road agents who escaped the matter is now under legal investigation the successful result of the search is due to a systematic plan evolved from the genius of mr beard who has devoted over a year to this labor it was first suggested to him by the finding of a ring now definitely identified as part of the treasure which was supposed to have been dropped from wells fargo  cos boxes by the robbers in their midnight flight through blazing star  in the same journal appeared the no less important intelligence which explains while it completes this veracious chronicle  it is rumored that a marriage is shortly to take place between the hero of the late treasure discovery and a young lady of red chief whose devoted aid and assistance to this important work is well known to this community    in the carquinez woods   chapter i  the sun was going down on the carquinez woods the few shafts of sunlight that had pierced their pillared gloom were lost in unfathomable depths or splintered their ineffectual lances on the enormous trunks of the redwoods for a time the dull red of their vast columns and the dull red of their castoff bark which matted the echoless aisles still seemed to hold a faint glow of the dying day but even this soon passed light and color fled upwards the dark interlaced treetops that had all day made an impenetrable shade broke into fire here and there their lost spires glittered faded and went utterly out a weird twilight that did not come from an outer world but seemed born of the wood itself slowly filled and possessed the aisles the straight tall colossal trunks rose dimly like columns of upward smoke the few fallen trees stretched their huge length into obscurity and seemed to lie on shadowy trestles the strange breath that filled these mysterious vaults had neither coldness nor moisture a dry fragrant dust arose from the noiseless foot that trod their barkstrewn floor the aisles might have been tombs the fallen trees enormous mummies the silence the solitude of the forgotten past  and yet this silence was presently broken by a recurring sound like breathing interrupted occasionally by inarticulate and stertorous gasps it was not the quick panting listening breath of some stealthy feline or canine animal but indicated a larger slower and more powerful organization whose progress was less watchful and guarded or as if a fragment of one of the fallen monsters had become animate at times this life seemed to take visible form but as vaguely as misshapenly as the phantom of a nightmare now it was a square object moving sideways endways with neither head nor tail and scarcely visible feet then an arched bulk rolling against the trunks of the trees and recoiling again or an upright cylindrical mass but always oscillating and unsteady and striking the trees on either hand the frequent occurrence of the movement suggested the figures of some weird rhythmic dance to music heard by the shape alone suddenly it either became motionless or faded away  there was the frightened neighing of a horse the sudden jingling of spurs a shout and outcry and the swift apparition of three dancing torches in one of the dark aisles but so intense was the obscurity that they shed no light on surrounding objects and seemed to advance at their own volition without human guidance until they disappeared suddenly behind the interposing bulk of one of the largest trees beyond its eighty feet of circumference the light could not reach and the gloom remained inscrutable but the voices and jingling spurs were heard distinctly  blast the mare shes shied off that cursed trail again  ye aint lost it agin hev ye growled a second voice  thats jist what i hev and these blasted pineknots dont give light an inch beyond em dd if i dont think they make this cursed hole blacker  there was a laugha womans laughhysterical bitter sarcastic exasperating the second speaker without heeding it went on  what in thunder skeert the hosses did you see or hear anything  nothin the wood is like a graveyard  the womans voice again broke into a hoarse contemptuous laugh the man resumed angrily  if you know anything why in hll dont you say so instead of cackling like a dd squaw there praps you reckon you ken find the trail too  take this rope off my wrist said the womans voice untie my hands let me down and ill find it she spoke quickly and with a spanish accent  it was the mens turn to laugh and give you a show to snatch that sixshooter and blow a hole through me as you did to the sheriff of calaveras eh not if this court understands itself said the first speaker dryly  go to the devil then she said curtly  not before a lady responded the other there was another laugh from the men the spurs jingled again the three torches reappeared from behind the tree and then passed away in the darkness  for a time silence and immutability possessed the woods the great trunks loomed upwards their fallen brothers stretched their slow length into obscurity the sound of breathing again became audible the shape reappeared in the aisle and recommenced its mystic dance presently it was lost in the shadow of the largest tree and to the sound of breathing succeeded a grating and scratching of bark suddenly as if riven by lightning a flash broke from the centre of the treetrunk lit up the woods and a sharp report rang through it after a pause the jingling of spurs and the dancing of torches were revived from the distance  hallo  no answer  who fired that shot  but there was no reply a slight veil of smoke passed away to the right there was the spice of gunpowder in the air but nothing more  the torches came forward again but this time it could be seen they were held in the hands of two men and a woman the womans hands were tied at the wrist to the horsehair reins of her mule while a riata passed around her waist and under the mules girth was held by one of the men who were both armed with rifles and revolvers their frightened horses curveted and it was with difficulty they could be made to advance  ho stranger what are you shooting at  the woman laughed and shrugged her shoulders look yonder at the roots of the tree youre a dd smart man for a sheriff aint you  the man uttered an exclamation and spurred his horse forward but the animal reared in terror he then sprang to the ground and approached the tree the shape lay there a scarcely distinguishable bulk  a grizzly by the living jingo shot through the heart  it was true the strange shape lit up by the flaring torches seemed more vague unearthly and awkward in its dying throes yet the small shut eyes the feeble nose the ponderous shoulders and halfhuman foot armed with powerful claws were unmistakable the men turned by a common impulse and peered into the remote recesses of the wood again  hi mister come and pick up your game hallo there  the challenge fell unheeded on the empty woods  and yet said he whom the woman had called the sheriff he cant be far off it was a close shot and the bear hez dropped in his tracks why wots this sticking in his claws  the two men bent over the animal why its sugar brown sugarlook there was no mistake the huge beasts fore paws and muzzle were streaked with the unromantic household provision and heightened the absurd contrast of its incongruous members the woman apparently indifferent had taken that opportunity to partly free one of her wrists  if we hadnt been cavorting round this yer spot for the last half hour id swear there was a shanty not a hundred yards away said the sheriff  the other man without replying remounted his horse instantly  if there is and its inhabited by a gentleman that kin make centre shots like that in the dark and dont care to explain how i reckon i wont disturb him  the sheriff was apparently of the same opinion for he followed his companions example and once more led the way the spurs tinkled the torches danced and the cavalcade slowly reëntered the gloom in another moment it had disappeared  the wood sank again into repose this time disturbed by neither shape nor sound what lower forms of life might have crept close to its roots were hidden in the ferns or passed with deadened tread over the barkstrewn floor towards morning a coolness like dew fell from above with here and there a dropping twig or nut or the crepitant awakening and stretchingout of cramped and weary branches later a dull lurid dawn not unlike the last evenings sunset filled the aisles this faded again and a clear gray light in which every object stood out in sharp distinctness took its place morning was waiting outside in all its brilliant youthful coloring but only entered as the matured and sobered day  seen in that stronger light the monstrous tree near which the dead bear lay revealed its age in its denuded and scarred trunk and showed in its base a deep cavity a foot or two from the ground partly hidden by hanging strips of bark which had fallen across it suddenly one of these strips was pushed aside and a young man leaped lightly down  but for the rifle he carried and some modern peculiarities of dress he was of a grace so unusual and unconventional that he might have passed for a faun who was quitting his ancestral home he stepped to the side of the bear with a light elastic movement that was as unlike customary progression as his face and figure were unlike the ordinary types of humanity even as he leaned upon his rifle looking down at the prostrate animal he unconsciously fell into an attitude that in any other mortal would have been a pose but with him was the picturesque and unstudied relaxation of perfect symmetry  hallo mister  he raised his head so carelessly and listlessly that he did not otherwise change his attitude stepping from behind the tree the woman of the preceding night stood before him her hands were free except for a thong of the riata which was still knotted around one wrist the end of the thong having been torn or burnt away her eyes were bloodshot and her hair hung over her shoulders in one long black braid  i reckoned all along it was you who shot the bear she said at least some one hidin yer and she indicated the hollow tree with her hand it wasnt no chance shot observing that the young man either from misconception or indifference did not seem to comprehend her she added we came by here last night a minute after you fired  oh that was you kicked up such a row was it said the young man with a shade of interest  i reckon said the woman nodding her head and them that was with me  and who are they  sheriff dunn of yolo and his deputy  and where are they now  the deputyin hll i reckon i dont know about the sheriff  i see said the young man quietly and you  igot away she said savagely but she was taken with a sudden nervous shiver which she at once repressed by tightly dragging her shawl over her shoulders and elbows and folding her arms defiantly  and youre going  to follow the deputy may be she said gloomily but come i say aint you going to treat its cursed cold here  wait a moment the young man was looking at her with his arched brows slightly knit and a half smile of curiosity aint you teresa  she was prepared for the question but evidently was not certain whether she would reply defiantly or confidently after an exhaustive scrutiny of his face she chose the latter and said you can bet your life on it johnny  i dont bet and my name isnt johnny then youre the woman who stabbed dick curson over at lagranges  she became defiant again thats me all the time what are you going to do about it  nothing and you used to dance at the alhambra  she whisked the shawl from her shoulders held it up like a scarf and made one or two steps of the sembicuacua there was not the least gayety recklessness or spontaneity in the action it was simply mechanical bravado it was so ineffective even upon her own feelings that her arms presently dropped to her side and she coughed embarrassedly wheres that whiskey pardner she asked  the young man turned toward the tree he had just quitted and without further words assisted her to mount to the cavity it was an irregularshaped vaulted chamber pierced fifty feet above by a shaft or cylindrical opening in the decayed trunk which was blackened by smoke as if it had served the purpose of a chimney in one corner lay a bearskin and blanket at the side were two alcoves or indentations one of which was evidently used as a table and the other as a cupboard in another hollow near the entrance lay a few small sacks of flour coffee and sugar the sticky contents of the latter still strewing the floor from this storehouse the young man drew a wicker flask of whiskey and handed it with a tin cup of water to the woman she waved the cup aside placed the flask to her lips and drank the undiluted spirit yet even this was evidently bravado for the water started to her eyes and she could not restrain the paroxysm of coughing that followed  i reckon thats the kind that kills at forty rods she said with a hysterical laugh but i say pardner you look as if you were fixed here to stay and she stared ostentatiously around the chamber but she had already taken in its minutest details even to observing that the hanging strips of bark could be disposed so as to completely hide the entrance  well yes he replied it wouldnt be very easy to pull up the stakes and move the shanty further on  seeing that either from indifference or caution he had not accepted her meaning she looked at him fixedly and said  what is your little game  eh  what are you hiding forhere in this tree  but im not hiding  then why didnt you come out when they hailed you last night  because i didnt care to  teresa whistled incredulously all rightthen if youre not hiding im going to as he did not reply she went on if i can keep out of sight for a couple of weeks this thing will blow over here and i can get across into yolo i could get a fair show there where the boys know me just now the trails are all watched but no one would think of lookin here  then how did you come to think of it he asked carelessly  because i knew that bear hadnt gone far for that sugar because i knew he hadnt stole it from a cacheit was too fresh and wed have seen the tornup earth because we had passed no camp and because i knew there was no shanty here and besides she added in a low voice may be i was huntin a hole myself to die inand spotted it by instinct  there was something in this suggestion of a hunted animal that unlike anything she had previously said or suggested was not exaggerated and caused the young man to look at her again she was standing under the chimneylike opening and the light from above illuminated her head and shoulders the pupils of her eyes had lost their feverish prominence and were slightly suffused and softened as she gazed abstractedly before her the only vestige of her previous excitement was in her lefthand fingers which were incessantly twisting and turning a diamond ring upon her right hand but without imparting the least animation to her rigid attitude suddenly as if conscious of his scrutiny she stepped aside out of the revealing light and by a swift feminine instinct raised her hand to her head as if to adjust her straggling hair it was only for a moment however for as if aware of the weakness she struggled to resume her aggressive pose  well she said speak up am i goin to stop here or have i got to get up and get  you can stay said the young man quietly but as ive got my provisions and ammunition here and havent any other place to go to just now i suppose well have to share it together  she glanced at him under her eyelids and a halfbitter halfcontemptuous smile passed across her face all right old man she said holding out her hand its a go well start in housekeeping at once if you like  ill have to come here once or twice a day he said quite composedly to look after my things and get something to eat but ill be away most of the time and what with camping out under the trees every night i reckon my share wont incommode you  she opened her black eyes upon him at this original proposition then she looked down at her torn dress i suppose this style of thing aint very fancy is it she said with a forced laugh  i think i know where to beg or borrow a change for you if you cant get any he replied simply  she stared at him again are you a family man  no  she was silent for a moment well she said you can tell your girl im not particular about its being in the latest fashion  there was a slight flush on his forehead as he turned toward the little cupboard but no tremor in his voice as he went on youll find tea and coffee here and if youre bored theres a book or two you read dont youi mean english  she nodded but cast a look of undisguised contempt upon the two worn coverless novels he held out to her you havent got last weeks sacramento union have you i hear they have my case all in only them lying reporters made it out against me all the time  i dont see the papers he replied curtly  they say theres a picture of me in the police gazette taken in the act and she laughed  he looked a little abstracted and turned as if to go i think youll do well to rest a while just now and keep as close hid as possible until afternoon the trail is a mile away at the nearest point but some one might miss it and stray over here youre quite safe if youre careful and stand by the tree you can build a fire here he stepped under the chimneylike opening without its being noticed even the smoke is lost and cannot be seen so high  the light from above was falling on his head and shoulders as it had on hers she looked at him intently  you travel a good deal on your figure pardner dont you she said with a certain admiration that was quite sexless in its quality but i dont see how you pick up a living by it in the carquinez woods so youre going are you you might be more sociable goodby  goodby he leaped from the opening  i say pardner  he turned a little impatiently she had knelt down at the entrance so as to be nearer his level and was holding out her hand but he did not notice it and she quietly withdrew it  if anybody dropped in and asked for you what name will they say  he smiled dont wait to hear  but suppose i wanted to sing out for you what will i call you  he hesitated call melo  lo the poor indian the first word of popes familiar apostrophe is humorously used in the far west as a distinguishing title for the indian  exactly  it suddenly occurred to the woman teresa that in the young mans height supple yet erect carriage color and singular gravity of demeanor there was a refined aboriginal suggestion he did not look like any indian she had ever seen but rather as a youthful chief might have looked there was a further suggestion in his fringed buckskin shirt and moccasins but before she could utter the halfsarcastic comment that rose to her lips he had glided noiselessly away even as an indian might have done  she readjusted the slips of hanging bark with feminine ingenuity dispersing them so as to completely hide the entrance yet this did not darken the chamber which seemed to draw a purer and more vigorous light through the soaring shaft that pierced the room than that which came from the dim woodland aisles below nevertheless she shivered and drawing her shawl closely around her began to collect some halfburnt fragments of wood in the chimney to make a fire but the preoccupation of her thoughts rendered this a tedious process as she would from time to time stop in the middle of an action and fall into an attitude of rapt abstraction with faroff eyes and rigid mouth when she had at last succeeded in kindling a fire and raising a film of pale blue smoke that seemed to fade and dissipate entirely before it reached the top of the chimney shaft she crouched beside it fixed her eyes on the darkest corner of the cavern and became motionless  what did she see through that shadow  nothing at first but a confused medley of figures and incidents of the preceding night things to be put away and forgotten things that would not have happened but for another thingthe thing before which everything faded a ballroom the sounds of music the one man she had cared for insulting her with the flaunting ostentation of his unfaithfulness herself despised put aside laughed at or worse jilted and then the moment of delirium when the light danced the one wild act that lifted her the despised one above them allmade her the supreme figure to be glanced at by frightened women stared at by halfstartled halfadmiring men yes she laughed but struck by the sound of her own voice moved twice round the cavern nervously and then dropped again into her old position  as they carried him away he had laughed at herlike a hound that he was he who had praised her for her spirit and incited her revenge against others he who had taught her to strike when she was insulted and it was only fit he should reap what he had sown she was what he what other men had made her and what was she now what had she been once  she tried to recall her childhood the man and woman who might have been her father and mother who fought and wrangled over her precocious little life abused or caressed her as she sided with either and then left her with a circus troupe where she first tasted the power of her courage her beauty and her recklessness she remembered those flashes of triumph that left a fever in her veinsa fever that when it failed must be stimulated by dissipation by anything by everything that would keep her name a wonder in mens mouths an envious fear to women she recalled her transfer to the strolling players her cheap pleasures and cheaper rivalries and hatredbut always teresa the daring teresa the reckless teresa audacious as a woman invincible as a boy dancing flirting fencing shooting swearing drinking smoking fighting teresa oh yes she had been loved perhapswho knowsbut always feared why should she change now ha he should see  she had lashed herself in a frenzy as was her wont with gestures ejaculations oaths adjurations and passionate apostrophes but with this strange and unexpected result heretofore she had always been sustained and kept up by an audience of some kind or quality if only perhaps a humble companion there had always been some one she could fascinate or horrify and she could read her power mirrored in their eyes even the halfabstracted indifference of her strange host had been something but she was alone now her words fell on apathetic solitude she was acting to viewless space she rushed to the opening dashed the hanging bark aside and leaped to the ground  she ran forward wildly a few steps and stopped  hallo she cried look tis i teresa  the profound silence remained unbroken her shrillest tones were lost in an echoless space even as the smoke of her fire had faded into pure ether she stretched out her clenched fists as if to defy the pillared austerities of the vaults around her  come and take me if you dare  the challenge was unheeded if she had thrown herself violently against the nearest treetrunk she could not have been stricken more breathless than she was by the compact embattled solitude that encompassed her the hopelessness of impressing these cold and passive vaults with her selfish passion filled her with a vague fear in her rage of the previous night she had not seen the wood in its profound immobility left alone with the majesty of those enormous columns she trembled and turned faint the silence of the hollow tree she had just quitted seemed to her less awful than the crushing presence of these mute and monstrous witnesses of her weakness like a wounded quail with lowered crest and trailing wing she crept back to her hidingplace  even then the influence of the wood was still upon her she picked up the novel she had contemptuously thrown aside only to let it fall again in utter weariness for a moment her feminine curiosity was excited by the discovery of an old book in whose blank leaves were pressed a variety of flowers and woodland grasses as she could not conceive that these had been kept for any but a sentimental purpose she was disappointed to find that underneath each was a sentence in an unknown tongue that even to her untutored eye did not appear to be the language of passion finally she rearranged the couch of skins and blankets and imparting to it in three clever shakes an entirely different character lay down to pursue her reveries but nature asserted herself and ere she knew it she was fast asleep  so intense and prolonged had been her previous excitement that the tension once relieved she passed into a slumber of exhaustion so deep that she seemed scarce to breathe high noon succeeded morning the central shaft received a single ray of upper sunlight the afternoon came and went the shadows gathered below the sunset fires began to eat their way through the groined roof and she still slept she slept even when the bark hangings of the chamber were put aside and the young man reentered  he laid down a bundle he was carrying and softly approached the sleeper for a moment he was startled from his indifference she lay so still and motionless but this was not all that struck him the face before him was no longer the passionate haggard visage that confronted him that morning the feverish air the burning color the strained muscles of mouth and brow and the staring eyes were gone wiped away perhaps by the tears that still left their traces on cheek and dark eyelash it was a face of a handsome woman of thirty with even a suggestion of softness in the contour of the cheek and arching of her upper lip no longer rigidly drawn down in anger but relaxed by sleep on her white teeth  with the lithe soft tread that was habitual to him the young man moved about examining the condition of the little chamber and its stock of provisions and necessaries and withdrew presently to reappear as noiselessly with a tin bucket of water this done he replenished the little pile of fuel with an armful of bark and pine cones cast an approving glance about him which included the sleeper and silently departed  it was night when she awoke she was surrounded by a profound darkness except where the shaftlike opening made a nebulous mist in the corner in her wooden cavern providentially she struggled back to consciousness slowly so that the solitude and silence came upon her gradually with a growing realization of the events of the past twentyfour hours but without a shock she was alone here but safe still and every hour added to her chances of ultimate escape she remembered to have seen a candle among the articles on the shelf and she began to grope her way toward the matches suddenly she stopped what was that panting  was it her own breathing quickened with a sudden nameless terror or was there something outside her heart seemed to stop beating while she listened yes it was a panting outsidea panting now increased multiplied redoubled mixed with the sounds of rustling tearing craunching and occasionally a quick impatient snarl she crept on her hands and knees to the opening and looked out at first the ground seemed to be undulating between her and the opposite tree but a second glance showed her the black and gray bristling tossing backs of tumbling beasts of prey charging the carcass of the bear that lay at its roots or contesting for the prize with gluttonous choked breath sidelong snarls arched spines and recurved tails one of the boldest had leaped upon a buttressing root of her tree within a foot of the opening  the excitement awe and terror she had undergone culminated in one wild maddened scream that seemed to pierce even the cold depths of the forest as she dropped on her face with her hands clasped over her eyes in an agony of fear  her scream was answered after a pause by a sudden volley of firebrands and sparks into the midst of the panting crowding pack a few smothered howls and snaps and a sudden dispersion of the concourse in another moment the young man with a blazing brand in either hand leaped upon the body of the bear  teresa raised her head uttered a hysterical cry slid down the tree flew wildly to his side caught convulsively at his sleeve and fell on her knees beside him  save me save me she gasped in a voice broken by terror save me from those hideous creatures no no she implored as he endeavored to lift her to her feet nolet me stay here close beside you so clutching the fringe of his leather huntingshirt and dragging herself on her knees nearer himsodont leave me for gods sake  they are gone he replied gazing down curiously at her as she wound the fringe around her hand to strengthen her hold theyre only a lot of cowardly coyotes and wolves that dare not attack anything that lives and can move  the young woman responded with a nervous shudder yes thats it she whispered in a broken voice its only the dead they want promise meswear to me if im caught or hung or shot you wont let me be left here to be torn andah my god whats that  she had thrown her arms around his knees completely pinioning him to her frantic breast something like a smile of disdain passed across his face as he answered its nothing they will not return get up  even in her terror she saw the change in his face i know i know she cried im frightenedbut i cannot bear it any longer hear me listen listenbut dont move i didnt mean to kill cursonno i swear to god no i didnt mean to kill the sheriffand i didnt i was only braggingdo you hear i lied i lieddont move i swear to god i lied ive made myself out worse than i was i have only dont leave me nowand if i dieand its not far off may beget me away from hereand from them swear it  all right said the young man with a scarcely concealed movement of irritation but get up now and go back to the cabin  no not there alone nevertheless he quietly but firmly released himself  i will stay here he replied i would have been nearer to you but i thought it better for your safety that my campfire should be further off but i can build it here and that will keep the coyotes off  let me stay with youbeside you she said imploringly  she looked so broken crushed and spiritless so unlike the woman of the morning that albeit with an ill grace he tacitly consented and turned away to bring his blankets but in the next moment she was at his side following him like a dog silent and wistful and even offering to carry his burden when he had built the fire for which she had collected the pinecones and broken branches near them he sat down folded his arms and leaned back against the tree in reserved and deliberate silence humble and submissive she did not attempt to break in upon a reverie she could not help but feel had little kindliness to herself as the fire snapped and sparkled she pillowed her head upon a root and lay still to watch it  it rose and fell and dying away at times to a mere lurid glow and again agitated by some breath scarcely perceptible to them quickening into a roaring flame when only the embers remained a dead silence filled the wood then the first breath of morning moved the tangled canopy above and a dozen tiny sprays and needles detached from the interlocked boughs winged their soft way noiselessly to the earth a few fell upon the prostrate woman like a gentle benediction and she slept but even then the young man looking down saw that the slender fingers were still aimlessly but rigidly twisted in the leather fringe of his huntingshirt   chapter ii  it was a peculiarity of the carquinez wood that it stood apart and distinct in its gigantic individuality even where the integrity of its own singular species was not entirely preserved it admitted no inferior trees nor was there any diminishing fringe on its outskirts the sentinels that guarded the few gateways of the dim trails were as monstrous as the serried ranks drawn up in the heart of the forest consequently the red highway that skirted the eastern angle was bare and shadeless until it slipped a league off into a watered valley and refreshed itself under lesser sycamores and willows it was here the newlyborn city of excelsior still in its cradle had like an infant hercules strangled the serpentine north fork of the american river and turned its lifecurrent into the ditches and flumes of the excelsior miners  newest of the new houses that seemed to have accidentally formed its single straggling street was the residence of the rev winslow wynn not unfrequently known as father wynn pastor of the first baptist church the pastorage as it was cheerfully called had the glaring distinction of being built of brick and was as had been wickedly pointed out by idle scoffers the only fireproof structure in town this sarcasm was not however supposed to be particularly distasteful to father wynn who enjoyed the reputation of being hail fellow well met with the rough mining element who called them by their christian names had been known to drink at the bar of the polka saloon while engaged in the conversion of a prominent citizen and was popularly said to have no gospel starch about him certain conscious outcasts and transgressors were touched at this apparent unbending of the spiritual authority the rigid tenets of father wynns faith were lost in the supposed catholicity of his humanity a preacher that can jine a man when hes histin liquor into him without jawin about it ought to be allowed to wrestle with sinners and splash about in as much cold water as he likes was the criticism of one of his converts nevertheless it was true that father wynn was somewhat loud and intolerant in his tolerance it was true that he was a little more rough a little more frank a little more hearty a little more impulsive than his disciples it was true that often the proclamation of his extreme liberality and brotherly equality partook somewhat of an apology it is true that a few who might have been most benefited by this kind of gospel regarded him with a singular disdain it is true that his liberality was of an ornamental insinuating quality accompanied with but little sacrifice his acceptance of a collection taken up in a gamblingsaloon for the rebuilding of his church destroyed by fire gave him a popularity large enough it must be confessed to cover the sins of the gamblers themselves but it was not proven that he had ever organized any form of relief but it was true that local history somehow accepted him as an exponent of mining christianity without the least reference to the opinions of the christian miners themselves  the rev mr wynns liberal habits and opinions were not however shared by his only daughter a motherless young lady of eighteen nellie wynn was in the eye of excelsior an unapproachable divinity as inaccessible and cold as her father was impulsive and familiar an atmosphere of chaste and proud virginity made itself felt even in the starched integrity of her spotless skirts in her neatlygloved fingertips in her clear amber eyes in her imperious red lips in her sensitive nostrils need it be said that the youth and middle age of excelsior were madly because apparently hopelessly in love with her for the rest she had been expensively educated was profoundly ignorant in two languages with a trained misunderstanding of music and painting and a natural and faultless taste in dress  the rev mr wynn was engaged in a characteristic hearty parting with one of his latest converts upon his own doorstep with admirable al fresco effect he had just clapped him on the shoulder goodby goodby charley my boy and keep in the right path not up or down or round the gulch you knowha habut straight across lots to the shining gate he had raised his voice under the stimulus of a few admiring spectators and backed his convert playfully against the wall you see were goin in to win you bet goodby id ask you to step in and have a chat but ive got my work to do and so have you the gospel mustnt keep us from that must it charley ha ha  the convert who elsewhere was a profane expressman and had become quite imbecile under mr wynns active heartiness and brotherly horseplay before spectators managed however to feebly stammer with a blush something about miss nellie  ah nellie she too is at her taskstrimming her lampyou know the parable of the wise virgins continued father wynn hastily fearing that the convert might take the illustration literally there theregoodby keep in the right path and with a parting shove he dismissed charley and entered his own house  that wise virgin nellie had evidently finished with the lamp and was now going out to meet the bridegroom as she was fully dressed and gloved and had a pink parasol in her hand as her father entered the sittingroom  his bluff heartiness seemed to fade away as he removed his soft broadbrimmed hat and glanced across the too freshlooking apartment there was a smell of mortar still in the air and a faint suggestion that at any moment green grass might appear between the interstices of the redbrick hearth the room yielding a little in the point of coldness seemed to share miss nellies fresh virginity and barring the pink parasol set her off as in a vestals cell  i supposed you wouldnt care to see brace the expressman so i got rid of him at the door said her father drawing one of the new chairs towards him slowly and sitting down carefully as if it were a hitherto untried experiment  miss nellies face took a tint of interest then he doesnt go with the coach to indian spring today  no why  i thought of going over myself to get the burnham girls to come to choirmeeting replied miss nellie carelessly and he might have been company  hed go now if he knew you were going said her father but its just as well he shouldnt be needlessly encouraged i rather think that sheriff dunn is a little jealous of him by the way the sheriff is much better i called to cheer him up today mr wynn had in fact tumultuously accelerated the sick mans pulse and he talked of you as usual in fact he said he had only two things to get well for one was to catch and hang that woman teresa who shot him the othercant you guess the other he added archly with a faint suggestion of his other manner  miss nellie coldly could not  the rev mr wynns archness vanished dont be a fool he said dryly he wants to marry you and you know it  most of the men here do responded miss nellie without the least trace of coquetry is the wedding or the hanging to take place first or together so he can officiate at both  his share in the union ditch is worth a hundred thousand dollars continued her father and if he isnt nominated for district judge this fall hes bound to go to the legislature any way i dont think a girl with your advantages and education can afford to throw away the chance of shining in sacramento san francisco or in good time perhaps even washington  miss nellies eyes did not reflect entire disapproval of this suggestion although she replied with something of her fathers practical quality  mr dunn is not out of his bed yet and they say teresas got away to arizona so there isnt any particular hurry  perhaps not but see here nellie ive some important news for you you know your young friend of the carquinez woodsdorman the botanist eh well brace knows all about him and what do you think he is  miss nellie took upon herself a few extra degrees of cold and didnt know  an injin yes an outandout cherokee you see he calls himself dormanlow dorman thats only french for sleeping water his injin namelow dorman  you mean leau dormante said nellie  thats what i said the chief called him sleeping water when he was a boy and one of them french canadian trappers translated it into french when he brought him to california to school but hes an injin sure no wonder he prefers to live in the woods  well said nellie  well echoed her father impatiently hes an injin i tell you and you cant of course have anything to do with him he mustnt come here again  but you forget said nellie imperturbably that it was you who invited him here and were so much exercised over him you remember you introduced him to the bishop and those eastern clergymen as a magnificent specimen of a young californian you forget what an occasion you made of his coming to church on sunday and how you made him come in his buckskin shirt and walk down the street with you after service  yes yes said the rev mr wynn hurriedly  and continued nellie carelessly how you made us sing out of the same book children of our fathers fold and how you preached at him until he actually got a color  yes said her father but it wasnt known then he was an injin and they are frightfully unpopular with those southwestern men among whom we labor indeed i am quite convinced that when brace said the only good indian was a dead one his expression though extravagant perhaps really voiced the sentiments of the majority it would be only kindness to the unfortunate creature to warn him from exposing himself to their rude but conscientious antagonism  perhaps youd better tell him then in your own popular way which they all seem to understand so well responded the daughter mr wynn cast a quick glance at her but there was no trace of irony in her facenothing but a halfbored indifference as she walked toward the window  i will go with you to the coachoffice said her father who generally gave these simple paternal duties the pronounced character of a public christian example  its hardly worth while replied miss nellie ive to stop at the watsons at the foot of the hill and ask after the baby so i shall go on to the crossing and pick up the coach as it passes goodby  nevertheless as soon as nellie had departed the rev mr wynn proceeded to the coachoffice and publicly grasping the hand of yuba bill the driver commended his daughter to his care in the name of the universal brotherhood of man and the christian fraternity carried away by his heartiness he forgot his previous caution and confided to the expressman miss nellies regrets that she was not to have that gentlemans company the result was that miss nellie found the coach with its passengers awaiting her with uplifted hats and wreathed smiles at the crossing and the boxseat from which an unfortunate stranger who had expensively paid for it had been summarily ejected at her service beside yuba bill who had thrown away his cigar and donned a new pair of buckskin gloves to do her honor but a more serious result to the young beauty was the effect of the rev mr wynns confidences upon the impulsive heart of jack brace the expressman it has been already intimated that it was his day off unable to summarily reassume his usual functions beside the driver without some practical reason and ashamed to go so palpably as a mere passenger he was forced to let the coach proceed without him discomfited for the moment he was not however beaten he had lost the blissful journey by her side which would have been his professional right butshe was going to indian spring could he not anticipate her there might they not meet in the most accidental manner and what might not come from that meeting away from the prying eyes of their own town mr brace did not hesitate but saddling his fleet buckskin by the time the stagecoach had passed the crossing in the highroad he had mounted the hill and was dashing along the cutoff in the same direction a full mile in advance arriving at indian spring he left his horse at a mexican posada on the confines of the settlement and from the piled débris of a tunnel excavation awaited the slow arrival of the coach on mature reflection he could give no reason why he had not boldly awaited it at the express office except a certain bashful consciousness of his own folly and a belief that it might be glaringly apparent to the bystanders when the coach arrived and he had overcome this consciousness it was too late yuba bill had discharged his passengers for indian spring and driven away miss nellie was in the settlement but where as time passed he became more desperate and bolder he walked recklessly up and down the main street glancing in at the open doors of shops and even in the windows of private dwellings it might have seemed a poor compliment to miss nellie but it was an evidence of his complete preoccupation when the sight of a female face at a window even though it was plain or perhaps painted caused his heart to bound or the glancing of a skirt in the distance quickened his feet and his pulses had jack contented himself with remaining at excelsior he might have vaguely regretted but as soon become as vaguely accustomed to miss nellies absence but it was not until his hitherto quiet and passive love took this first step of action that it fully declared itself when he had made the tour of the town a dozen times unsuccessfully he had perfectly made up his mind that marriage with nellie or the speedy death of several people including possibly himself was the only alternative he regretted he had not accompanied her he regretted he had not demanded where she was going he contemplated a course of future action that two hours ago would have filled him with bashful terror there was clearly but one thing to doto declare his passion the instant he met her and return with her to excelsior an accepted suitor or not to return at all  suddenly he was vexatiously conscious of hearing his name lazily called and looking up found that he was on the outskirts of the town and interrogated by two horsemen  got down to walk and the coach got away from you jack eh  a little ashamed of his preoccupation brace stammered something about collections he did not recognize the men but his own face name and business were familiar to everybody for fifty miles along the stageroad  well you can settle a bet for us i reckon bill dacre thar bet me five dollars and the drinks that a young gal we met at the edge of the carquinez woods dressed in a long brown duster and half muffled up in a hood was the daughter of father wynn of excelsior i did not get a fair look at her but it stands to reason that a hightoned young lady like nellie wynn dont go trapsing along the wood like a pike county tramp i took the bet may be you know if shes here or in excelsior  mr brace felt himself turning pale with eagerness and excitement but the near prospect of seeing her presently gave him back his caution and he answered truthfully that he had left her in excelsior and that in his two hours sojourn in indian spring he had not once met her but he added with a californians reverence for the sanctity of a bet i reckon youd better make it a standoff for twentyfour hours and ill find out and let you know which it is only fair to say he honestly intended to do  with a hurried nod of parting he continued in the direction of the woods when he had satisfied himself that the strangers had entered the settlement and would not follow him for further explanation he quickened his pace in half an hour he passed between two of the gigantic sentinels that guarded the entrance to a trail here he paused to collect his thoughts the woods were vast in extent the trail dim and uncertainat times apparently breaking off or intersecting another trail as faint as itself believing that miss nellie had diverged from the highway only as a momentary excursion into the shade and that she would not dare to penetrate its more sombre and unknown recesses he kept within sight of the skirting plain by degrees the sedate influence of the silent vaults seemed to depress him the ardor of the chase began to flag under the calm of their dim roof the fever of his veins began to subside his pace slackened he reasoned more deliberately it was by no means probable that the young woman in a brown duster was nellie it was not her habitual traveling dress it was not like her to walk unattended in the road there was nothing in her tastes and habits to take her into this gloomy forest allowing that she had even entered it and on this absolute question of her identity the two witnesses were divided he stopped irresolutely and cast a last long halfdespairing look around him hitherto he had given that part of the wood nearest the plain his greatest attention his glance now sought its darker recesses suddenly he became breathless was it a beam of sunlight that had pierced the groined roof above and now rested against the trunk of one of the dimmer more secluded giants no it was moving even as he gazed it slipped away glanced against another tree passed across one of the vaulted aisles and then was lost again brief as was the glimpse he was not mistakenit was the figure of a woman  in another moment he was on her track and soon had the satisfaction of seeing her reappear at a lesser distance but the continual intervention of the massive trunks made the chase by no means an easy one and as he could not keep her always in sight he was unable to follow or understand the one intelligent direction which she seemed to invariably keep nevertheless he gained upon her breathlessly and thanks to the barkstrewn floor noiselessly he was near enough to distinguish and recognize the dress she wore a pale yellow that he had admired when he first saw her it was nellie unmistakably if it were she of the brown duster she had discarded it perhaps for greater freedom he was near enough to call out now but a sudden nervous timidity overcame him his lips grew dry what should he say to her how account for his presence miss nellie one moment he gasped she darted forward andvanished  at this moment he was not more than a dozen yards from her he rushed to where she had been standing but her disappearance was perfect and complete he made a circuit of the group of trees within whose radius she had last appeared but there was neither trace of her nor suggestion of her mode of escape he called aloud to her the vacant woods let his helpless voice die in their unresponsive depths he gazed into the air and down at the barkstrewn carpet at his feet like most of his vocation he was sparing of speech and epigrammatic after his fashion comprehending in one swift but despairing flash of intelligence the existence of some fateful power beyond his own weak endeavor he accepted its logical result with characteristic grimness threw his hat upon the ground put his hands in his pockets and said  well im dd   chapter iii  out of compliment to miss nellie wynn yuba bill on reaching indian spring had made a slight détour to enable him to ostentatiously set down his fair passenger before the door of the burnhams when it had closed on the admiring eyes of the passengers and the coach had rattled away miss nellie without any undue haste or apparent change in her usual quiet demeanor managed however to dispatch her business promptly and leaving an impression that she would call again before her return to excelsior parted from her friends and slipped away through a side street to the general furnishing store of indian spring in passing this emporium miss nellies quick eye had discovered a cheap brown linen duster hanging in its window to purchase it and put it over her delicate cambric dress albeit with a shivering sense that she looked like a badlyfolded brownpaper parcel did not take long as she left the shop it was with mixed emotions of chagrin and security that she noticed that her passage through the settlement no longer turned the heads of its male inhabitants she reached the outskirts of indian spring and the highroad at about the time mr brace had begun his fruitless patrol of the main street far in the distance a faint olivegreen table mountain seemed to rise abruptly from the plain it was the carquinez woods gathering her spotless skirts beneath her extemporized brown domino she set out briskly towards them  but her progress was scarcely free or exhilarating she was not accustomed to walking in a country where buggyriding was considered the only genteel young ladylike mode of progression and its regular provision the expected courtesy of mankind always fastidiously booted her lowquartered shoes were charming to the eye but hardly adapted to the dust and inequalities of the highroad it was true that she had thought of buying a coarser pair at indian spring but once face to face with their uncompromising ugliness she had faltered and fled the sun was unmistakably hot but her parasol was too well known and offered too violent a contrast to the duster for practical use once she stopped with an exclamation of annoyance hesitated and looked back in half an hour she had twice lost her shoe and her temper a pink flush took possession of her cheeks and her eyes were bright with suppressed rage dust began to form grimy circles around their orbits with catlike shivers she even felt it pervade the roots of her blonde hair gradually her breath grew more rapid and hysterical her smarting eyes became humid and at last encountering two observant horsemen in the road she turned and fled until reaching the wood she began to cry  nevertheless she waited for the two horsemen to pass to satisfy herself that she was not followed then pushed on vaguely until she reached a fallen tree where with a gesture of disgust she tore off her hapless duster and flung it on the ground she then sat down sobbing but after a moment dried her eyes hurriedly and started to her feet a few paces distant erect noiseless with outstretched hand the young solitary of the carquinez woods advanced towards her his hand had almost touched hers when he stopped  what has happened he asked gravely  nothing she said turning half away and searching the ground with her eyes as if she had lost something only i must be going back now  you shall go back at once if you wish it he said flushing slightly but you have been crying why  frank as miss nellie wished to be she could not bring herself to say that her feet hurt her and the dust and heat were ruining her complexion it was therefore with a halfconfident belief that her troubles were really of a moral quality that she answered nothingnothing butbutits wrong to come here  but you did not think it was wrong when you agreed to come at our last meeting said the young man with that persistent logic which exasperates the inconsequent feminine mind it cannot be any more wrong today  but it was not so far off murmured the young girl without looking up  oh the distance makes it more improper then he said abstractedly but after a moments contemplation of her halfaverted face he asked gravely has any one talked to you about me  ten minutes before nellie had been burning to unburden herself of her fathers warning but now she felt she would not i wish you wouldnt call yourself low she said at last  but its my name he replied quietly  nonsense its only a stupid translation of a stupid nickname they might as well call you water at once  but you said you liked it  well so i do but dont you seeioh dear you dont understand  low did not reply but turned his head with resigned gravity towards the deeper woods grasping the barrel of his rifle with his left hand he threw his right arm across his left wrist and leaned slightly upon it with the habitual ease of a western hunterdoubly picturesque m his own lithe youthful symmetry miss nellie looked at him from under her eyelids and then half defiantly raised her head and her dark lashes gradually an almost magical change came over her features her eyes grew larger and more and more yearning until they seemed to draw and absorb in their liquid depths the figure of the young man before her her cold face broke into an ecstasy of light and color her humid lips parted in a bright welcoming smile until with an irresistible impulse she arose and throwing back her head stretched towards him two hands full of vague and trembling passion  in another moment he had seized them kissed them and as he drew her closer to his embrace felt them tighten around his neck but what name do you wish to call me he asked looking down into her eyes  miss nellie murmured something confidentially to the third button of his huntingshirt but that he replied with a faint smile that wouldnt be any more practical and you wouldnt want others to call me dar her fingers loosened around his neck she drew her head back and a singular expression passed over her face which to any calmer observer than a lover would have seemed however to indicate more curiosity than jealousy  who else does call you so she added earnestly how many for instance  lows reply was addressed not to her ear but her lips she did not avoid it but added and do you kiss them all like that taking him by the shoulders she held him a little way from her and gazed at him from head to foot then drawing him again to her embrace she said i dont care at least no woman has kissed you like that happy dazzled and embarrassed he was beginning to stammer the truthful protestation that rose to his lips but she stopped him no dont protest say nothing let me love youthat is all it is enough he would have caught her in his arms again but she drew back we are near the road she said quietly come you promised to show me where you camped let us make the most of our holiday in an hour i must leave the woods  but i shall accompany you dearest  no i must go as i camealone  but nellie  i tell you no she said with an almost harsh practical decision incompatible with her previous abandonment we might be seen together  well suppose we are we must be seen together eventually he remonstrated  the young girl made an involuntary gesture of impatient negation but checked herself dont let us talk of that now come while i am here under your own roofshe pointed to the high interlaced boughs above themyou must be hospitable show me your home tell me isnt it a little gloomy sometimes  it never has been i never thought it would be until the moment you leave it today  she pressed his hand briefly and in a halfperfunctory way as if her vanity had accepted and dismissed the compliment take me somewhere she said inquisitively where you stay most i do not seem to see you here she added looking around her with a slight shiver it is so big and so high have you no place where you eat and rest and sleep  except in the rainy season i camp all over the placeat any spot where i may have been shooting or collecting  collecting queried nellie  yes with the herbarium you know  yes said nellie dubiously but you told me oncethe first time we ever talked together she added looking in his eyessomething about your keeping your things like a squirrel in a tree could we not go there is there not room for us to sit and talk without being browbeaten and looked down upon by these supercilious trees  its too far away said low truthfully but with a somewhat pronounced emphasis much too far for you just now and it lies on another trail that enters the wood beyond but come i will show you a spring known only to myself the wood ducks and the squirrels i discovered it the first day i saw you and gave it your name but you shall christen it yourself it will be all yours and yours alone for it is so hidden and secluded that i defy any feet but my own or whoso shall keep step with mine to find it shall that foot be yours nellie  her face beamed with a bright assent it may be difficult to track it from here he said but stand where you are a moment and dont move rustle nor agitate the air in any way the woods are still now he turned at right angles with the trail moved a few paces into the ferns and underbrush and then stopped with his finger on his lips for an instant both remained motionless then with his intent face bent forward and both arms extended he began to sink slowly upon one knee and one side inclining his body with a gentle perfectlygraduated movement until his ear almost touched the ground nellie watched his graceful figure breathlessly until like a bow unbent he stood suddenly erect again and beckoned to her without changing the direction of his face  what is it she asked eagerly  all right i have found it he continued moving forward without turning his head  but how what did you kneel for he did not reply but taking her hand in his continued to move slowly on through the underbrush as if obeying some magnetic attraction how did you find it again asked the halfawed girl her voice unconsciously falling to a whisper still silent low kept his rigid face and forward tread for twenty yards further then he stopped and released the girls halfimpatient hand how did you find it she repeated sharply  with my ears and nose replied low gravely  with your nose  yes i smelt it  still fresh with the memory of his picturesque attitude the young mans reply seemed to involve something more irritating to her feelings than even that absurd anticlimax she looked at him coldly and critically and appeared to hesitate whether to proceed is it far she asked  not more than ten minutes now as i shall go  and you wont have to smell your way again  no it is quite plain now he answered seriously the young girls sarcasm slipping harmlessly from his indian stolidity dont you smell it yourself  but miss nellies thin cold nostrils refused to take that vulgar interest  nor hear it listen  you forget i suffer the misfortune of having been brought up under a roof she replied coldly  thats true repeated low in all seriousness its not your fault but do you know i sometimes think i am peculiarly sensitive to water i feel it miles away at night though i may not see it or even know where it is i am conscious of it it is company to me when i am alone and i seem to hear it in my dreams there is no music as sweet to me as its song when you sang with me that day in church i seemed to hear it ripple in your voice it says to me more than the birds do more than the rarest plants i find it seems to live with me and for me it is my earliest recollection i know it will be my last for i shall die in its embrace do you think nellie he continued stopping short and gazing earnestly in her facedo you think that the chiefs knew this when they called me sleeping water  to miss nellies several gifts i fear the gods had not added poetry a slight knowledge of english verse of a select character unfortunately did not assist her in the interpretation of the young mans speech nor relieve her from the momentary feeling that he was at times deficient in intellect she preferred however to take a personal view of the question and expressed her sarcastic regret that she had not known before that she had been indebted to the great flume and ditch at excelsior for the pleasure of his acquaintance this pert remark occasioned some explanation which ended in the girls accepting a kiss in lieu of more logical argument nevertheless she was still conscious of an inward irritationalways distinct from her singular and perfectly material passionwhich found vent as the difficulties of their undeviating progress through the underbrush increased at last she lost her shoe again and stopped short its a pity your indian friends did not christen you wild mustard or clover she said satirically that you might have had some sympathies and longings for the open fields instead of these horrid jungles i know we will not get back in time  unfortunately low accepted this speech literally and with his remorseless gravity if my name annoys you i can get it changed by the legislature you know and i can find out what my fathers name was and take that my mother who died in giving me birth was the daughter of a chief  then your mother was really an indian said nellie and you areshe stopped short  but i told you all this the day we first met said low with grave astonishment dont you remember our long talk coming from church  no said nellie coldly you didnt tell me but she was obliged to drop her eyes before the unwavering undeniable truthfulness of his  you have forgotten he said calmly but it is only right you should have your own way in disposing of a name that i have cared little for and as youre to have a share of it  yes but its getting late and if we are not going forwardinterrupted the girl impatiently  we are going forward said low imperturbably but i wanted to tell you as we were speaking on that subject nellie looked at her watch ive been offered the place of botanist and naturalist in professor grants survey of mount shasta and if i take itwhy when i come back darlingwell  but youre not going just yet broke in nellie with a new expression in her face  no  then we need not talk of it now she said with animation  her sudden vivacity relieved him i see whats the matter he said gently looking down at her feet these little shoes were not made to keep step with a moccasin we must try another way he stooped as if to secure the erring buskin but suddenly lifted her like a child to his shoulder there he continued placing her arm around his neck you are clear of the ferns and brambles now and we can go on are you comfortable he looked up read her answer in her burning eyes and the warm lips pressed to his forehead at the roots of his straight dark hair and again moved onward as in a mesmeric dream but he did not swerve from his direct course and with a final dash through the undergrowth parted the leafy curtain before the spring  at first the young girl was dazzled by the strong light that came from a rent in the interwoven arches of the wood the breach had been caused by the huge bulk of one of the great giants that had half fallen and was lying at a steep angle against one of its mightiest brethren having borne down a lesser tree in the arc of its downward path two of the roots as large as younger trees tossed their blackened and bare limbs high in the air the springthe insignificant cause of this vast disruptiongurgled flashed and sparkled at the base the limpid baby fingers that had laid bare the foundations of that fallen column played with the still clinging rootlets laved the fractured and twisted limbs and widening filled with sleeping water the graves from which they had been torn  it had been going on for years down there said low pointing to a cavity from which the fresh water now slowly welled but it had been quickened by the rising of the subterranean springs and rivers which always occurs at a certain stage of the dry season i remember that on that very nightfor it happened a little after midnight when all sounds are more audiblei was troubled and oppressed in my sleep by what you would call a nightmare a feeling as if i was kept down by bonds and pinions that i longed to break and then i heard a crash in this direction and the first streak of morning brought me the sound and scent of water six months afterwards i chanced to find my way here as i told you and gave it your name i did not dream that i should ever stand beside it with you and have you christen it yourself  he unloosed the cup from his flask and filling it at the spring handed it to her but the young girl leant over the pool and pouring the water idly back said id rather put my feet in it maynt i  i dont understand you he said wonderingly  my feet are so hot and dusty the water looks deliciously cool may i  certainly  he turned away as nellie with apparent unconsciousness seated herself on the bank and removed her shoes and stockings when she had dabbled her feet a few moments in the pool she said over her shoulder  we can talk just as well cant we  certainly  well then why didnt you come to church more often and why didnt you think of telling father that you were convicted of sin and wanted to be baptized  i dont know hesitated the young man  well you lost the chance of having father convert you baptize you and take you into full church fellowship  i never thoughthe began  you never thought arent you a christian  i suppose so  he supposes so have you no convictionsno professions  but nellie i never thought that younever thought that iwhat do you think that i could ever be anything to a man who did not believe in justification by faith or in the covenant of church fellowship do you think father would let me  in his eagerness to defend himself he stepped to her side but seeing her little feet shining through the dark water like outcroppings of delicately veined quartz he stopped embarrassed miss nellie however leaped to one foot and shaking the other over the pool put her hand on his shoulder to steady herself you havent got a towelor she said dubiously looking at her small handkerchief anything to dry them on  but low did not as she perhaps expected offer his own handkerchief  if you take a bath after our fashion he said gravely you must learn to dry yourself after our fashion  lifting her again lightly in his arms he carried her a few steps to the sunny opening and bade her bury her feet in the dried mosses and baked withered grasses that were bleaching in a hollow the young girl uttered a cry of childish delight as the soft ciliated fibres touched her sensitive skin  it is healing too continued low a moccasin filled with it after a day on the trail makes you all right again  but miss nellie seemed to be thinking of something else  is that the way the squaws bathe and dry themselves  i dont know you forget i was a boy when i left them  and youre sure you never knew any  none  the young girl seemed to derive some satisfaction in moving her feet up and down for several minutes among the grasses in the hollow then after a pause said you are quite certain i am the first woman that ever touched this spring  not only the first woman but the first human being except myself  how nice  they had taken each others hands seated side by side they leaned against a curving elastic root that half supported half encompassed them the girls capricious fitful manner succumbed as before to the near contact of her companion looking into her eyes low fell into a sweet selfish lovers monologue descriptive of his past and present feelings towards her which she accepted with a heightened color a slight exchange of sentiment and a strange curiosity the sun had painted their halfembraced silhouettes against the slanting treetrunk and began to decline unnoticed the ripple of the water mingling with their whispers came as one sound to the listening ear even their eloquent silences were as deep and i wot perhaps as dangerous as the darkened pool that filled so noiselessly a dozen yards away so quiet were they that the tremor of invading wings once or twice shook the silence or the quick scamper of frightened feet rustled the dead grass but in the midst of a prolonged stillness the young man sprang up so suddenly that nellie was still half clinging to his neck as he stood erect hush he whispered some one is near  he disengaged her anxious hands gently leaped upon the slanting treetrunk and running halfway up its incline with the agility of a squirrel stretched himself at full length upon it and listened  to the impatient inexplicably startled girl it seemed an age before he rejoined her  you are safe he said hes going by the western trail toward indian spring  who is he she asked biting her lips with a poorly restrained gesture of mortification and disappointment  some stranger replied low  as long as he wasnt coming here why did you give me such a fright she said pettishly are you nervous because a single wayfarer happens to stray here  it was no wayfarer for he tried to keep near the trail said low he was a stranger to the wood for he lost his way every now and then he was seeking or expecting some one for he stopped frequently and waited or listened he had not walked far for he wore spurs that tinkled and caught in the brush and yet he had not ridden here for no horses hoofs passed the road since we have been here he must have come from indian spring  and you heard all that when you listened just now asked nellie half disdainfully  impervious to her incredulity low turned his calm eyes on her face certainly ill bet my life on what i say tell me do you know anybody in indian spring who would likely spy upon you  the young girl was conscious of a certain illdefined uneasiness but answered no  then it was not you he was seeking said low thoughtfully miss nellie had not time to notice the emphasis for he added you must go at once and lest you have been followed i will show you another way back to indian spring it is longer and you must hasten take your shoes and stockings with you until we are out of the bush  he raised her again in his arms and strode once more out through the covert into the dim aisles of the wood they spoke but little she could not help feeling that some other discordant element affecting him more strongly than it did her had come between them and was half perplexed and half frightened at the end of ten minutes he seated her upon a fallen branch and telling her he would return by the time she had resumed her shoes and stockings glided from her like a shadow she would have uttered an indignant protest at being left alone but he was gone ere she could detain him for a moment she thought she hated him but when she had mechanically shod herself once more not without nervous shivers at every falling needle he was at her side  do you know any one who wears a frieze coat like that he asked handing her a few torn shreds of wool affixed to a splinter of bark  miss nellie instantly recognized the material of a certain sportingcoat worn by mr jack brace on festive occasions but a strange yet infallible instinct that was part of her nature made her instantly disclaim all knowledge of it  no she said  not any one who scents himself with some doctors stuff like cologne continued low with the disgust of keen olfactory sensibilities  again miss nellie recognized the perfume with which the gallant expressman was wont to make redolent her little parlor but again she avowed no knowledge of its possessor well returned low with some disappointment such a man has been here be on your guard let us go at once  she required no urging to hasten her steps but hurried breathlessly at his side he had taken a new trail by which they left the wood at right angles with the highway two miles away following an almost effaced mule track along a slight depression of the plain deep enough however to hide them from view he accompanied her until rising to the level again she saw they were beginning to approach the highway and the distant roofs of indian spring nobody meeting you now he whispered would suspect where you had been good night until next weekremember  they pressed each others hands and standing on the slight ridge outlined against the paling sky in full view of the highway parting carelessly as if they had been chance met travellers but nellie could not restrain a parting backward glance as she left the ridge low had descended to the deserted trail and was running swiftly in the direction of the carquinez woods   chapter iv  teresa awoke with a start it was day already but how far advanced the even unchanging soft twilight of the woods gave no indication her companion had vanished and to her bewildered senses so had the campfire even to its embers and ashes was she awake or had she wandered away unconsciously in the night one glance at the tree above her dissipated the fancy there was the opening of her quaint retreat and the hanging strips of bark and at the foot of the opposite tree lay the carcass of the bear it had been skinned and as teresa thought with an inward shiver already looked half its former size  not yet accustomed to the fact that a few steps in either direction around the circumference of those great trunks produced the sudden appearance or disappearance of any figure teresa uttered a slight scream as her young companion unexpectedly stepped to her side you see a change here he said the stampedout ashes of the campfire lie under the brush and he pointed to some cleverly scattered boughs and strips of bark which completely effaced the traces of last nights bivouac we cant afford to call the attention of any packer or hunter who might straggle this way to this particular spot and this particular tree the more naturally he added as they always prefer to camp over an old fire accepting this explanation meekly as partly a reproach for her caprice of the previous night teresa hung her head  im very sorry she said but wouldnt that pointing to the carcass of the bear have made them curious  but lows logic was relentless  by this time there would have been little left to excite curiosity if you had been willing to leave those beasts to their work  im very sorry repeated the woman her lips quivering  they are the scavengers of the wood he continued in a lighter tone if you stay here you must try to use them to keep your house clean  teresa smiled nervously  i mean that they shall finish their work tonight he added and i shall build another campfire for us a mile from here until they do  but teresa caught his sleeve  no she said hurriedly dont please for me you must not take the trouble nor the risk hear me do please i can bear it i will bear ittonight i would have borne it last night but it was so strangeandshe passed her hands over her foreheadi think i must have been half mad but i am not so foolish now  she seemed so broken and despondent that he replied reassuringly perhaps it would be better that i should find another hidingplace for you until i can dispose of that carcass so that it will not draw dogs after the wolves and men after them besides your friend the sheriff will probably remember the bear when he remembers anything and try to get on its track again  hes a conceited fool broke in teresa in a high voice with a slight return of her old fury or hed have guessed where that shot came from and she added in a lower tone looking down at her limp and nerveless fingers he wouldnt have let a poor weak nervous wretch like me get away  but his deputy may put two and two together and connect your escape with it  teresas eyes flashed it would be like the dog just to save his pride to swear it was an ambush of my friends and that he was overpowered by numbers oh yes i see it all she almost screamed lashing herself into a rage at the bare contemplation of this diminution of her glory thats the dirty lie he tells everywhere and is telling now  she stamped her feet and glanced savagely around as if at any risk to proclaim the falsehood low turned his impassive truthful face towards her  sheriff dunn he began gravely is a politician and a fool when he takes to the trail as a hunter of man or beast but he is not a coward nor a liar your chances would be better if he wereif he laid your escape to an ambush of your friends than if his pride held you alone responsible  if hes such a good man why do you hesitate she replied bitterly why dont you give me up at once and do a service to one of your friends  i do not even know him returned low opening his clear eyes upon her ive promised to hide you here and i shall hide you as well from him as from anybody  teresa did not reply but suddenly dropping down upon the ground buried her face in her hands and began to sob convulsively low turned impassively away and putting aside the bark curtain climbed into the hollow tree in a few moments he reappeared laden with provisions and a few simple cooking utensils and touched her lightly on the shoulder she looked up timidly the paroxysm had passed but her lashes yet glittered  come he said come and get some breakfast i find you have eaten nothing since you have been heretwentyfour hours  i didnt know it she said with a faint smile then seeing his burden and possessed by a new and strange desire for some menial employment she said hurriedly let me carry somethingdo please and even tried to disencumber him  half annoyed low at last yielded and handing his rifle said there then take that but be carefulits loaded  a cruel blush burnt the womans face to the roots of her hair as she took the weapon hesitatingly in her hand  no she stammered hurriedly lifting her shamesuffused eyes to his no no  he turned away with an impatience which showed her how completely gratuitous had been her agitation and its significance and said well then give it back if you are afraid of it but she as suddenly declined to return it and shouldering it deftly took her place by his side silently they moved from the hollow tree together  during their walk she did not attempt to invade his taciturnity nevertheless she was as keenly alive and watchful of his every movement and gesture as if she had hung enchanted on his lips the unerring way with which he pursued a viewless undeviating path through those trackless woods his quick reconnaissance of certain trees or openings his mute inspection of some almost imperceptible footprint of bird or beast his critical examination of certain plants which he plucked and deposited in his deerskin haversack were not lost on the quickwitted woman as they gradually changed the clear unencumbered aisles of the central woods for a more tangled undergrowth teresa felt that subtle admiration which culminates in imitation and simulating perfectly the step tread and easy swing of her companion followed so accurately his lead that she won a gratified exclamation from him when their goal was reacheda broken blackened shaft splintered by longforgotten lightning in the centre of a tangled carpet of woodclover  i dont wonder you distanced the deputy he said cheerfully throwing down his burden if you can take the huntingpath like that in a few days if you stay here i can venture to trust you alone for a little pasear when you are tired of the tree  teresa looked pleased but busied herself with arrangements for the breakfast while he gathered the fuel for the roaring fire which soon blazed beside the shattered tree  teresas breakfast was a success it was a revelation to the young nomad whose ascetic habits and simple tastes were usually content with the most primitive forms of frontier cookery it was at least a surprise to him to know that without extra trouble kneaded flour water and saleratus need not be essentially heavy that coffee need not be boiled with sugar to the consistency of syrup that even that rarest delicacy small shreds of venison covered with ashes and broiled upon the end of a ramrod boldly thrust into the flames would be better and even more expeditiously cooked upon burning coals moved in his practical nature he was surprised to find this curious creature of disorganized nerves and useless impulses informed with an intelligence that did not preclude the welfare of humanity or the existence of a soul he respected her for some minutes until in the midst of a culinary triumph a big tear dropped and spluttered in the saucepan but he forgave the irrelevancy by taking no notice of it and by doing full justice to that particular dish  nevertheless he asked several questions based upon these recently discovered qualities it appeared that in the old days of her wanderings with the circus troupe she had often been forced to undertake this nomadic housekeeping but she despised it had never done it since and always had refused to do it for himthe personal pronoun referring as low understood to her lover curson not caring to revive these memories further low briefly concluded  i dont know what you were or what you may be but from what i see of you youve got all the sabe of a frontiermans wife  she stopped and looked at him and then with an impulse of impudence that only half concealed a more serious vanity asked do you think i might have made a good squaw  i dont know he replied quietly i never saw enough of them to know  teresa confident from his clear eyes that he spoke the truth but having nothing ready to follow this calm disposal of her curiosity relapsed into silence  the meal finished teresa washed their scant table equipage in a little spring near the campfire where catching sight of her disordered dress and collar she rapidly threw her shawl after the national fashion over her shoulder and pinned it quickly low cached the remaining provisions and the few cookingutensils under the dead embers and ashes obliterating all superficial indication of their campfire as deftly and artistically as he had before  there isnt the ghost of a chance he said in explanation that anybody but you or i will set foot here before we come back to supper but its well to be on guard ill take you back to the cabin now though i bet you could find your way there as well as i can  on their way back teresa ran ahead of her companion and plucking a few tiny leaves from a hidden oasis in the barkstrewn trail brought them to him  thats the kind youre looking for isnt it she said half timidly  it is responded low in gratified surprise but how did you know it youre not a botanist are you  i reckon not said teresa but you picked some when we came and i noticed what they were  here was indeed another revelation low stopped and gazed at her with such frank open utterly unabashed curiosity that her black eyes fell before him  and do you think he asked with logical deliberation that you could find any plant from another i should give you  yes  or from a drawing of it  yes perhaps even if you described it to me  a halfconfidential half fraternal silence followed  i tell you what ive got a book  i know it interrupted teresa full of these things  yes do you think you could  of course i could broke in teresa again  but you dont know what i mean said the imperturbable low  certainly i do why find em and preserve all the different ones for you to write underthats it isnt it  low nodded his head gratified but not entirely convinced that she had fully estimated the magnitude of the endeavor  i suppose said teresa in the feminine postscriptum voice which it would seem entered even the philosophical calm of the aisles they were treadingi suppose that she places great value on them  low had indeed heard science personified before nor was it at all impossible that the singular woman walking by his side had also he said yes but added in mental reference to the linnean society of san francisco that they were rather particular about the rarer kinds  content as teresa had been to believe in lows tender relations with some favored one of her sex this frank confession of a plural devotion staggered her  they she repeated  yes he continued calmly the botanical society i correspond with are more particular than the government survey  then you are doing this for a society demanded teresa with a stare  certainly im making a collection and classification of specimens i intendbut what are you looking at  teresa had suddenly turned away putting his hand lightly on her shoulder the young man brought her face to face with him again she was laughing  i thought all the while it was for a girl she said andbut here the mere effort of speech sent her off into an audible and genuine outburst of laughter it was the first time he had seen her even smile other than bitterly characteristically unconscious of any humor in her error he remained unembarrassed but he could not help noticing a change in the expression of her face her voice and even her intonation it seemed as if that fit of laughter had loosed the last ties that bound her to a selfimposed character had swept away the last barrier between her and her healthier nature had dispossessed a painful unreality and relieved the morbid tension of a purely nervous attitude the change in her utterance and the resumption of her softer spanish accent seemed to have come with her confidences and low took leave of her before their sylvan cabin with a comrades heartiness and a complete forgetfulness that her voice had ever irritated him  when he returned that afternoon he was startled to find the cabin empty but instead of bearing any appearance of disturbance or hurried flight the rude interior seemed to have magically assumed a decorous order and cleanliness unknown before fresh bark hid the inequalities of the floor the skins and blankets were folded in the corners the rude shelves were carefully arranged even a few tall ferns and bright but quickly fading flowers were disposed around the blackened chimney she had evidently availed herself of the change of clothing he had brought her for her late garments were hanging from the hastilydevised wooden pegs driven in the wall the young man gazed around him with mixed feelings of gratification and uneasiness his presence had been dispossessed in a single hour his ten years of lonely habitation had left no trace that this woman had not effaced with a deft move of her hand more than that it looked as if she had always occupied it and it was with a singular conviction that even when she should occupy it no longer it would only revert to him as her dwelling that he dropped the bark shutters athwart the opening and left it to follow her  to his quick ear fine eye and abnormal senses this was easy enough she had gone in the direction of this mornings camp once or twice he paused with a halfgesture of recognition and a characteristic good at the place where she had stopped but was surprised to find that her main course had been as direct as his own deviating from this direct line with indian precaution he first made a circuit of the camp and approached the shattered trunk from the opposite direction he consequently came upon teresa unawares but the momentary astonishment and embarrassment were his alone  he scarcely recognized her she was wearing the garments he had brought her the day beforea certain discarded gown of miss nellie wynn which he had hurriedly begged from her under the pretext of clothing the wife of a distressed overland emigrant then on the way to the mines although he had satisfied his conscience with the intention of confessing the pious fraud to her when teresa was gone and safe from pursuit it was not without a sense of remorse that he witnessed the sacrilegious transformation the two women were nearly the same height and size and although teresas maturer figure accented the outlines more strongly it was still becoming enough to increase his irritation  of this becomingness she was doubtless unaware at the moment that he surprised her she was conscious of having a change and this had emboldened her to do her hair and otherwise compose herself after their greeting she was the first to allude to the dress regretting that it was not more of a rough disguise and that as she must now discard the national habit of wearing her shawl manta fashion over her head she wanted a hat but you must not she said borrow any more dresses for me from your young woman buy them for me at some shop they left me enough money for that low gently put aside the few pieces of gold she had drawn from her pocket and briefly reminded her of the suspicion such a purchase by him would produce thats so she said with a laugh caramba what a mule im becoming ah wait a moment i have it buy me a common felt hata mans hatas if for yourself as a change to that animal pointing to the foxtailed cap he wore summer and winter and ill show you a trick i havent run a theatrical wardrobe for nothing nor had she for the hat thus procured a few days later became by the aid of a silk handkerchief and a bluejays feather a fascinating pork pie  whatever cause of annoyance to low still lingered in teresas dress it was soon forgotten in a palpable evidence of teresas value as botanical assistant it appeared that during the afternoon she had not only duplicated his specimens but had discovered one or two rare plants as yet unclassified in the flora of the carquinez woods he was delighted and in turn over the campfire yielded up some details of his present life and some of his earlier recollections  you dont remember anything of your father she asked did he ever try to seek you out  no why should he replied the imperturbable low he was not a cherokee  no he was a beast responded teresa promptly and your motherdo you remember her  no i think she died  you think she died dont you know  no  then youre another said teresa notwithstanding this frankness they shook hands for the night teresa nestling like a rabbit in a hollow by the side of the campfire low with his feet towards it indianwise and his head and shoulders pillowed on his haversack only half distinguishable in the darkness beyond  with such trivial details three uneventful days slipped by their retreat was undisturbed nor could low detect by the least evidence to his acute perceptive faculties that any intruding feet had since crossed the belt of shade the echoes of passing events at indian spring had recorded the escape of teresa as occurring at a remote and purely imaginative distance and her probable direction the county of yolo  can you remember he one day asked her what time it was when you cut the riata and got away  teresa pressed her hands upon her eyes and temples  about three i reckon  and you were here at seven you could have covered some ground in four hours  perhapsi dont know she said her voice taking up its old quality again dont ask mei ran all the way  her face was quite pale as she removed her hands from her eyes and her breath came as quickly as if she had just finished that race for life  then you think i am safe here she added after a pause  perfectlyuntil they find you are not in yolo then theyll look here and thats the time for you to go there teresa smiled timidly  it will take them some time to search yolounless she added youre tired of me here the charming non sequitur did not however seem to strike the young man ive got time yet to find a few more plants for you she suggested  oh certainly  and give you a few more lessons in cooking  perhaps  the conscientious and literal low was beginning to doubt if she were really practical how otherwise could she trifle with such a situation  it must be confessed that that day and the next she did trifle with it she gave herself up to a grave and delicious languor that seemed to flow from shadow and silence and permeate her entire being she passed hours in a thoughtful repose of mind and spirit that seemed to fall like balm from those steadfast guardians and distill their gentle ether in her soul or breathed into her listening ear immunity from the forgotten past and security for the present if there was no dream of the future in this calm even recurrence of placid existence so much the better the simple details of each succeeding day the quaint housekeeping the brief companionship and coming and going of her young hosthimself at best a crystallized personification of the sedate and hospitable woodssatisfied her feeble cravings she no longer regretted the inferior passion that her fears had obliged her to take the first night she came she began to look up to this young manso much younger than herselfwithout knowing what it meant it was not until she found that this attitude did not detract from his picturesqueness that she discovered herself seeking for reasons to degrade him from this seductive eminence  a week had elapsed with little change on two days he had been absent all day returning only in time to sup in the hollow tree which thanks to the final removal of the dead bear from its vicinity was now considered a safer retreat than the exposed campfire on the first of these occasions she received him with some preoccupation paying but little heed to the scant gossip he brought from indian spring and retiring early under the plea of fatigue that he might seek his own distant campfire which thanks to her stronger nerves and regained courage she no longer required so near on the second occasion he found her writing a letter more or less blotted with her tears when it was finished she begged him to post it at indian spring where in two days an answer would be returned under cover to him  i hope you will be satisfied then she added  satisfied with what queried the young man  youll see she replied giving him her cold hand goodnight  but cant you tell me now he remonstrated retaining her hand  wait two days longerit isnt much was all she vouchsafed to answer  the two days passed their former confidence and good fellowship were fully restored when the morning came on which he was to bring the answer from the postoffice at indian spring he had talked again of his future and had recorded his ambition to procure the appointment of naturalist to a government surveying expedition she had even jocularly proposed to dress herself in mans attire and enlist as his assistant  but you will be safe with your friends i hope by that time responded low  safe with my friends she repeated in a lower voice safe with my friendsyes an awkward silence followed teresa broke it gayly but your girl your sweetheart my benefactorwill she let you go  i havent told her yet said low gravely but i dont see why she should object  object indeed interrupted teresa in a high voice and a sudden and utterly gratuitous indignation how should she id like to see her do it  she accompanied him some distance to the intersection of the trail where they parted in good spirits on the dusty plain without a gale was blowing that rocked the high treetops above her but tempered and subdued entered the low aisles with a fluttering breath of morning and a sound like the cooing of doves never had the wood before shown so sweet a sense of security from the turmoil and tempest of the world beyond never before had an intrusion from the outer lifeeven in the shape of a letterseemed so wicked a desecration tempted by the solicitation of air and shade she lingered with lows herbarium slung on her shoulder  a strange sensation like a shiver suddenly passed across her nerves and left them in a state of rigid tension with every sense morbidly acute with every faculty strained to its utmost the subtle instincts of lows woodcraft transformed and possessed her she knew it now a new element was in the wooda strange beinganother lifeanother man approaching she did not even raise her head to look about her but darted with the precision and fleetness of an arrow in the direction of her tree but her feet were arrested her limbs paralyzed her very existence suspended by the sound of a voice  teresa  it was a voice that had rung in her ears for the last two years in all phases of intensity passion tenderness and anger a voice upon whose modulations rude and unmusical though they were her heart and soul had hung in transport or anguish but it was a chime that had rung its last peal to her senses as she entered the carquinez woods and for the last week had been as dead to her as a voice from the grave it was the voice of her loverdick curson   chapter v  the wind was blowing towards the stranger so that he was nearly upon her when teresa first took the alarm he was a man over six feet in height strongly built with a slight tendency to a roundness of bulk which suggested reserved rather than impeded energy his thick beard and moustache were closely cropped around a small and handsome mouth that lisped except when he was excited but always kept fellowship with his blue eyes in a perpetual smile of halfcynical goodhumor his dress was superior to that of the locality his general expression that of a man of the world albeit a world of san francisco sacramento and murderers bar he advanced towards her with a laugh and an outstretched hand  you here she gasped drawing back  apparently neither surprised nor mortified at this reception he answered frankly yeth you didnt expect me i know but doloreth showed me the letter you wrote her andwellhere i am ready to help you with two men and a thpare horthe waiting outside the woodth on the blind trail  youyouhere she only repeated  curson shrugged his shoulders yeth of courth you never expected to thee me again and leatht of all here ill admit that ill thay i wouldnt if id been in your plathe ill go further and thay you didnt want to thee me againanywhere but it all cometh to the thame thing here i am i read the letter you wrote doloreth i read how you were hiding here under dunnth very nothe with his whole pothe out cavorting round and barkin up the wrong tree i made up my mind to come down here with a few nathty friends of mine and cut you out under dunnth nothe and run you over into yubathat th all  how dared she show you my letteryou of all men how dared she ask your help continued teresa fiercely  but she didnt athk my help he responded coolly dd if i dont think she jutht calculated id be glad to know you were being hunted down and thtarving that i might put dunn on your track  you lie said teresa furiously she was my friend a better friend than those who professedmore she added with a contemptuous drawing away of her skirt as if she feared cursons contamination  all right thettle that with her when you go back continued curson philosophically we can talk of that on the way the thing now ith to get up and get out of thethe woods come  teresas only reply was a gesture of scorn  i know all that continued curson half soothingly but theyre waiting  let them wait i shall not go  what will you do  stay heretill the wolves eat me  teresa listen dit allteresatita see here he said with sudden energy i swear to god its all right im willing to let bygones be bygones and take a new deal you shall come back as if nothing had happened and take your old place as before i dont mind doing the square thing all round if thats what you mean if thats all that stands in the way why look upon the thing as settled there tita old girl come  careless or oblivious of her stony silence and starting eyes he attempted to take her hand but she disengaged herself with a quick movement drew back and suddenly crouched like a wild animal about to spring curson folded his arms as she leaped to her feet the little dagger she had drawn from her garter flashed menacingly in the air but she stopped  the man before her remained erect impassive and silent the great trees around and beyond her remained erect impassive and silent there was no sound in the dim aisles but the quick panting of her mad passion no movement in the calm motionless shadow but the trembling of her uplifted steel her arm bent and slowly sank her fingers relaxed the knife fell from her hand  thatth quite enough for a thow he said with a return to his former cynical ease and a perceptible tone of relief in his voice itth the thame old teretha well then if you wont go with me go without me take the led horthe and cut away dick athley and petereth will follow you over the county line if you want thome money there it ith he took a buckskin purse from his pocket if you wont take it from mehe hesitated as she made no replyathleyth flush and ready to lend you thome  she had not seemed to hear him but had stooped in some embarrassment picked up the knife and hastily hid it then with averted face and nervous fingers was beginning to tear strips of loose bark from the nearest trunk  well what do you thay  i dont want any money and i shall stay here she hesitated looked around her and then added with an effort i suppose you meant well be it so let bygones be bygones you said just now its the same old teresa so she is and seeing shes the same shes better here than anywhere else  there was enough bitterness in her tone to call for cursons halfperfunctory sympathy  that be dd he responded quickly jutht thay youll come tita and  she stopped his halfspoken sentence with a negative gesture you dont understand i shall stay here  but even if they dont theek you here you cant live here forever the friend that you wrote about who wath tho good to you you know cant keep you here alwayth and are you thure you can alwayth trutht her  it isnt a woman its a man she stopped short and colored to the line of her forehead who said it was a woman she continued fiercely as if to cover her confusion with a burst of gratuitous anger is that another of your lies  cursons lips which for a moment had completely lost their smile were now drawn together in a prolonged whistle he gazed curiously at her gown at her hat at the bow of bright ribbon that tied her black hair and said ah  a poor man who has kept my secret she went on hurriedlya man as friendless and lonely as myself yes disregarding cursons cynical smile a man who has shared everything  naturally suggested curson  and turned himself out of his only shelter to give me a roof and covering she continued mechanically struggling with the new and horrible fancy that his words awakened  and thlept every night at indian thpring to save your reputation said curson of courthe  teresa turned very white curson was prepared for an outburst of furyperhaps even another attack but the crushed and beaten woman only gazed at him with frightened and imploring eyes for gods sake dick dont say that  the amiable cynic was staggered his goodhumor and a certain chivalrous instinct he could not repress got the better of him he shrugged his shoulders what i thay and what you do teretha neednt make us quarrel ive no claim on youi know it onlya vivid sense of the ridiculous powerful in men of his stamp completed her victoryonly dont thay anything about my coming down here to cut you out from thethethe sheriff he gave utterance to a short but unaffected laugh made a slight grimace and turned to go  teresa did not join in his mirth awkward as it would have been if he had taken a severer view of the subject she was mortified even amidst her fears and embarrassment at his levity just as she had become convinced that his jealousy had made her overconscious his apparent goodhumored indifference gave that overconsciousness a guilty significance yet this was lost in her sudden alarm as her companion looking up uttered an exclamation and placed his hand upon his revolver with a sinking conviction that the climax had come teresa turned her eyes from the dim aisles beyond low was approaching the catastrophe seemed complete  she had barely time to utter an imploring whisper in the name of god not a word to him but a change had already come over her companion it was no longer a parley with a foolish woman he had to deal with a man like himself as lows dark face and picturesque figure came nearer mr cursons proposed method of dealing with him was made audible  ith it a mulatto or a thircuth or both he asked with affected anxiety  lows indian phlegm was impervious to such assault he turned to teresa without apparently noticing her companion i turned back he said quietly as soon as i knew there were strangers here i thought you might need me she noticed for the first time that in addition to his rifle he carried a revolver and huntingknife in his belt  yeth returned curson with an ineffectual attempt to imitate lows phlegm but ath i did nt happen to be a sthranger to thith lady perhaps it wathnt nethethary particularly ath i had two friends  waiting at the edge of the wood with a led horse interrupted low without addressing him but apparently continuing his explanation to teresa but she turned to low with feverish anxiety  thats sohe is an old friendshe gave a quick imploring glance at cursonan old friend who came to help me awayhe is very kind she stammered turning alternately from the one to the other but i told him there was no hurryat least todaythat youwerevery goodtoo and would hide me a little longer until your planyou know your plan she added with a look of beseeching significance to lowcould be tried and then with a helpless conviction that her excuses motives and emotions were equally and perfectly transparent to both men she stopped in a tremble  perhapth itth jutht ath well then that the gentleman came thraight here and didnt tackle my two friendth when he pathed them observed curson half sarcastically  i have not passed your friends nor have i been near them said low looking at him for the first time with the same exasperating calm or perhaps i should not be here or they there i knew that one man entered the wood a few moments ago and that two men and four horses remained outside  thats true said teresa to curson excitedlythats true he knows all he can see without looking hear without listening heheshe stammered colored and stopped  the two men had faced each other curson after his first goodnatured impulse had retained no wish to regain teresa whom he felt he no longer loved and yet who for that very reason perhaps had awakened his chivalrous instincts low equally on his side was altogether unconscious of any feeling which might grow into a passion and prevent him from letting her go with another if for her own safety they were both men of a certain taste and refinement yet in spite of all this some vague instinct of the baser male animal remained with them and they were moved to a mutually aggressive attitude in the presence of the female  one word more and the opening chapter of a sylvan iliad might have begun but this modern helen saw it coming and arrested it with an inspiration of feminine genius without being observed she disengaged her knife from her bosom and let it fall as if by accident it struck the ground with the point of its keen blade bounded and rolled between them the two men started and looked at each other with a foolish air curson laughed  i reckon she can take care of herthelf he said extending his hand to low im off but if im wanted shell know where to find me low took the proffered hand but neither of the two men looked at teresa the reserve of antagonism once broken a few words of caution advice and encouragement passed between them in apparent obliviousness of her presence or her personal responsibility as curson at last nodded a farewell to her low insisted upon accompanying him as far as the horses and in another moment she was again alone  she had saved a quarrel between them at the sacrifice of herself for her vanity was still keen enough to feel that this exhibition of her old weakness had degraded her in their eyes and worse had lost the respect her late restraint had won from low they had treated her like a child or a crazy woman perhaps even now were exchanging criticisms upon herperhaps pitying her yet she had prevented a quarrel a fight possibly the death of either one or the other of these men who despised her for none better knew than she the trivial beginning and desperate end of these encounters would theywould low ever realize it and forgive her her small dark hands went up to her eyes and she sank upon the ground she looked through tearveiled lashes upon the mute and giant witnesses of her deceit and passion and tried to draw from their immovable calm strength and consolation as before but even they seemed to stand apart reserved and forbidding  when low returned she hoped to gather from his eyes and manner what had passed between him and her former lover but beyond a mere gentle abstraction at times he retained his usual calm she was at last forced to allude to it herself with simulated recklessness  i suppose i didnt get a very good character from my last place she said with a laugh  i dont understand you he replied in evident sincerity  she bit her lip and was silent but as they were returning home she said gently i hope you were not angry with me for the lie i told when i spoke of your plan i could not give the real reason for not returning withwiththat man but its not all a lie i have a planif you havent when you are ready to go to sacramento to take your place dress me as an indian boy paint my face and let me go with you you can leave methereyou know  its not a bad idea he responded gravely we will see  on the next day and the next the rencontre seemed to be forgotten the herbarium was already filled with rare specimens teresa had even overcome her feminine repugnance to bugs and creeping things so far as to assist in his entomological collection he had drawn from a sacred cache in the hollow of a tree the few worn textbooks from which he had studied  they seem very precious she said with a smile  very he replied gravely there was one with plates that the ants ate up and it will be six months before i can afford to buy another  teresa glanced hurriedly over his wellworn buckskin suit at his calico shirt with its pattern almost obliterated by countless washings and became thoughtful  i suppose you couldnt buy one at indian spring she said innocently  for once low was startled out of his phlegm indian spring he ejaculated perhaps not even in san francisco these came from the states  how did you get them persisted teresa  i bought them for skins i got over the ridge  i didnt mean thatbut no matter then you mean to sell that bearskin dont you she added  low had in fact already sold it the proceeds having been invested in a gold ring for miss nellie which she scrupulously did not wear except in his presence in his singular truthfulness he would have frankly confessed it to teresa but the secret was not his own he contented himself with saying that he had disposed of it at indian spring teresa started and communicated unconsciously some of her nervousness to her companion they gazed in each others eyes with a troubled expression  do you think it was wise to sell that particular skin which might be identified she asked timidly  low knitted his arched brows but felt a strange sense of relief perhaps not he said carelessly but its too late now to mend matters  that afternoon she wrote several letters and tore them up one however she retained and handed it to low to post at indian spring whither he was going she called his attention to the superscription being the same as the previous letter and added with affected gayety but if the answer isnt as prompt perhaps it will be pleasanter than the last her quick feminine eye noticed a little excitement in his manner and a more studious attention to his dress only a few days before she would not have allowed this to pass without some mischievous allusion to his mysterious sweetheart it troubled her greatly now to find that she could not bring herself to this household pleasantry and that her lip trembled and her eye grew moist as he parted from her  the afternoon passed slowly he had said he might not return to supper until late nevertheless a strange restlessness took possession of her as the day wore on she put aside her work the darning of his stockings and rambled aimlessly through the woods she had wandered she knew not how far when she was suddenly seized with the same vague sense of a foreign presence which she had felt before could it be curson again with a word of warning no she knew it was not he so subtle had her sense become that she even fancied that she detected in the invisible aura projected by the unknown no significance or relation to herself or low and felt no fear nevertheless she deemed it wisest to seek the protection of her sylvan bower and hurried swiftly thither  but not so quickly nor directly that she did not once or twice pause in her flight to examine the newcomer from behind a friendly trunk he was a strangera young fellow with a brown mustache wearing heavy mexican spurs in his ridingboots whose tinkling he apparently did not care to conceal he had perceived her and was evidently pursuing her but so awkwardly and timidly that she eluded him with ease when she had reached the security of the hollow tree and had pulled the curtain of bark before the narrow opening with her eye to the interstices she waited his coming he arrived breathlessly in the open space before the tree where the bear once lay the dazed bewildered and half awed expression of his face as he glanced around him and through the openings of the forest aisles brought a faint smile to her saddened face at last he called in a half embarrassed voice  miss nellie  the smile faded from teresas cheek who was miss nellie she pressed her ear to the opening miss wynn the voice again called but was lost in the echoless woods devoured with a new and gratuitous curiosity in another moment teresa felt she would have disclosed herself at any risk but the stranger rose and began to retrace his steps long after his tinkling spurs were lost in the distance teresa remained like a statue staring at the place where he had stood then she suddenly turned like a mad woman glanced down at the gown she was wearing tore it from her back as if it had been a polluted garment and stamped upon it in a convulsion of rage and then with her beautiful bare arms clasped together over her head she threw herself upon her couch in a tempest of tears   chapter vi  when miss nellie reached the first mining extension of indian spring which surrounded it like a fosse she descended for one instant into one of its trenches opened her parasol removed her duster hid it under a bowlder and with a few shivers and catlike strokes of her soft hands not only obliterated all material traces of the stolen cream of carquinez woods but assumed a feline demureness quite inconsistent with any moral dereliction unfortunately she forgot to remove at the same time a certain ring from her third finger which she had put on with her duster and had worn at no other time with this slight exception the benignant fate which always protected that young person brought her in contact with the burnham girls at one end of the main street as the returning coach to excelsior entered the other and enabled her to take leave of them before the coach office with a certain ostentation of parting which struck mr jack brace who was lingering at the doorway into a state of utter bewilderment  here was miss nellie wynn the belle of excelsior calm quiet selfpossessed her chaste cambric skirts and dainty shoes as fresh as when she had left her fathers house but where was the woman of the brown duster and where the yellowdressed apparition of the woods he was feebly repeating to himself his mental adjuration of a few hours before when he caught her eye and was taken with a blush and a fit of coughing could he have been such an egregious fool and was it not plainly written on his embarrassed face for her to read  are we going down together asked miss nellie with an exceptionally gracious smile  there was neither affectation nor coquetry in this advance the girl had no idea of braces suspicion of her nor did any uneasy desire to placate or deceive a possible rival of lows prompt her graciousness she simply wished to shake off in this encounter the already stale excitement of the past two hours as she had shaken the dust of the woods from her clothes it was characteristic of her irresponsible nature and transient susceptibilities that she actually enjoyed the relief of change more than that i fear she looked upon this infidelity to a past dubious pleasure as a moral principle a mild open flirtation with a recognized man like brace after her secret passionate tryst with a nameless nomad like low was an ethical equipoise that seemed proper to one of her religious education  brace was only too happy to profit by miss nellies condescension he at once secured the seat by her side and spent the four hours and a half of their return journey to excelsior in blissful but timid communion with her if he did not dare to confess his past suspicions he was equally afraid to venture upon the boldness he had premeditated a few hours before he was therefore obliged to take a middle course of slightly egotistical narration of his own personal adventures with which he beguiled the young girls ear this he only departed from once to describe to her a valuable grizzly bearskin which he had seen that day for sale at indian spring with a view to divining her possible acceptance of it for a buggy robe and once to comment upon a ring which she had inadvertently disclosed in pulling off her glove  its only an old family keepsake she added with easy mendacity and affecting to recognize in mr braces curiosity a not unnatural excuse for toying with her charming fingers she hid them in chaste and virginal seclusion in her lap until she could recover the ring and resume her glove  a week passeda week of peculiar and desiccating heat for even those dry sierra tablelands the long days were filled with impalpable dust and acrid haze suspended in the motionless air the nights were breathless and dewless the cold wind which usually swept down from the snow line was laid to sleep over a dark monotonous level whose horizon was pricked with the eating fires of burning forest crests the lagging coach of indian spring drove up at excelsior and precipitated its passengers with an accompanying cloud of dust before the excelsior hotel as they emerged from the coach mr brace standing in the doorway closely scanned their begrimed and almost unrecognizable faces they were the usual type of travelers a single professional man in dusty black a few traders in tweeds and flannels a sprinkling of miners in red and gray shirts a chinaman a negro and a mexican packer or muleteer this latter for a moment mingled with the crowd in the barroom and even penetrated the corridor and diningroom of the hotel as if impelled by a certain semicivilized curiosity and then strolled with a lazy dragging stephalf impeded by the enormous leather leggings chains and spurs peculiar to his classdown the main street the darkness was gathering but the muleteer indulged in the same childish scrutiny of the dimly lighted shops magazines and saloons and even of the occasional groups of citizens at the street corners apparently young as far as the outlines of his figure could be seen he seemed to show even more than the usual concern of masculine excelsior in the charms of womankind the few female figures about at that hour or visible at window or veranda received his marked attention he respectfully followed the two auburnhaired daughters of deacon johnson on their way to choir meeting to the door of the church not content with that act of discreet gallantry after they had entered he managed to slip in unperceived behind them  the memorial of the excelsior gamblers generosity was a modern building large and pretentious for even mr wynns popularity and had been goodhumoredly known in the characteristic language of the generous donors as one of the biggest religious bluffs on record its groined rafters which were so new and spicy that they still suggested their native forest aisles seldom covered more than a hundred devotees and in the rambling choir with its bare space for the future organ the few choristers gathered round a small harmonium were lost in the deepening shadow of that summer evening the muleteer remained hidden in the obscurity of the vestibule after a few moments desultory conversation in which it appeared that the unexpected absence of miss nellie wynn their leader would prevent their practicing the choristers withdrew the stranger who had listened eagerly drew back in the darkness as they passed out and remained for a few moments a vague and motionless figure in the silent church then coming cautiously to the window the flapping broadbrimmed hat was put aside and the faint light of the dying day shone in the black eyes of teresa despite her face darkened with dye and disfigured with dust the matted hair piled and twisted around her head the strange dress and boyish figure one swift glance from under her raised lashes betrayed her identity  she turned aside mechanically into the first pew picked up and opened a hymnbook her eyes became riveted on a name written on the titlepage nellie wynn her name and her book the instinct that had guided her here was right the slight gossip of her fellowpassengers was right this was the clergymans daughter whose praise filled all mouths this was the unknown girl the stranger was seeking but who in her turn perhaps had been seeking lowthe girl who absorbed his fancythe secret of his absences his preoccupation his coldness this was the girl whom to see perhaps in his arms she was now periling her liberty and her life unknown to him a slight odor some faint perfume of its owner came from the book it was the same she had noticed in the dress low had given her she flung the volume to the ground and throwing her arms over the back of the pew before her buried her face in her hands  in that light and attitude she might have seemed some rapt acolyte abandoned to selfcommunion but whatever yearning her soul might have had for higher sympathy or deeper consolation i fear that the spiritual tabernacle of excelsior and the reverend mr wynn did not meet that requirement she only felt the dry ovenlike heat of that vast shell empty of sentiment and beauty hollow in its pretense and dreary in its desolation she only saw in it a chief altar for the glorification of this girl who had absorbed even the pure worship of her companion and converted and degraded his sublime paganism to her petty creed with a womans withering contempt for her own art displayed in another woman she thought how she herself could have touched him with the peace that the majesty of their woodland aislesso unlike this pillared shamhad taught her own passionate heart had she but dared mingling with this imperfect theology she felt she could have proved to him also that a brunette and a woman of her experience was better than an immature blonde she began to loathe herself for coming hither and dreaded to meet his face here a sudden thought struck her what if he had not come here what if she had been mistaken what if her rash interpretation of his absence from the wood that night was simple madness what if he should returnif he had already returned she rose to her feet whitening yet joyful with the thought she would return at once what was the girl to her now yet there was time to satisfy herself if he were at her house she had been told where it was she could find it in the dark an open door or window would betray some sign or sound of the occupants she rose replaced her hat over her eyes knotted her flaunting scarf around her throat groped her way to the door and glided into the outer darkness   chapter vii  it was quite dark when mr jack brace stopped before father wynns open door the windows were also invitingly open to the wayfarer as were the pastoral counsels of father wynn delivered to some favored guest within in a tone of voice loud enough for a pulpit jack brace paused the visitor was the convalescent sheriff jim dunn who had publicly commemorated his recovery by making his first call upon the father of his inamorata the reverend mr wynn had been expatiating upon the unremitting heat as a possible precursor of forest fires and exhibiting some catholic knowledge of the designs of a deity in that regard and what should be the policy of the legislature when mr brace concluded to enter mr wynn and the wounded man who occupied an armchair by the window were the only occupants of the room but in spite of the formers ostentatious greeting brace could see that his visit was inopportune and unwelcome the sheriff nodded a quick impatient recognition which had it not been accompanied by an anathema on the heat might have been taken as a personal insult neither spoke of miss nellie although it was patent to brace that they were momentarily expecting her all of which went far to strengthen a certain wavering purpose in his mind  ah ha strong language mr dunn said father wynn referring to the sheriffs adjuration but out of the fullness of the heart the mouth speaketh job sir cursed we are told and even expressed himself in vigorous hebrew regarding his birthday ha ha im not opposed to that when i have often wrestled with the spirit i confess i have sometimes said dn you yes sir dn you  there was something so unutterably vile in the reverend gentlemans utterance and emphasis of this oath that the two men albeit both easy and facile blasphemers felt shocked as the purest of actresses is apt to overdo the rakishness of a gay lothario father wynns immaculate conception of an imprecation was something terrible but he added the law ought to interfere with the reckless use of campfires in the woods in such weather by packers and prospecters  it isnt so much the work of white men broke in brace as it is of greasers chinamen and diggers especially diggers theres that blasted low ranges the whole carquinez woods as if they were his i reckon he aint particular just where he throws his matches  but hes not a digger hes a cherokee and only a halfbreed at that interpolated wynn unless he added with the artful suggestion of the betrayed trust of a too credulous christian he deceived me in this as in other things  in what other things low had deceived him he did not say but to the astonishment of both men dunn growled a dissent to braces proposition either from some secret irritation with that possible rival or impatience at the prolonged absence of nellie he had had enough of that sort of hogwash ladled out to him for genuine liquor as to the carquinez woods he dunn didnt know why low hadnt as much right there as if hed grabbed it under a preemption law and didnt live there with this hint at certain speculations of father wynn in public lands for a homestead he added that if they brace and wynn could bring him along any older american settler than an indian they might rake down his dunns pile unprepared for this turn in the conversation wynn hastened to explain that he did not refer to the pure aborigine whose gradual extinction no one regretted more than himself but to the mongrel who inherited only the vices of civilization there should be a law sir against the mingling of races there are men sir who violate the laws of the most high by living with indian womensquaw men sir as they are called  dunn rose with a face livid with weakness and passion who dares say that they are a dd sight better than sneaking northern abolitionists who married their daughters to buck niggers likebut a spasm of pain withheld this parthian shot at the politics of his two companions and he sank back helplessly in his chair  an awkward silence ensued the three men looked at each other in embarrassment and confusion dunn felt that he had given way to a gratuitous passion wynn had a vague presentiment that he had said something that imperiled his daughters prospects and brace was divided between an angry retort and the secret purpose already alluded to  its all the blasted heat said dunn with a forced smile pushing away the whiskey which wynn had ostentatiously placed before him  of course said wynn hastily only its a pity nellie aint here to give you her smellingsalts she ought to be back now he added no longer mindful of braces presence the coach is overdue now though i reckon the heat made yuba bill take it easy at the up grade  if you mean the coach from indian spring said brace quietly its in already but miss nellie didnt come on it  maybe she got out at the crossing said wynn cheerfully she sometimes does  she didnt take the coach at indian spring returned brace because i saw it leave and passed it on buckskin ten minutes ago coming up the hills  shes stopped over at burnhams said wynn reflectively then in response to the significant silence of his guests he added in a tone of chagrin which his forced heartiness could not disguise well boys its a disappointment all round but we must take the lesson as it comes ill go over to the coach office and see if shes sent any word make yourselves at home until i return  when the door had closed behind him brace arose and took his hat as if to go with his hand on the lock he turned to his rival who halfhidden in the gathering darkness still seemed unable to comprehend his illluck  if youre waiting for that baldheaded fraud to come back with the truth about his daughter said brace coolly youd better send for your things and take up your lodgings here  what do you mean said dunn sternly  i mean that shes not at the burnhams i mean that he does or does not know where she is and that in either case he is not likely to give you information but i can  you can  yes  then where is she  in the carquinez woods in the arms of the man you were just defendinglow the halfbreed  the room had become so dark that from the road nothing could be distinguished only the momentary sound of struggling feet was heard  sit down said braces voice and dont be a fool youre too weak and it aint a fair fight let go your hold im not lyingi wish to god i was  there was a silence and brace resumed weve been rivals i know maybe i thought my chance as good as yours if what i say aint truth well stand as we stood before and if youre on the shoot im your man when you like where you like or on sight if you choose but i cant see another man played upon as ive been played upongiven dead away as i have been it aint on the square  there he continued after a pause thats right now steady listen a week ago that girl went down just like this to indian spring it was given out like this that she went to the burnhams i dont mind saying dunn that i went down myself all on the square thinking i might get a show to talk to her just as you might have done you know if you had my chance i didnt come across her anywhere but two men that i met thought they recognized her in a disguise going into the woods not suspecting anything i went after her saw her at a distance in the middle of the woods in another dress that i can swear to and was just coming up to her when she vanishedwent like a squirrel up a tree or down like a gopher in the ground but vanished  is that all said dunns voice and just because you were a dd fool or had taken a little too much whiskey you thought  steady thats just what i said to myself interrupted brace coolly particularly when i saw her that same afternoon in another dress saying goodby to the burnhams as fresh as a rose and as cold as those snowpeaks only one thingshe had a ring on her finger she never wore before and didnt expect me to see  what if she did she might have bought it i reckon she hasnt to consult you broke in dunns voice sternly  she didnt buy it continued brace quietly low gave that jew trader a bearskin in exchange for it and presented it to her i found that out two days afterwards i found out that out of the whole afternoon she spent less than an hour with the burnhams i found out that she bought a duster like the disguise the two men saw her in i found the yellow dress she wore that day hanging up in lows cabinthe place where i saw her gothe rendezvous where she meets him oh youre listenin are you stop sit down  i discovered it by accident continued the voice of brace when all was again quiet it was hidden as only a squirrel or an injin can hide when they improve upon nature when i was satisfied that the girl had been in the woods i was determined to find out where she vanished and went there again prospecting around i picked up at the foot of one of the biggest trees this yer old memorandumbook with grasses and herbs stuck in it i remembered that id heard old wynn say that low like the dd digger that he was collected these herbs only he pretended it was for science i reckoned the book was his and that he mightnt be far away i lay low and waited bimeby i saw a lizard running down the root when he got sight of me he stopped  dn the lizard whats that got to do with where she is now  everything that lizard had a piece of sugar in his mouth where did it come from i made him drop it and calculated hed go back for more he did he scooted up that tree and slipped in under some hanging strips of bark i shoved em aside and found an opening to the hollow where they do their housekeeping  but you didnt see her thereand how do you know she is there now  i determined to make it sure when she left today i started an hour ahead of her and hid myself at the edge of the woods an hour after the coach arrived at indian spring she came there in a brown duster and was joined by him id have followed them but the dd hound has the ears of a squirrel and though i was five hundred yards from him he was on his guard  guard be blessed wasnt you armed why didnt you go for him said dunn furiously  i reckoned id leave that for you said brace coolly if hed killed me and if hed even covered me with his rifle hed be sure to let daylight through me at double the distance i shouldnt have been any better off nor you either if id killed him it would have been your duty as sheriff to put me in jail and i reckon it wouldnt have broken your heart jim dunn to have got rid of two rivals instead of one hullo where are you going  going said dunn hoarsely going to the carquinez woods by god to kill him before her ill risk it if you darent let me succeed and you can hang me and take the girl yourself  sit down sit down dont be a fool jim dunn you wouldnt keep the saddle a hundred yards did i say i wouldnt help you no if youre willing well run the risk together but it must be in my way hear me ill drive you down there in a buggy before daylight and well surprise them in the cabin or as they leave the wood but you must come as if to arrest him for some offensesay as an escaped digger from the reservation a dangerous tramp a destroyer of public property in the forests a suspected road agent or anything to give you the right to hunt him the exposure of him and nellie dont you see must be accidental if he resists kill him on the spot and nobodyll blame you if he goes peaceably with you and you once get him in excelsior jail when the story gets out that hes taken the belle of excelsior for his squaw if youd the angels for your posse you couldnt keep the boys from hanging him to the first tree whats that  he walked to the window and looked out cautiously  if it was the old man coming back and listening he said after a pause it cant be helped hell hear it soon enough if he dont suspect something already  look yer brace broke in dunn hoarsely dd if i understand you or you me that dog low has got to answer to me not to the law ill take my risk of killing him on sight and on the square i dont reckon to handicap myself with a warrant and i am not going to draw him out with a lie you hear me thats me all the time  then you calkilate to go down thar said brace contemptuously yell out for him and nellie and let him line you on a rest from the first tree as if you were a grizzly  there was a pause whats that you were saying just now about a bearskin he sold asked dunn slowly as if reflecting  he exchanged a bearskin replied brace with a single hole right over the heart hes a dead shot i tell you  dn his shooting said dunn im not thinking of that how long ago did he bring in that bearskin  about two weeks i reckon why  nothing look yer brace you mean wellthars my hand ill go down with you there but not as the sheriff im going there as jim dunn and you can come along as a white man to see things fixed on the square come  brace hesitated youll think better of my plan before you get there but ive said id stand by you and i will come then theres no time to lose  they passed out into the darkness together  what are you waiting for said dunn impatiently as brace who was supporting him by the arm suddenly halted at the corner of the house  some one was listeningdid you not see him was it the old man asked brace hurriedly  blast the old man it was only one of them mexican packers chockfull of whiskey and trying to hold up the house what are you thinking of we shall be late  in spite of his weakness the wounded man hurriedly urged brace forward until they reached the latters lodgings to his surprise the horse and buggy were already before the door  then you reckoned to go any way said dunn with a searching look at his companion  i calkilated somebody would go returned brace evasively patting the impatient buckskin but come in and take a drink before we leave  dunn started out of a momentary abstraction put his hand on his hip and mechanically entered the house they had scarcely raised the glasses to their lips when a sudden rattle of wheels was heard in the street brace set down his glass and ran to the window  its the mare bolted he said with an oath weve kept her too long standing follow me and he dashed down the staircase into the street dunn followed with difficulty when he reached the door he was confronted by his breathless companion shes gone off on a run and ill swear there was a man in the buggy he stopped and examined the halterstrap still fastened to the fence cut by god  dunn turned pale with passion whos got another horse and buggy he demanded  the new blacksmith in main street but we wont get it by borrowing said brace  how then asked dunn savagely  seize it as the sheriff of yuba and his deputy pursuing a confederate of the injin lowthe horse thief   chapter viii  the brief hour of darkness that preceded the dawn was that night intensified by a dense smoke which after blotting out horizon and sky dropped a thick veil on the highroad and the silent streets of indian spring as the buggy containing sheriff dunn and brace dashed through the obscurity brace suddenly turned to his companion  some one ahead  the two men bent forward over the dashboard above the steady plunging of their own horsehoofs they could hear the quicker irregular beat of other hoofs in the darkness before them  its that horse thief said dunn in a savage whisper bear to the right and hand me the whip  a dozen cuts of the cruel lash and their maddened horse bounding at each stroke broke into a wild canter the frail vehicle swayed from side to side at each spring of the elastic shafts steadying himself by one hand on the low rail dunn drew his revolver with the other sing out to him to pull up or well fire my voice is clean gone he added in a husky whisper  they were so near that they could distinguish the bulk of a vehicle careering from side to side in the blackness ahead dunn deliberately raised his weapon sing out he repeated impatiently but brace who was still keeping in the shadow suddenly grasped his companions arm  hush its not buckskin he whispered hurriedly  are you sure  dont you see were gaining on him replied the other contemptuously dunn grasped his companions hand and pressed it silently even in that supreme moment this horsemans tribute to the fugitive buckskin forestalled all baser considerations of pursuit and capture  in twenty seconds they were abreast of the stranger crowding his horse and buggy nearly into the ditch brace keenly watchful dunn suppressed and pale in half a minute they were leading him a length and when their horse again settled down to his steady work the stranger was already lost in the circling dust that followed them but the victors seemed disappointed the obscurity had completely hidden all but the vague outlines of the mysterious driver  hes not our game any way whispered dunn drive on  but if it was some friend of his suggested brace uneasily what would you do  what i said id do responded dunn savagely i dont want five minutes to do it in either well be half an hour ahead of that dd fool whoever he is look here all youve got to do is to put me in the trail to that cabin stand back of me out of gunshot alone if you like as my deputy or with any number you can pick up as my posse if he gets by me as nellies lover you may shoot him or take him as a horse thief if you like  then you wont shoot him on sight  not till ive had a word with him  but  ive chirped said the sheriff gravely drive on  for a few moments only the plunging hoofs and rattling wheels were heard a dull lurid glow began to define the horizon they were silent until an abatement of the smoke the vanishing of the gloomy horizon line and a certain impenetrability in the darkness ahead showed them they were nearing the carquinez woods but they were surprised on entering them to find the dim aisles alight with a faint mystic aurora the tops of the towering spires above them had caught the gleam of the distant forest fires and reflected it as from a gilded dome  it would be hot work if the carquinez woods should conclude to take a hand in this yer little game thats going on over on the divide yonder said brace securing his horse and glancing at the spires overhead i reckon id rather take a back seat at injin spring when the show commences  dunn did not reply but buttoning his coat placed one hand on his companions shoulder and sullenly bade him lead the way advancing slowly and with difficulty the desperate man might have been taken for a peaceful invalid returning from an early morning stroll his right hand was buried thoughtfully in the sidepocket of his coat only brace knew that it rested on the handle of his pistol  from time to time the latter stopped and consulted the faint trail with a minuteness that showed recent careful study suddenly he paused i made a blaze hereabouts to show where to leave the trail there it is he added pointing to a slight notch cut in the trunk of an adjoining tree  but weve just passed one said dunn if thats what you are looking after a hundred yards back  brace uttered an oath and ran back in the direction signified by his companion presently he returned with a smile of triumph  theyve suspected something its a clever trick but it wont hold water that blaze which was done to muddle you was cut with an axe this which i made was done with a bowieknife its the real one were not far off now come on  they proceeded cautiously at right angles with the blazed tree for ten minutes more the heat was oppressive drops of perspiration rolled from the forehead of the sheriff and at times when he attempted to steady his uncertain limbs his hands shrank from the heated blistering bark he touched with ungloved palms  here we are said brace pausing at last do you see that biggest tree with the root stretching out halfway across to the opposite one  no its further to the right and abreast of the dead brush interrupted dunn quickly with a sudden revelation that this was the spot where he had found the dead bear in the night teresa escaped  thats so responded brace in astonishment  and the opening is on the other side opposite the dead brush said dunn  then you know it said brace suspiciously  i reckon responded dunn grimly thats enough fall back  to the surprise of his companion he lifted his head erect and with a strong firm step walked directly to the tree reaching it he planted himself squarely before the opening  halloo he said  there was no reply a squirrel scampered away close to his feet brace far in the distance after an ineffectual attempt to distinguish his companion through the intervening trunks took off his coat leaned against a tree and lit a cigar  come out of that cabin continued dunn in a clear resonant voice come out before i drag you out  all right captain scott dont shoot and ill come down said a voice as clear and as high as his own the hanging strips of bark were dashed aside and a woman leaped lightly to the ground  dunn staggered back teresa by the eternal  it was teresa the old teresa teresa a hundred times more vicious reckless hysterical extravagant and outrageous than beforeteresa staring with tooth and eye sunburnt and embrowned her hair hanging down her shoulders and her shawl drawn tightly around her neck  teresa it is the same old gal here we are again return of the favorite in her original character for two weeks only houp là tshk and catching her yellow skirt with her fingers she pirouetted before the astounded man and ended in a pose recovering himself with an effort dunn dashed forward and seized her by the wrist  answer me woman is that lows cabin  it is  who occupies it besides  i do  and who else  well drawled teresa slowly with an extravagant affectation of modesty nobody else but us i reckon twos company you know and threes none  stop will you swear that there isnt a young girl hishis sweetheartconcealed there with you  the fire in teresas eye was genuine as she answered steadily well it aint my style to put up with that sort of thing at least it wasnt over at yolo and you know it jim dunn or i wouldnt be here  yes yes said dunn hurriedly but im a dd fool or worse the fool of a fool tell me teresa is this man low your lover  teresa lowered her eyes as if in maidenly confusion  well if id known that you had any feeling of your own about itif youd spoken sooner  answer me you devil  he is  and he has been with you hereyesterdaytonight  he has  enough he laughed a weak foolish laugh and turning pale suddenly lapsed against a tree he would have fallen but with a quick instinct teresa sprang to his side and supported him gently to a root the action over they both looked astounded  i reckon that wasnt much like either you or me said dunn slowly was it but if youd let me drop then youd have stretched out the biggest fool in the sierras he paused and looked at her curiously whats come over you blessed if i seem to know you now  she was very pale again and quiet that was all  teresa dn it look here when i was laid up yonder in excelsior i said i wanted to get well for only two things one was to hunt you down the other to marry nellie wynn when i came here i thought that last thing could never be i came here expecting to find her here with low and kill himperhaps kill her too i never even thought of you not once you might have risen up before mebetween me and himand id have passed you by and now that i find its all a mistake and it was you not her i was looking for why  why she interrupted bitterly youll just take me of course to save your time and earn your salary im ready  but im not just yet he said faintly help me up she mechanically assisted him to his feet  now stand where you are he added and dont move beyond this tree till i return  he straightened himself with an effort clenched his fists until the nails were nearly buried in his palms and strode with a firm steady step in the direction he had come in a few moments he returned and stood before her  ive sent away my deputythe man who brought me here the fool who thought you were nellie he knows now he made a mistake but who it was he mistook for nellie he does not know nor shall ever know nor shall any living being know other than myself and when i leave the wood today i shall know it no longer you are safe here as far as i am concerned but i cannot screen you from others prying let low take you away from here as soon as he can  let him take me away ah yes for what  to save you said dunn look here teresa without knowing it you lifted me out of hell just now and because of the wrong i might have done herfor her sake i spare you and shirk my duty  for her sake gasped the womanfor her sake oh yes go on  well said dunn gloomily i reckon perhaps youd as lieve left me in hell for all the love you bear me and maybe youve grudge enough agin me still to wish id found her and him together  you think so she said turning her head away  there dn it i didnt mean to make you cry maybe you wouldnt then only tell that fellow to take you out of this and not run away the next time he sees a man coming  he didnt run said teresa with flashing eyes iii sent him away she stammered then suddenly turning with fury upon him she broke out run run from you ha ha you said just now id a grudge against you well listen jim dunn id only to bring you in range of that young mans rifle and youd have dropped in your tracks like  like that bar the other night said dunn with a short laugh so that was your little game he checked his laugh suddenlya cloud passed over his face look here teresa he said with an assumption of carelessness that was as transparent as it was utterly incompatible with his frank open selfishness what became of that bar the skineh that was worth something  yes said teresa quietly low exchanged it and got a ring for me from that trader isaacs it was worth more you bet and the ring didnt fit either  yes interrupted dunn with an almost childish eagerness  and i made him take it back and get the value in money i hear that isaacs sold it again and made another profit but thats like those traders the disingenuous candor of teresas manner was in exquisite contrast to dunn he rose and grasped her hand so heartily she was forced to turn her eyes away  goodby he said  you look tired she murmured with a sudden gentleness that surprised him let me go with you a part of the way  it isnt safe for you just now he said thinking of the possible consequences of the alarm brace had raised  not the way you came she replied but one known only to myself  he hesitated only a moment all right then he said finally let us go at once its suffocating here and i seem to feel this dead bark crinkle under my feet  she cast a rapid glance around her and then seemed to sound with her eyes the faroff depths of the aisles beginning to grow pale with the advancing day but still holding a strange quiver of heat in the air when she had finished her half abstracted scrutiny of the distance she cast one backward glance at her own cabin and stopped  will you wait a moment for me she asked gently  yesbutno tricks teresa it isnt worth the time  she looked him squarely in the eyes without a word  enough he said go  she was absent for some moments he was beginning to become uneasy when she made her appearance again clad in her old faded black dress her face was very pale and her eyes were swollen but she placed his hand on her shoulder and bidding him not to fear to lean upon her for she was quite strong led the way  you look more like yourself now and yetblast it allyou dont either said dunn looking down upon her youve changed in some way what is it is it on account of that injin couldnt you have found a white man in his place  i reckon hes neither worse nor better for that she replied bitterly and perhaps he wasnt as particular in his taste as a white man might have been but she added with a sudden spasm of her old rage its a lie hes not an indian no more than i am not unless being born of a mother who scarcely knew him of a father who never even saw him and being brought up among white men and wild beasts less cruel than they were could make him one  dunn looked at her in surprise not unmixed with admiration if nellie he thought could but love me like that but he only said  for all that hes an injin why look at his name it aint low its leau dormante sleeping water an injin name  and what does that prove returned teresa only that indians clap a nickname on any stranger white or red who may camp with them why even his own father a white man the wretch who begot him and abandoned himhe had an indian nameloup noir  what name did you say  le loup noir the black wolf i suppose youd call him an indian too eh whats the matter were walking too fast stop a moment and rest therethere lean on me  she was none too soon for after holding him upright a moment his limbs failed and stooping gently she was obliged to support him half reclining against a tree  its the heat he said give me some whiskey from my flask never mind the water he added faintly with a forced laugh after he had taken a draught at the strong spirit tell me more about the other waterthe sleeping water you know how do you know all this about him and hisfather  partly from him and partly from curson who wrote to me about him she answered with some hesitation  but dunn did not seem to notice this incongruity of correspondence with a former lover and he told you  yes and i saw the name on an old memorandumbook he has which he says belonged to his father its full of old accounts of some trading post on the frontier its been missing for a day or two but it will turn up but i can swear i saw it  dunn attempted to rise to his feet put your hand in my pocket he said in a hurried whisper no therebring out a book there i havent looked at it yet is that it he added handing her the book brace had given him a few hours before  yes said teresa in surprise where did you find it  never mind now let me see it quick open it for my sight is failing therethank youthats all  take more whiskey said teresa with a strange anxiety creeping over her you are faint again  wait listen teresalowerput your ear lower listen i came near killing that chap low today wouldnt it have been ridiculous  he tried to smile but his head fell back he had fainted   chapter ix  for the first time in her life teresa lost her presence of mind in an emergency she could only sit staring at the helpless man scarcely conscious of his condition her mind filled with a sudden prophetic intuition of the significance of his last words in the light of that new revelation she looked into his pale haggard face for some resemblance to low but in vain yet her swift feminine instinct met the objection its the mothers blood that would show she murmured not this mans  recovering herself she began to chafe his hands and temples and moistened his lips with the spirit when his respiration returned with a faint color to his cheeks she pressed his hand eagerly and leaned over him  are you sure she asked  of what he whispered faintly  that low is really your son  who said so he asked opening his round eyes upon her  you did yourself a moment ago she said quickly dont you remember  did i  you did is it so  he smiled faintly i reckon  she held her breath in expectation but only the ludicrousness of the discovery seemed paramount to his weakened faculties isnt it just about the ridiculousest thing all round he said with a feeble chuckle first you nearly kill me before you know i am lows father then im just spoilin to kill him before i know hes my son then that godforsaken fool jack brace mistakes you for nellie and nellie for you aint it just the biggest thing for the boys to get hold of but we must keep it dark until after i marry nellie dont you see then well have a good time all round and ill stand the drinks think of it teresha you donno me i dono you nobody knowsh anybody elsh i try kill lo lo wants kill nellie no thath no ribut the potent liquor overtaking his exhausted senses thickened impeded and at last stopped his speech his head slipped to her shoulder and he became once more unconscious  teresa breathed again in that brief moment she had abandoned herself to a wild inspiration of hope which she could scarcely define not that it was entirely a wild inspiration she tried to reason calmly what if she revealed the truth to him what if she told the wretched man before her that she had deceived him that she had overheard his conversation with brace that she had stolen braces horse to bring low warning that failing to find low in his accustomed haunts or at the campfire she had left a note for him pinned to the herbarium imploring him to fly with his companion from the danger that was coming and that remaining on watch she had seen them bothbrace and dunnapproaching and had prepared to meet them at the cabin would this miserable and maddened man understand her selfabnegation would he forgive low and nellieshe did not ask for herself or would the revelation turn his brain if it did not kill him outright she looked at the sunken orbits of his eyes and hectic on his cheek and shuddered  why was this added to the agony she already suffered she had been willing to stand between them with her life her liberty and eventhe hot blood dyed her cheek at the thoughtwith the added shame of being thought the castoff mistress of that mans son yet all this she had taken upon herself in expiation of somethingshe knew not clearly what no for nothingonly for him and yet this very situation offered her that gleam of hope which had thrilled her a hope so wild in its improbability so degrading in its possibility that at first she knew not whether despair was not preferable to its shame and yet was it unreasonable she was no longer passionate she would be calm and think it out fairly  she would go to low at once she would find him somewhereand even if with that girl what matteredand she would tell him all when he knew that the life and death of his father lay in the scale would he let his brief foolish passion for nellie stand in the way even if he were not influenced by filial affection or mere compassion would his pride let him stoop to a rivalry with the man who had deserted his youth could he take dunns promised bride who must have coquetted with him to have brought him to this miserable plight was this like the calm proud young god she knew yet she had an uneasy instinct that calm proud young gods and goddesses did things like this and felt the weakness of her reasoning flush her own conscious cheek  teresa  she started dunn was awake and was gazing at her curiously  i was reckoning it was the only square thing for low to stop this promiscuous picnicking here and marry you out and out  marry me said teresa in a voice that with all her efforts she could not make cynical  yes he repeated after ive married nellie tote you down to san angeles and there take my name like a man and give it to you nobodyll ask after teresa sureyou bet your life and if they do and he cant stop their jaw just you call on the old man its mighty queer aint it teresa to think of you being my daughterinlaw  it seemed here as if he was about to lapse again into unconsciousness over the purely ludicrous aspect of the subject but he haply recovered his seriousness hell have as much money from me as he wants to go into business with whats his line of business teresa asked this prospective fatherinlaw in a large liberal way  he is a botanist said teresa with a sudden childish animation that seemed to keep up the grim humor of the paternal suggestion and oh he is too poor to buy books i sent for one or two for him myself the other dayshe hesitatedit was all the money i had but it wasnt enough for him to go on with his studies  dunn looked at her sparkling eyes and glowing cheeks and became thoughtful curson must have been a dd fool he said finally  teresa remained silent she was beginning to be impatient and uneasy fearing some mischance that might delay her dreaded yet longedfor meeting with low yet she could not leave this sick and exhausted man his father now bound to her by more than mere humanity  couldnt you manage she said gently to lean on me a few steps further until i could bring you to a cooler spot and nearer assistance  he nodded she lifted him almost like a child to his feet a spasm of pain passed over his face how far is it he asked  not more than ten minutes she replied  i can make a spurt for that time he said coolly and began to walk slowly but steadily on only his face which was white and set and the convulsive grip of his hand on her arm betrayed the effort at the end of ten minutes she stopped they stood before the splintered lightningscarred shaft in the opening of the woods where low had built her first campfire she carefully picked up the herbarium but her quick eye had already detected in the distance before she had allowed dunn to enter the opening with her that her note was gone low had been there before them he had been warned as his absence from the cabin showed he would not return there they were free from interruptionbut where had he gone  the sick man drew a long breath of relief as she seated him in the clovergrown hollow where she had slept the second night of her stay its cooler than those cursed woods he said i suppose its because its a little like a grave what are you going to do now he added as she brought a cup of water and placed it at his side  i am going to leave you here for a little while she said cheerfully but with a pale face and nervous hands im going to leave you while i seek low  the sick man raised his head im good for a spurt teresa like that ive just got through but i dont think im up to a family party couldnt you issue cards later on  you dont understand she said im going to get low to send some one of your friends to you here i dont think hell begrudge leaving her a moment for that she added to herself bitterly  whats that youre saying he queried with the nervous quickness of an invalid  nothingbut that im going now she turned her face aside to hide her moistened eyes wish me good luck wont you she asked half sadly half pettishly  come here  she came and bent over him he suddenly raised his hands and drawing her face down to his own kissed her forehead  give that to him he whispered from me  she turned and fled happily for her sentiment not hearing the feeble laugh that followed as dunn in sheer imbecility again referred to the extravagant ludicrousness of the situation it is about the biggest thing in the way of a sell all round he repeated lying on his back confidentially to the speck of smokeobscured sky above him he pictured himself repeating it not to nellieher severe propriety might at last overlook the fact but would not tolerate the jokebut to her father it would be just one of those characteristic californian jokes father wynn would admire  to his exhaustion fever presently succeeded and he began to grow restless the heat too seemed to invade his retreat and from time to time the little patch of blue sky was totally obscured by clouds of smoke he amused himself with watching a lizard who was investigating a folded piece of paper whose elasticity gave the little creature lively apprehensions of its vitality at last he could stand the stillness of his retreat and his supine position no longer and rolled himself out of the bed of leaves that teresa had so carefully prepared for him he rose to his feet stiff and sore and supporting himself by the nearest tree moved a few steps from the dead ashes of the campfire the movement frightened the lizard who abandoned the paper and fled with a satirical recollection of brace and his ridiculous discovery through the medium of this animal he stooped and picked up the paper like as not he said to himself with grim irony these yer lizards are in the discovery business praps this may lead to another mystery and he began to unfold the paper with a smile but the smile ceased as his eye suddenly caught his own name  a dozen lines were written in pencil on what seemed to be a blank leaf originally torn from some book he trembled so that he was obliged to sit down to read these words  when you get this keep away from the woods dunn and another man are in deadly pursuit of you and your companion i overheard their plan to surprise you in our cabin dont go there and i will delay them and put them off the scent dont mind me god bless you and if you never see me again think sometimes of                                teresa  his trembling ceased he did not start but rose in an abstracted way and made a few deliberate steps in the direction teresa had gone even then he was so confused that he was obliged to refer to the paper again but with so little effect that he could only repeat the last words think sometimes of teresa he was conscious that this was not all he had a full conviction of being deceived and knew that he held the proof in his hand but he could not formulate it beyond that sentence teresayes he would think of her she would think of him she would explain it and here she was returning  in that brief interval her face and manner had again changed she was pale and quite breathless she cast a swift glance at dunn and the paper he mechanically held out walked up to him and tore it from his hand  well she said hoarsely what are you going to do about it  he attempted to speak but his voice failed him even then he was conscious that if he had spoken he would have only repeated think sometimes of teresa he looked longingly but helplessly at the spot where she had thrown the paper as if it had contained his unuttered words  yes she went on to herself as if he was a mute indifferent spectatoryes theyre gone that ends it all the games played out well suddenly turning upon him now you know it all your nellie was here with him and is with him now do you hear make the most of it youve lost thembut here i am  yes he said eagerlyyes teresa  she stopped stared at him then taking him by the hand led him like a child back to his couch well she said in halfsavage explanation i told you the truth when i said the girl wasnt at the cabin last night and that i didnt know her what are you glowerin at no i havent lied to you i swear to god except in one thing do you know what that was to save him i took upon me a shame i dont deserve i let you think i was his mistress you think so now dont you well before god todayand he may take me when he likesim no more to him than a sister i reckon your nellie cant say as much  she turned away and with the quick impatient stride of some caged animal made the narrow circuit of the opening stopping a moment mechanically before the sick man and again without looking at him continuing her monotonous round the heat had become excessive but she held her shawl with both hands drawn tightly over her shoulders suddenly a woodduck darted out of the covert blindly into the opening struck against the blasted trunk fell half stunned near her feet and then recovering fluttered away she had scarcely completed another circuit before the irruption was followed by a whirring bevy of quail a flight of jays and a sudden tumult of wings swept through the wood like a tornado she turned inquiringly to dunn who had risen to his feet but the next moment she caught convulsively at his wrist a wolf had just dashed through the underbrush not a dozen yards away and on either side of them they could hear the scamper and rustle of hurrying feet like the outburst of a summer shower a cold wind arose from the opposite direction as if to contest this wild exodus but it was followed by a blast of sickening heat teresa sank at dunns feet in an agony of terror  dont let them touch me she gasped keep them off tell me for gods sake what has happened  he laid his hand firmly on her arm and lifted her in his turn to her feet like a child in that supreme moment of physical danger his strength reason and manhood returned in their plenitude of power he pointed coolly to the trail she had quitted and said  the carquinez woods are on fire   chapter x  the nest of the tuneful burnhams although in the suburbs of indian spring was not in ordinary weather and seasons hidden from the longing eyes of the youth of that settlement that night however it was veiled in the smoke that encompassed the great highway leading to excelsior it is presumed that the burnham brood had long since folded their wings for there was no sign of life nor movement in the house as a rapidly driven horse and buggy pulled up before it fortunately the paternal burnham was an early bird in the habit of picking up the first stirring mining worm and a resounding knock brought him half dressed to the street door he was startled at seeing father wynn before him a trifle flushed and abstracted  ah ha up betimes i see and ready no sluggards hereha ha he said heartily slamming the door behind him and by a series of pokes in the ribs genially backing his host into his own sittingroom im up too and am here to see nellie shes here ehof course he added darting a quick look at burnham  but mr burnham was one of those large liberal western husbands who classified his household under the general title of woman folk for the integers of which he was not responsible he hesitated and then propounded over the balusters to the upper story the direct queryyou dont happen to have nellie wynn up there do ye  there was an interval of inquiry proceeding from half a dozen reluctant throats more or less cottony and muffled in those various degrees of grievance and mental distress which indicate too early roused young womanhood the eventual reply seemed to be affirmative albeit accompanied with a suppressed giggle as if the young lady had just been discovered as an answer to an amusing conundrum  all right said wynn with an apparent accession of boisterous geniality tell her i must see her and ive only got a few minutes to spare tell her to slip on anything and come down theres no one here but myself and ive shut the front door on brother burnham ha ha and suiting the action to the word he actually bundled the admiring brother burnham out on his own doorstep there was a light pattering on the staircase and nellie wynn pink with sleep very tall very slim hastily draped in a white counterpane with a blue border and a general classic suggestion slipped into the parlor at the same moment the father shut the door behind her placed one hand on the knob and with the other seized her wrist  where were you yesterday he asked  nellie looked at him shrugged her shoulders and said here  you were in the carquinez woods with low dorman you went there in disguise youve met him there before he is your clandestine lover you have taken pledges of affection from him you have  stop she said  he stopped  did he tell you this she asked with an expression of disdain  no i overheard it dunn and brace were at the house waiting for you when the coach did not bring you i went to the office to inquire as i left our door i thought i saw somebody listening at the parlor windows it was only a drunken mexican muleteer leaning against the house but if he heard nothing i did nellie i heard brace tell dunn that he had tracked you in your disguise to the woodsdo you hear that when you pretended to be here with the girls you were with lowalone that you wear a ring that low got of a trader here that there was a cabin in the woods  stop she repeated  wynn again paused  and what did you do she asked  i heard they were starting down there to surprise you and him together and i harnessed up and got ahead of them in my buggy  and found me here she said looking full into his eyes  he understood her and returned the look he recognized the full importance of the culminating fact conveyed in her words and was obliged to content himself with its logical and worldly significance it was too late now to take her to task for mere filial disobedience they must become allies  yes he said hurriedly but if you value your reputation if you wish to silence both these men answer me fully  go on she said  did you go to the cabin in the woods yesterday  no  did you ever go there with low  no i do not know even where it is  wynn felt that she was telling the truth nellie knew it but as she would have been equally satisfied with an equally efficacious falsehood her face remained unchanged  and when did he leave you  at nine oclock here he went to the hotel  he saved his life then for dunn is on his way to the woods to kill him  the jeopardy of her lover did not seem to affect the young girl with alarm although her eyes betrayed some interest  then dunn has gone to the woods she said thoughtfully  he has replied wynn  is that all she asked  i want to know what you are going to do  i was going back to bed  this is no time for trifling girl  i should think not she said with a yawn its too early or too late  wynn grasped her wrist more tightly hear me put whatever face you like on this affair you are compromisedand compromised with a man you cant marry  i dont know that i ever wanted to marry low if you mean him she said quietly  and dunn wouldnt marry you now  im not so sure of that either  nellie said wynn excitedly do you want to drive me mad have you nothing to saynothing to suggest  oh you want me to help you do you why didnt you say that first well go and bring dunn here  are you mad the man has gone already in pursuit of your lover believing you with him  then he will the more readily come and talk with me without him will you take the invitationyes or no  yes but  enough on your way there you will stop at the hotel and give low a letter from me  nellie  you shall read it of course she said scornfully for it will be your text for the conversation you will have with him will you please take your hand from the lock and open the door  wynn mechanically opened the door the young girl flew upstairs in a very few moments she returned with two notes one contained a few lines of formal invitation to dunn the other read as follows  dear mr dorman my father will tell you how deeply i regret that our recent botanical excursions in the carquinez woods have been a source of serious misapprehension to those who had a claim to my consideration and that i shall be obliged to discontinue them for the future at the same time he wishes me to express my gratitude for your valuable instruction and assistance in that pleasing study even though approaching events may compel me to relinquish it for other duties may i beg you to accept the enclosed ring as a slight recognition of my obligations to you  your grateful pupil  nellie wynn  when he had finished reading the letter she handed him a ring which he took mechanically he raised his eyes to hers with perfectly genuine admiration youre a good girl nellie he said and in a moment of parental forgetfulness unconsciously advanced his lips towards her cheek but she drew back in time to recall him to a sense of that human weakness  i suppose ill have time for a nap yet she said as a gentle hint to her embarrassed parent he nodded and turned towards the door  if i were you she continued repressing a yawn id manage to be seen on good terms with low at the hotel so perhaps you need not give the letter to him until the last thing goodby  the sittingroom door opened and closed behind her as she slipped upstairs and her father without the formality of leavetaking quietly let himselt out by the front door  when he drove into the highroad again however an overlooked possibility threatened for a moment to indefinitely postpone his amiable intentions regarding low the hotel was at the farther end of the settlement toward the carquinez woods and as wynn had nearly reached it he was recalled to himself by the sounds of hoofs and wheels rapidly approaching from the direction of the excelsior turnpike wynn made no doubt it was the sheriff and brace to avoid recognition at that moment he whipped up his horse intending to keep the lead until he could turn into the first crossroad but the coming travelers had the fleetest horse and finding it impossible to distance them he drove close to the ditch pulling up suddenly as the strange vehicle was abreast of him and forcing them to pass him at full speed with the result already chronicled when they had vanished in the darkness mr wynn with a heart overflowing with christian thankfulness and universal benevolence wheeled round and drove back to the hotel he had already passed to pull up at the veranda with a stentorian shout to thump loudly at the deserted bar to hilariously beat the panels of the landlords door and commit a jocose assault and battery upon that halfdressed and halfawakened man was eminently characteristic of wynn and part of his amiable plans that morning  something to wash this wood smoke from my throat brother carter and about as much again to prop open your eyes he said dragging carter before the bar and glasses round for as many of the boys as are up and stirring after a hardworking christians rest how goes the honest publicans trade and who have we here  thars judge robinson and two lawyers from sacramento dick curson over from yolo said carter and that ar young injin yarb doctor from the carquinez woods i reckon hes jist upi noticed a light under his door as i passed  hes my man for a friendly chat before breakfast said wynn you neednt come up ill find the way i dont want a light i reckon my eyes aint as bright nor as young as his but theyll see almost as far in the darkhehe and nodding to brother carter he strode along the passage and with no other introduction than a playful and preliminary boo burst into one of the rooms low who by the light of a single candle was bending over the plates of a large quarto merely raised his eyes and looked at the intruder the young mans natural imperturbability always exasperating to wynn seemed accented that morning by contrast with his own overacted animation  ah hawasting the midnight oil instead of imbibing the morning dews said father wynn archly illustrating his metaphor with a movement of his hand to his lips what have we here  an anonymous gift replied low simply recognizing the father of nellie by rising from his chair its a volume ive longed to possess but never could afford to buy i cannot imagine who sent it to me  wynn was for a moment startled by the thought that this recipient of valuable gifts might have influential friends but a glance at the bare room which looked like a camp and the strange unconventional garb of its occupant restored his former convictions there might be a promise of intelligence but scarcely of prosperity in the figure before him  ah we must not forget that we are watched over in the night season he said laying his hand on lows shoulder with an illustration of celestial guardianship that would have been impious but for its palpable grotesqueness no sir we know not what a day may bring forth  unfortunately lows practical mind did not go beyond a mere human interpretation it was enough however to put a new light in his eye and a faint color in his cheek  could it have been miss nellie he asked with halfboyish hesitation  mr wynn was too much of a christian not to bow before what appeared to him the purely providential interposition of this suggestion seizing it and low at the same moment he playfully forced him down again in his chair  ah you rascal he said with infinite archness thats your game is it you want to trap poor father wynn you want to make him say no you want to tempt him to commit himself no sirnever sirno no  firmly convinced that the present was nellies and that her father only goodhumoredly guessed it the young mans simple truthful nature was embarrassed he longed to express his gratitude but feared to betray the young girls trust the reverend mr wynn speedily relieved his mind  no he continued bestriding a chair and familiarly confronting low over its back no sirno and you want me to say no dont you regarding the little walks of nellie and a certain young man in the carquinez woodsha ha youd like me to say that i knew nothing of the botanizings and the herb collectings and the picnickings thereheheyou sly dog perhaps youd like to tempt father wynn further and make him swear he knows nothing of his daughter disguising herself in a duster and meeting another young manisnt it another young manall alone eh perhaps you want poor old father wynn to say no no sir nothing of the kind ever occurred ah you young rascal  slightly troubled in spite of wynns hearty manner low with his usual directness however said i do not want any one to deny that i have seen miss nellie  certainly certainly said wynn abandoning his method considerably disconcerted by lows simplicity and a certain natural reserve that shook off his familiarity certainly its a noble thing to be able to put your hand on your heart and say to the world come on all of you observe me i have nothing to conceal i walk with miss wynn in the woods as her instructorher teacher in fact we cull a flower here and there we pluck an herb fresh from the hand of the creator we look so to speak from nature to natures god yes my young friend we should be the first to repel the foul calumny that could misinterpret our most innocent actions  calumny repeated low starting to his feet what calumny  my friend my noble young friend i recognize your indignation i know your worth when i said to nellie my only child my perhaps too simple offspringa mere wildflower like yourselfwhen i said to her go my child walk in the woods with this young man hand in hand let him instruct you from the humblest roots for he has trodden in the ways of the almighty gather wisdom from his lips and knowledge from his simple woodmans craft make in fact a collection not only of herbs but of moral axioms and experiencei knew i could trust you and trusting you my young friend i felt i could trust the world perhaps i was weak foolish but i thought only of her welfare i even recall how that to preserve the purity of her garments i bade her don a simple duster that to secure her from the trifling companionship of others i bade her keep her own counsel and seek you at seasons known but to yourselves  but  did nellie  understand you interrupted low hastily  i see you read her simple nature understand me no not at first her maidenly instinctperhaps her duty to anothertook the alarm i remember her words but what will dunn say she asked will he not be jealous  dunn jealous i dont understand said low fixing his eyes on wynn  thats just what i said to nellie jealous i said what dunn your affianced husband jealous of a mere frienda teacher a guide a philosopher it is impossible well sir she was right he is jealous and more than that he has imparted his jealousy to others in other words he has made a scandal  lows eyes flashed where is your daughter now he said sternly  at present in bed suffering from a nervous attack brought on by these unjust suspicions she appreciates your anxiety and knowing that you could not see her told me to give you this he handed low the ring and the letter  the climax had been forced and it must be confessed was by no means the one mr wynn had fully arranged in his own inner consciousness he had intended to take an ostentatious leave of low in the barroom deliver the letter with archness and escape before a possible explosion he consequently backed towards the door for an emergency but he was again at fault that unaffected stoical fortitude in acute suffering which was the one remaining pride and glory of lows race was yet to be revealed to wynns civilized eyes  the young man took the letter and read it without changing a muscle folded the ring in it and dropped it into his haversack then he picked up his blanket threw it over his shoulder took his trusty rifle in his hand and turned toward wynn as if coldly surprised that he was still standing there  are youare yougoing stammered wynn  are you not replied low dryly leaning on his rifle for a moment as if waiting for wynn to precede him the preacher looked at him a moment mumbled something and then shambled feebly and ineffectively down the staircase before low with a painful suggestion to the ordinary observer of being occasionally urged thereto by the moccasin of the young man behind him  on reaching the lower hall however he endeavored to create a diversion in his favor by dashing into the barroom and clapping the occupants on the back with indiscriminate playfulness but here again he seemed to be disappointed to his great discomfiture a large man not only returned his salutation with powerful levity but with equal playfulness seized him in his arms and after an ingenious simulation of depositing him in the horsetrough set him down in affected amazement bletht if i didnt think from the weight of your hand it wath my old friend thacramento bill said curson apologetically with a wink at the bystanders thatth the way bill alwayth uthed to tackle hith friendth till he wath one day bounthed by a prithefighter in frithco whom he had mithtaken for a mithionary as mr cursons reputation was of a quality that made any form of apology from him instantly acceptable the amused spectators made way for him as recognizing low who was just leaving the hotel he turned coolly from them and walked towards him  halloo he said extending his hand youre the man im waiting for did you get a book from the exthpreth offithe latht night  i did why  itth all right ath im rethponthible for it i only wanted to know  did you send it asked low quickly fixing his eyes on his face  well not exactly me but itth not worth making a mythtery of it teretha gave me a commithion to buy it and thend it to you anonymouthly thatth a womanth nonthenth for how could thee get a retheipt for it  then it was her present said low gloomily  of courthe it wathnt mine my boy id have thent you a tharpth rifle in plathe of that muthle loader you carry or thomething thenthible but i thay whatth up you look ath if you had been running all night  low grasped his hand thank you he said hurriedly but its nothing only i must be back to the woods early goodby  but curson retained lows hand in his own powerful grip  ill go with you a bit further he said in fact ive got thomething to thay to you only dont be in thuch a hurry the woodth can wait till you get there quietly compelling low to alter his own characteristic indian stride to keep pace with his he went on i dont mind thaying i rather cottoned to you from the time you acted like a white manno offentheto teretha she thayth you were left when a child lying round jutht ath promithcuouthly ath she wath and if i can do anything towardth putting you on the trail of your people ill do it i know thome of the voyageurth who traded with the cherokeeth and your father wath onewasnt he he glanced at lows utterly abstracted and immobile face i thay you dont theem to take a hand in thith game pardner what th the row ith anything wrong over there and he pointed to the carquinez woods which were just looming out of the morning horizon in the distance  low stopped the last words of his companion seemed to recall him to himself he raised his eyes automatically to the woods and started  there is something wrong over there he said breathlessly look  i thee nothing said curson beginning to doubt lows sanity nothing more than i thaw an hour ago  look again dont you see that smoke rising straight up it isnt blown over from the divide its new smoke the fire is in the woods  i reckon that th so muttered curson shading his eyes with his hand but hullo wait a minute well get hortheth i say he shouted forgetting his lisp in his excitementstop but low had already lowered his head and darted forward like an arrow  in a few moments he had left not only his companion but the last straggling houses of the outskirts far behind him and had struck out in a long swinging trot for the disused cutoff already he fancied he heard the note of clamor in indian spring and thought he distinguished the sound of hurrying hoofs on the great highway but the sunken trail hid it from his view from the column of smoke now plainly visible in the growing morning light he tried to locate the scene of the conflagration it was evidently not a fire advancing regularly from the outer skirt of the wood communicated to it from the divide it was a local outburst near its centre it was not in the direction of his cabin in the tree there was no immediate danger to teresa unless fear drove her beyond the confines of the wood into the hands of those who might recognize her the screaming of jays and ravens above his head quickened his speed as it heralded the rapid advance of the flames and the unexpected apparition of a bounding body flattened and flying over the yellow plain told him that even the secure retreat of the mountain wildcat had been invaded a sudden recollection of teresas uncontrollable terror that first night smote him with remorse and redoubled his efforts alone in the track of these frantic and bewildered beasts to what madness might she not be driven  the sharp crack of a rifle from the highroad turned his course momentarily in that direction the smoke was curling lazily over the heads of a party of men in the road while the huge bulk of a grizzly was disappearing in the distance a battue of the escaping animals had commenced in the bitterness of his heart he caught at the horrible suggestion and resolved to save her from them or die with her there  how fast he ran or the time it took him to reach the woods has never been known their outlines were already hidden when he entered them to a sense less keen a courage less desperate and a purpose less unaltered than lows the wood would have been impenetrable the central fire was still confined to the lofty treetops but the downward rush of wind from time to time drove the smoke into the aisles in blinding and suffocating volumes to simulate the creeping animals and fall to the ground on hands and knees feel his way through the underbrush when the smoke was densest or take advantage of its momentary lifting and without uncertainty mistake or hesitation glide from tree to tree in one undeviating course was possible only to an experienced woodsman to keep his reason and insight so clear as to be able in the midst of this bewildering confusion to shape that course so as to intersect the wild and unknown tract of an inexperienced frightened wanderer belonged to low and to low alone he was making his way against the wind towards the fire he had reasoned that she was either in comparative safety to windward of it or he should meet her being driven towards him by it or find her succumbed and fainting at its feet to do this he must penetrate the burning belt and then pass under the blazing dome he was already upon it he could see the falling fire dropping like rain or blown like gorgeous blossoms of the conflagration across his path the space was lit up brilliantly the vast shafts of dull copper cast no shadow below but there was no sign nor token of any human being for a moment the young man was at fault it was true this hidden heart of the forest bore no undergrowth the cool matted carpet of the aisles seemed to quench the glowing fragments as they fell escape might be difficult but not impossible yet every moment was precious he leaned against a tree and sent his voice like a clarion before him teresa there was no reply he called again a faint cry at his back from the trail he had just traversed made him turn only a few paces behind him blinded and staggering but following like a beaten and wounded animal teresa halted knelt clasped her hands and dumbly held them out before her teresa he cried again and sprang to her side  she caught him by the knees and lifted her face imploringly to his  say that again she cried passionately tell me it was teresa you called and no other you have come back for me you would not let me die here alone  he lifted her tenderly in his arms and cast a rapid glance around him it might have been his fancy but there seemed a dull glow in the direction he had come  you do not speak she said tell me you did not come here to seek her  whom he said quickly  nellie  with a sharp cry he let her slip to the ground all the pentup agony rage and mortification of the last hour broke from him in that inarticulate outburst then catching her hands again he dragged her to his level  hear me he cried disregarding the whirling smoke and the fiery baptism that sprinkled themhear me if you value your life if you value your soul and if you do not want me to cast you to the beasts like jezebel of old nevernever take that accursed name again upon your lips seek herher yes seek her to tie her like a witchs daughter of hell to that blazing tree he stopped forgive me he said in a changed voice im mad and forgetting myself and you come  without noticing the expression of half savage delight that had passed across her face he lifted her in his arms  which way are you going she asked passing her hands vaguely across his breast as if to reassure herself of his identity  to our camp by the scarred tree he replied  not there not there she said hurriedly i was driven from there just now i thought the fire began there until i came here  then it was as he feared obeying the same mysterious law that had launched this fatal fire like a thunderbolt from the burning mountain crest five miles away into the heart of the carquinez woods it had again leaped a mile beyond and was hemming them between two narrowing lines of fire but low was not daunted retracing his steps through the blinding smoke he strode off at right angles to the trail near the point where he had entered the wood it was the spot where he had first lifted nellie in his arms to carry her to the hidden spring if any recollection of it crossed his mind at that moment it was only shown in his redoubled energy he did not glide through the thick underbrush as on that day but seemed to take a savage pleasure in breaking through it with sheer brute force once teresa insisted upon relieving him of the burden of her weight but after a few steps she staggered blindly against him and would fain have recourse once more to his strong arms and so alternately staggering bending crouching or bounding and crashing on but always in one direction they burst through the jealous rampart and came upon the sylvan haunt of the hidden spring the great angle of the half fallen tree acted as a barrier to the wind and drifting smoke and the cool spring sparkled and bubbled in the almost translucent air he laid her down beside the water and bathed her face and hands as he did so his quick eye caught sight of a womans handkerchief lying at the foot of the disrupted root dropping teresas hand he walked towards it and with the toe of his moccasin gave it one vigorous kick into the ooze at the overflow of the spring he turned to teresa but she evidently had not noticed the act  where are you she asked with a smile  something in her movement struck him he came towards her and bending down looked into her face  teresa good godlook at me what has happened  she raised her eyes to his there was a slight film across them the lids were blackened the beautiful lashes gone forever  i see you a little now i think she said with a smile passing her hands vaguely over his face it must have happened when he fainted and i had to drag him through the blazing brush both my hands were full and i could not cover my eyes  drag whom said low quickly  why dunn  dunn he here said low hoarsely  yes didnt you read the note i left on the herbarium didnt you come to the campfire she asked hurriedly clasping his hands tell me quickly  no  then you were not therethen you didnt leave me to die  no i swear it teresa the stoicism that had upheld his own agony breaking down before her strong emotion  thank god she threw her arms around him and hid her aching eyes in his troubled breast  tell me all teresa he whispered in her listening ear dont move stay there and tell me all  with her face buried in his bosom as if speaking to his heart alone she told him part but not all with her eyes filled with tears but a smile on her lips radiant with newfound happiness she told him how she had overheard the plans of dunn and brace how she had stolen their conveyance to warn him in time but here she stopped dreading to say a word that would shatter the hope she was building upon his sudden revulsion of feeling for nellie she could not bring herself to repeat their interviewthat would come later when they were safe and out of danger now not even the secret of his birth must come between them with its distraction to mar their perfect communion she faltered that dunn had fainted from weakness and that she had dragged him out of danger he will never interfere with usi mean she said softly with me again i can promise you that as well as if he had sworn it  let him pass now said low that will come later on he added unconsciously repeating her thought in a tone that made her heart sick but tell me teresa why did you go to excelsior  she buried her head still deeper as if to hide it he felt her broken heart beat against his own he was conscious of a depth of feeling her rival had never awakened in him the possibility of teresa loving him had never occurred to his simple nature he bent his head and kissed her she was frightened and unloosed her clinging arms but he retained her hand and said we will leave this accursed place and you shall go with me as you said you would nor need you ever leave me unless you wish it  she could hear the beating of her own heart through his words she longed to look at the eyes and lips that told her this and read the meaning his voice alone could not entirely convey for the first time she felt the loss of her sight she did not know that it was in this moment of happiness the last blessing vouchsafed to her miserable life  a few moments of silence followed broken only by the distant rumor of the conflagration and the crash of falling boughs it may be an hour yet he whispered before the fire has swept a path for us to the road below we are safe here unless some sudden current should draw the fire down upon us you are not frightened she pressed his hand she was thinking of the pale face of dunn lying in the secure retreat she had purchased for him at such a sacrifice yet the possibility of danger to him now for a moment marred her present happiness and security you think the fire will not go north of where you found me she asked softly  i think not he said but i will reconnoitre stay where you are  they pressed hands and parted he leaped upon the slanting trunk and ascended it rapidly she waited in mute expectation  there was a sudden movement of the root on which she sat a deafening crash and she was thrown forward on her face  the vast bulk of the leaning tree dislodged from its aerial support by the gradual sapping of the spring at its roots or by the crumbling of the bark from the heat had slipped made a half revolution and falling overbore the lesser trees in its path and tore in its resistless momentum a broad opening to the underbrush  with a cry to low teresa staggered to her feet there was an interval of hideous silence but no reply she called again there was a sudden deepening roar the blast of a fiery furnace swept through the opening a thousand luminous points around her burst into fire and in an instant she was lost in a whirlwind of smoke and flame from the onset of its fury to its culmination twenty minutes did not elapse but in that interval a radius of two hundred yards around the hidden spring was swept of life and light and motion  for the rest of that day and part of the night a pall of smoke hung above the scene of desolation it lifted only towards the morning when the moon riding high picked out in black and silver the shrunken and silent columns of those roofless vaults shorn of base and capital it flickered on the still overflowing pool of the hidden spring and shone upon the white face of low who with a rootlet of the fallen tree holding him down like an arm across his breast seemed to be sleeping peacefully in the sleeping water                                       contemporaneous history touched him as briefly but not as gently it is now definitely ascertained said the slumgullion mirror that sheriff dunn met his fate in the carquinez woods in the performance of his duty that fearless man having received information of the concealment of a band of horse thieves in their recesses the desperadoes are presumed to have escaped as the only remains found are those of two wretched tramps one of whom is said to have been a digger who supported himself upon roots and herbs and the other a degraded halfwhite woman it is not unreasonable to suppose that the fire originated through their carelessness although father wynn of the first baptist church in his powerful discourse of last sunday pointed at the warning and lesson of such catastrophes it may not be out of place here to say that the rumors regarding an engagement between the pastors accomplished daughter and the late lamented sheriff are utterly without foundation as it has been an on dit for some time in all wellinformed circles that the indefatigable mr brace of wells fargo  cos express will shortly lead the lady to the hymeneal altar    at the mission of san carmel   prologue  it was noon of the 10th of august 1838 the monotonous coast line between monterey and san diego had set its hard outlines against the steady glare of the californian sky and the metallic glitter of the pacific ocean the weary succession of rounded domelike hills obliterated all sense of distance the rare whaling vessel or still rarer trader drifting past saw no change in these rusty undulations barren of distinguishing peak or headland and bald of wooded crest or timbered ravine the withered ranks of wild oats gave a dull procession of uniform color to the hills unbroken by any relief of shadow in their smooth round curves as far as the eye could reach sea and shore met in one bleak monotony flecked by no passing cloud stirred by no sign of life or motion even sound was absent the angelus rung from the invisible mission tower far inland was driven back again by the steady northwest trades that for half the year had swept the coast line and left it abraded of all umbrage and color  but even this monotony soon gave way to a change and another monotony as uniform and depressed the western horizon slowly contracting before a wall of vapor by four oclock had become a mere cold steely strip of sea into which gradually the northern trend of the coast faded and was lost as the fog stole with soft step southward all distance space character and locality again vanished the hills upon which the sun still shone bore the same monotonous outlines as those just wiped into space last of all before the red sun sank like the descending host it gleamed upon the sails of a trading vessel close in shore it was the last object visible a damp breath breathed upon it a soft hand passed over the slate the sharp pencilling of the picture faded and became a confused gray cloud  the wind and waves too went down in the fog the now invisible and hushed breakers occasionally sent the surf over the sand in a quick whisper with grave intervals of silence but with no continuous murmur as before in a curving bight of the shore the creaking of oars in their rowlocks began to be distinctly heard but the boat itself although apparently only its length from the sands was invisible  steady now way enough the voice came from the sea and was low as if unconsciously affected by the fog silence  the sound of a keel grating the sand was followed by the order stern all from the invisible speaker  shall we beach her asked another vague voice  not yet hail again and all together  ah hoyoioioy  there were four voices but the hail appeared weak and ineffectual like a cry in a dream and seemed hardly to reach beyond the surf before it was suffocated in the creeping cloud a silence followed but no response  its no use to beach her and go ashore until we find the boat said the first voice gravely and well do that if the current has brought her here are you sure youve got the right bearings  as near as a man could off a shore with not a blasted pint to take his bearings by  there was a long silence again broken only by the occasional dip of oars keeping the invisible boathead to the sea  take my word for it lads its the last well see of that boat again or of jack cranch or the captains baby  it does look mighty queer that the painter should slip jack cranch aint the man to tie a granny knot  silence said the invisible leader listen  a hail so faint and uncertain that it might have been the longdeferred faroff echo of their own came from the sea abreast of them  its the captain he hasnt found anything or he couldnt be so far north hark  the hail was repeated again faintly dreamily to the seamens trained ears it seemed to have an intelligent significance for the first voice gravely responded aye aye and then said softly oars  the word was followed by a splash the oars clicked sharply and simultaneously in the rowlocks then more faintly then still fainter and then passed out into the darkness  the silence and shadow both fell together for hours sea and shore were impenetrable yet at times the air was softly moved and troubled the surrounding gloom faintly lightened as with a misty dawn and then was dark again or drowsy faroff cries and confused noises seemed to grow out of the silence and when they had attracted the weary ear sank away as in a mocking dream and showed themselves unreal nebulous gatherings in the fog seemed to indicate stationary objects that even as one gazed moved away the recurring lap and ripple on the shingle sometimes took upon itself the semblance of faint articulate laughter or spoken words but towards morning a certain monotonous grating on the sand that had for many minutes alternately cheated and piqued the ear asserted itself more strongly and a moving vacillating shadow in the gloom became an opaque object on the shore  with the first rays of the morning light the fog lifted as the undraped hills one by one bared their cold bosoms to the sun the long line of coast struggled back to life again everything was unchanged except that a stranded boat lay upon the sands and in its stern sheets a sleeping child   i  the 10th of august 1852 brought little change to the dull monotony of wind fog and treeless coast line only the sea was occasionally flecked with racing sails that outstripped the old slowcreeping trader or was at times streaked and blurred with the trailing smoke of a steamer there were a few strange footprints on those virgin sands and a fresh track that led from the beach over the rounded hills dropped into the bosky recesses of a hidden valley beyond the coast range  it was here that the refectory windows of the mission of san carmel had for years looked upon the reverse of that monotonous picture presented to the sea it was here that the trade winds shorn of their fury and strength in the heated ovenlike air that rose from the valley lost their weary way in the tangled recesses of the wooded slopes and breathed their last at the foot of the stone cross before the mission it was on the crest of those slopes that the fog halted and walled in the sunillumined plain below it was in this plain that limitless fields of grain clothed the flat adobe soil here the mission garden smiled over its hedges of fruitful vines and through the leaves of fig and gnarled pear trees and it was here that father pedro had lived for fifty years found the prospect good and had smiled also  father pedros smile was rare he was not a las casas nor a junipero serra but he had the deep seriousness of all disciples laden with the responsible wording of a gospel not their own and his smile had an ecclesiastical as well as a human significance the pleasantest object in his prospect being the fair and curly head of his boy acolyte and chorister francisco which appeared among the vines and his sweetest pastoral music the high soprano humming of a chant with which the boy accompanied his gardening  suddenly the acolytes chant changed to a cry of terror running rapidly to father pedros side he grasped his sotana and even tried to hide his curls among its folds  st st said the padre disengaging himself with some impatience what new alarm is this is it luzbel hiding among our catalan vines or one of those heathen americanos from monterey speak  neither holy father said the boy the color struggling back into his pale cheeks and an apologetic bashful smile lighting his clear eyes neither but oh such a gross lethargic toad and it almost leaped upon me  a toad leaped upon thee repeated the good father with evident vexation what next i tell thee child those foolish fears are most unmeet for thee and must be overcome if necessary with prayer and penance frightened by a toad blood of the martyrs t is like any foolish girl  father pedro stopped and coughed  i am saying that no christian child should shrink from any of gods harmless creatures and only last week thou wast disdainful of poor murietas pig forgetting that san antonio himself did elect one his faithful companion even in glory  yes but it was so fat and so uncleanly holy father replied the young acolyte and it smelt so  smelt so echoed the father doubtfully have a care child that this is not luxuriousness of the senses i have noticed of late you gather overmuch of roses and syringa excellent in their way and in moderation but still not to be compared with the flower of holy church the lily  but lilies dont look well on the refectory table and against the adobe wall returned the acolyte with a pout of a spoilt child and surely the flowers cannot help being sweet any more than myrrh or incense and i am not frightened of the heathen americanos either now there was a small one in the garden yesterday a boy like me and he spoke kindly and with a pleasant face  what said he to thee child asked father pedro anxiously  nay the matter of his speech i could not understand laughed the boy but the manner was as gentle as thine holy father  st child said the padre impatiently thy likings are as unreasonable as thy fears besides have i not told thee it ill becomes a child of christ to chatter with those sons of belial but canst thou not repeat the wordsthe words he said he continued suspiciously  t is a harsh tongue the americanos speak in their throat replied the boy but he said devilishnisse and prettyasagirl and looked at me  the good father made the boy repeat the words gravely and as gravely repeated them after him with infinite simplicity they are but heretical words he replied in answer to the boys inquiring look it is well you understand not english enough run away child and be ready for the angelus i will commune with myself awhile under the pear trees  glad to escape so easily the young acolyte disappeared down the alley of fig trees not without a furtive look at the patches of chickweed around their roots the possible ambuscade of creeping or saltant vermin the good priest heaved a sigh and glanced round the darkening prospect the sun had already disappeared over the mountain wall that lay between him and the sea rimmed with a faint white line of outlying fog a cool zephyr fanned his cheek it was the dying breath of the vientos generales beyond the wall as father pedros eyes were raised to this barrier which seemed to shut out the boisterous world beyond he fancied he noticed for the first time a slight breach in the parapet over which an advanced banner of the fog was fluttering was it an omen his speculations were cut short by a voice at his very side  he turned quickly and beheld one of those heathens against whom he had just warned his young acolyte one of that straggling band of adventurers whom the recent gold discoveries had scattered along the coast luckily the fertile alluvium of these valleys lying parallel with the sea offered no indications to attract the goldseekers nevertheless to father pedro even the infrequent contact with the americanos was objectionable they were at once inquisitive and careless they asked questions with the sharp perspicacity of controversy they received his grave replies with the frank indifference of utter worldliness powerful enough to have been tyrannical oppressors they were singularly tolerant and gentle contenting themselves with a playful goodnatured irreverence which tormented the good father more than opposition they were felt to be dangerous and subversive  the americano however who stood before him did not offensively suggest these national qualities a man of middle height strongly built bronzed and slightly gray from the vicissitudes of years and exposure he had an air of practical seriousness that commended itself to father pedro to his religious mind it suggested selfconsciousness expressed in the dialect of the stranger it only meant business  im rather glad i found you out here alone began the latter it saves time i havent got to take my turn with the rest in therehe indicated the church with his thumband you havent got to make an appointment you have got a clear forty minutes before the angelus rings he added consulting a large silver chronometer and i reckon i kin git through my part of the job inside of twenty leaving you ten minutes for remarks i want to confess  father pedro drew back with a gesture of dignity the stranger however laid his hand upon the padres sleeve with the air of a man anticipating objection but never refusal and went on  of course i know you want me to come at some other time and in there you want it in the reglar style thats your way and your time my answer is it aint my way and my time the main idea of confession i take it is gettin at the facts im ready to give em if youll take em out here now if youre willing to drop the church and confessional and all that sort o thing i on my side am willing to give up the absolution and all that sort o thing you might he added with an unconscious touch of pathos in the suggestion heave in a word or two of advice after i get through for instance what youd do in the circumstances you see thats all but thats as you please it aint part of the business  irreverent as this speech appeared there was really no trace of such intention in his manner and his evident profound conviction that his suggestion was practical and not at all inconsistent with ecclesiastical dignity would alone have been enough to touch the padre had not the strangers dominant personality already overridden him he hesitated the stranger seized the opportunity to take his arm and lead him with the half familiarity of powerful protection to a bench beneath the refectory window taking out his watch again he put it in the passive hands of the astonished priest saying time me cleared his throat and began  fourteen years ago there was a ship cruisin in the pacific jest off this range that was ez nigh on to a hell afloat as anything rigged kin be if a chap managed to dodge the capens belayingpin for a time he was bound to be fetched up in the ribs at last by the mates boots there was a chap knocked down the fore hatch with a broken leg in the gulf and another jumped overboard off cape corrientes crazy as a loon along a clip of the head from the capens trumpet thems facts the ship was a brigantine trading along the mexican coast the capen had his wife aboard a little timid mexican woman hed picked up at mazatlan i reckon she didnt get on with him any better than the men for she ups and dies one day leavin her baby a yearold gal one o the crew was fond o that baby he used to get the black nurse to put it in the dingy and hed tow it astern rocking it with the painter like a cradle he did ithatin the capen all the same one day the black nurse got out of the dingy for a moment when the baby was asleep leavin him alone with it an idea took hold on him jest from cussedness youd say but it was partly from revenge on the capen and partly to get away from the ship the ship was well in shore and the current settin towards it he slipped the painterthat manand set himself adrift with the baby it was a crazy act youd reckon for there was nt any oars in the boat but he had a crazy mans luck and he contrived by sculling the boat with one of the seats he tore out to keep her out of the breakers till he could find a bight in the shore to run her in the alarm was given from the ship but the fog shut down upon him he could hear the other boats in pursuit they seemed to close in on him and by the sound he judged the capen was just abreast of him in the gig bearing down upon him in the fog he slipped out of the dingy into the water without a splash and struck out for the breakers he got ashore after havin been knocked down and dragged in four times by the undertow he had only one idea then thankfulness that he had not taken the baby with him in the surf you kin put that down for him its a fact he got off into the hills and made his way up to monterey  and the child asked the padre with a sudden and strange asperity that boded no good to the penitent the child thus ruthlessly abandonedwhat became of it  thats just it the child said the stranger gravely well if that man was on his deathbed instead of being here talking to you hed swear that he thought the capen was sure to come up to it the next minit thats a fact but it wasnt until one day that hethats meran across one of that crew in frisco hallo cranch sez he to me so you got away didnt you and hows the capens baby grown a young gal by this time aint she what are you talking about sez i how should i know he draws away from me and sezdit sez he you dont mean that you  i grabs him by the throat and makes him tell me all and then it appears that the boat and the baby were never found again and every man of that crew capen and all believed i had stolen it  he paused father pedro was staring at the prospect with an uncompromising rigidity of head and shoulder  its a bad lookout for me aint it the stranger continued in serious reflection  how do i know said the priest harshly without turning his head that you did not make away with this child  beg pardon  that you did not complete your revenge bybykilling it as your comrade suspected you ah holy trinity continued father pedro throwing out his hands with an impatient gesture as if to take the place of unutterable thought  how do you know echoed the stranger coldly  yes  the stranger linked his fingers together and threw them over his knee drew it up to his chest caressingly and said quietly because you do know  the padre rose to his feet  what mean you he said sternly fixing his eyes upon the speaker their eyes met the strangers were gray and persistent with hanging corner lids that might have concealed even more purpose than they showed the padres were hollow open and the whites slightly brown as if with tobacco stains yet they were the first to turn away  i mean returned the stranger with the same practical gravity that you know it wouldnt pay me to come here if id killed the baby unless i wanted you to fix things right with me up there pointing skyward and get absolution and ive told you that wasnt in my line  why do you seek me then demanded the padre suspiciously  because i reckon i thought a man might be allowed to confess something short of a murder if youre going to draw the line below that  this is but sacrilegious levity interrupted father pedro turning as if to go but the stranger did not make any movement to detain him  have you implored forgiveness of the fatherthe man you wrongedbefore you came here asked the priest lingering  not much it wouldnt pay if he was living and he died four years ago  you are sure of that  i am  there are other relations perhaps  none  father pedro was silent when he spoke again it was with a changed voice what is your purpose then he asked with the first indication of priestly sympathy in his manner you cannot ask forgiveness of the earthly father you have injured you refuse the intercession of holy church with the heavenly father you have disobeyed speak wretched man what is it you want  i want to find the child  but if it were possible if she were still living are you fit to seek her to even make yourself known to her to appear before her  well if i made it profitable to her perhaps  perhaps echoed the priest scornfully so be it but why come here  to ask your advice to know how to begin my search you know this country you were here when that boat drifted ashore beyond that mountain  ah indeed i have much to do with it it is an affair of the alcaldethe authoritiesof youryour police  is it  the padre again met the strangers eyes he stopped with the snuffbox he had somewhat ostentatiously drawn from his pocket still open in his hand  why is it not señor he demanded  if she lives she is a young lady by this time and might not want the details of her life known to any one  and how will you recognize your baby in this young lady asked father pedro with a rapid gesture indicating the comparative heights of a baby and an adult  i reckon ill know her and her clothes too and whoever found her wouldnt be fool enough to destroy them  after fourteen years good you have faith señor  cranch supplied the stranger consulting his watch but times up business is business goodby dont let me keep you  he extended his hand  the padre met it with a dry unsympathetic palm as sere and yellow as the hills when their hands separated the father still hesitated looking at cranch if he expected further speech or entreaty from him he was mistaken for the american without turning his head walked in the same serious practical fashion down the avenue of fig trees and disappeared beyond the hedge of vines the outlines of the mountain beyond were already lost in the fog father pedro turned into the refectory  antonio  a strong flavor of leather onions and stable preceded the entrance of a short stout vaquero from the little patio  saddle pinto and thine own mule to accompany francisco who will take letters from me to the father superior at san josé tomorrow at daybreak  at daybreak reverend father  at daybreak hark ye go by the mountain trails and avoid the highway stop at no posada nor fonda but if the child is weary rest then awhile at don juan briones or at the rancho of the blessed fisherman have no converse with stragglers least of all those gentile americanos so   the first strokes of the angelus came from the nearer tower with a gesture father pedro waved antonio aside and opened the door of the sacristy  ad majorem dei gloria   ii  the hacienda of don juan briones nestling in a wooded cleft of the foothills was hidden as father pedro had wisely reflected from the straying feet of travelers along the dusty highway to san josé as francisco emerging from the cañada put spurs to his mule at the sight of the whitewashed walls antonio grunted  oh aye little priest thou wast tired enough a moment ago and though we are not three leagues from the blessed fisherman thou couldst scarce sit thy saddle longer mother of god and all to see that little mongrel juanita  but good antonio juanita was my playfellow and i may not soon again chance this way and juanita is not a mongrel no more than i am  she is a mestiza and thou art a child of the church though this following of gypsy wenches does not show it  but father pedro does not object urged the boy  the reverend father has forgotten he was ever young replied antonio sententiously or he wouldnt set fire and tow together  what sayest thou good antonio asked francisco quickly opening his blue eyes in frank curiosity who is fire and who is tow  the worthy muleteer utterly abashed and confounded by this display of the acolytes direct simplicity contented himself by shrugging his shoulders and a vague quien sabe  come said the boy gayly confess it is only the aguardiente of the blessed fisherman thou missest never fear juanita will find thee some and see here she comes  there was a flash of white flounces along the dark brown corridor the twinkle of satin slippers the flying out of long black braids and with a cry of joy a young girl threw herself upon francisco as he entered the patio and nearly dragged him from his mule  have a care little sister laughed the acolyte looking at antonio or there will be a conflagration am i the fire he continued submitting to the two sounding kisses the young girl placed upon either cheek but still keeping his mischievous glance upon the muleteer  quien sabe repeated antonio gruffly as the young girl blushed under his significant eyes it is no affair of mine he added to himself as he led pinto away perhaps father pedro is right and this young twig of the church is as dry and sapless as himself let the mestiza burn if she likes  quick pancho said the young girl eagerly leading him along the corridor this way i must talk with thee before thou seest don juan that is why i ran to intercept thee and not as that fool antonio would signify to shame thee wast thou ashamed my pancho  the boy threw his arm familiarly round the supple stayless little waist accented only by the belt of the light flounced saya and said but why this haste and feverishness nita and now i look at thee thou hast been crying  they had emerged from a door in the corridor into the bright sunlight of a walled garden the girl dropped her eyes cast a quick glance around her and said  not here to the arroyo and half leading half dragging him made her way through a copse of manzanita and alder until they heard the faint tinkling of water dost thou remember said the girl it was here pointing to an embayed pool in the dark current that i baptized thee when father pedro first brought thee here when we both played at being monks they were dear old days for father pedro would trust no one with thee but me and always kept us near him  aye and he said i would be profaned by the touch of any other and so himself always washed and dressed me and made my bed near his  and took thee away again and i saw thee not till thou camest with antonio over a year ago to the cattle branding and now my pancho i may never see thee again she buried her face in her hands and sobbed aloud  the little acolyte tried to comfort her but with such abstraction of manner and inadequacy of warmth that she hastily removed his caressing hand  but why what has happened he asked eagerly  the girls manner had changed her eyes flashed and she put her brown fist on her waist and began to rock from side to side  but ill not go she said viciously  go where asked the boy  oh where she echoed impatiently hear me francisco thou knowest i am like thee an orphan but i have not like thee a parent in the holy church for alas she added bitterly i am not a boy and have not a lovely voice borrowed from the angels i was like thee a foundling kept by the charity of the reverend fathers until don juan a childless widower adopted me i was happy not knowing and caring who were the parents who had abandoned me happy only in the love of him who became my adopted father and nowshe paused  and now echoed francisco eagerly  and now they say it is discovered who are my parents  and they live  mother of god no said the girl with scarcely filial piety there is some one a thing a mere don fulano who knows it all it seems who is to be my guardian  but how tell me all dear juanita said the boy with a feverish interest that contrasted so strongly with his previous abstraction that juanita bit her lips with vexation  ah how santa barbara an extravaganza for children a necklace of lies i am lost from a ship of which my fatherheaven rest himis general and i am picked up among the weeds on the seashore like moses in the bulrushes a pretty story indeed  o how beautiful exclaimed francisco enthusiastically ah juanita would it had been me  thee said the girl bitterlythee noit was a girl wanted enough it was me  and when does the guardian come persisted the boy with sparkling eyes  he is here even now with that pompous fool the american alcalde from monterey a wretch who knows nothing of the country or the people but who helped the other american to claim me i tell thee francisco like as not it is all a folly some senseless blunder of those americanos that imposes upon don juans simplicity and love for them  how looks he this americano who seeks thee asked francisco  what care i how he looks said juanita or what he is he may have the four ss for all i care yet she added with a slight touch of coquetry he is not bad to look upon now i recall him  had he a long mustache and a sad sweet smile and a voice so gentle and yet so strong that you felt he ordered you to do things without saying it and did his eye read your thoughtsthat very thought that you must obey him  saints preserve thee pancho of whom dost thou speak  listen juanita it was a year ago the eve of natividad he was in the church when i sang look where i would i always met his eye when the canticle was sung and i was slipping into the sacristy he was beside me he spoke kindly but i understood him not he put into my hand gold for an aguinaldo i pretended i understood not that also and put it into the box for the poor he smiled and went away often have i seen him since and last night when i left the mission he was there again with father pedro  and father pedro what said he of him asked juanita  nothing the boy hesitated perhapsbecause i said nothing of the stranger  juanita laughed so thou canst keep a secret from the good father when thou carest but why dost thou think this stranger is my new guardian  dost thou not see little sister he was even then seeking thee said the boy with joyous excitement doubtless he knew we were friends and playmatesmaybe the good father has told him thy secret for it is no idle tale of the alcalde believe me i see it all it is true  then thou wilt let him take me away exclaimed the girl bitterly withdrawing the little hand he had clasped in his excitement  alas juanita what avails it now i am sent to san josé charged with a letter to the father superior who will give me further orders what they are or how long i must stay i know not but i know this the good father pedros eyes were troubled when he gave me his blessing and he held me long in his embrace pray heaven i have committed no fault still it may be that the reputation of my gift hath reached the father superior and he would advance me and franciscos eyes lit up with youthful pride at the thought  not so juanita her black eyes snapped suddenly with suspicion she drew in her breath and closed her little mouth firmly then she began a crescendo  mother of god was that all was he a child to be sent away for such time or for such purpose as best pleased the fathers was he to know no more than that with such gifts as god had given him was he not at least to have some word in disposing of them ah she would not stand it  the boy gazed admiringly at the piquant energy of the little figure before him and envied her courage it is the mestizo blood he murmured to himself then aloud thou shouldst have been a man nita  and thou a woman  or a priest eh what is that  they had both risen juanita defiantly her black braids flying as she wheeled and suddenly faced the thicket francisco clinging to her with trembling hands and whitened lips a stone loosened from the hillside had rolled to their feet there was a crackling in the alders on the slope above them  is it a bear or a brigand whispered francisco hurriedly sounding the uttermost depths of his terror in the two words  it is an eavesdropper said juanita impetuously and who and why i intend to know and she started towards the thicket  do not leave me good juanita said the young acolyte grasping the girls skirt  nay run to the hacienda quickly and leave me to search the thicket run  the boy did not wait for a second injunction but scuttled away his long coat catching in the brambles while juanita darted like a kitten into the bushes her search was fruitless however and she was returning impatiently when her quick eye fell upon a letter lying amid the dried grass where she and francisco had been seated the moment before it had evidently fallen from his breast when he had risen suddenly and been overlooked in his alarm it was father pedros letter to the father superior of san josé  in an instant she had pounced upon it as viciously as if it had been the interloper she was seeking she knew that she held in her fingers the secret of franciscos sudden banishment she felt instinctively that this yellowish envelope with its red string and its blotch of red seal was his sentence and her own the little mestizo had not been brought up to respect the integrity of either locks or seals both being unknown in the patriarchal life of the hacienda yet with a certain feminine instinct she looked furtively around her and even managed to dislodge the clumsy wax without marring the pretty effigy of the crossed keys impressed upon it then she opened the letter and read  suddenly she stopped and put back her hair from her brown temples then a succession of burning blushes followed each other in waves from her neck up and died in drops of moisture in her eyes this continued until she was fairly crying dropping the letter from her hands and rocking to and fro in the midst of this she quickly stopped again the clouds broke a sunshine of laughter started from her eyes she laughed shyly she laughed loudly she laughed hysterically then she stopped again as suddenly knitted her brows swooped down once more upon the letter and turned to fly but at the same moment the letter was quietly but firmly taken from her hand and mr jack cranch stood beside her  juanita was crimson but unconquered she mechanically held out her hand for the letter the american took her little fingers kissed them and said  how are you again  the letter replied juanita with a strong disposition to stamp her foot  but said cranch with business directness youve read enough to know it isnt for you  nor for you either responded juanita  true it is for the reverend father superior of san josé mission ill give it to him  juanita was becoming alarmed first at this prospect second at the power the stranger seemed to be gaining over her she recalled franciscos description of him with something like superstitious awe  but it concerns francisco it contains a secret he should know  then you can tell him it perhaps it would come easier from you  juanita blushed again why she asked half dreading his reply  because said the american quietly you are old playmates you are attached to each other  juanita bit her lips why dont you read it yourself she asked bluntly  because i dont read other peoples letters and if it concerns me youll tell me  what if i dont  then the father superior will  i believe you know franciscos secret already said the girl boldly  perhaps  then mother of god señor crancho what do you want  i do not want to separate two such good friends as you and francisco  perhaps youd like to claim us both said the girl with a sneer that was not devoid of coquetry  i should be delighted  then here is your occasion senor for here comes my adopted father don juan and your friend senor brrown the american alcalde  two men appeared in the garden path below them the stiff glazed broadbrimmed black hat surmounting a dark face of quixotic gravity and romantic rectitude indicated don juan briones his companion lazy specious and redfaced was señor brown the american alcalde  well i reckon we kin about call the thing fixed said señor brown with a large wave of the hand suggesting a sweeping away of all trivial details ez i was saying to the don yer when two hightoned gents like you and him come together in a delicate matter of this kind it aint no hoss trade nor sharp practice the don is that lofty in principle that hes willin to sacrifice his affections for the good of the gal and you on your hand kalkilate to see all hes done for her and go your whole pile better youll make the legal formalities good i reckon that old injin woman who can swear to the finding of the baby on the shore will set things all right yet for the matter o that if you want anything in the way of a certificate im on hand always  juanita and myself are at your disposition caballeros said don juan with a grave exaltation never let it be said that the mexican nation was outdone by the great americanos in deeds of courtesy and affection let it rather stand that juanita was a sacred trust put into my hands years ago by the goddess of american liberty and nurtured in the mexican eagles nest is it not so my soul he added more humanly to the girl when he had quite recovered from the intoxication of his own speech we love thee little one but we keep our honor  theres nothing mean about the old man said brown admiringly with a slight dropping of his left eyelid his head is level and he goes with his party  thou takest my daughter señor cranch continued the old man carried away by his emotion but the american nation gives me a son  you know not what you say father said the young girl angrily exasperated by a slight twinkle in the americans eye  not so said cranch perhaps one of the american nation may take him at his word  then caballeros you will for the moment at least possess yourselves of the house and its poor hospitality said don juan with timehonored courtesy producing the rustic key of the gate of the patio it is at your disposition caballeros he repeated leading the way as his guests passed into the corridor  two hours passed the hills were darkening on their eastern slopes the shadows of the few poplars that sparsedly dotted the dusty highway were falling in long black lines that looked like ditches on the dead level of the tawny fields the shadows of slowly moving cattle were mingling with their own silhouettes and becoming more and more grotesque a keen wind rising in the hills was already creeping from the cañada as from the mouth of a funnel and sweeping the plains antonio had forgathered with the servants had pinched the ears of the maids had partaken of aguardiente had saddled the mulesantonio was becoming impatient  and then a singular commotion disturbed the peaceful monotony of the patriarchal household of don juan briones the stagnant courtyard was suddenly alive with peons and servants running hither and thither the alleys and gardens were filled with retainers a confusion of questions orders and outcrys rent the air the plains shook with the galloping of a dozen horsemen for the acolyte francisco of the mission san carmel had disappeared and vanished and from that day the hacienda of don juan briones knew him no more   iii  when father pedro saw the yellow mules vanish under the low branches of the oaks beside the little graveyard caught the last glitter of the morning sun on pintos shining headstall and heard the last tinkle of antonios spurs something very like a mundane sigh escaped him to the simple wonder of the majority of early worshipersthe halfbreed converts who rigorously attended the spiritual ministrations of the mission and ate the temporal provisions of the reverend fathershe deputed the functions of the first mass to a coadjutor and breviary in hand sought the orchard of venerable pear trees whether there was any occult sympathy in his reflections with the contemplation of their gnarled twisted gouty and knotty limbs still bearing gracious and goodly fruit i know not but it was his private retreat and under one of the most rheumatic and misshapen trunks there was a rude seat here father pedro sank his face toward the mountain wall between him and the invisible sea the relentless dry practical californian sunlight falling on his face grimly pointed out a night of vigil and suffering the snuffy yellow of his eyes was injected yet burning his temples were ridged and veined like a tobacco leaf the odor of desiccation which his garments always exhaled was hot and feverish as if the fire had suddenly awakened among the ashes  of what was father pedro thinking  he was thinking of his youth a youth spent under the shade of those pear trees even then venerable as now he was thinking of his youthful dreams of heathen conquest emulating the sacrifices and labors of junipero serra a dream cut short by the orders of the archbishop that sent his companion brother diego north on a mission to strange lands and condemned him to the isolation of san carmel he was thinking of that fierce struggle with envy of a fellowcreatures better fortune that conquered by prayer and penance left him patient submissive and devoted to his humble work how he raised up converts to the faith even taking them from the breast of heretic mothers  he recalled how once with the zeal of propagandism quickening in the instincts of a childless man he had dreamed of perpetuating his work through some sinless creation of his own of dedicating some virgin soul one over whom he could have complete control restricted by no human paternal weakness to the task he had begun but how of all the boys eagerly offered to the church by their parents there seemed none sufficiently pure and free from parental taint he remembered how one night through the intercession of the blessed virgin herself as he firmly then believed this dream was fulfilled an indian woman brought him a waugee childa babygirl that she had picked up on the seashore there were no parents to divide the responsibility the child had no past to confront except the memory of the ignorant indian woman who deemed her duty done and whose interest ceased in giving it to the padre the austere conditions of his monkish life compelled him to the first step in his adoption of itthe concealment of its sex this was easy enough as he constituted himself from that moment its sole nurse and attendant and boldly baptized it among the other children by the name of francisco no others knew its origin nor cared to know father pedro had taken a muchacho foundling for adoption his jealous seclusion of it and his personal care was doubtless some sacerdotal formula at once high and necessary  he remembered with darkening eyes and impeded breath how his close companionship and daily care of this helpless child had revealed to him the fascinations of that paternity denied to him how he had deemed it his duty to struggle against the thrill of baby fingers laid upon his yellow cheeks the pleading of inarticulate words the eloquence of wonderseeing and mutely questioning eyes how he had succumbed again and again and then struggled no more seeing only in them the suggestion of childhood made incarnate in the holy babe and yet even as he thought he drew from his gown a little shoe and laid it beside his breviary it was franciscos baby slipper a duplicate to those worn by the miniature waxen figure of the holy virgin herself in her niche in the transept  had he felt during these years any qualms of conscience at this concealment of the childs sex none for to him the babe was sexless as most befitted one who was to live and die at the foot of the altar there was no attempt to deceive god what mattered else nor was he withholding the child from the ministrations of the sacred sisters there was no convent near the mission and as each year passed the difficulty of restoring her to the position and duties of her sex became greater and more dangerous and then the acolytes destiny was sealed by what again appeared to father pedro as a direct interposition of providence the child developed a voice of such exquisite sweetness and purity that an angel seemed to have strayed into the little choir and kneeling worshipers below transported gazed upwards half expectant of a heavenly light breaking through the gloom of the raftered ceiling the fame of the little singer filled the valley of san carmel it was a miracle vouchsafed the mission don josé peralta remembered ah yes to have heard in old spain of boy choristers with such voices  and was this sacred trust to be withdrawn from him was this life which he had brought out of an unknown world of sin unstained and pure consecrated and dedicated to god just in the dawn of power and promise for the glory of the mother church to be taken from his side and at the word of a selfconvicted man of sina man whose tardy repentance was not yet absolved by the holy church never never father pedro dwelt upon the strangers rejections of the ministrations of the church with a pitiable satisfaction had he accepted it he would have had a sacred claim upon father pedros sympathy and confidence yet he rose again uneasily and with irregular steps returned to the corridor passing the door of the familiar little cell beside his own the window the table and even the scant toilette utensils were filled with the flowers of yesterday some of them withered and dry the white gown of the little chorister was hanging emptily against the wall father pedro started and trembled it seemed as if the spiritual life of the child had slipped away with its garments  in that slight chill which even in the hottest days in california always invests any shadow cast in that white sunlight father pedro shivered in the corridor passing again into the garden he followed in fancy the wayfaring figure of francisco saw the child arrive at the rancho of don juan and with the fateful blindness of all dreamers projected a picture most unlike the reality he followed the pilgrims even to san josé and saw the child deliver the missive which gave the secret of her sex and condition to the father superior that the authority at san josé might dissent with the padre of san carmel or decline to carry out his designs did not occur to the oneidead priest like all solitary people isolated from passing events he made no allowance for occurrences outside of his routine yet at this moment a sudden thought whitened his yellow cheek what if the father superior deemed it necessary to impart the secret to francisco would the child recoil at the deception and perhaps cease to love him it was the first time in his supreme selfishness he had taken the acolytes feelings into account he had thought of him only as one owing implicit obedience to him as a temporal and spiritual guide  reverend father  he turned impatiently it was his muleteer josé father pedros sunken eye brightened  ah josé quickly then hast thou found sanchicha  truly your reverence and i have brought her with me just as she is though if your reverence make more of her than to fill the sixfoot hole and say a prayer over her ill give the mule that brought her here for food for the bulls horns she neither hears nor speaks but whether from weakness or sheer wantonness i know not  peace then and let thy tongue take example from hers bring her with thee into the sacristy and attend without go  father pedro watched the disappearing figure of the muleteer and hurriedly swept his thin dry hand veined and ribbed like a brown november leaf over his stony forehead with a sound that seemed almost a rustle then he suddenly stiffened his fingers over his breviary dropped his arms perpendicularly before him and with a rigid step returned to the corridor and passed into the sacristy  for a moment in the halfdarkness the room seemed to be empty tossed carelessly in the corner appeared some blankets topped by a few straggling black horsetails like an unstranded riata a trembling agitated the mass as father pedro approached he bent over the heap and distinguished in its midst the glowing black eyes of sanchicha the indian centenarian of the mission san carmel only her eyes lived helpless boneless and jellylike old age had overtaken her with a mild form of deliquescence  listen sanchicha said the father gravely it is important that thou shouldst refresh thy memory for a moment look back fourteen years mother it is but yesterday to thee thou dost remember the babya little muchacha thou broughtest me thenfourteen years ago  the old womans eyes became intelligent and turned with a quick look towards the open door of the church and thence towards the choir  the padre made a motion of irritation no no thou dost not understand thou dost not attend me knowest thou of any mark of clothing trinket or amulet found upon the babe  the light of the old womans eyes went out she might have been dead father pedro waited a moment and then laid his hand impatiently on her shoulder  dost thou mean there are none  a ray of light struggled back into her eyes  none  and thou hast kept back or put away no sign nor mark of her parentage tell me on this crucifix  the eyes caught the crucifix and became as empty as the orbits of the carven christ upon it  father pedro waited patiently a moment passed only the sound of the muleteers spurs was heard in the courtyard  it is well he said at last with a sigh of relief pepita shall give thee some refreshment and josé will bring thee back again i will summon him  he passed out of the sacristy door leaving it open a ray of sunlight darted eagerly in and fell upon the grotesque heap in the corner sanchichas eyes lived again more than that a singular movement came over her face the hideous caverns of her toothless mouth openedshe laughed the step of josé was heard in the corridor and she became again inert  the third day which should have brought the return of antonio was nearly spent father pedro was impatient but not alarmed the good fathers at san josé might naturally detain antonio for the answer which might require deliberation if any mischance had occurred to francisco antonio would have returned or sent a special messenger at sunset he was in his accustomed seat in the orchard his hands clasped over the breviary in his listless lap his eyes fixed upon the mountain between him and that mysterious sea that had brought so much into his life he was filled with a strange desire to see it a vague curiosity hitherto unknown to his preoccupied life he wished to gaze upon that strand perhaps the very spot where she had been found he doubted not his questioning eyes would discover some forgotten trace of her under his persistent will and aided by the holy virgin the sea would give up its secret he looked at the fog creeping along the summit and recalled the latest gossip of san carmel how that since the advent of the americanos it was gradually encroaching on the mission the hated name vividly recalled to him the features of the stranger as he had stood before him three nights ago in this very garden so vividly that he sprang to his feet with an exclamation it was no fancy but señor cranch himself advancing from under the shadow of a pear tree  i reckoned id catch you here said mr cranch with the same dry practical business fashion as if he were only resuming an interrupted conversation and i reckon i aint going to keep you a minit longer than i did tother day he mutely referred to his watch which he already held in his hand and then put it back in his pocket well we found her  francisco interrupted the priest with a single stride laying his hand upon cranchs arm and staring into his eyes  mr cranch quietly removed father pedros hand i reckon that wasnt the name as i caught it he returned dryly hadnt you better sit down  pardon mepardon me señor said the priest hastily sinking back upon his bench i was thinking of other things youyoucame upon me suddenly i thought it was the acolyte go on señor i am interested  i thought youd be said cranch quietly thats why i came and then you might be of service too  true true said the priest with rapid accents and this girl señor this girl is  juanita the mestiza adopted daughter of don juan briones over on the santa clare valley replied cranch jerking his thumb over his shoulder and then sitting down upon the bench beside father pedro  the priest turned his feverish eyes piercingly upon his companion for a few seconds and then doggedly fixed them upon the ground cranch drew a plug of tobacco from his pocket cut off a portion placed it in his cheek and then quietly began to strap the blade of his jackknife upon his boot father pedro saw it from under his eyelids and even in his preoccupation despised him  then you are certain she is the babe you seek said the father without looking up  i reckon as near as you can be certain of anything her age tallies she was the only foundling girl baby baptized by you you knowhe partly turned round appealingly to the padrethat year injin woman says she picked up a baby looks like a pretty clear case dont it  and the clothes friend cranch said the priest with his eyes still on the ground and a slight assumption of easy indifference  they will be forthcoming like enough when the time comes said cranch the main thing at first was to find the girl that was my job the lawyers i reckon can fit the proofs and say whats wanted later on  but why lawyers continued padre pedro with a slight sneer he could not repress if the child is found and señor cranch is satisfied  on account of the property business is business  the property  mr cranch pressed the back of his knifeblade on his boot shut it up with a click and putting it in his pocket said calmly  well i reckon the million of dollars that her father left when he died which naturally belongs to her will require some proof that she is his daughter  he had placed both his hands in his pockets and turned his eyes full upon father pedro the priest arose hurriedly  but you said nothing of this before señor cranch said he with a gesture of indignation turning his back quite upon cranch and taking a step towards the refectory  why should i i was looking after the girl not the property returned cranch following the padre with watchful eyes but still keeping his careless easy attitude  ah well will it be said so think you eh bueno what will the world think of your sacred quest eh continued the padre pedro forgetting himself in his excitement but still averting his face from his companion  the world will look after the proofs and i reckon not bother if the proofs are all right replied cranch carelessly and the girl wont think the worse for me for helping her to a fortune hallo youve dropped something he leaped to his feet picked up the breviary which had fallen from the padres fingers and returned it to him with a slight touch of gentleness that was unsuspected in the man  the priests dry tremulous hand grasped the volume without acknowledgment  but these proofs he said hastily these proofs señor  oh well youll testify to the baptism you know  but if i refuse if i will have nothing to do with this thing if i will not give my word that there is not some mistake said the priest working himself into a feverish indignation that there are not slips of memory eh of so many children baptized is it possible for me to know which eh and if this juanita is not your girl eh  then youll help me to find who is said cranch coolly  father pedro turned furiously on his tormentor overcome by his vigil and anxiety he was oblivious of everything but the presence of the man who seemed to usurp the functions of his own conscience who are you who speak thus he said hoarsely advancing upon cranch with outstretched and anathematizing fingers who are you señor heathen who dare to dictate to me a father of holy church i tell you i will have none of this never i will not from this moment you understandnothing i will never   he stopped the first stroke of the angelus rang from the little tower the first stroke of that bell before whose magic exorcism all human passions fled the peaceful bell that had for fifty years lulled the little fold of san carmel to prayer and rest came to his throbbing ear his trembling hands groped for the crucifix carried it to his left breast his lips moved in prayer his eyes were turned to the cold passionless sky where a few faint farspaced stars had silently stolen to their places the angelus still rang his trembling ceased he remained motionless and rigid  the american who had uncovered in deference to the worshiper rather than the rite waited patiently the eyes of father pedro returned to the earth moist as if with dew caught from above he looked half absently at cranch  forgive me my son he said in a changed voice i am only a worn old man i must talk with thee more of thisbut not tonightnot tonighttomorrowtomorrowtomorrow  he turned slowly and appeared to glide rather than move under the trees until the dark shadow of the mission tower met and encompassed him cranch followed him with anxious eyes then he removed the quid of tobacco from his cheek  just as i reckoned remarked he quite audibly hes clean gold on the bed rock after all   iv  that night father pedro dreamed a strange dream how much of it was reality how long it lasted or when he awoke from it he could not tell the morbid excitement of the previous day culminated in a febrile exaltation in which he lived and moved as in a separate existence  this is what he remembered he thought he had risen at night in a sudden horror of remorse and making his way to the darkened church had fallen upon his knees before the high altar when all at once the acolytes voice broke from the choir but in accents so dissonant and unnatural that it seemed a sacrilege and he trembled he thought he had confessed the secret of the childs sex to cranch but whether the next morning or a week later he did not know he fancied too that cranch had also confessed some trifling deception to him but what or why he could not remember so much greater seemed the enormity of his own transgression he thought cranch had put in his hands the letter he had written to the father superior saying that his secret was still safe and that he had been spared the avowal and the scandal that might have ensued but through all and above all he was conscious of one fixed idea to seek the seashore with sanchicha and upon the spot where she had found francisco meet the young girl who had taken his place and so part from her forever he had a dim recollection that this was necessary to some legal identification of her as arranged by cranch but how or why he did not understand enough that it was a part of his penance  it was early morning when the faithful antonio accompanied by sanchicha and josé rode forth with him from the mission of san carmel except on the expressionless features of the old woman there was anxiety and gloom upon the faces of the little cavalcade he did not know how heavily his strange abstraction and hallucinations weighed upon their honest hearts as they wound up the ascent of the mountain he noticed that antonio and josé conversed with bated breath and many pious crossings of themselves but with eyes always wistfully fixed upon him he wondered if as part of his penance he ought not to proclaim his sin and abase himself before them but he knew that his devoted followers would insist upon sharing his punishment and he remembered his promise to cranch that for her sake he would say nothing before they reached the summit he turned once or twice to look back upon the mission how small it looked lying there in the peaceful valley contrasted with the broad sweep of the landscape beyond stopped at the farther east only by the dim ghostlike outlines of the sierras but the strong breath of the sea was beginning to be felt in a few moments more they were facing it with lowered sombreros and flying serapes and the vast glittering illimitable pacific opened out beneath them  dazed and blinded as it seemed to him by the shining restless expanse father pedro rode forward as if still in a dream suddenly he halted and called antonio to his side  tell me child didst thou say that this coast was wild and desolate of man beast and habitation  truly i did reverend father  then what is that pointing to the shore  almost at their feet nestled a cluster of houses at the head of an arroyo reaching up from the beach they looked down upon the smoke of a manufactory chimney upon strange heaps of material and curious engines scattered along the sands with here and there moving specks of human figures in a little bay a schooner swung at her cables  the vaquero crossed himself in stupefied alarm i know not your reverence it is only two years ago before the rodeo that i was here for strayed colts and i swear by the blessed bones of san antonio that it was as i said  ah it is like these americanos responded the muleteer i have it from my brother diego that he went from san josé to pescadero two months ago across the plains with never a hut nor fonda to halt at all the way he returned in seven days and in the midst of the plain there were three houses and a mill and many people and why was it ah mother of god one had picked up in the creek where he drank that much of gold and the muleteer tapped one of the silver coins that fringed his jacket sleeves in place of buttons  and they are washing the sands for gold there now said antonio eagerly pointing to some men gathered round a machine like an enormous cradle let us hasten on  father pedros momentary interest had passed the words of his companions fell dull and meaningless upon his dreaming ears he was conscious only that the child was more a stranger to him as an outcome of this hard bustling life than when he believed her borne to him over the mysterious sea it perplexed his dazed disturbed mind to think that if such an antagonistic element could exist within a dozen miles of the mission and he not know it could not such an atmosphere have been around him even in his monastic isolation and he remain blind to it had he really lived in the world without knowing it had it been in his blood had it impelled him tohe shuddered and rode on  they were at the last slope of the zigzag descent to the shore when he saw the figures of a man and woman moving slowly through a field of wild oats not far from the trail it seemed to his distorted fancy that the man was cranch the woman his heart stopped beating ah could it be he had never seen her in her proper garb would she look like that would she be as tall he thought he bade josé and antonio go on slowly before with sanchicha and dismounted walking slowly between the high stalks of grain lest he should disturb them they evidently did not hear his approach but were talking earnestly it seemed to father pedro that they had taken each others hands and as he looked cranch slipped his arm round her waist with only a blind instinct of some dreadful sacrilege in this act father pedro would have rushed forward when the girls voice struck his ear he stopped breathless it was not francisco but juanita the little mestiza  but are you sure you are not pretending to love me now as you pretended to think i was the muchacha you had run away with and lost are you sure it is not pity for the deceit you practiced upon meupon don juanupon poor father pedro  it seemed as if cranch had tried to answer with a kiss for the girl drew suddenly away from him with a coquettish fling of the black braids and whipped her little brown hands behind her  well look here said cranch with the same easy goodnatured practical directness which the priest remembered and which would have passed for philosophy in a more thoughtful man put it squarely then in the first place it was don juan and the alcalde who first suggested you might be the child  but you have said you knew it was francisco all the time interrupted juanita  i did but when i found the priest would not assist me at first and admit that the acolyte was a girl i preferred to let him think i was deceived in giving a fortune to another and leave it to his own conscience to permit it or frustrate it i was right i reckon it was pretty hard on the old man at his time of life and wrapped up as he was in the girl but at the moment he came up to the scratch like a man  and to save him you have deceived me thank you señor said the girl with a mock curtsey  i reckon i preferred to have you for a wife than a daughter said cranch if thats what you mean when you know me better juanita he continued gravely youll know that i would never have let you believe i sought in you the one if i had not hoped to find in you the other  bueno and when did you have that pretty hope  when i first saw you  and that wastwo weeks ago  a year ago juanita when francisco visited you at the rancho i followed and saw you  juanita looked at him a moment and then suddenly darted at him caught him by the lapels of his coat and shook him like a terrier  are you sure that you did not love that francisco speak she shook him again swear that you did not follow her  buti did said cranch laughing and shaking between the clenching of the little hands  judas iscariot swear you do not love her all this while  but juanita  swear  cranch swore then to father pedros intense astonishment she drew the americans face towards her own by the ears and kissed him  but you might have loved her and married a fortune said juanita after a pause  where would have been my reparationmy duty returned cranch with a laugh  reparation enough for her to have had you said juanita with that rapid disloyalty of one loving woman to another in an emergency this provoked another kiss from cranch and then juanita said demurely  but we are far from the trail let us return or we shall miss father pedro are you sure he will come  a week ago he promised to be here to see the proofs today  the voices were growing fainter and fainter they were returning to the trail  father pedro remained motionless a week ago was it a week ago sincesince what and what had he been doing here listening he father pedro listening like an idle peon to the confidences of two lovers but they had talked of him of his crime and the man had pitied him why did he not speak why did he not call after them he tried to raise his voice it sank in his throat with a horrible choking sensation the nearest heads of oats began to nod to him he felt himself swaying backward and forward he fellheavily down down down from the summit of the mountain to the floor of the mission chapel and there he lay in the dark                                       he moves  blessed saint anthony preserve him  it was antonios voice it was josés arm it was the field of wild oats the sky above his headall unchanged  what has happened said the priest feebly  a giddiness seized your reverence just now as we were coming to seek you  and you met no one  no one your reverence  father pedro passed his hand across his forehead  but who are these he said pointing to two figures who now appeared upon the trail  antonio turned  it is the americano señor cranch and his adopted daughter the mestiza juanita seeking your reverence methinks  ah said father pedro  cranch came forward and greeted the priest cordially  it was kind of you father pedro he said meaningly with a significant glance at josé and antonio to come so far to bid me and my adopted daughter farewell we depart when the tide serves but not before you partake of our hospitality in yonder cottage  father pedro gazed at cranch and then at juanita  i see he stammered but she goes not alone she will be strange at first she takes some friend perhapssome companion he continued tremulously  a very old and dear one father pedro who is waiting for us now  he led the way to a little white cottage so little and white and recent that it seemed a mere fleck of seafoam cast on the sands disposing of josé and antonio in the neighboring workshop and outbuildings he assisted the venerable sanchicha to dismount and together with father pedro and juanita entered a white palisaded enclosure beside the cottage and halted before what appeared to be a large folding trapdoor covering a slight sandy mound it was locked with a padlock beside it stood the american alcalde and don juan briones father pedro looked hastily around for another figure but it was not there  gentlemen began cranch in his practical business way i reckon you all know weve come here to identify a young lady whohe hesitatedwas lately under the care of father pedro with a foundling picked up on this shore fifteen years ago by an indian woman how this foundling came here and how i was concerned in it you all know ive told everybody here how i scrambled ashore leaving the baby in the dingy supposing it would be picked up by the boat pursuing me ive told some of you he looked at father pedro how i first discovered from one of the men three years ago that the child was not found by its father but i have never told any one before now i knew it was picked up here  i never could tell the exact locality where i came ashore for the fog was coming on as it is now but two years ago i came up with a party of gold hunters to work these sands one day digging near this creek i struck something embedded deep below the surface well gentlemen it wasnt gold but something worth more to me than gold or silver here it is  at a sign the alcalde unlocked the doors and threw them open they disclosed an irregular trench in which filled with sand lay the halfexcavated stern of a boat  it was the dingy of the trinidad gentlemen you can still read her name i found hidden away tucked under the stern sheets moldy and waterworn some clothes that i recognized to be the babys i knew then that the child had been taken away alive for some purpose and the clothes were left so that she should carry no trace with her i recognized the hand of an indian i set to work quietly i found sanchicha here she confessed to finding a baby but what she had done with it she would not at first say but since then she has declared before the alcalde that she gave it to father pedro of san carmel and that here it standsfrancisco that was francisca that it is  he stepped aside to make way for a tall girl who had approached from the cottage  father pedro had neither noticed the concluding words nor the movement of cranch his eyes were fixed upon the imbecile sanchichasanchicha of whom to render his rebuke more complete the deity seemed to have worked a miracle and restored intelligence to eye and lip he passed his hand tremblingly across his forehead and turned away when his eye fell upon the last comer  it was she the moment he had longed for and dreaded had come she stood there animated handsome filled with a hurtful consciousness in her new charms her fresh finery and the pitiable trinkets that had supplanted her scapulary and which played under her foolish fingers the past had no place in her preoccupied mind her bright eyes were full of eager anticipation of a substantial future the incarnation of a frivolous world even as she extended one hand to him in halfcoquettish embarrassment she arranged the folds of her dress with the other at the touch of her fingers he felt himself growing old and cold even the penance of parting which he had looked forward to was denied him there was no longer sympathy enough for sorrow he thought of the empty choristers robe in the little cell but not now with regret he only trembled to think of the flesh that he had once caused to inhabit it  thats all gentlemen broke in the practical voice of cranch whether there are proofs enough to make francisca the heiress of her fathers wealth the lawyers must say i reckon its enough for me that they give me the chance of repairing a wrong by taking her fathers place after all it was a mere chance  it was the will of god said father pedro solemnly  they were the last words he addressed them for when the fog had begun to creep inshore hastening their departure he only answered their farewells by a silent pressure of the hand mute lips and faroff eyes  when the sound of their laboring oars grew fainter he told antonio to lead him and sanchicha again to the buried boat there he bade her kneel beside him we will do penance here thou and i daughter he said gravely when the fog had drawn its curtain gently around the strange pair and sea and shore were blotted out he whispered tell me it was even so was it not daughter on the night she came when the distant clatter of blocks and rattle of cordage came from the unseen vessel now standing out to sea he whispered again so this is what thou didst hear even then and so during the night he marked more or less audibly to the halfconscious woman at his side the low whisper of the waves the murmur of the faroff breakers the lightening and thickening of the fog the phantoms of moving shapes and the slow coming of the dawn and when the morning sun had rent the veil over land and sea antonio and josé found him haggard but erect beside the trembling old woman with a blessing on his lips pointing to the horizon where a single sail still glimmered  va usted con dios     a bluegrass penelope   i  she was barely twentythree years old it is probable that up to that age and the beginning of this episode her life had been uneventful born to the easy mediocrity of such compensating extremes as a small farmhouse and large lands a good position and no society in that vast grazing district of kentucky known as the blue grass region all the possibilities of a western american girls existence lay before her a piano in the barewalled house the latest patented mower in the limitless meadows and a silk dress sweeping the rough floor of the unpainted meetinghouse were already the promise of those possibilities beautiful she was but the power of that beauty was limited by being equally shared with her few neighbors there were small narrow arched feet besides her own that trod the uncarpeted floors of outlying log cabins with equal grace and dignity bright clearly opened eyes that were equally capable of looking unabashed upon princes and potentates as a few later did and the heiress of the county judge read her own beauty without envy in the frank glances and unlowered crest of the blacksmiths daughter eventually she had married the male of her species a young stranger who as schoolmaster in the nearest town had utilized to some local extent a scant capital of education in obedience to the unwritten law of the west after the marriage was celebrated the doors of the ancestral home cheerfully opened and bride and bridegroom issued forth without regret and without sentiment to seek the further possibilities of a life beyond these already too familiar voices with their departure for california as mr and mrs spencer tucker the parental nest in the blue grass meadows knew them no more  they submitted with equal cheerfulness to the privations and excesses of their new conditions within three years the schoolmaster developed into a lawyer and capitalist the blue grass bride supplying a grace and ease to these transitions that were all her own she softened the abruptness of sudden wealth mitigated the austerities of newly acquired power and made the most glaring incongruity picturesque only one thing seemed to limit their progress in the region of these possibilities they were childless it was as if they had exhausted the future in their own youth leaving little or nothing for another generation to do                                       a southwesterly storm was beating against the dressingroom windows of their new house in one of the hilly suburbs of san francisco and threatening the unseasonable frivolity of the stucco ornamentation of cornice and balcony mrs tucker had been called from the contemplation of the dreary prospect without by the arrival of a visitor on entering the drawingroom she found him engaged in a half admiring half resentful examination of its new furniture and hangings mrs tucker at once recognized mr calhoun weaver a former blue grass neighbor with swift feminine intuition she also felt that his slight antagonism was likely to be transferred from her furniture to herself waiving it with the lazy amiability of southern indifference she welcomed him by the familiarity of a christian name  i reckoned that mebbee you opined old blue grass friends wouldnt naturally hitch on to them fancy doins he said glancing around the apartment to avoid her clear eyes as if resolutely setting himself against the old charm of her manner as he had against the more recent glory of her surroundings but i thought id just drop in for the sake of old times  why shouldnt you cal said mrs tucker with a frank smile  especially as im going up to sacramento tonight with some influential friends he continued with an ostentation calculated to resist the assumption of her charms and her furniture senator dyce of kentucky and his cousin judge briggs perhaps you know em or maybe spenceri mean mr tuckerdoes  i reckon said mrs tucker smiling but tell me something about the boys and girls at vineville and about yourself youre looking well and right smart too she paused to give due emphasis to this latter recognition of a huge gold chain with which her visitor was somewhat ostentatiously trifling  i didnt know as you cared to hear anything about blue grass he returned a little abashed ive been away from there some time myself he added his uneasy vanity taking fresh alarm at the faint suspicion of patronage on the part of his hostess theyre doin well though perhaps as well as some others  and youre not married yet continued mrs tucker oblivious of the innuendo ah cal she added archly i am afraid you are as fickle as ever what poor girl in vineville have you left pining  the simple face of the man before her flushed with foolish gratification at this oldfashioned ambiguous flattery now look yer belle he said chuckling if youre talking of old times and you think i bear malice agin spencer why  but mrs tucker interrupted what might have been an inopportune sentimental retrospect with a finger of arch but languid warning that will do im dying to know all about it and you must stay to dinner and tell me its right mean you cant see spencer too but he isnt back from sacramento yet  grateful as a têteàtête with his old neighbor in her more prosperous surroundings would have been if only for the sake of later gossiping about it he felt it would be inconsistent with his pride and his assumption of present business more than that he was uneasily conscious that in mrs tuckers simple and unaffected manner there was a greater superiority than he had ever noticed during their previous acquaintance he would have felt kinder to her had she shown any airs and graces which he could have commented upon and forgiven he stammered some vague excuse of preoccupation yet lingered in the hope of saying something which if not aggressively unpleasant might at least transfer to her indolent serenity some of his own irritation i reckon he said as he moved hesitatingly toward the door that spencer has made himself easy and secure in them business risks hes taking that ere alameda ditch affair theyre talking so much about is a mighty big thing rather too big if it ever got to falling back on him but i suppose hes accustomed to take risks  of course he is said mrs tucker gayly he married me  the visitor smiled feebly but was not equal to the opportunity offered for gallant repudiation but suppose you aint accustomed to risks  why not i married him said mrs tucker  mr calhoun weaver was human and succumbed to this last charming audacity he broke into a noisy but genuine laugh shook mrs tuckers hand with effusion said now thats regular blue grass and no mistake and retreated under cover of his hilarity in the hall he made a rallying stand to repeat confidentially to the servant who had overheard them blue grass all over you bet your life and opening the door was apparently swallowed up in the tempest  mrs tuckers smile kept her lips until she had returned to her room and even then languidly shone in her eyes for some minutes after as she gazed abstractedly from her window on the stormtossed bay in the distance perhaps some girlish vision of the peaceful blue grass plain momentarily usurped the prospect but it is to be doubted if there was much romance in that retrospect or that it was more interesting to her than the positive and sharply cut outlines of the practical life she now led howbeit she soon forgot this fancy in lazily watching a boat that in the teeth of the gale was beating round alcatraz island although at times a mere blank speck on the gray waste of foam a closer scrutiny showed it to be one of those lateenrigged italian fishingboats that so often flecked the distant bay lost in the sudden darkening of rain or reappearing beneath the lifted curtain of the squall she watched it weather the island and then turn its laboring but persistent course toward the open channel a rent in the indianinky sky that showed the narrowing portals of the golden gate beyond revealed as unexpectedly the destination of the little craft a tall ship that hitherto lay hidden in the mist of the saucelito shore as the distance lessened between boat and ship they were again lost in the downward swoop of another squall when it lifted the ship was creeping under the headland towards the open sea but the boat was gone mrs tucker in vain rubbed the pane with her handkerchief it had vanished meanwhile the ship as she neared the gate drew out from the protecting headland stood outlined for a moment with spars and canvas hearsed in black against the lurid rent in the horizon and then seemed to sink slowly into the heaving obscurity beyond a sudden onset of rain against the windows obliterated the remaining prospect the entrance of a servant completed the diversion  captain poindexter maam  mrs tucker lifted her pretty eyebrows interrogatively captain poindexter was a legal friend of her husband and had dined there frequently nevertheless she asked did you tell him mr tucker was not at home  yes m  did he ask for me  yes m  tell him ill be down directly  mrs tuckers quiet face did not betray the fact that this second visitor was even less interesting than the first in her heart she did not like captain poindexter with a clever womans instinct she had early detected the fact that he had a superior stronger nature than her husband as a loyal wife she secretly resented the occasional unconscious exhibition of this fact on the part of his intimate friend in their familiar intercourse added to this slight jealousy there was a certain moral antagonism between herself and the captain which none but themselves knew they were both philosophers but mrs tuckers serene and languid optimism would not tolerate the compassionate and kindhearted pessimisms of the lawyer knowing what jack poindexter does of human nature her husband had once said its mighty fine in him to be so kind and forgiving you ought to like him better belle and qualify myself to be forgiven said the lady pertly i dont see what youre driving at belle i give it up had responded the puzzled husband mrs tucker kissed his high but foolish forehead tenderly and said im glad you dont dear  meanwhile her second visitor had like the first employed the interval in a critical survey of the glories of the new furniture but with apparently more compassion than resentment in his manner once only had his expression changed over the fireplace hung a large photograph of mr spencer tucker it was retouched refined and idealized in the highest style of that polite and diplomatic art as captain poindexter looked upon the fringed hazel eyes the drooping raven mustache the clustering ringlets and the byronic full throat and turneddown collar of his friend a smile of exhausted humorous tolerance and affectionate impatience curved his lips well you are a fool arent you he apostrophized it half audibly  he was standing before the picture as she entered even in the trying contiguity of that peerless work he would have been called a finelooking man as he advanced to greet her it was evident that his military title was not one of the mere fanciful sobriquets of the locality in his erect figure and the disciplined composure of limb and attitude there were still traces of the refined academic rigors of west point the pliant adaptability of western civilization which enabled him three years before to leave the army and transfer his executive ability to the more profitable profession of the law had loosed sash and shoulderstrap but had not entirely removed the restraint of the one nor the bearing of the other  spencer is in sacramento began mrs tucker in languid explanation after the first greetings were over  i knew he was not here replied captain poindexter gently as he drew the proffered chair towards her but this is business that concerns you both he stopped and glanced upwards at the picture i suppose you know nothing of his business of course not he added reassuringly nothing absolutely nothing certainly he said this so kindly and yet so positively as if to promptly dispose of that question before going further that she assented mechanically well then hes taken some big risks in the way of business andwell things have gone bad with him you know very bad really they couldnt be worse of course it was dreadfully rash and all that he went on as if commenting upon the amusing waywardness of a child but the result is the usual smashup of everything money credit and all he laughed and added yes hes got cut offmules and baggage regularly routed and dispersed im in earnest he raised his eyebrows and frowned slightly as if to deprecate any corresponding hilarity on the part of mrs tucker or any attempt to make too light of the subject and then rising placed his hands behind his back beamed halfhumorously upon her from beneath her husbands picture and repeated thats so  mrs tucker instinctively knew that he spoke the truth and that it was impossible for him to convey it in any other than his natural manner but between the shock and the singular influence of that manner she could at first only say you dont mean it fully conscious of the utter inanity of the remark and that it seemed scarcely less coldblooded than his own  poindexter still smiling nodded  she arose with an effort she had recovered from the first shock and pride lent her a determined calmness that more than equaled poindexters easy philosophy  where is he she asked  at sea and i hope by this time where he cannot be found or followed  was her momentary glimpse of the outgoing ship a coincidence or only a vision she was confused and giddy but mastering her weakness she managed to continue in a lower voice  you have no message for me from him he told you nothing to tell me  nothing absolutely nothing replied poindexter it was as much as he could do i reckon to get fairly away before the crash came  then you did not see him go  well no said poindexter id hardly have managed things in this way he checked himself and added with a forgiving smile but he was the best judge of what he needed of course  i suppose i will hear from him she said quietly as soon as he is safe he must have had enough else to think about poor fellow  she said this so naturally and quietly that poindexter was deceived he had no idea that the collected woman before him was thinking only of solitude and darkness of her own room and madly longing to be there he said yes i dare say in quite another voice and glanced at the picture but as she remained standing he continued more earnestly i didnt come here to tell you what you might read in the newspapers tomorrow morning and what everybody might tell you before that time i want you to do something to save a fragment of your property from the ruin do you understand i want you to make a rally and bring off something in good order  for him said mrs tucker with brightening eyes  well yes of courseif you likebut as if for yourself do you know the rancho de los cuervos  i do  its almost the only bit of real property your husband hasnt sold mortgaged or pledged why it was exempt or whether only forgotten i cant say  ill tell you why said mrs tucker with a slight return of color it was the first land we ever bought and spencer always said it should be mine and he would build a new house on it  captain poindexter smiled and nodded at the picture oh he did say that did he well thats evidence but you see he never gave you the deed and by sunrise tomorrow his creditors will attach itunless  unlessrepeated mrs tucker with kindling eyes  unless continued captain poindexter they happen to find you in possession  ill go said mrs tucker  of course you will returned poindexter pleasantly only as its a big contract to take suppose we see how you can fill it its forty miles to los cuervos and you cant trust yourself to steamboat or stagecoach the steamboat left an hour ago  if i had only known this then ejaculated mrs tucker  i knew it but you had company then said poindexter with ironical gallantry and i wouldnt disturb you without saying how he knew it he continued in the stagecoach you might be recognized you must go in a private conveyance and alone even i cannot go with you for i must go on before and meet you there can you drive forty miles  mrs tucker lifted up her abstracted pretty lids i once drove fiftyat home she returned simply  good and i dare say you did it then for fun do it now for something real and personal as we lawyers say you will have relays and a plan of the road its rough weather for a pasear but all the better for that youll have less company on the road  how soon can i go she asked  the sooner the better ive arranged everything for you already he continued with a laugh come now thats a compliment to you isnt it he smiled a moment in her steadfast earnest face and then said more gravely youll do now listen  he then carefully detailed his plan there was so little of excitement or mystery in their manner that the servant who returned to light the gas never knew that the ruin and bankruptcy of the house was being told before her or that its mistress was planning her secret flight  good afternoon i will see you tomorrow then said poindexter raising his eyes to hers as the servant opened the door for him  good afternoon repeated mrs tucker quietly answering his look you need not light the gas in my room mary she continued in the same tone of voice as the door closed upon him i shall lie down for a few moments and then i may run over to the robinsons for the evening  she regained her room composedly the longing desire to bury her head in her pillow and think out her position had gone she did not apostrophize her fate she did not weep few real women do in the access of calamity or when there is anything else to be done she felt that she knew it all she believed she had sounded the profoundest depths of the disaster and seemed already so old in her experience that she almost fancied she had been prepared for it perhaps she did not fully appreciate it to a life like hers it was only an incident the mere turning of a page of the illimitable book of youth the breaking up of what she now felt had become a monotony in fact she was not quite sure she had ever been satisfied with their present success had it brought her all she expected she wanted to say this to her husband not only to comfort him poor fellow but that they might come to a better understanding of life in the future she was not perhaps different from other loving women who believing in this unattainable goal of matrimony have sought it in the various episodes of fortune or reverses in the bearing of children or the loss of friends in her childless experience there was no other life that had taken root in her circumstances and might suffer transplantation only she and her husband could lose or profit by the change the perfect understanding would come under other conditions than these  she would have gone superstitiously to the window to gaze in the direction of the vanished ship but another instinct restrained her she would put aside all yearning for him until she had done something to help him and earned the confidence he seemed to have withheld perhaps it was prideperhaps she never really believed his exodus was distant or complete  with a full knowledge that tomorrow the various ornaments and pretty trifles around her would be in the hands of the law she gathered only a few necessaries for her flight and some familiar personal trinkets i am constrained to say that this selfabnegation was more fastidious than moral she had no more idea of the ethics of bankruptcy than any other charming woman she simply did not like to take with her any contagious memory of the chapter of the life just closing she glanced around the home she was leaving without a lingering regret there was no sentiment of tradition or custom that might be destroyed her roots lay too near the surface to suffer dislocation the happiness of her childless union had depended upon no domestic center nor was its flame sacred to any local hearthstone it was without a sigh that when night had fully fallen she slipped unnoticed down the staircase at the door of the drawingroom she paused and then entered with the first guilty feeling of shame she had known that evening looking stealthily around she mounted a chair before her husbands picture kissed the irreproachable mustache hurriedly said you foolish darling you and slipped out again with this touching indorsement of the views of a rival philosopher she closed the door softly and left her home forever   ii  the wind and rain had cleared the unfrequented suburb of any observant lounger and the darkness lit only by farspaced gusty lamps hid her hastening figure she had barely crossed the second street when she heard the quick clatter of hoofs behind her a buggy drove up to the curbstone and poindexter leaped out she entered quickly but for a moment he still held the reins of the impatient horse hes rather fresh he said eying her keenly are you sure you can manage him  give me the reins she said simply  he placed them in the two firm wellshaped hands that reached from the depths of the vehicle and was satisfied yet he lingered  its rough work for a lone woman he said almost curtly i cant go with you but speak frankly is there any man you know whom you can trust well enough to take its not too late yet think a moment  he paused over the buttoning of the leather apron of the vehicle  no there is none answered the voice from the interior and its better so is all ready  one moment more he had recovered his half bantering manner you have a friend and countryman already with you do you know your horse is blue grass goodnight  with these words ringing in her ears she began her journey the horse as if eager to maintain the reputation which his native district had given his race as well as the race of the pretty woman behind him leaped impatiently forward but pulled together by the fine and firm fingers that seemed to guide rather than check his exuberance he presently struck into the long swinging pace of his kind and kept it throughout without break or acceleration over the paved streets the light buggy rattled and the slender shafts danced around his smooth barrel but when they touched the level high road horse and vehicle slipped forward through the night a swift and noiseless phantom mrs tucker could see his graceful back dimly rising and falling before her with tireless rhythm and could feel the intelligent pressure of his mouth until it seemed the responsive grasp of a powerful but kindly hand the faint glow of conquest came to her cold cheek the slight stirrings of pride moved her preoccupied heart a soft light filled her hazel eyes a desolate woman bereft of husband and home and flying through storm and night she knew not where she still leaned forward towards her horse was he blue grass then dear old boy she gently cooed at him in the darkness he evidently was and responded by blowing her an ostentatious equine kiss and he would be good to his own forsaken belle she murmured caressingly and wouldnt let any one harm her but here overcome by the lazy witchery of her voice he shook his head so violently that mrs tucker after the fashion of her sex had the double satisfaction of demurely restraining the passion she had evoked  to avoid the more traveled thoroughfare while the evening was still early it had been arranged that she should at first take a less direct but less frequented road this was a famous pleasuredrive from san francisco a graveled and sanded stretch of eight miles to the sea and an ultimate cocktail in a stately pleasuredome decreed among the surf and rocks of the pacific shore it was deserted now and left to the unobstructed sweep of the wind and rain mrs tucker would not have chosen this road with the instinctive jealousy of a bucolic inland race born by great rivers she did not like the sea and again the dim and dreary waste tended to recall the vision connected with her husbands flight upon which she had resolutely shut her eyes but when she had reached it the road suddenly turned following the trend of the beach and she was exposed to the full power of its dread fascinations the combined roar of sea and shore was in her ears as the direct force of the gale had compelled her to furl the protecting hood of the buggy to keep the light vehicle from oversetting or drifting to leeward she could no longer shut out the heaving chaos on the right from which the pallid ghosts of dead and dying breakers dimly rose and sank as if in awful salutation at times through the darkness a white sheet appeared spread before the path and beneath the wheels of the buggy which when withdrawn with a reluctant hiss seemed striving to drag the exhausted beach seaward with it but the blind terror of her horse who swerved at every sweep of the surge shamed her own half superstitious fears and with the effort to control his alarm she regained her own selfpossession albeit with eyelashes wet not altogether with the salt spray from the sea this was followed by a reaction perhaps stimulated by her victory over the beaten animal when for a time she knew not how long she felt only a mad sense of freedom and power oblivious of even her sorrows her lost home and husband and with intense feminine consciousness she longed to be a man she was scarcely aware that the track turned again inland until the beat of the horses hoofs on the firm ground and an acceleration of speed showed her she had left the beach and the mysterious sea behind her and she remembered that she was near the end of the first stage of her journey half an hour later the twinkling lights of the roadside inn where she was to change horses rose out of the darkness  happily for her the hostler considered the horse who had a local reputation of more importance than the unknown muffled figure in the shadow of the unfurled hood and confined his attention to the animal after a careful examination of his feet and a few comments addressed solely to the superior creation he led him away mrs tucker would have liked to part more affectionately from her fourfooted compatriot and felt a sudden sense of loneliness at the loss of her new friend but a recollection of certain cautions of captain poindexters kept her mute nevertheless the hostlers ostentatious adjuration of now then arent you going to bring out that mustang for the señora puzzled her it was not until the fresh horse was put to and she had flung a piece of gold into the attendants hand that the gracias of his unmistakable saxon speech revealed to her the reason of the lawyers caution poindexter had evidently represented her to these people as a native californian who did not speak english in her inconsistency her blood took fire at this first suggestion of deceit and burned in her face why should he try to pass her off as anybody else why should she not use her own her husbands name she stopped and bit her lip  it was but the beginning of an uneasy train of thought she suddenly found herself thinking of her visitor calhoun weaver and not pleasantly he would hear of their ruin tomorrow perhaps of her own flight he would remember his visit and what would he think of her deceitful frivolity would he believe that she was then ignorant of the failure it was her first sense of any accountability to others than herself but even then it was rather owing to an uneasy consciousness of what her husband must feel if he were subjected to the criticisms of men like calhoun she wondered if others knew that he had kept her in ignorance of his flight did poindexter know it or had he only entrapped her into the admission why had she not been clever enough to make him think that she knew it already for the moment she hated poindexter for sharing that secret yet this was again followed by a new impatience of her husbands want of insight into her ability to help him of course the poor fellow could not bear to worry her could not bear to face such men as calhoun or even poindexter she added exultingly to herself but he might have sent her a line as he fled only to prepare her to meet and combat the shame alone it did not occur to her unsophisticated singleness of nature that she was accepting as an error of feeling what the world would call cowardly selfishness  at midnight the storm lulled and a few stars trembled through the rent clouds her eyes had become accustomed to the darkness and her country instincts a little overlaid by the urban experiences of the last few years came again to the surface she felt the fresh cool radiation from outlying upturned fields the faint sad odors from dim stretches of pricking grain and quickening leaf and wondered if at los cuervos it might be possible to reproduce the peculiar verdure of her native district she beguiled her fancy by an ambitious plan of retrieving their fortunes by farming her comfortable tastes had lately rebelled against the homeless mechanical cultivation of these desolate but teeming californian acres and for a moment indulged in a vision of a vineclad cottage home that in any other woman would have been sentimental her cramped limbs aching she took advantage of the security of the darkness and the familiar contiguity of the fields to get down from the vehicle gather her skirts together and run at the head of the mustang until her chill blood was thawed night drawing a modest veil over this charming revelation of the nymph and woman but the sudden shadow of a coyote checked the scouring feet of this swift camilla and sent her back precipitately to the buggy nevertheless she was refreshed and able to pursue her journey until the cold gray of early morning found her at the end of her second stage  her route was changed again from the main highway rendered dangerous by the approach of day and the contiguity of the neighboring rancheros the road was rough and hilly her new horse and vehicle in keeping with the rudeness of the routeby far the most difficult of her whole journey the rare wagon tracks that indicated her road were often scarcely discernible at times they led her through openings in the halfcleared woods skirted suspicious morasses painfully climbed the smooth domelike hills or wound along perilous slopes at a dangerous angle twice she had to alight and cling to the sliding wheels on one of those treacherous inclines or drag them from impending ruts or immovable mire in the growing light she could distinguish the distant lowlying marshes eaten by encroaching sloughs and insidious channels and beyond them the faint gray waste of the lower bay a darker peninsula in the marsh she knew to be the extreme boundary of her future home the rancho de los cuervos in another hour she began to descend to the plain and once more to approach the main road which now ran nearly parallel with her track she scanned it cautiously for any early traveler it stretched north and south in apparent unending solitude she struck into it boldly and urged her horse to the top of his speed until she reached the crossroad that led to the rancho but here she paused and allowed the reins to drop idly on the mustangs back a singular and unaccountable irresolution seized her the difficulties of her journey were over the rancho lay scarcely two miles away she had achieved the most important part of her task in the appointed time but she hesitated what had she come for she tried to recall poindexters words even her own enthusiasm but in vain she was going to take possession of her husbands property she knew that was all but the means she had taken seemed now so exaggerated and mysterious for that simple end that she began to dread an impending something or some vague danger she had not considered that she was rushing blindly to meet full of this strange feeling she almost mechanically stopped her horse as she entered the crossroad  from this momentary hesitation a singular sound aroused her it seemed at first like the swift hurrying by of some viewless courier of the air the vague alarm of some invisible flying herald or like the inarticulate cry that precedes a storm it seemed to rise and fall around her as if with some changing urgency of purpose raising her eyes she suddenly recognized the two farstretching lines of telegraph wire above her head and knew the aeolian cry of the morning wind along its vibrating chords but it brought another and more practical fear to her active brain perhaps even now the telegraph might be anticipating her had poindexter thought of that she hesitated no longer but laying the whip on the back of her jaded mustang again hurried forward  as the level horizon grew more distinct her attention was attracted by the white sail of a small boat lazily threading the sinuous channel of the slough it might be poindexter arriving by the more direct route from the steamboat that occasionally laid off the ancient embarcadero of the los cuervos rancho but even while watching it her quick ear caught the sound of galloping hoofs behind her she turned quickly and saw she was followed by a horseman but her momentary alarm was succeeded by a feeling of relief as she recognized the erect figure and square shoulders of poindexter yet she could not help thinking that he looked more like a militant scout and less like a cautious legal adviser than ever  with unaffected womanliness she rearranged her slightly disordered hair as he drew up beside her i thought you were in yonder boat she said  not i he laughed i distanced you by the highroad two hours and have been reconnoitering until i saw you hesitate at the crossroads  but who is in the boat asked mrs tucker partly to hide her embarrassment  only some early chinese market gardener i dare say but you are safe now you are on your own land you passed the boundary monument of the rancho five minutes ago look all you see before you is yours from the embarcadero to yonder coast range  the tone of half raillery did not however cheer mrs tucker she shuddered slightly and cast her eyes over the monotonous sea of tule and meadow  it doesnt look pretty perhaps continued poindexter but its the richest land in the state and the embarcadero will some day be a town i suppose youll call it blue grassville but you seem tired he said suddenly dropping his voice to a tone of half humorous sympathy  mrs tucker managed to get rid of an impending tear under the pretense of clearing her eyes are we nearly there she asked  nearly you know he added with the same half mischievous half sympathizing gayety its not exactly a palace youre coming tohardly its the old casa that has been deserted for years but i thought it better you should go into possession there than take up your abode at the shanty where your husbands farmhands are no one will know when you take possession of the casa while the very hour of your arrival at the shanty would be known and if they should make any trouble  if they should make any trouble repeated mrs tucker lifting her frank inquiring eyes to poindexter  his horse suddenly rearing from an apparently accidental prick of the spur it was a minute or two before he was able to explain i mean if this ever comes up as a matter of evidence you know but here we are  what had seemed to be an overgrown mound rising like an island out of the dead level of the grassy sea now resolved itself into a collection of adobe walls eaten and incrusted with shrubs and vines that bore some resemblance to the usual uninhabitedlooking exterior of a spanishamerican dwelling apertures that might have been lanceshaped windows or only cracks and fissures in the walls were choked up with weeds and grass and gave no passing glimpse of the interior entering a ruinous corral they came to a second entrance which proved to be the patio or courtyard the deserted wooden corridor with beams rafters and floors whitened by the sun and wind contained a few withered leaves dryly rotting skins and thongs of leather as if undisturbed by human care but among these scattered débris of former life and habitation there was no noisome or unclean suggestion of decay a faint spiced odor of desiccation filled the bare walls there was no slime on stone or sundried brick in place of fungus or discolored moisture the dust of efflorescence whitened in the obscured corners the elements had picked clean the bones of the old and crumbling tenement ere they should finally absorb it  a withered old peon woman who in dress complexion and fibrous hair might have been an animated fragment of the débris rustled out of a low vaulted passage and welcomed them with a feeble crepitation following her into the dim interior mrs tucker was surprised to find some slight attempt at comfort and even adornment in the two or three habitable apartments they were scrupulously clean and dry two qualities which in her feminine eyes atoned for poverty of material  i could not send anything from san bruno the nearest village without attracting attention explained poindexter but if you can manage to picnic here for a day longer ill get one of our chinese friends here he pointed to the slough to bring over for his return cargo from across the bay any necessaries you may want there is no danger of his betraying you he added with an ironical smile chinamen and indians are by an ingenious provision of the statute of california incapable of giving evidence against a white person you can trust your handmaiden perfectlyeven if she cant trust you that is your sacred privilege under the constitution and now as i expect to catch the up boat ten miles from hence i must say goodby until tomorrow night i hope to bring you then some more definite plans for the future the worst is over he held her hand for a moment and with a graver voice continued you have done it very welldo you knowvery well  in the slight embarrassment produced by his sudden change of manner she felt that her thanks seemed awkward and restrained dont thank me he laughed with a prompt return of his former levity thats my trade i only advised you have saved yourself like a plucky womanshall i say like blue grass goodby he mounted his horse but as if struck by an afterthought wheeled and drew up by her side again if i were you i wouldnt see many strangers for a day or two and listen to as little news as a woman possibly can he laughed again waved her a half gallant half military salute and was gone the question she had been trying to frame regarding the probability of communication with her husband remained unasked at least she had saved her pride before him  addressing herself to the care of her narrow household she mechanically put away the few things she had brought with her and began to read just the scant furniture she was a little discomposed at first at the absence of bolts locks and even windowfastenings until assured by conchas evident inability to comprehend her concern that they were quite unknown at los cuervos her slight knowledge of spanish was barely sufficient to make her wants known so that the relief of conversation with her only companion was debarred her and she was obliged to content herself with the sapless crackling smiles and withered genuflexions that the old woman dropped like dead leaves in her path it was staring noon when the house singing like an empty shell in the monotonous wind she felt she could stand the solitude no longer and crossing the glaring patio and whistling corridor made her way to the open gateway  but the view without seemed to intensify her desolation the broad expanse of the shadowless plain reached apparently to the coast range trackless and unbroken save by one or two clusters of dwarfed oaks which at that distance were but mossy excrescences on the surface barely raised above the dead level on the other side the marsh took up the monotony and carried it scarcely interrupted by undefined watercourses to the faintly markedout horizon line of the remote bay scattered and apparently motionless black spots on the meadows that gave a dreary significance to the title of the crows which the rancho bore and sudden gray clouds of sandpipers on the marshes that rose and vanished down the wind were the only signs of life even the white sail of the early morning was gone  she stood there until the aching of her straining eyes and the stiffening of her limbs in the cold wind compelled her to seek the sheltered warmth of the courtyard here she endeavored to make friends with a brighteyed lizard who was sunning himself in the corridor a graceful little creature in blue and gold from whom she felt at other times she might have fled but whose beauty and harmlessness solitude had made known to her with misplaced kindness she tempted it with breadcrumbs with no other effect than to stiffen it into stony astonishment she wondered if she should become like the prisoners she had read of in books who poured out their solitary affections on noisome creatures and she regretted even the mustang which with the buggy had disappeared under the charge of some unknown retainer on her arrival was she not a prisoner the shutterless windows yawning doors and open gate refuted the suggestion but the encompassing solitude and trackless waste still held her captive poindexter had told her it was four miles to the shanty she might walk there why had she given her word that she would remain at the rancho until he returned  the long day crept monotonously away and she welcomed the night which shut out the dreary prospect but it brought no cessation of the harassing wind without nor surcease of the nervous irritation its perpetual and even activity wrought upon her it haunted her pillow even in her exhausted sleep and seemed to impatiently beckon her to rise and follow it it brought her feverish dreams of her husband footsore and weary staggering forward under its pitiless lash and clamorous outcry she would have gone to his assistance but when she reached his side and held out her arms to him it hurried her past with merciless power and bearing her away left him hopelessly behind it was broad day when she awoke the usual night showers of the waning rainy season had left no trace in sky or meadow the fervid morning sun had already dried the patio only the restless harrying wind remained  mrs tucker arose with a resolve she had learned from concha on the previous evening that a part of the shanty was used as a tienda or shop for the laborers and rancheros under the necessity of purchasing some articles she would go there and for a moment mingle with those people who would not recognize her even if they did her instinct told her it would be less to be feared than the hopeless uncertainty of another day as she left the house the wind seemed to seize her as in her dream and hurry her along with it until in a few moments the walls of the low casa sank into the earth again and she was alone but for the breeze on the solitary plain the level distance glittered in the sharp light a few crows with slant wings dipped and ran down the wind before her and a passing gleam on the marsh was explained by the faroff cry of a curlew  she had walked for an hour upheld by the stimulus of light and morning air when the cluster of scrub oaks which was her destination opened enough to show two rambling sheds before one of which was a wooden platform containing a few barrels and bones as she approached nearer she could see that one or two horses were tethered under the trees that their riders were lounging by a horsetrough and that over an open door the word tienda was rudely painted on a board and as rudely illustrated by the wares displayed at door and window accustomed as she was to the poverty of frontier architecture even the crumbling walls of the old hacienda she had just left seemed picturesque to the rigid angles of the thin blank unpainted shell before her one of the loungers who was reading a newspaper aloud as she advanced put it aside and stared at her there was an evident commotion in the shop as she stepped upon the platform and when she entered with breathless lips and beating heart she found herself the object of a dozen curious eyes her quick pride resented the scrutiny and recalled her courage and it was with a slight coldness in her usual lazy indifference that she leaned over the counter and asked for the articles she wanted  the request was followed by a dead silence mrs tucker repeated it with some hauteur  i reckon you dont seem to know this store is in the hands of the sheriff said one of the loungers  mrs tucker was not aware of it  well i dont know any one whos a better right to know than spence tuckers wife said another with a coarse laugh the laugh was echoed by the others mrs tucker saw the pit into which she had deliberately walked but did not flinch  is there any one to serve here she asked turning her clear eyes full upon the bystanders  youd better ask the sheriff he was the last one to sarve here he sarved an attachment replied the inevitable humorist of all californian assemblages  is he here asked mrs tucker disregarding the renewed laughter which followed this subtle witticism  the loungers at the door made way for one of their party who was half dragged half pushed into the shop here he is said half a dozen eager voices in the fond belief that his presence might impart additional humor to the situation he cast a deprecating glance at mrs tucker and said its so madam this yer place is attached but if theres anything youre wanting why i reckon boyshe turned half appealingly to the crowd we could oblige a lady there was a vague sound of angry opposition and remonstrance from the back door of the shop but the majority partly overcome by mrs tuckers beauty assented only continued the officer explanatorily ez these yer goods are in the hands of the creditors they ought to be represented by an equivalent in money if youre expecting they should be charged  but i wish to pay for them interrupted mrs tucker with a slight flush of indignation i have the money  oh i bet you have screamed a voice as overturning all opposition the malcontent at the back door in the shape of an infuriated woman forced her way into the shop ill bet you have the money look at her boys look at the wife of the thief with the stolen money in diamonds in her ears and rings on her fingers shes got money if weve none she can pay for what she fancies if we havent a cent to redeem the bed thats stolen from under us oh yes buy it all mrs spencer tucker buy the whole shop mrs spencer tucker do you hear and if you aint satisfied then buy my clothes my wedding ring the only things your husband hasnt stolen  i dont understand you said mrs tucker coldly turning towards the door but with a flying leap across the counter her relentless adversary stood between her and retreat  you dont understand perhaps you dont understand that your husband not only stole the hard labor of these men but even the little money they brought here and trusted to his thieving hands perhaps you dont know that he stole my husbands hard earnings mortgaged these very goods you want to buy and that he is today a convicted thief a forger and a runaway coward perhaps if you cant understand me you can read the newspaper look she exultingly opened the paper the sheriff had been reading aloud and pointed to the displayed headlines look there are the very words forgery swindling embezzlement do you see and perhaps you cant understand this look shameful flight abandons his wife runs off with a notorious  easy old gal easy now dn it will you dry up i say stop  it was too late the sheriff had dashed the paper from the womans hand but not until mrs tucker had read a single line a line such as she had sometimes turned from with weary scorn in her careless perusal of the daily shameful chronicle of domestic infelicity then she had coldly wondered if there could be any such men and women and now the crowd fell back before her even the virago was silenced as she looked at her face the humorists face was as white but not as immobile as he gasped christ if i dont believe she knew nothin of it  for a moment the full force of such a supposition with all its poignancy its dramatic intensity and its pathos possessed the crowd in the momentary clairvoyance of enthusiasm they caught a glimpse of the truth and by one of the strange reactions of human passion they only waited for a word of appeal or explanation from her lips to throw themselves at her feet had she simply told her story they would have believed her had she cried fainted or gone into hysterics they would have pitied her she did neither perhaps she thought of neither or indeed of anything that was then before her eyes she walked erect to the door and turned upon the threshold i mean what i say she said calmly i dont understand you but whatever just claims you have upon my husband will be paid by me or by his lawyer captain poindexter  she had lost the sympathy but not the respect of her hearers they made way for her with sullen deference as she passed out on the platform but her adversary profiting by the last opportunity burst into an ironical laugh  captain poindexter is it well perhaps hes safe to pay your bill but as for your husbands  thats another matter interrupted a familiar voice with the greatest cheerfulness thats what you were going to say wasnt it ha ha well mrs patterson continued poindexter stepping from his buggy you never spoke a truer word in your lifeone moment mrs tucker let me send you back in the buggy dont mind me i can get a fresh horse of the sheriff im quite at home here then turning to one of the bystanders i say patterson step a few paces this way will you a little further from your wife please that will do youve got a claim of five thousand dollars against the property havent you  yes  well that woman just driving away is your one solitary chance of getting a cent of it if your wife insults her again that chance is gone and if you do  well  as sure as there is a god in israel and a supreme court of the state of california ill kill you in your tracks stay  patterson turned the irrepressible look of humorous tolerance of all human frailty had suffused poindexters black eyes with mischievous moisture if you think it quite safe to confide to your wife this prospect of her improvement by widowhood you may   iii  mr patterson did not inform his wife of the lawyers personal threat to himself but he managed after poindexter had left to make her conscious that mrs tucker might be a power to be placated and feared youve shot off your mouth at her he said argumentatively and whether youve hit the mark or not youve had your say ef you think its worth a possible five thousand dollars and interest to keep on heave ahead ef you rather have the chance of getting the rest in cash youll let up on her you dont suppose returned mrs patterson contemptuously that shes got anything but what that man of herspoindexterlets her have the sheriff says retorted patterson surlily that shes notified him that she claims the rancho as a gift from her husband three years ago and shes in possession now and was so when the execution was out it dont make no matter he added with gloomy philosophy whos got a full hand as long as we aint got the cards to chip in i wouldnt a minded it he continued meditatively ef spence tucker had dropped a hint to me afore he put out and i suppose said mrs patterson angrily youd have put out too i reckon said patterson simply  twice or thrice during the evening he referred more or less directly to this lack of confidence shown by his late debtor and employer and seemed to feel it more keenly than the loss of property he confided his sentiments quite openly to the sheriff in possession over the whiskey and euchre with which these gentlemen avoided the difficulties of their delicate relations he brooded over it as he handed the keys of the shop to the sheriff when they parted for the night and was still thinking of it when the house was closed everybody gone to bed and he was fetching a fresh jug of water from the well the moon was at times obscured by flying clouds the avantcouriers of the regular evening shower he was stooping over the well when he sprang suddenly to his feet again whos there he demanded sharply  hush said a voice so low and faint it might have been a whisper of the wind in the palisades of the corral but indistinct as it was it was the voice of a man he was thinking of as far away and it sent a thrill of alternate awe and pleasure through his pulses  he glanced quickly round the moon was hidden by a passing cloud and only the faint outlines of the house he had just quitted were visible is that you spence he said tremulously  yes replied the voice and a figure dimly emerged from the corner of the corral  lay low lay low for gods sake said patterson hurriedly throwing himself upon the apparition the sheriff and his posse are in there  but i must speak to you a moment said the figure  wait said patterson glancing toward the building its blank shutterless windows revealed no inner light a profound silence encompassed it come quick he whispered letting his grasp slip down to the unresisting hand of the stranger he half dragged half led him brushing against the wall into the open door of the deserted barroom he had just quitted locked the inner door poured a glass of whiskey from a decanter gave it to him and then watched him drain it at a single draught  the moon came out and falling through the bare windows full upon the strangers face revealed the artistic but slightly disheveled curls and mustache of the fugitive spencer tucker  whatever may have been the real influence of this unfortunate man upon his fellows it seemed to find expression in a singular unanimity of criticism patterson looked at him with a half dismal half welcoming smile well you are a hll of a fellow aint you  spencer tucker passed his hand through his hair and lifted it from his forehead with a gesture at once emotional and theatrical i am a man with a price on me he said bitterly give me up to the sheriff and youll get five thousand dollars help me and youll get nothing thats my dd luck and yours too i suppose  i reckon youre right there said patterson gloomily but i thought you got clean awaywent off in a ship  went off in a boat to a ship interrupted tucker savagely went off to a ship that had all my things on boardeverything the cursed boat capsized in a squall just off the heads the ship dn her sailed away the men thinking i was drowned likely and that theyd make a good thing off my goods i reckon  but the girl inez who was with you didnt she make a row  quien sabe returned tucker with a reckless laugh well i hung on like grim death to that boats keel until one of those chinese fishermen in a dugout hauled me in opposite saucelito i chartered him and his dugout to bring me down here  why here asked patterson with a certain ostentatious caution that ill concealed his pensive satisfaction  you may well ask returned tucker with an equal ostentation of bitterness as he slightly waved his companion away but i reckoned i could trust a white man that id been kind to and who wouldnt go back on me no no let me go hand me over to the sheriff  patterson had suddenly grasped both the hands of the picturesque scamp before him with an affection that for an instant almost shamed the man who had ruined him but tuckers egotism whispered that this affection was only a recognition of his own superiority and felt flattered he was beginning to believe that he was really the injured party  what i have and what i have had is yours spence returned patterson with a sad and simple directness that made any further discussion a gratuitous insult i only wanted to know what you reckoned to do here  i want to get over across the coast range to monterey said tucker once there one of those coasting schooners will bring me down to acapulco where the ship will put in  patterson remained silent for a moment theres a mustang in the corral you can takeleastways i shant know that its goneuntil tomorrow afternoon in an hour from now he added looking from the window these clouds will settle down to business it will rain there will be light enough for you to find your way by the regular trail over the mountain but not enough for any one to know you if you cant push through tonight you can lie over at the posada on the summit them greasers that keep it wont know you and if they did they wont go back on you and if they did go back on you nobody would believe them its mighty curious he added with gloomy philosophy but i reckon its the reason why providence allows this kind of cattle to live among white men and others made in his image take a piece of pie wont you he continued abandoning this abstract reflection and producing half a flat pumpkin pie from the bar spencer tucker grasped the pie with one hand and his friends fingers with the other and for a few moments was silent from the hurried deglutition of viand and sentiment youre a white man patterson any way he resumed ill take your horse and put it down in our account at your own figure as soon as this cursed thing is blown over ill be back here and see you through you bet i dont desert my friends however rough things go with me  i see you dont returned patterson with an unconscious and serious simplicity that had the effect of the most exquisite irony i was only just saying to the sheriff that if there was anything i could have done for you you wouldnt have cut away without letting me know tucker glanced uneasily at patterson who continued ye aint wanting anything else then observing that his former friend and patron was roughly but newly clothed and betrayed no trace of his last escapade he added i see youve got a fresh harness  that dd chinaman bought me these at the landing theyre not much in style or fit he continued trying to get a moonlight view of himself in the mirror behind the bar but that dont matter here he filled another glass of spirits jauntily settled himself back in his chair and added i dont suppose there are any girls around anyway  cept your wife she was down here this afternoon said patterson meditatively  mr tucker paused with the pie in his hand ah yes he essayed a reckless laugh but that evident simulation failed before pattersons melancholy with an assumption of falling in with his friends manner rather than from any personal anxiety he continued well  that man poindexter was down here with her put her in the hacienda to hold possession afore the news came out  impossible said tucker rising hastily it dont belongthat ishe hesitated  yer thinking the creditorsll get it mebbe returned patterson gazing at the floor not as long as shes in it no sir whether its really hers or shes only keeping house for poindexter shes a fixture you bet they are a team when they pull together they are  the smile slowly faded from tuckers face that now looked quite rigid in the moonlight he put down his glass and walked to the window as patterson gloomily continued but thats nothing to you youve got ahead of em both and had your revenge by going off with the gal thats what i said all along when folksspecially women folkswondered how you could leave a woman like your wife and go off with a scallawag like that gal i allers said theyd find out there was a reason and when your wife came flaunting down here with poindexter before shed quite got quit of you i reckon they began to see the whole little game no sir i knew it wasnt on account of the gal why when you came here tonight and told me quite natrallike and easy how she went off in the ship and then calmly ate your pie and drank your whiskey after it i knew you didnt care for her theres my hand spence youre a trump even if you are a little looney eh why whats up  shallow and selfish as tucker was pattersons words seemed like a revelation that shocked him as profoundly as it might have shocked a nobler nature the simple vanity and selfishness that made him unable to conceive any higher reason for his wifes loyalty than his own personal popularity and success now that he no longer possessed that éclat made him equally capable of the lowest suspicions he was a dishonored fugitive broken in fortune and reputationwhy should she not desert him he had been unfaithful to her from wildness from caprice from the effect of those fascinating qualities it seemed to him natural that she should be disloyal from more deliberate motives and he hugged himself with that belief yet there was enough doubt enough of haunting suspicion that he had lost or alienated a powerful affection to make him thoroughly miserable he returned his friends grasp convulsively and buried his face upon his shoulder but he was above feeling a certain exultation in the effect of his misery upon the doglike unreasoning affection of patterson nor could he entirely refrain from slightly posing his affliction before that sympathetic but melancholy man suddenly he raised his head drew back and thrust his hand into his bosom with a theatrical gesture  whats to keep me from killing poindexter in his tracks he said wildly  nothin but his shooting first returned patterson with dismal practicality hes mighty quick like all them army men its about even i reckon that he dont get me first he added in an ominous voice  no returned tucker grasping his hand again this is not your affair patterson leave him to me when i come back  if he ever gets the drop on me i reckon he wont wait continued patterson lugubriously he seems to object to my passin criticism on your wife as if she was a queen or an angel  the blood came to spencers cheek and he turned uneasily to the window its dark enough now for a start he said hurriedly and if i could get across the mountain without lying over at the summit it would be a day gained  patterson arose without a word filled a flask of spirit handed it to his friend and silently led the way through the slowly falling rain and the now settled darkness the mustang was quickly secured and saddled a heavy poncho afforded tucker a disguise as well as a protection from the rain with a few hurried disconnected words and an abstracted air he once more shook his friends hand and issued cautiously from the corral when out of earshot from the house he put spurs to the mustang and dashed into a gallop  to intersect the mountain road he was obliged to traverse part of the highway his wife had walked that afternoon and to pass within a mile of the casa where she was long before he reached that point his eyes were straining the darkness in that direction for some indication of the house which was to him familiar becoming now accustomed to the even obscurity less trying to the vision than the alternate light and shadow of cloud or the full glare of the moonlight he fancied he could distinguish its low walls over the monotonous level one of those impulses which had so often taken the place of resolution in his character suddenly possessed him to diverge from his course and approach the house why he could not have explained it was not from any feeling of jealous suspicion or contemplated revengethat had passed with the presence of patterson it was not from any vague lingering sentiment for the woman he had wrongedhe would have shrunk from meeting her at that moment but it was full of these and more possibilities by which he might or might not be guided and was at least a movement towards some vague end and a distraction from certain thoughts he dared not entertain and could not entirely dismiss inconceivable and inexplicable to human reason it might have been acceptable to the divine omniscience for its predestined result  he left the road at a point where the marsh encroached upon the meadow familiar to him already as near the spot where he had debarked from the chinamans boat the day before he remembered that the walls of the hacienda were distinctly visible from the tules where he had hidden all day and he now knew that the figures he had observed near the building which had deterred his first attempts at landing must have been his wife and his friend he knew that a long tongue of the slough filled by the rising tide followed the marsh and lay between him and the hacienda the sinking of his horses hoofs in the spongy soil determined its proximity and he made a detour to the right to avoid it in doing so a light suddenly rose above the distant horizon ahead of him trembled faintly and then burned with a steady lustre it was a light at the hacienda guiding his horse half abstractedly in this direction his progress was presently checked by the splashing of the animals hoofs in the water but the turf below was firm and a salt drop that had spattered to his lips told him that it was only the encroaching of the tide in the meadow with his eyes on the light he again urged his horse forward the rain lulled the clouds began to break the landscape alternately lightened and grew dark the outlines of the crumbling hacienda walls that enshrined the light grew more visible a strange and dreamy resemblance to the long bluegrass plain before his wifes paternal house as seen by him during his evening rides to courtship pressed itself upon him he remembered too that she used to put a light in the window to indicate her presence following this retrospect the moon came boldly out sparkled upon the overflow of silver at his feet seemed to show the dark opaque meadow beyond for a moment and then disappeared it was dark now but the lesser earthly star still shone before him as a guide and pushing towards it he passed in the allembracing shadow   iv  as mrs tucker erect white and rigid drove away from the tienda it seemed to her to sink again into the monotonous plain with all its horrible realities except that there was now a new and heartbreaking significance to the solitude and loneliness of the landscape all that had passed might have been a dream but as the blood came back to her cheek and little by little her tingling consciousness returned it seemed as if her life had been the dream and this last scene the awakening reality with eyes smarting with the moisture of shame the scarlet blood at times dyeing her very neck and temples she muffled her lowered crest in her shawl and bent over the reins bit by bit she recalled in poindexters mysterious caution and strange allusions the corroboration of her husbands shame and her own disgrace this was why she was brought hitherthe deserted wife the abandoned confederate the mocking glitter of the concave vault above her scoured by the incessant wind the cold stare of the shining pools beyond the hard outlines of the coast range and the jarring accompaniment of her horses hoofs and rattling buggywheels alternately goaded and distracted her she found herself repeating no no no with the dogged reiteration of fever she scarcely knew when or how she reached the hacienda she was only conscious that as she entered the patio the dusky solitude that had before filled her with unrest now came to her like balm a benumbing peace seemed to fall from the crumbling walls the peace of utter seclusion isolation oblivion death nevertheless an hour later when the jingle of spurs and bridle were again heard in the road she started to her feet with bent brows and a kindling eye and confronted captain poindexter in the corridor  i would not have intruded upon you so soon again he said gravely but i thought i might perhaps spare you a repetition of the scene of this morning hear me out please he added with a gentle half deprecating gesture as she lifted the beautiful scorn of her eyes to his i have just heard that your neighbor don josé santierra of los gatos is on his way to this house he once claimed this land and hated your husband who bought of the rival claimant whose grant was confirmed i tell you this he added slightly flushing as mrs tucker turned impatiently away only to show you that legally he has no rights and you need not see him unless you choose i could not stop his coming without perhaps doing you more harm than good but when he does come my presence under this roof as your legal counsel will enable you to refer him to me he stopped she was pacing the corridor with short impatient steps her arms dropped and her hands clasped rigidly before her have i your permission to stay  she suddenly stopped in her walk approached him rapidly and fixing her eyes on his said  do i know all noweverything  he could only reply that she had not yet told him what she had heard  well she said scornfully that my husband has been cruelly imposed uponimposed upon by some wretched woman who has made him sacrifice his property his friends his honoreverything but me  everything but whom gasped poindexter  but me  poindexter gazed at the sky the air the deserted corridor the stones of the patio itself and then at the inexplicable woman before him then he said gravely i think you know everything  then if my husband has left me all he couldthis property she went on rapidly twisting her handkerchief between her fingers i can do with it what i like cant i  you certainly can  then sell it she said with passionate vehemence sell itall everything and sell these she darted into her bedroom and returned with the diamond rings she had torn from her fingers and ears when she entered the house sell them for anything theyll bring only sell them at once  but for what asked poindexter with demure lips but twinkling eyes  to pay the debts that thisthiswoman has led him into to return the money she has stolen she went on rapidly to keep him from sharing infamy cant you understand  but my dear madam began poindexter even if this could be done  dont tell me if it couldit must be done do you think i could sleep under this roof propped up by the timbers of that ruined tienda do you think i could wear those diamonds again while that termagant shopwoman can say that her money bought them no if you are my husbands friend you will do thisforfor his sake she stopped locked and interlocked her cold fingers before her and said hesitating and mechanically you meant well captain poindexter in bringing me here i know you must not think that i blame you for it or for the miserable result of it that you have just witnessed but if i have gained anything by it for gods sake let me reap it quickly that i may give it to these people and go i have a friend who can aid me to get to my husband or to my home in kentucky where spencer will yet find me i know i want nothing more she stopped again with another woman the pause would have been one of tears but she kept her head above the flood that filled her heart and the clear eyes fixed upon poindexter albeit pained were undimmed  but this would require time said poindexter with a smile of compassionate explanation you could not sell now nobody would buy you are safe to hold this property while you are in actual possession but you are not strong enough to guarantee it to another there may still be litigation your husband has other creditors than these people you have talked with but while nobody could oust youthe wife who would have the sympathies of judge and juryit might be a different case with any one who derived title from you any purchaser would know that you could not sell or if you did it would be at a ridiculous sacrifice  she listened to him abstractedly walked to the end of the corridor returned and without looking up said  i suppose you know her  i beg your pardon  this woman you have seen her  never to my knowledge  and you are his friend thats strange she raised her eyes to his well she continued impatiently who is she and what is she you know that surely  i know no more of her than what i have said said poindexter she is a notorious woman  the swift color came to mrs tuckers face as if the epithet had been applied to herself i suppose she said in a dry voice as if she were asking a business question but with an eye that showed her rising angeri suppose there is some law by which creatures of this kind can be followed and brought to justicesome law that would keep innocent people from suffering for their crimes  i am afraid said poindexter that arresting her would hardly help these people over in the tienda  i am not speaking of them responded mrs tucker with a sudden sublime contempt for the people whose cause she had espoused i am talking of my husband  poindexter bit his lip youd hardly think of bringing back the strongest witness against him he said bluntly  mrs tucker dropped her eyes and was silent a sudden shame suffused poindexters cheek he felt as if he had struck that woman a blow i beg your pardon he said hastily i am talking like a lawyer to a lawyer he would have taken any other woman by the hand in the honest fullness of his apology but something restrained him here he only looked down gently on her lowered lashes and repeated his question if he should remain during the coming interview with don josé i must beg you to determine quickly he added for i already hear him entering the gate  stay said mrs tucker as the ringing of spurs and clatter of hoofs came from the corral one moment she looked up suddenly and said how long had he known her but before he could reply there was a step in the doorway and the figure of don josé santierra emerged from the archway  he was a man slightly past middle age fair and well shaven wearing a black broadcloth serape the deeply embroidered opening of which formed a collar of silver rays around his neck while a row of silver buttons down the side seams of his ridingtrousers and silver spurs completed his singular equipment mrs tuckers swift feminine glance took in these details as well as the deep salutation more formal than the exuberant frontier politeness she was accustomed to with which he greeted her it was enough to arrest her first impulse to retreat she hesitated and stopped as poindexter stepped forward partly interposing between them acknowledging don josés distant recognition of himself with an ironical accession of his usual humorous tolerance the spaniard did not seem to notice it but remained gravely silent before mrs tucker gazing at her with an expression of intent and unconscious absorption  you are quite right don josé said poindexter with ironical concern it is mrs tucker your eyes do not deceive you she will be glad to do the honors of her house he continued with a simulation of appealing to her unless you visit her on business when i need not say i shall be only too happy to attend you as before  don josé with a slight lifting of the eyebrows allowed himself to become conscious of the lawyers meaning it is not of business that i come to kiss the señoras hand today he replied with a melancholy softness it is as her neighbor to put myself at her disposition ah what have we here fit for a lady he continued raising his eyes in deprecation of the surroundings a house of nothing a place of winds and dry bones without refreshments or satisfaction or delicacy the señora will not refuse to make us proud this day to send her of that which we have in our poor home at los gatos to make her more complete of what shall it be let her make choice or if she would commemorate this day by accepting of our hospitality at los gatos until she shall arrange herself the more to receive us here we shall have too much honor  the señora would only find it the more difficult to return to this humble roof again after once leaving it for don josés hospitality said poindexter with a demure glance at mrs tucker but the innuendo seemed to lapse equally unheeded by his fair client and the stranger raising her eyes with a certain timid dignity which don josés presence seemed to have called out she addressed herself to him  you are very kind and considerate mister santierra and i thank you i know that my husbandshe let the clear beauty of her translucent eyes rest full on both menwould thank you too but i shall not be here long enough to accept your kindness in this house nor in your own i have but one desire and object now it is to dispose of this property and indeed all i possess to pay the debt of my husband it is in your power perhaps to help me i am told that you wish to possess los cuervos she went on equally oblivious of the consciousness that appeared in don josés face and a humorous perplexity on the brow of poindexter if you can arrange it with mr poindexter you will find me a liberal vendor that much you can do and i know you will believe i shall be grateful you can do no more unless it be to say to your friends that mrs belle tucker remains here only for that purpose and to carry out what she knows to be the wishes of her husband she paused bent her pretty crest dropped a quaint curtsey to the superior age the silver braid and the gentlemanly bearing of don josé and with the passing sunshine of a smile disappeared from the corridor  the two men remained silent for a moment don josé gazing abstractedly on the door through which she had vanished until poindexter with a return of his tolerant smile said you have heard the views of mrs tucker you know the situation as well as she does  ah yes possibly better  poindexter darted a quick glance at the grave sallow face of don josé but detecting no unusual significance in his manner continued as you see she leaves this matter in my hands let us talk like business men have you any idea of purchasing this property  of purchasing ah no  poindexter bent his brows but quickly relaxed them with a smile of humorous forgiveness if you have any other idea don josé i ought to warn you as mrs tuckers lawyer that she is in legal possession here and that nothing but her own act can change that position  ah so  irritated at the shrug which accompanied this poindexter continued haughtily if i am to understand you have nothing to say  to say ah yes possibly buthe glanced toward the door of mrs tuckers roomnot here he stopped appeared to recall himself and with an apologetic smile and a studied but graceful gesture of invitation he motioned to the gateway and said will you ride  what can the fellow be up to muttered poindexter as with an assenting nod he proceeded to remount his horse if he wasnt an old hidalgo id mistrust him no matter here goes  the don also remounted his halfbroken mustang they proceeded in solemn silence through the corral and side by side emerged on the open plain poindexter glanced round no other being was in sight it was not until the lonely hacienda had also sunk behind them that don josé broke the silence  you say just now we shall speak as business men i say no don marco i will not i shall speak we shall speak as gentlemen  go on said poindexter who was beginning to be amused  i say just now i will not purchase the rancho from the señora and why look you don marco he reined in his horse thrust his hand under his serape and drew out a folded document this is why  with a smile poindexter took the paper from his hand and opened it but the smile faded from his lips as he read with blazing eyes he spurred his horse beside the spaniard almost unseating him and said sternly what does this mean  what does it mean repeated don josé with equally flashing eyes ill tell you it means that your client this man spencer tucker is a judas a traitor it means that he gave los cuervos to his mistress a year ago and that she sold it to meto me you hearme josé santierra the day before she left it means that the coyote of a spencer the thief who bought these lands of a thief and gave them to a thief has tricked you all look he said rising in his saddle holding the paper like a bâton and defining with a sweep of his arm the whole level plain all these lands were once mine they are mine again today do i want to purchase los cuervos you ask for you will speak of the business well listen i have purchased los cuervos and here is the deed  but it has never been recorded said poindexter with a carelessness he was far from feeling  of a verity no do you wish that i should record it asked don josé with a return of his simple gravity  poindexter bit his lip you said we were to talk like gentlemen he returned do you think you have come into possession of this alleged deed like a gentleman  don josé shrugged his shoulders i found it tossed in the lap of a harlot i bought it for a song eh what would you  would you sell it again for a song asked poindexter  ah what is this said don josé lifting his irongray brows but a moment ago we would sell everything for any money now we would buy is it so  one moment don josé said poindexter with a baleful light in his dark eyes do i understand that you are the ally of spencer tucker and his mistress that you intend to turn this doubly betrayed wife from the only roof she has to cover her  ah i comprehend not you heard her say she wished to go perhaps it may please me to distribute largess to these cattle yonder i do not say no more she does not ask but you don marco of whom are you advocate you abandon your clients mistress for the wife is it so  what i may do you will learn hereafter said poindexter who had regained his composure suddenly reining up his horse as our paths seem likely to diverge they had better begin now good morning  patience my friend patience ah blessed st anthony what these americans are listen for what you shall do i do not inquire the question is to me what ihe emphasized the pronoun by tapping himself on the breasti josé santierra will do well i shall tell you today nothing tomorrow nothing for a week for a month nothing after we shall see  poindexter paused thoughtfully will you give your word don josé that you will not press the claim for a month  truly on one condition observe i do not ask you for an equal promise that you will not take this time to defend yourself he shrugged his shoulder no it is only this you shall promise that during that time the señora tucker shall remain ignorant of this document  poindexter hesitated a moment i promise he said at last  good adios don marco  adios don josé  the spaniard put spurs to his mustang and galloped off in the direction of los gatos the lawyer remained for a moment gazing on his retreating but victorious figure for the first time the old look of humorous toleration with which mr poindexter was in the habit of regarding all human infirmity gave way to something like bitterness i might have guessed it he said with a slight rise of color hes an old fool and shewell perhaps its all the better for her he glanced backwards almost tenderly in the direction of los cuervos and then turned his head towards the embarcadero  as the afternoon wore on a creaking antiquated oxcart arrived at los cuervos bearing several articles of furniture and some tasteful ornaments from los gatos at the same time that a young mexican girl mysteriously appeared in the kitchen as a temporary assistant to the decrepit concha these were both clearly attributable to don josé whose visit was not so remote but that these delicate attentions might have been already projected before mrs tucker had declined them and she could not without marked discourtesy return them now she did not wish to seem discourteous she would like to have been more civil to this old gentleman who still retained the evidences of a picturesque and decorous past and a repose so different from the life that was perplexing her reflecting that if he bought the estate these things would be ready to his hand and with a womans instinct recognizing their value in setting off the house to other purchasers eyes she took a pleasure in tastefully arranging them and even found herself speculating how she might have enjoyed them herself had she been able to keep possession of the property after all it would not have been so lonely if refined and gentle neighbors like this old man would have sympathized with her she had an instinctive feeling that in their own hopeless decay and hereditary unfitness for this new civilization they would have been more tolerant of her husbands failure than his own kind she could not believe that don josé really hated her husband for buying of the successful claimant as there was no other legal title allowing herself to become interested in the guileless gossip of the new handmaiden proud of her broken english she was drawn into a sympathy with the grave simplicity of don josés character a relic of that true nobility which placed this descendant of the castilians and the daughter of a free people on the same level  in this way the second day of her occupancy of los cuervos closed with dumb clouds along the gray horizon and the paroxysms of hysterical wind growing fainter and fainter outside the walls with the moon rising after nightfall and losing itself in silent and mysterious confidences with drifting scud she went to bed early but woke past midnight hearing as she thought her own name called the impression was so strong upon her that she rose and hastily enwrapping herself went to the dark embrasures of the ovenshaped windows and looked out the dwarfed oak beside the window was still dropping from a past shower but the level waste of marsh and meadow beyond seemed to advance and recede with the coming and going of the moon again she heard her name called and this time in accents so strangely familiar that with a slight cry she ran into the corridor crossed the patio and reached the open gate the darkness that had even in this brief interval again fallen upon the prospect she tried in vain to pierce with eye and voice a blank silence followed then the veil was suddenly withdrawn the vast plain stretching from the mountain to the sea shone as clearly as in the light of day the moving current of the channel glittered like black pearls the stagnant pools like molten lead but not a sign of life nor motion broke the monotony of the broad expanse she must have surely dreamed it a chill wind drove her back to the house again she entered her bedroom and in half an hour she was in a peaceful sleep   v  the two men kept their secret mr poindexter convinced mrs tucker that the sale of los cuervos could not be effected until the notoriety of her husbands flight had been fairly forgotten and she was forced to accept her fate the sale of her diamonds which seemed to her to have realized a singularly extravagant sum enabled her to quietly reinstate the pattersons in the tienda and to discharge in full her husbands liabilities to the rancheros and his humbler retainers  meanwhile the winter rains had ceased it seemed to her as if the clouds had suddenly one night struck their white tents and stolen away leaving the unvanquished sun to mount the vacant sky the next morning alone and possess it thenceforward unchallenged one afternoon she thought the long sad waste before her window had caught some tint of grayer color from the sunset a week later she found it a blazing landscape of poppies broken here and there by blue lagoons of lupine by pools of daisies by banks of dogroses by broad outlying shores of dandelions that scattered their lavish gold to the foot of the hills where the green billows of wild oats carried it on and upwards to the darker crests of pines for two months she was dazzled and bewildered with color she had never before been face to face with this spendthrift californian flora in her virgin wastefulness her more than goddesslike prodigality the teeming earth seemed to quicken and throb beneath her feet the few circuits of a plow around the outlying corral was enough to call out a jungle growth of giant grain that almost hid the low walls of the hacienda in this glorious fecundity of the earth in this joyous renewal of life and color in this opulent youth and freshness of soil and sky it alone remained the dead and sterile past left in the midst of buoyant rejuvenescence and resurrection like an empty churchyard skull upturned on the springing turf its bronzed adobe walls mocked the green vine that embraced them the crumbling dust of its courtyard remained ungerminating and unfruitful to the thousand stirring voices without its dry lips alone remained mute unresponsive and unchanged  during this time don josé had become a frequent visitor at los cuervos bringing with him at first his niece and sister in a stately precision of politeness that was not lost on the proud blue grass stranger she returned their visit at los gatos and there made the formal acquaintance of don josés grandmother a lady who still regarded the decrepit concha as a giddy muchacha and who herself glittered as with the phosphorescence of refined decay through this circumstance she learned that don josé was not yet fifty and that his gravity of manner and sedateness was more the result of fastidious isolation and temperament than years she could not tell why the information gave her a feeling of annoyance but it caused her to regret the absence of poindexter and to wonder also somewhat nervously why he had lately avoided her presence the thought that he might be doing so from a recollection of the innuendoes of mrs patterson caused a little tremor of indignation in her pulses as ifbut she did not finish the sentence even to herself and her eyes filled with bitter tears  yet she had thought of the husband who had so cruelly wronged her less feverishly less impatiently than before for she thought she loved him now the more deeply because although she was not reconciled to his absence it seemed to keep alive the memory of what he had been before his one wild act separated them she had never seen the reflection of another womans eyes in his the past contained no haunting recollection of waning or alienated affection she could meet him again and clasping her arms around him awaken as if from a troubled dream without reproach or explanation her strong belief in this made her patient she no longer sought to know the particulars of his flight and never dreamed that her passive submission to his absence was partly due to a fear that something in his actual presence at that moment would have destroyed that belief forever  for this reason the delicate reticence of the people at los gatos and their seclusion from the world which knew of her husbands fault had made her encourage the visits of don josé until from the instinct already alluded to she one day summoned poindexter to los cuervos on the day that don josé usually called but to her surprise the two men met more or less awkwardly and coldly and her tact as hostess was tried to the utmost to keep their evident antagonism from being too apparent the effort to reconcile their mutual discontent and some other feeling she did not quite understand produced a nervous excitement which called the blood to her cheek and gave a dangerous brilliancy to her eyes two circumstances not unnoticed nor unappreciated by her two guests but instead of reuniting them the prettier mrs tucker became the more distant and reserved grew the men until don josé rose before his usual hour and with more than usual ceremoniousness departed  then my business does not seem to be with him said poindexter with quiet coolness as mrs tucker turned her somewhat mystified face towards him or have you anything to say to me about him in private  i am sure i dont know what you both mean she returned with a slight tremor of voice i had no idea you were not on good terms i thought you were its very awkward without coquetry and unconsciously she raised her blue eyes under her lids until the clear pupils coyly and softly hid themselves in the corners of the brown lashes and added you have both been so kind to me  perhaps that is the reason said poindexter gravely but mrs tucker refused to accept the suggestion with equal gravity and began to laugh the laugh which was at first frank spontaneous and almost childlike was becoming hysterical and nervous as she went on until it was suddenly checked by poindexter  i have had no difficulties with don josé santierra he said somewhat coldly ignoring her hilarity but perhaps he is not inclined to be as polite to the friend of the husband as he is to the wife  mr poindexter said mrs tucker quickly her face becoming pale again  i beg your pardon said poindexter flushing but  you want to say she interrupted coolly that you are not friends i see is that the reason why you have avoided this house she continued gently  i thought i could be of more service to you elsewhere he replied evasively i have been lately following up a certain clue rather closely i think i am on the track of a confidante ofofthat woman  a quick shadow passed over mrs tuckers face indeed she said coldly then i am to believe that you prefer to spend your leisure moments in looking after that creature to calling here  poindexter was stupefied was this the woman who only four months ago was almost vindictively eager to pursue her husbands paramour there could be but one answer to itdon josé four months ago he would have smiled compassionately at it from his cynical preeminence now he managed with difficulty to stifle the bitterness of his reply  if you do not wish the inquiry carried on he began of course  i what does it matter to me she said coolly do as you please  nevertheless half an hour later as he was leaving she said with a certain hesitating timidity do not leave me so much alone here and let that woman go  this was not the only unlookedfor sequel to her innocent desire to propitiate her best friends don josé did not call again upon his usual day but in his place came doña clara his younger sister when mrs tucker had politely asked after the absent don josé doña clara wound her swarthy arms around the fair americans waist and replied but why did you send for the abogado poindexter when my brother called  but captain poindexter calls as one of my friends said the amazed mrs tucker he is a gentleman and has been a soldier and an officer she added with some warmth  ah yes a soldier of the law what you call an oficial de policia a chief of gendarmes my sister but not a gentlemana camarero to protect a lady  mrs tucker would have uttered a hasty reply but the perfect and goodnatured simplicity of doña clara withheld her nevertheless she treated don josé with a certain reserve at their next meeting until it brought the simpleminded castilian so dangerously near the point of demanding an explanation which implied too much that she was obliged to restore him temporarily to his old footing meantime she had a brilliant idea she would write to calhoun weaver whom she had avoided since that memorable day she would say she wished to consult him he would come to los cuervos he might suggest something to lighten this weary waiting at least she would show them all that she had still old friends yet she did not dream of returning to her blue grass home her parents had died since she left she shrank from the thought of dragging her ruined life before the hopeful youth of her girlhoods companions  mr calhoun weaver arrived promptly ostentatiously oracularly and cordially but a little coarsely he haddid she rememberexpected this from the first spercer had lost his head through vanity and had attempted too much it required foresight and firmness as he himselfwho had lately made successful combinations which she might perhaps have heard ofwell knew but spencer had got the big head as to that womana devilish handsome woman toowell everybody knew that spencer always had a weakness that way and he would saybut if she didnt care to hear any more about herwell perhaps she was right that was the best way to take it sitting before her prosperous weak egotistical incompetent unavailable and yet filled with a vague kindliness of intent mrs tucker loathed him a sickening perception of her own weakness in sending for him a new and aching sense of her utter isolation and helplessness seemed to paralyze her  natrally you feel bad he continued with the large air of a profound student of human nature natrally natrally youre kept in an uncomfortable state not knowing jist how you stand there aint but one thing to do jist rise up quiet like and get a divorce agin spencer hold on there aint a judge or jury in california that wouldnt give it to you right off the nail without asking questions why youd get it by default if you wanted to youd just have to walk over the course and then belle he drew his chair still nearer her when youve settled down againwelli dont mind renewing that offer i once made ye before spencer ever came round yei dont mind belle i swear i dont honest injin im in earnest theres my hand  mrs tuckers reply has not been recorded enough that half an hour later mr weaver appeared in the courtyard with traces of tears on his foolish face a broken falsetto voice and other evidence of mental and moral disturbance his cordiality and oracular predisposition remained sufficiently to enable him to suggest the magical words blue grass mysteriously to concha with an indication of his hand to the erect figure of her pale mistress in the doorway who waved to him a silent but half compassionate farewell  at about this time a slight change in her manner was noticed by the few who saw her more frequently her apparently invincible girlishness of spirit had given way to a certain matronly seriousness she applied herself to her household cares and the improvement of the hacienda with a new sense of duty and a settled earnestness until by degrees she wrought into it not only her instinctive delicacy and taste but part of her own individuality even the rude rancheros and tradesmen who were permitted to enter the walls in the exercise of their calling began to speak mysteriously of the beauty of this garden of the almarjal she went out but seldom and then accompanied by one or the other of her female servants in long drives on unfrequented roads on sundays she sometimes drove to the half ruined mission church of santa inez and hid herself during mass in the dim monastic shadows of the choir gradually the poorer people whom she met in these journeys began to show an almost devotional reverence for her stopping in the roads with uncovered heads for her to pass or making way for her in the tienda or plaza of the wretched town with dumb courtesy she began to feel a strange sense of widowhood that while it at times brought tears to her eyes was not without a certain tender solace in the sympathy and simpleness of this impulse she went as far as to revive the mourning she had worn for her parents but with such a fatal accenting of her beauty and dangerous misinterpreting of her condition to eligible bachelors strange to the country that she was obliged to put it off again her reserved and dignified manner caused others to mistake her nationality for that of the santierras and in doña bella the simple mrs tucker was for a while forgotten at times she even forgot it herself accustomed now almost entirely to the accents of another language and the features of another race she would sit for hours in the corridor whose massive bronzed enclosure even her tasteful care could only make an embowered mausoleum of the past or gaze abstractedly from the dark embrasures of her windows across the stretching almarjal to the shining lagoon beyond that terminated the estuary she had a strange fondness for this tranquil mirror which under sun or stars always retained the passive reflex of the sky above and seemed to rest her weary eyes she had objected to one of the plans projected by poindexter to redeem the land and deepen the water at the embarcadero as it would have drained the lagoon and the lawyer had postponed the improvement to gratify her fancy so she kept it through the long summer unchanged save by the shadows of passing wings or the lazy files of sleeping seafowl  on one of these afternoons she noticed a slowly moving carriage leave the highroad and cross the almarjal skirting the edge of the lagoon if it contained visitors for los cuervos they had evidently taken a shorter cut without waiting to go on to the regular road which intersected the highway at right angles a mile farther on it was with some sense of annoyance and irritation that she watched the trespass and finally saw the vehicle approach the house a few moments later the servant informed her that mr patterson would like to see her alone when she entered the corridor which in the dry season served as a reception hall she was surprised to see that patterson was not alone near him stood a welldressed handsome woman gazing about her with goodhumored admiration of mrs tuckers taste and ingenuity  it dont look much like it did two years ago said the stranger cheerfully youve improved it wonderfully  stiffening slightly mrs tucker turned inquiringly to mr patterson but that gentlemans usual profound melancholy appeared to be intensified by the hilarity of his companion he only sighed deeply and rubbed his leg with the brim of his hat in gloomy abstraction  well go on then said the woman laughing and nudging him go onintroduce mecant you dont stand there like a tombstone you wont well ill introduce myself she laughed again and then with an excellent imitation of pattersons lugubrious accents said mr spencer tuckers wife that is allow me to introduce you to mr spencer tuckers sweetheart that was hold on i said that was for true as i stand here maamand i reckon i wouldnt stand here if it wasnt truei havent set eyes on him since the day he left you  its the gospel truth every word said patterson stirred into a sudden activity by mrs tuckers white and rigid face its the frozen truth and i kin prove it for i kin swear that when that there young woman was sailin outer the golden gate spencer tucker was in my barroom i kin swear that i fed him lickered him give him a hoss and set him in his road to monterey that very night  then where is he now said mrs tucker suddenly facing them  they looked at each other and then looked at mrs tucker then both together replied slowly and in perfect unison thatswhatwewanttoknow they seemed so satisfied with this effect that they as deliberately repeated yesthatswhatwewanttoknow  between the shock of meeting the partner of her husbands guilt and the unexpected revelation to her inexperience that in suggestion and appearance there was nothing beyond the recollection of that guilt that was really shocking in the womanbetween the extravagant extremes of hope and fear suggested by their words there was something so grotesquely absurd in the melodramatic chorus that she with difficulty suppressed an hysterical laugh  thats the way to take it said the woman putting her own goodhumored interpretation upon mrs tuckers expression now look here ill tell you all about it she carefully selected the most comfortable chair and sitting down lightly crossed her hands in her lap well i left here on the 13th of last january on the ship argo calculating that your husband would join the ship just inside the heads that was our arrangement but if anything happened to prevent him he was to join me at acapulco well he didnt come aboard and we sailed without him but it appears now he did attempt to join the ship but his boat was capsized there now dont be alarmed he wasnt drowned as patterson can swear tono catch him not a hair of him was hurt but ii was bundled off to the end of the earth in mexico alone without a cent to bless me for true as you live that hound of a captain when he found as he thought that spencer was nabbed he just confiscated all his trunks and valuables and left me in the lurch if i had not met a man down there that offered to marry me and brought me here i might have died there i reckon but i did and here i am i went down there as your husbands sweetheart ive come back as the wife of an honest man and i reckon its about square  there was something so startlingly frank so hopelessly selfsatisfied so contagiously goodhumored in the womans perfect moral unconsciousness that even if mrs tucker had been less preoccupied her resentment would have abated but her eyes were fixed on the gloomy face of patterson who was beginning to unlock the sepulchers of his memory and disinter his deeply buried thoughts  you kin bet your whole pile on what this mrs capting baxterez used to be french inez of new orleanshez told ye ye kin take everything shes onloaded and its only doin the square thing to her to say she haint done it out o no cussedness but just to satisfy herself now shes a married woman and past such foolishness but that aint neither here nor there the gist of the whole matter is that spencer tucker was at the tienda the day after she sailed and after his boat capsized he then gave a detailed account of the interview with the unnecessary but truthful minutiae of his class adding to the particulars already known that the following week he visited the summit house and was surprised to find that spencer had never been there nor had he ever sailed from monterey  but why was this not told to me before said mrs tucker suddenly why not at the time why she demanded almost fiercely turning from the one to the other has this been kept from me  ill tell ye why said patterson sinking with crashed submission into a chair when i found he wasnt where he ought to be i got to lookin elsewhere i knew the track of the hoss i lent him by a loose shoe i examined and found he had turned off the highroad somewhere beyond the lagoon jist as if he was makin a bee line here  well said mrs tucker breathlessly  well said patterson with the resigned tone of an accustomed martyr mebbe im a godforsaken idiot but i reckon he did come yer and mebbe im that much of a habitooal lunatic but thinking so i calkilated youd know it without tellin  with their eyes fixed upon her mrs tucker felt the quick blood rush to her cheeks although she knew not why but they were apparently satisfied with her ignorance for patterson resumed yet more gloomily  then if he wasnt hidin here beknownst to you he must have changed his mind agin and got away by the embarcadero the only thing wantin to prove that idea is to know how he got a boat and what he did with the hoss and thars one more idea and ez that cant be proved continued patterson sinking his voice still lower mebbe its accordin to gods laws  unsympathetic to her as the speaker had always been and still was mrs tucker felt a vague chill creep over her that seemed to be the result of his manner more than his words and that idea is she suggested with pale lips  its this fust i dont say it means much to anybody but me ive heard of these warnings afore now ez comin only to folks ez hear them for themselves alone and i reckon i kin stand it if its the will o god the idea is thenthatspencer tuckerwas drownded in that boat the idea ishis voice was almost lost in a hoarse whisperthat it was no living man that kem to me that night but a spirit that kem out of the darkness and went back into it no eye saw him but mineno ears heard him but mine i reckon it werent intended it should he paused and passed the flap of his hat across his eyes the pie youll say is agin it he continued in the same tone of voicethe whiskey is agin ita few cuss words that dropped from him accidental like may have been agin it all the same they mout have been only the little signs and tokens that it was him  but mrs baxters ready laugh somewhat rudely dispelled the infection of pattersons gloom i reckon the only spirit was that which you and spencer consumed she said cheerfully i dont wonder youre a little mixed like as not youve misunderstood his plans  patterson shook his head hell turn up yet alive and kicking like as not then poindexter knows where he is all the time  impossible he would have told me said mrs tucker quickly  mrs baxter looked at patterson without speaking patterson replied by a long lugubrious whistle  i dont understand you said mrs tucker drawing back with cold dignity  you dont returned mrs baxter bless your innocent heart why was he so keen to hunt me up at first shadowing my friends and all that and why has he dropped it now he knows im here if he didnt know where spencer was  i can explain that interrupted mrs tucker hastily with a blush of confusion that isi  then mebbe you kin explain too broke in patterson with gloomy significance why he has bought up most of spencers debts himself and perhaps youre satisfied it is nt to hold the whip hand of him and keep him from coming back openly praps you know why hes movin heaven and earth to make don josé santierra sell the ranch and why the don dont see it all  don josé sell los cuervos buy it you mean said mrs tucker i offered to sell it to him  patterson arose from the chair looked despairingly around him passed his hand sadly across his forehead and said its come i knew it would its the warning its suthing betwixt jimjams and doddering idjiocy here id hev been willin to swear that mrs baxter here told me she had sold this yer ranch nearly two years ago to don josé and now you  stop said mrs tucker in a voice that chilled them  she was standing upright and rigid as if stricken to stone i command you to tell me what this means she said turning only her blazing eyes upon the woman  even the ready smile faded from mrs baxters lips as she replied hesitatingly and submissively i thought you knew already that spencer had given this ranch to me i sold it to don josé to get the money for us to go away with it was spencers idea  you lie said mrs tucker  there was a dead silence the wrathful blood that had quickly mounted to mrs baxters cheek to pattersons additional bewilderment faded as quickly she did not lift her eyes again to mrs tuckers but slowly raising herself from her seat said i wish to god i did lie but its true and its true that i never touched a cent of the money but gave it all to him she laid her hand on pattersons arm and said come let us go and led him a few steps toward the gateway but here patterson paused and again passed his hand over his melancholy brow the necessity of coherently and logically closing the conversation impressed itself upon his darkening mind then you dont happen to have heard anything of spencer he said sadly and vanished with mrs baxter through the gate  left alone to herself mrs tucker raised her hands above her head with a little cry interlocked her rigid fingers and slowly brought her palms down upon her upturned face and eyes pressing hard as if to crush out all light and sense of life before her she stood thus for a moment motionless and silent with the rising wind whispering without and flecking her white morning dress with gusty shadows from the arbor then with closed eyes dropping her hands to her breast still pressing hard she slowly passed them down the shapely contours of her figure to the waist and with another cry cast them off as if she were stripping herself of some loathsome garment then she walked quickly to the gateway looked out returned to the corridor unloosening and taking off her weddingring from her finger as she walked here she paused then slowly and deliberately rearranged the chairs and adjusted the gaycolored rugs that draped them and quietly reëntered her chamber  two days afterwards the sweating steed of captain poindexter was turned loose in the corral and a moment later the captain entered the corridor handing a letter to the decrepit concha who seemed to be utterly disorganized by its contents and the few curt words with which it was delivered he gazed silently upon the vacant bower still fresh and redolent with the delicacy and perfume of its graceful occupant until his dark eyes filled with unaccustomed moisture but his reverie was interrupted by the sound of jingling spurs without and the old humor struggled back into his eyes as don josé impetuously entered the spaniard started back but instantly recovered himself  so i find you here ah it is well he said passionately producing a letter from his bosom look do you call this honor look how you keep your compact  poindexter coolly took the letter it contained a few words of gentle dignity from mrs tucker informing don josé that she had only that instant learned of his just claims upon los cuervos tendering him her gratitude for his delicate intentions but pointing out with respectful firmness that he must know that a moments further acceptance of his courtesy was impossible  she has gained this knowledge from no word of mine said poindexter calmly right or wrong i have kept my promise to you i have as much reason to accuse you of betraying my secret in this he added coldly as he took another letter from his pocket and handed it to don josé  it seemed briefer and colder but was neither it reminded poindexter that as he had again deceived her she must take the government of her affairs in her own hands henceforth she abandoned all the furniture and improvements she had put in los cuervos to him to whom she now knew she was indebted for them she could not thank him for what his habitual generosity impelled him to do for any woman but she could forgive him for misunderstanding her like any other woman perhaps she should say like a child when he received this she would be already on her way to her old home in kentucky where she still hoped to be able by her own efforts to amass enough to discharge her obligations to him  she does not speak of her husband this woman said don josé scanning poindexters face it is possible she rejoins him eh  perhaps in one way she has never left him don josé said poindexter with grave significance  don josés face flushed but he returned carelessly and the rancho naturally you will not buy it now  on the contrary i shall abide by my offer said poindexter quietly  don josé eyed him narrowly and then said ah we shall consider of it  he did consider it and accepted the offer with the full control of the land captain poindexters improvements so indefinitely postponed were actively pushed forward the thick walls of the hacienda were the first to melt away before them the low lines of corral were effaced and the early breath of the summer trade winds swept uninterruptedly across the now leveled plain to the embarcadero where a newer structure arose a more vivid green alone marked the spot where the crumbling adobe walls of the casa had returned to the parent soil that gave it the channel was deepened the lagoon was drained until one evening the magic mirror that had so long reflected the weary waiting of the blue grass penelope lay dull dead lusterless an opaque quagmire of noisome corruption and decay to be put away from the sight of man forever on this spot the crows the titular tenants of los cuervos assembled in tumultuous congress coming and going in mysterious clouds or laboring in thick and writhing masses as if they were continuing the work of improvement begun by human agency so well had they done the work that by the end of a week only a few scattered white objects remained glittering on the surface of the quickly drying soil but they were the bones of the missing outcast spencer tucker  the same spring a breath of war swept over a foul decaying quagmire of the whole land before which such passing deeds as these were blown as vapor it called men of all rank and condition to battle for a nations life and among the first to respond were those into whose boyish hands had been placed the nations honor it returned the epaulets to poindexters shoulder with the addition of a double star carried him triumphantly to the front and left him at the end of a summers day and a hardwon fight sorely wounded at the door of a blue grass farmhouse and the woman who sought him out and ministered to his wants said timidly as she left her hand in his i told you i should live to repay you    left out on lone star mountain   i  there was little doubt that the lone star claim was played out not dug out worked out washed out but played out for two years its five sanguine proprietors had gone through the various stages of mining enthusiasm had prospected and planned dug and doubted they had borrowed money with hearty but unredeeming frankness established a credit with unselfish abnegation of all responsibility and had borne the disappointment of their creditors with a cheerful resignation which only the consciousness of some deep compensating future could give giving little else however a singular dissatisfaction obtained with the traders and being accompanied with a reluctance to make further advances at last touched the gentle stoicism of the proprietors themselves the youthful enthusiasm which had at first lifted the most ineffectual trial the most useless essay to the plane of actual achievement died out leaving them only the dull prosaic record of halffinished ditches purposeless shafts untenable pits abandoned engines and meaningless disruptions of the soil upon the lone star claim and empty flour sacks and pork barrels in the lone star cabin  they had borne their poverty if that term could be applied to a light renunciation of all superfluities in food dress or ornament ameliorated by the gentle depredations already alluded to with unassuming levity more than that having segregated themselves from their fellowminers of red gulch and entered upon the possession of the little manzanitathicketed valley five miles away the failure of their enterprise had assumed in their eyes only the vague significance of the decline and fall of a general community and to that extent relieved them of individual responsibility it was easier for them to admit that the lone star claim was played out than confess to a personal bankruptcy moreover they still retained the sacred right of criticism of government and rose superior in their private opinions to their own collective wisdom each one experienced a grateful sense of the entire responsibility of the other four in the fate of their enterprise  on december 24 1863 a gentle rain was still falling over the length and breadth of the lone star claim it had been falling for several days had already called a faint spring color to the wan landscape repairing with tender touches the ravages wrought by the proprietors or charitably covering their faults the ragged seams in gulch and cañon lost their harsh outlines a thin green mantle faintly clothed the torn and abraded hillside a few weeks more and a veil of forgetfulness would be drawn over the feeble failures of the lone star claim the charming derelicts themselves listening to the raindrops on the roof of their little cabin gazed philosophically from the open door and accepted the prospect as a moral discharge from their obligations four of the five partners were present the right and left bowers union mills and the judge  it is scarcely necessary to say that not one of these titles was the genuine name of its possessor the right and left bowers were two brothers their sobriquets a cheerful adaptation from the favorite game of euchre expressing their relative value in the camp the mere fact that union mills had at one time patched his trousers with an old floursack legibly bearing that brand of its fabrication was a tempting baptismal suggestion that the other partners could not forego the judge a singularly inequitable missourian with no knowledge whatever of the law was an inspiration of gratuitous irony  union mills who had been for some time sitting placidly on the threshold with one leg exposed to the rain from a sheer indolent inability to change his position finally withdrew that weatherbeaten member and stood up the movement more or less deranged the attitudes of the other partners and was received with cynical disfavor it was somewhat remarkable that although generally giving the appearance of healthy youth and perfect physical condition they one and all simulated the decrepitude of age and invalidism and after limping about for a few moments settled back again upon their bunks and stools in their former positions the left bower lazily replaced a bandage that he had worn around his ankle for weeks without any apparent necessity and the judge scrutinized with tender solicitude the faded cicatrix of a scratch upon his arm a passive hypochondria born of their isolation was the last ludicrously pathetic touch of their situation  the immediate cause of this commotion felt the necessity of an explanation  it would have been just as easy for you to have stayed outside with your business leg instead of dragging it into private life in that obtrusive way retorted the right bower but that exhaustive effort is nt going to fill the pork barrel the grocery man at dalton sayswhats that he said he appealed lazily to the judge  said he reckoned the lone star was about played out and he didnt want any more in histhank you repeated the judge with a mechanical effort of memory utterly devoid of personal or present interest  i always suspected that man after grimshaw begun to deal with him said the left bower theyre just mean enough to join hands against us it was a fixed belief of the lone star partners that they were pursued by personal enmities  more than likely those new strangers over in the fork have been paying cash and filled him up with conceit said union mills trying to dry his leg by alternately beating it or rubbing it against the cabin wall once begin wrong with that kind of snipe and you drag everybody down with you  this vague conclusion was received with dead silence everybody had become interested in the speakers peculiar method of drying his leg to the exclusion of the previous topic a few offered criticism no one assistance  who did the grocery man say that to asked the right bower finally returning to the question  the old man answered the judge  of course ejaculated the right bower sarcastically  of course echoed the other partners together thats like him the old man all over  it did not appear exactly what was like the old man or why it was like him but generally that he alone was responsible for the grocery mans defection it was put more concisely by union mills  that comes of letting him go there its just a fair provocation to any man to have the old man sent to him they cant sorter restrain themselves at him hes enough to spoil the credit of the rothschilds  thats so chimed in the judge and look at his prospecting why he was out two nights last week all night prospecting in the moonlight for blind leads just out of sheer foolishness  it was quite enough for me broke in the left bower when the other day you remember when he proposed to us white men to settle down to plain ground sluicing making grub wages just like any chinaman it just showed his idea of the lone star claim  well i never said it afore added union mills but when that one of the mattison boys came over here to examine the claim with an eye to purchasin it was the old man that took the conceit out of him he just as good as admitted that a lot of work had got to be done afore any pay ore could be realized never even asked him over to the shanty here to jine us in a friendly game just kept him so to speak to himself and naturally the mattisons didnt see it  a silence followed broken only by the rain monotonously falling on the roof and occasionally through the broad adobe chimney where it provoked a retaliating hiss and splutter from the dying embers of the hearth the right bower with a sudden access of energy drew the empty barrel before him and taking a pack of wellworn cards from his pocket began to make a solitaire upon the lid the others gazed at him with languid interest  makin it for anythin asked mills  the right bower nodded  the judge and left bower who were partly lying in their respective bunks sat up to get a better view of the game union mills slowly disengaged himself from the wall and leaned over the solitaire player the right bower turned the last card in a pause of almost thrilling suspense and clapped it down on the lid with fateful emphasis  it went said the judge in a voice of hushed respect what did you make it for he almost whispered  to know if wed make the break we talked about and vamose the ranch its the fifth time today continued the right bower in a voice of gloomy significance and it went agin bad cards too  i aint superstitious said the judge with awe and fatuity beaming from every line of his credulous face but its flyin in the face of providence to go agin such signs as that  make it again to see if the old man must go suggested the left bower  the suggestion was received with favor the three men gathering breathlessly around the player again the fateful cards were shuffled deliberately placed in their mysterious combination with the same ominous result yet everybody seemed to breathe more freely as if relieved from some responsibility the judge accepting this manifest expression of providence with resigned selfrighteousness  yes gentlemen resumed the left bower serenely as if a calm legal decision had just been recorded we must not let any foolishness or sentiment get mixed up with this thing but look at it like business men the only sensible move is to get up and get out of the camp  and the old man queried the judge  the old manhush hes coming  the doorway was darkened by a slight lissome shadow it was the absent partner otherwise known as the old man need it be added that he was a boy of nineteen with a slight down just clothing his upper lip  the creek is up over the ford and i had to shin up a willow on the bank and swing myself across he said with a quick frank laugh but all the same boys its going to clear up in about an hour you bet its breaking away over bald mountain and theres a sun flash on a bit of snow on lone peak look you can see it from here its for all the world like noahs dove just landed on mount ararat its a good omen  from sheer force of habit the men had momentarily brightened up at the old mans entrance but the unblushing exhibition of degrading superstition shown in the last sentence recalled their just severity they exchanged meaning glances union mills uttered hopelessly to himself hells full of such omens  too occupied with his subject to notice this ominous reception the old man continued i reckon i struck a fresh lead in the new grocery man at the crossing he says hell let the judge have a pair of boots on credit but he cant send them over here and considering that the judge has got to try them anyway it dont seem to be asking too much for the judge to go over there he says hell give us a barrel of pork and a bag of flour if well give him the right of using our tailrace and clean out the lower end of it  its the work of a chinaman and a four days job broke in the left bower  it took one white man only two hours to clean out a third of it retorted the old man triumphantly for i pitched in at once with a pick he let me have on credit and did that amount of work this morning and told him the rest of you boys would finish it this afternoon  a slight gesture from the right bower checked an angry exclamation from the left the old man did not notice either but knitting his smooth young brow in a paternally reflective fashion went on youll have to get a new pair of trousers mills but as he doesnt keep clothing well have to get some canvas and cut you out a pair i traded off the beans he let me have for some tobacco for the right bower at the other shop and got them to throw in a new pack of cards these are about played out well be wanting some brushwood for the fire theres a heap in the hollow whos going to bring it in its the judges turn isnt it why whats the matter with you all  the restraint and evident uneasiness of his companions had at last touched him he turned his frank young eyes upon them they glanced helplessly at each other yet his first concern was for them his first instinct paternal and protecting he ran his eyes quickly over them they were all there and apparently in their usual condition anything wrong with the claim he suggested  without looking at him the right bower rose leaned against the open door with his hands behind him and his face towards the landscape and said apparently to the distant prospect the claims played out the partnerships played out and the sooner we skedaddle out of this the better if he added turning to the old man if you want to stay if you want to do chinamans work at chinamans wages if you want to hang on to the charity of the traders at the crossing you can do it and enjoy the prospects and the noahs doves alone but were calculatin to step out of it  but i havent said i wanted to do it alone protested the old man with a gesture of bewilderment  if these are your general ideas of the partnership continued the right bower clinging to the established hypothesis of the other partners for support it aint ours and the only way we can prove it is to stop the foolishness right here we calculated to dissolve the partnership and strike out for ourselves elsewhere youre no longer responsible for us nor we for you and we reckon its the square thing to leave you the claim and the cabin and all it contains to prevent any trouble with the traders weve drawn up a paper here  with a bonus of fifty thousand dollars each down and the rest to be settled on my children interrupted the old man with a half uneasy laugh of course buthe stopped suddenly the blood dropped from his fresh cheek and he again glanced quickly round the group i dont thinkii quite sabe boys he added with a slight tremor of voice and lip if its a conundrum ask me an easier one  any lingering doubt he might have had of their meaning was dispelled by the judge its about the softest thing you kin drop into old man he said confidentially if i had nt promised the other boys to go with them and if i did nt need the best medical advice in sacramento for my lungs id just enjoy staying with you  it gives a sorter freedom to a young fellow like you old man like goin into the world on your own capital that every californian boy has nt got said union mills patronizingly  of course its rather hard papers on us you know givin up everything so to speak but its for your good and we aint goin back on you said the left bower are we boys  the color had returned to the old mans face a little more quickly and freely than usual he picked up the hat he had cast down put it on carefully over his brown curls drew the flap down on the side towards his companions and put his hands in his pockets all right he said in a slightly altered voice when do you go  today answered the left bower we calculate to take a moonlight pasear over to the cross roads and meet the down stage at about twelve tonight theres plenty of time yet he added with a slight laugh its only three oclock now  there was a dead silence even the rain withheld its continuous patter a dumb gray film covered the ashes of the hushed hearth for the first time the right bower exhibited some slight embarrassment  i reckon its held up for a spell he said ostentatiously examining the weather and we might as well take a run round the claim to see if weve forgotten nothing of course well be back again he added hastily without looking at the old man before we go you know  the others began to look for their hats but so awkwardly and with such evident preoccupation of mind that it was not at first discovered that the judge had his already on this raised a laugh as did also a clumsy stumble of union mills against the pork barrel although that gentleman took refuge from his confusion and secured a decent retreat by a gross exaggeration of his lameness as he limped after the right bower the judge whistled feebly the left bower in a more ambitious effort to impart a certain gayety to his exit stopped on the threshold and said as if in arch confidence to his companions darned if the old man dont look two inches higher since he became a proprietor laughed patronizingly and vanished  if the newlymade proprietor had increased in stature he had not otherwise changed his demeanor he remained in the same attitude until the last figure disappeared behind the fringe of buckeye that hid the distant highway then he walked slowly to the fireplace and leaning against the chimney kicked the dying embers together with his foot something dropped and spattered in the film of hot ashes surely the rain had not yet ceased  his high color had already fled except for a spot on either cheekbone that lent a brightness to his eyes he glanced around the cabin it looked familiar and yet strange rather it looked strange because still familiar and therefore incongruous with the new atmosphere that surrounded itdiscordant with the echo of their last meeting and painfully accenting the change there were the four bunks or sleeping berths of his companions each still bearing some traces of the individuality of its late occupant with a dumb loyalty that seemed to make their lighthearted defection monstrous in the dead ashes of the judges pipe scattered on his shelf still lived his old fire in the whittled and carved edges of the left bowers bunk still were the memories of bygone days of delicious indolence in the bulletholes clustered round a knot of one of the beams there was still the record of the right bowers oldtime skill and practice in the few engravings of female loveliness stuck upon each headboard there were the proofs of their old extravagant devotionall a mute protest to the change  he remembered how a fatherless truant schoolboy he had drifted into their adventurous nomadic life itself a life of grownup truancy like his own and became one of that gypsy family how they had taken the place of relations and household in his boyish fancy filling it with the unsubstantial pageantry of a childs play at grownup existence he knew only too well but how from being a pet and protégé he had gradually and unconsciously asserted his own individuality and taken upon his younger shoulders not only a poets keen appreciation of that life but its actual responsibilities and halfchildish burdens he never suspected he had fondly believed that he was a neophyte in their ways a novice in their charming faith and indolent creed and they had encouraged it now their renunciation of that faith could only be an excuse for a renunciation of him the poetry that had for two years invested the material and sometimes even mean details of their existence was too much a part of himself to be lightly dispelled the lesson of those ingenuous moralists failed as such lessons are apt to fail their discipline provoked but did not subdue a rising indignation stirred by a sense of injury mounted to his cheek and eyes it was slow to come but was none the less violent that it had been preceded by the benumbing shock of shame and pride  i hope i shall not prejudice the readers sympathies if my duty as a simple chronicler compels me to state therefore that the sober second thought of this gentle poet was to burn down the cabin on the spot with all its contents this yielded to a milder counselwaiting for the return of the party challenging the right bower a duel to the death perhaps himself the victim with the crushing explanation in extremis it seems we are one too many no matter it is settled now farewell dimly remembering however that there was something of this in the last wellworn novel they had read together and that his antagonist might recognize it or even worse anticipate it himself the idea was quickly rejected besides the opportunity for an apotheosis of selfsacrifice was past nothing remained now but to refuse the proffered bribe of claim and cabin by letter for he must not wait their return he tore a leaf from a blotted diary begun and abandoned long since and essayed to write scrawl after scrawl was torn up until his fury had cooled down to a frigid third personality mr john ford regrets to inform his late partners that their tender of house of furniture however seemed too inconsistent with the porkbarrel table he was writing on a more eloquent renunciation of their offer became frivolous and idiotic from a caricature of union mills label and all that appeared suddenly on the other side of the leaf and when he at last indited a satisfactory and impassioned exposition of his feelings the legible addendum of oh aint you glad youre out of the wildernessthe forgotten first line of a popular song which no scratching would eraseseemed too like an ironical postscript to be thought of for a moment he threw aside his pen and cast the discordant record of past foolish pastime into the dead ashes of the hearth  how quiet it was with the cessation of the rain the wind too had gone down and scarcely a breath of air came through the open door he walked to the threshold and gazed on the hushed prospect in this listless attitude he was faintly conscious of a distant reverberation a mere phantom of soundperhaps the explosion of a distant blast in the hillsthat left the silence more marked and oppressive as he turned again into the cabin a change seemed to have come over it it already looked old and decayed the loneliness of years of desertion seemed to have taken possession of it the atmosphere of dry rot was in the beams and rafters to his excited fancy the few disordered blankets and articles of clothing seemed dropping to pieces in one of the bunks there was a hideous resemblance in the longitudinal heap of clothing to a withered and mummied corpse so it might look in afteryears when some passing strangerbut he stopped a dread of the place was beginning to creep over him a dread of the days to come when the monotonous sunshine should lay bare the loneliness of these walls the long long days of endless blue and cloudless overhanging solitude summer days when the wearying incessant trade winds should sing around that empty shell and voice its desolation he gathered together hastily a few articles that were especially his ownrather that the free communion of the camp from indifference or accident had left wholly to him he hesitated for a moment over his rifle but scrupulous in his wounded pride turned away and left the familiar weapon that in the dark days had so often provided the dinner or breakfast of the little household candor compels me to state that his equipment was not large nor eminently practical his scant pack was a light weight for even his young shoulders but i fear he thought more of getting away from the past than providing for the future  with this vague but sole purpose he left the cabin and almost mechanically turned his steps towards the creek he had crossed that morning he knew that by this route he would avoid meeting his companions its difficulties and circuitousness would exercise his feverish limbs and give him time for reflection he had determined to leave the claim but whence he had not yet considered he reached the bank of the creek where he had stood two hours before it seemed to him two years he looked curiously at his reflection in one of the broad pools of overflow and fancied he looked older he watched the rush and outset of the turbid current hurrying to meet the south fork and to eventually lose itself in the yellow sacramento even in his preoccupation he was impressed with a likeness to himself and his companions in this flood that had burst its peaceful boundaries in the drifting fragments of one of their forgotten flumes washed from the bank he fancied he saw an omen of the disintegration and decay of the lone star claim  the strange hush in the air that he had noticed beforea calm so inconsistent with that hour and the season as to seem portentousbecame more marked in contrast to the feverish rush of the turbulent watercourse a few clouds lazily huddled in the west apparently had gone to rest with the sun on beds of somnolent poppies there was a gleam as of golden water everywhere along the horizon washing out the cold snowpeaks and drowning even the rising moon the creek caught it here and there until in grim irony it seemed to bear their broken sluiceboxes and useless engines on the very pactolian stream they had been hopefully created to direct and carry but by some peculiar trick of the atmosphere the perfect plenitude of that golden sunset glory was lavished on the rugged sides and tangled crest of the lone star mountain that isolated peak the landmark of their claim the gaunt monument of their folly transfigured in the evening splendor kept its radiance unquenched long after the glow had fallen from the encompassing skies and when at last the rising moon step by step put out the fires along the winding valley and plains and crept up the bosky sides of the cañon the vanishing sunset was lost only to reappear as a golden crown  the eyes of the young man were fixed upon it with more than a momentary picturesque interest it had been the favorite ground of his prospecting exploits its lowest flank had been scarred in the old enthusiastic days with hydraulic engines or pierced with shafts but its central position in the claim and its superior height had always given it a commanding view of the extent of their valley and its approaches and it was this practical preeminence that alone attracted him at that moment he knew that from its crest he would be able to distinguish the figures of his companions as they crossed the valley near the cabin in the growing moonlight thus he could avoid encountering them on his way to the highroad and yet see them perhaps for the last time even in his sense of injury there was a strange satisfaction in the thought  the ascent was toilsome but familiar all along the dim trail he was accompanied by gentler memories of the past that seemed like the faint odor of spiced leaves and fragrant grasses wet with the rain and crushed beneath his ascending tread to exhale the sweeter perfume in his effort to subdue or rise above them there was the thicket of manzanita where they had broken noonday bread together here was the rock beside their maiden shafts where they had poured a wild libation in boyish enthusiasm of success and here the ledge where their first flag a red shirt heroically sacrificed was displayed from a longhandled shovel to the gaze of admirers below when he at last reached the summit the mysterious hush was still in the air as if in breathless sympathy with his expedition in the west the plain was faintly illuminated but disclosed no moving figures he turned towards the rising moon and moved slowly to the eastern edge suddenly he stopped another step would have been his last he stood upon the crumbling edge of a precipice a landslip had taken place on the eastern flank leaving the gaunt ribs and fleshless bones of lone star mountain bare in the moonlight he understood now the strange rumble and reverberation he had heard he understood now the strange hush of bird and beast in brake and thicket  although a single rapid glance convinced him that the slide had taken place in an unfrequented part of the mountain above an inaccessible cañon and reflection assured him his companions could not have reached that distance when it took place a feverish impulse led him to descend a few rods in the track of the avalanche the frequent recurrence of outcrop and angle made this comparatively easy here he called aloud the feeble echo of his own voice seemed only a dull impertinence to the significant silence he turned to reascend the furrowed flank of the mountain before him lay full in the moonlight to his excited fancy a dozen luminous starlike points in the rocky crevices started into life as he faced them throwing his arm over the ledge above him he supported himself for a moment by what appeared to be a projection of the solid rock it trembled slightly as he raised himself to its level his heart stopped beating it was simply a fragment detached from the outcrop lying loosely on the ledge but upholding him by its own weight only he examined it with trembling fingers the encumbering soil fell from its sides and left its smoothed and worn protuberances glistening in the moonlight it was virgin gold  looking back upon that moment afterwards he remembered that he was not dazed dazzled or startled it did not come to him as a discovery or an accident a stroke of chance or a caprice of fortune he saw it all in that supreme moment nature had worked out their poor deduction what their feeble engines had essayed spasmodically and helplessly against the curtain of soil that hid the treasure the elements had achieved with mightier but more patient forces the slow sapping of the winter rains had loosened the soil from the auriferous rock even while the swollen stream was carrying their impotent and shattered engines to the sea what mattered that his single arm could not lift the treasure he had found what mattered that to unfix those glittering stars would still tax both skill and patience the work was done the goal was reached even his boyish impatience was content with that he rose slowly to his feet unstrapped his longhandled shovel from his back secured it in the crevice and quietly regained the summit  it was all his own his own by right of discovery under the law of the land and without accepting a favor from them he recalled even the fact that it was his prospecting on the mountain that first suggested the existence of gold in the outcrop and the use of the hydraulic he had never abandoned that belief whatever the others had done he dwelt somewhat indignantly to himself on this circumstance and half unconsciously faced defiantly towards the plain below but it was sleeping peacefully in the full sight of the moon without life or motion he looked at the stars it was still far from midnight his companions had no doubt long since returned to the cabin to prepare for their midnight journey they were discussing him perhaps laughing at him or worse pitying him and his bargain yet here was his bargain a slight laugh he gave vent to here startled him a little it sounded so hard and so unmirthful and so unlike as he oddly fancied what he really thought but what did he think  nothing mean or revengeful no they never would say that when he had taken out all the surface gold and put the mine in working order he would send them each a draft for a thousand dollars of course if they were ever ill or poor he would do more one of the first the very first things he should do would be to send them each a handsome gun and tell them that he only asked in return the oldfashioned rifle that once was his looking back at the moment in afteryears he wondered that with this exception he made no plans for his own future or the way he should dispose of his newly acquired wealth this was the more singular as it had been the custom of the five partners to lie awake at night audibly comparing with each other what they would do in case they made a strike he remembered how alnascharlike they nearly separated once over a difference in the disposal of a hundred thousand dollars that they never had nor expected to have he remembered how union mills always began his career as a millionaire by a square meal at delmonicos how the right bowers initial step was always a trip home to see his mother how the left bower would immediately placate the parents of his beloved with priceless gifts it may be parenthetically remarked that the parents and the beloved one were as hypothetical as the fortune and how the judge would make his first start as a capitalist by breaking a certain faro bank in sacramento he himself had been equally eloquent in extravagant fancy in those penniless days he who now was quite cold and impassive beside the more extravagant reality  how different it might have been if they had only waited a day longer if they had only broken their resolves to him kindly and parted in good will how he would long ere this have rushed to greet them with the joyful news how they would have danced around it sung themselves hoarse laughed down their enemies and run up the flag triumphantly on the summit of the lone star mountain how they would have crowned him the old man the hero of the camp how he would have told them the whole story how some strange instinct had impelled him to ascend the summit and how another step on that summit would have precipitated him into the cañon and howbut what if somebody else union mills or the judge had been the first discoverer might they not have meanly kept the secret from him have selfishly helped themselves and done  what you are doing now  the hot blood rushed to his cheek as if a strange voice were at his ear for a moment he could not believe that it came from his own pale lips until he found himself speaking he rose to his feet tingling with shame and began hurriedly to descend the mountain  he would go to them tell them of his discovery let them give him his share and leave them forever it was the only thing to be done strange that he had not thought of it at once yet it was hard very hard and cruel to be forced to meet them again what had he done to suffer this mortification for a moment he actually hated this vulgar treasure that had forever buried under its gross ponderability the light and careless past and utterly crushed out the poetry of their old indolent happy existence  he was sure to find them waiting at the cross roads where the coach came past it was three miles away yet he could get there in time if he hastened it was a wise and practical conclusion of his evenings work a lame and impotent conclusion to his evenings indignation  no matter they would perhaps at first think he had come to weakly follow them perhaps they would at first doubt his story no matter he bit his lips to keep down the foolish rising tears but still went blindly forward  he saw not the beautiful night cradled in the dark hills swathed in luminous mists and hushed in the awe of its own loveliness here and there the moon had laid her calm face on lake and overflow and gone to sleep embracing them until the whole plain seemed to be lifted into infinite quiet walking on as in a dream the black impenetrable barriers of skirting thickets opened and gave way to vague distances that it appeared impossible to reach dim vistas that seemed unapproachable gradually he seemed himself to become a part of the mysterious night he was becoming as pulseless as calm as passionless  what was that a shot in the direction of the cabin yet so faint so echoless so ineffective in the vast silence that he would have thought it his fancy but for the strange instinctive jar upon his sensitive nerves was it an accident or was it an intentional signal to him he stopped it was not repeated the silence reasserted itself but this time with an ominous deathlike suggestion a sudden and terrible thought crossed his mind he cast aside his pack and all encumbering weight took a deep breath lowered his head and darted like a deer in the direction of the challenge   ii  the exodus of the seceding partners of the lone star claim had been scarcely an imposing one for the first five minutes after quitting the cabin the procession was straggling and vagabond unwonted exertion had exaggerated the lameness of some and feebleness of moral purpose had predisposed the others to obtrusive musical exhibition union mills limped and whistled with affected abstraction the judge whistled and limped with affected earnestness the right bower led the way with some show of definite design the left bower followed with his hands in his pockets the two feebler natures drawn together in unconscious sympathy looked vaguely at each other for support  you see said the judge suddenly as if triumphantly concluding an argument there aint anything better for a young fellow than independence nature so to speak points the way look at the animals  theres a skunk hereabouts said union mills who was supposed to be gifted with aristocratically sensitive nostrils within ten miles of this place like as not crossing the ridge its always my luck to happen out just at such times i dont see the necessity anyhow of trapesing round the claim now if we calculate to leave it tonight  both men waited to observe if the suggestion was taken up by the right and left bower moodily plodding ahead no response following the judge shamelessly abandoned his companion  you wouldnt stand snoopin round instead of lettin the old man get used to the idea alone no i could see all along that he was takin it in takin it in kindly but slowly and i reckoned the best thing for us to do was to git up and git until hed got round it the judges voice was slightly raised for the benefit of the two before him  didnt he say remarked the right bower stopping suddenly and facing the others didnt he say that that new trader was goin to let him have some provisions anyway  union mills turned appealingly to the judge that gentleman was forced to reply yes i remember distinctly he said it it was one of the things i was particular about on his account responded the judge with the air of having arranged it all himself with the new trader i remember i was easier in my mind about it  but didnt he say queried the left bower also stopping short suthin about its being contingent on our doing some work on the race  the judge turned for support to union mills who however under the hollow pretense of preparing for a long conference had luxuriously seated himself on a stump the judge sat down also and replied hesitatingly well yes us or him  us or him repeated the right bower with gloomy irony and you aint quite clear in your mind are you if you havent done the work already youre just killing yourself with this spontaneous promiscuous and premature overwork thats whats the matter with you  i reckon i heard somebody say suthin about its being a chinamans threeday job interpolated the left bower with equal irony but i aint quite clear in my mind about that  itll be a sorter distraction for the old man said union mills feeblykinder take his mind off his loneliness  nobody taking the least notice of the remark union mills stretched out his legs more comfortably and took out his pipe he had scarcely done so when the right bower wheeling suddenly set off in the direction of the creek the left bower after a slight pause followed without a word the judge wisely conceiving it better to join the stronger party ran feebly after him and left union mills to bring up a weak and vacillating rear  their course diverging from lone star mountain led them now directly to the bend of the creek the base of their old ineffectual operations here was the beginning of the famous tailrace that skirted the new traders claim and then lost its way in a swampy hollow it was choked with debris a thin yellow stream that once ran through it seemed to have stopped work when they did and gone into greenish liquidation  they had scarcely spoken during this brief journey and had received no other explanation from the right bower who led them than that afforded by his mute example when he reached the race leaping into it without a word he at once began to clear away the broken timbers and driftwood fired by the spectacle of what appeared to be a new and utterly frivolous game the men gayly leaped after him and were soon engaged in a fascinating struggle with the impeded race the judge forgot his lameness in springing over a broken sluicebox union mills forgot his whistle in a happy imitation of a chinese coolies song nevertheless after ten minutes of this mild dissipation the pastime flagged union mills was beginning to rub his leg when a distant rumble shook the earth the men looked at each other the diversion was complete a languid discussion of the probabilities of its being an earthquake or a blast followed in the midst of which the right bower who was working a little in advance of the others uttered a warning cry and leaped from the race his companions had barely time to follow before a sudden and inexplicable rise in the waters of the creek sent a swift irruption of the flood through the race in an instant its choked and impeded channel was cleared the race was free and the scattered debris of logs and timber floated upon its easy current quick to take advantage of this laborsaving phenomenon the lone star partners sprang into the water and by disentangling and directing the eddying fragments completed their work  the old man oughter been here to see this said the left bower its just one o them climaxes of poetic justice hes always huntin up its easy to see whats happened one o them hightoned shrimps over in the excelsior claim has put a blast in too near the creek hes tumbled the bank into the creek and sent the back water down here just to wash out our race thats what i call poetical retribution  and who was it advised us to dam the creek below the race and make it do the thing asked the right bower moodily  that was one of the old mans ideas i reckon said the left bower dubiously  and you remember broke in the judge with animation i allus said go slow go slow you just hold on and suthin will happen and he added triumphantly you see suthin has happened i dont want to take credit to myself but i reckoned on them excelsior boys bein fools and took the chances  and what if i happen to know that the excelsior boys aint blastin today said the right bower sarcastically  as the judge had evidently based his hypothesis on the alleged fact of a blast he deftly evaded the point i aint sayin the old mans head aint level on some things he wants a little more sabe of the world hes improved a good deal in euchre lately and in pokerwell hes got that sorter dreamy listenintotheangels kind o way that you cant exactly tell whether hes bluffin or has got a full hand hasnt he he asked appealing to union mills  but that gentleman who had been watching the dark face of the right bower preferred to take what he believed to be his cue from him that aint the question he said virtuously we aint takin this step to make a card sharp out of him were not doin chinamens work in this race today for that no sir were teachin him to paddle his own canoe not finding the sympathetic response he looked for in the right bowers face he turned to the left  i reckon we were teachin him our canoe was too full was the left bowers unexpected reply thats about the size of it  the right bower shot a rapid glance under his brows at his brother the latter with his hands in his pockets stared unconsciously at the rushing water and then quietly turned away the right bower followed him are you goin back on us he asked  are you responded the other  no  no then it is returned the left bower quietly the elder brother hesitated in halfangry embarrassment  then what did you mean by saying we reckoned our canoe was too full  wasnt that our idea returned the left bower indifferently confounded by this practical expression of his own unformulated good intentions the right bower was staggered  speakin of the old man broke in the judge with characteristic infelicity i reckon hell sort o miss us times like these we were allers runnin him and bedevilin him after work just to get him excited and amusin and hell kinder miss that sort o stimulatin i reckon well miss it too somewhat dont you remember boys the night we put up that little sell on him and made him believe wed struck it rich in the bank of the creek and got him so conceited he wanted to go off and settle all our debts at once  and how i came bustin into the cabin with a pan full of iron pyrites and black sand chuckled union mills continuing the reminiscences and how them big gray eyes of his nearly bulged out of his head well its some satisfaction to know we did our duty by the young fellow even in those little things he turned for confirmation of their general disinterestedness to the right bower but he was already striding away uneasily conscious of the lazy following of the left bower like a laggard conscience at his back this movement again threw union mills and the judge into feeble complicity in the rear as the procession slowly straggled homeward from the creek  night had fallen their way lay through the shadow of lone star mountain deepened here and there by the slight bosky ridges that starting from its base crept across the plain like vast roots of its swelling trunk the shadows were growing blacker as the moon began to assert itself over the rest of the valley when the right bower halted suddenly on one of these ridges the left bower lounged up to him and stopped also while the two others came up and completed the group  theres no light in the shanty said the right bower in a low voice half to himself and half in answer to their inquiring attitude the men followed the direction of his finger in the distance the black outline of the lone star cabin stood out distinctly in the illumined space there was the blank sightless external glitter of moonlight on its two windows that seemed to reflect its dim vacancy empty alike of light and warmth and motion  thats singlar said the judge in an awed whisper  the left bower by simply altering the position of his hands in his trousers pockets managed to suggest that he knew perfectly the meaning of it had always known it but that being now so to speak in the hands of fate he was callous to it this much at least the elder brother read in his attitude but anxiety at that moment was the controlling impulse of the right bower as a certain superstitious remorse was the instinct of the two others and without heeding the cynic the three started at a rapid pace for the cabin  they reached it silently as the moon now riding high in the heavens seemed to touch it with the tender grace and hushed repose of a tomb it was with something of this feeling that the right bower softly pushed open the door it was with something of this dread that the two others lingered on the threshold until the right bower after vainly trying to stir the dead embers on the hearth into life with his foot struck a match and lit their solitary candle its flickering light revealed the familiar interior unchanged in aught but one thing the bunk that the old man had occupied was stripped of its blankets the few cheap ornaments and photographs were gone the rude poverty of the bare boards and scant pallet looked up at them unrelieved by the bright face and gracious youth that had once made them tolerable in the grim irony of that exposure their own penury was doubly conscious the little knapsack the teacup and coffeepot that had hung near his bed were gone also the most indignant protest the most pathetic of the letters he had composed and rejected whose torn fragments still littered the floor could never have spoken with the eloquence of this empty space the men exchanged no words the solitude of the cabin instead of drawing them together seemed to isolate each one in selfish distrust of the others even the unthinking garrulity of union mills and the judge was checked a moment later when the left bower entered the cabin his presence was scarcely noticed  the silence was broken by a joyous exclamation from the judge he had discovered the old mans rifle in the corner where it had been at first overlooked he aint gone yet gentlemenfor yers his rifle he broke in with a feverish return of volubility and a high excited falsetto he wouldnt have left this behind no i knowed it from the first hes just outside a bit foraging for wood and water no sir coming along here i said to union millsdidnt ibet your life the old mans not far off even if he aint in the cabin why the moment i stepped foot  and i said coming along interrupted union mills with equally reviving mendacity like as not hes hangin round yer and lyin low just to give us a surprise he ho  hes gone for good and he left that rifle here on purpose said the left bower in a low voice taking the weapon almost tenderly in his hands  drop it then said the right bower the voice was that of his brother but suddenly changed with passion the two other partners drew back in alarm  ill not leave it here for the first comer said the left bower calmly because weve been fools and he too its too good a weapon for that  drop it i say said the right bower with a savage stride towards him  the younger brother brought the rifle to a half charge with a white face but a steady eye  stop where you are he said collectedly dont row with me because you havent either the grit to stick to your ideas or the heart to confess them wrong weve followed your lead andhere we are the camps broken upthe old mans goneand were going and as for the dd rifle  drop it do you hear shouted the right bower clinging to that one idea with the blind pertinacity of rage and a losing cause drop it  the left bower drew back but his brother had seized the barrel with both hands there was a momentary struggle a flash through the halflighted cabin and a shattering report the two men fell back from each other the rifle dropped on the floor between them  the whole thing was over so quickly that the other two partners had not had time to obey their common impulse to separate them and consequently even now could scarcely understand what had passed it was over so quickly that the two actors themselves walked back to their places scarcely realizing their own act  a dead silence followed the judge and union mills looked at each other in dazed astonishment and then nervously set about their former habits apparently in that fatuous belief common to such natures that they were ignoring a painful situation the judge drew the barrel towards him picked up the cards and began mechanically to make a patience on which union mills gazed with ostentatious interest but with eyes furtively conscious of the rigid figure of the right bower by the chimney and the abstracted face of the left bower at the door ten minutes had passed in this occupation the judge and union mills conversing in the furtive whispers of children unavoidably but fascinatedly present at a family quarrel when a light step was heard upon the crackling brushwood outside and the bright panting face of the old man appeared upon the threshold there was a shout of joy in another moment he was halfburied in the bosom of the right bowers shirt halfdragged into the lap of the judge upsetting the barrel and completely encompassed by the left bower and union mills with the enthusiastic utterance of his name the spell was broken  happily unconscious of the previous excitement that had provoked this spontaneous unanimity of greeting the old man equally relieved at once broke into a feverish announcement of his discovery he painted the details with i fear a slight exaggeration of coloring due partly to his own excitement and partly to justify their own but he was strangely conscious that these bankrupt men appeared less elated with their personal interest in their stroke of fortune than with his own success i told you hed do it said the judge with a reckless unscrupulousness of the statement that carried everybody with it look at him the game little pup oh no he aint the right breed is he echoed union mills with arch irony while the right and left bower grasping either hand pressed a proud but silent greeting that was half new to him but wholly delicious it was not without difficulty that he could at last prevail upon them to return with him to the scene of his discovery or even then restrain them from attempting to carry him thither on their shoulders on the plea of his previous prolonged exertions once only there was a momentary embarrassment then you fired that shot to bring me back said the old man gratefully in the awkward silence that followed the hands of the two brothers sought and grasped each other penitently yes interposed the judge with delicate tact ye see the right and left bower almost quarreled to see which should be the first to fire for ye i disremember which didi never touched the trigger said the left bower hastily with a hurried backward kick the judge resumed it went off sorter spontaneous  the difference in the sentiment of the procession that once more issued from the lone star cabin did not fail to show itself in each individual partner according to his temperament the subtle tact of union mills however in expressing an awakened respect for their fortunate partner by addressing him as if unconsciously as mr ford was at first discomposing but even this was forgotten in their breathless excitement as they neared the base of the mountain when they had crossed the creek the right bower stopped reflectively  you say you heard the slide come down before you left the cabin he said turning to the old man  yes but i did not know then what it was it was about an hour and a half after you left was the reply  then look here boys continued the right bower with superstitious exultation it was the slide that tumbled into the creek overflowed it and helped us clear out the race  it seemed so clear that providence had taken the partners of the lone star directly in hand that they faced the toilsome ascent of the mountain with the assurance of conquerors they paused only on the summit to allow the old man to lead the way to the slope that held their treasure he advanced cautiously to the edge of the crumbling cliff stopped looked bewildered advanced again and then remained white and immovable in an instant the right bower was at his side  is anything the matter dontdont look so old man for gods sake  the old man pointed to the dull smooth black side of the mountain without a crag break or protuberance and said with ashen lips  its gone                                       and it was gone a second slide had taken place stripping the flank of the mountain and burying the treasure and the weak implement that had marked its side deep under a chaos of rock and débris at its base  thank god the blank faces of his companions turned quickly to the right bower thank god he repeated with his arm round the neck of the old man  had he stayed behind he would have been buried too he paused and pointing solemnly to the depths below said and thank god for showing us where we may yet labor for it in hope and patience like honest men  the men silently bowed their heads and slowly descended the mountain but when they had reached the plain one of them called out to the others to watch a star that seemed to be rising and moving towards them over the hushed and sleeping valley  its only the stagecoach boys said the left bower smiling the coach that was to take us away  in the security of their newfound fraternity they resolved to wait and see it pass as it swept by with flash of light beat of hoofs and jingle of harness the only real presence in the dreamy landscape the driver shouted a hoarse greeting to the phantom partners audible only to the judge who was nearest the vehicle  did you heardid you hear what he said boys he gasped turning to his companions no shake hands all round boys god bless you all boys to think we didnt know it all this while  know what  merry christmas    a ship of 49   it had rained so persistently in san francisco during the first week of january 1854 that a certain quagmire in the roadway of long wharf had become impassable and a plank was thrown over its dangerous depth indeed so treacherous was the spot that it was alleged on good authority that a hastily embarking traveler had once hopelessly lost his portmanteau and was fain to dispose of his entire interest in it for the sum of two dollars and fifty cents to a speculative stranger on the wharf as the strangers search was rewarded afterwards only by the discovery of the body of a casual chinaman who had evidently endeavored wickedly to anticipate him a feeling of commercial insecurity was added to the other eccentricities of the locality  the plank led to the door of a building that was a marvel even in the chaotic frontier architecture of the street the houses on either sideirregular frames of wood or corrugated ironbore evidence of having been quickly thrown together to meet the requirements of the goods and passengers who were once disembarked on what was the muddy beach of the infant city but the building in question exhibited a certain elaboration of form and design utterly inconsistent with this idea the structure obtruded a bowed front to the street with a curving line of small windows surmounted by elaborate carvings and scroll work of vines and leaves while below in faded gilt letters appeared the legend pontiacmarseilles the effect of this incongruity was startling  it is related that an inebriated miner impeded by mud and drink before its door was found gazing at its remarkable façade with an expression of the deepest despondency i hev lived a free life pardner he explained thickly to the samaritan who succored him and every time since ive been on this six weeks jamboree might have kalkilated it would come to this snakes ive seen afore now and rats im not unfamiliar with but when it comes to the starn of a ship risin up out of the street i reckon its time to pass in my checks  it is a ship you blasted old soaker said the samaritan curtly  it was indeed a ship a ship run ashore and abandoned on the beach years before by her goldseeking crew with the débris of her scattered stores and cargo overtaken by the wild growth of the strange city and the reclamation of the muddy flat wherein she lay hopelessly imbedded her retreat cut off by wharves and quays and breakwater jostled at first by sheds and then impacted in a block of solid warehouses and dwellings her rudder port and counter boarded in and now gazing hopelessly through her cabin windows upon the busy street before her but still a ship despite her transformation the faintest line of contour yet left visible spoke of the buoyancy of another element the balustrade of her roof was unmistakably a taffrail the rain slipped from her swelling sides with a certain lingering touch of the sea the soil around her was still treacherous with its suggestions and even the wind whistled nautically over her chimney if in the fury of some southwesterly gale she had one night slipped her strange moorings and left a shining track through the lower town to the distant sea no one would have been surprised  least of all perhaps her present owner and possessor mr abner nott for by the irony of circumstances mr nott was a far western farmer who had never seen a ship before nor a larger stream of water than a tributary of the missouri river in a spirit half of fascination half of speculation he had bought her at the time of her abandonment and had since mortgaged his ranch at petaluma with his live stock to defray the expenses of filling in the land where she stood and the improvements of the vicinity he had transferred his household goods and his only daughter to her cabin and had divided the space between decks and her hold into lodgingrooms and lofts for the storage of goods it could hardly be said that the investment had been profitable his tenants vaguely recognized that his occupancy was a sentimental rather than a commercial speculation and often generously lent themselves to the illusion by not paying their rent others treated their own tenancy as a jokea quaint recreation born of the childlike familiarity of frontier intercourse a few had left carelessly abandoning their unsalable goods to their landlord with great cheerfulness and a sense of favor occasionally mr abner nott in a practical relapse raged against the derelicts and talked of dispossessing them or even dismantling his tenement but he was easily placated by a compliment to the dear old ship or an effort made by some tenant to idealize his apartment a photographer who had ingeniously utilized the forecastle for a gallery accessible from the bows in the next street paid no further tribute than a portrait of the pretty face of rosey nott the superstitious reverence in which abner nott held his monstrous fancy was naturally enhanced by his purely bucolic exaggeration of its real functions and its native element this yer keel has sailed and sailed and sailed he would explain with some incongruity of illustration in a bee line makin tracks for days runnin i reckon more storms and blizzards hez tackled her than you ken shake a stick at shes stampeded whales afore now and sloshed round with pirates and freebooters in and outer the spanish main and across lots from marcelleys where she was rared and yer she sits peacefullike just ez if shed never been outer a pertater patch and hadnt ploughed the sea with fosails and studdin sails and them things cavortin round her masts  abner notts enthusiasm was shared by his daughter but with more imagination and an intelligence stimulated by the scant literature of her fathers emigrant wagon and the few books found on the cabin shelves but to her the strange shell she inhabited suggested more of the great world than the rude chaotic civilization she saw from the cabin windows or met in the persons of her fathers lodgers shut up for days in this quaint tenement she had seen it change from the enchanted playground of her childish fancy to the theater of her active maidenhood but without losing her ideal romance in it she had translated its history in her own way read its quaint nautical hieroglyphics after her own fashion and possessed herself of its secrets she had in fancy made voyages in it to foreign lands had heard the accents of a softer tongue on its decks and on summer nights from the roof of the quarterdeck had seen mellower constellations take the place of the hard metallic glitter of the californian skies sometimes in her isolation the long cylindrical vault she inhabited seemed like some vast seashell to become musical with the murmurings of the distant sea so completely had it taken the place of the usual instincts of feminine youth that she had forgotten she was pretty or that her dresses were old in fashion and scant in quantity after the first surprise of admiration her fathers lodgers ceased to follow the abstracted nymph except with their eyespartly respecting her spiritual shyness partly respecting the jealous supervision of the paternal nott she seldom penetrated the crowded center of the growing city her rare excursions were confined to the old ranch at petaluma whence she brought flowers and plants and even extemporized a hanginggarden on the quarterdeck  it was still raining and the wind which had increased to a gale was dashing the drops against the slanting cabin windows with a sound like spray when mr abner nott sat before a table seriously engaged with his accounts for it was steamer nightas that momentous day of reckoning before the sailing of the regular mail steamer was briefly known to commercial san franciscoand mr nott was subject at such times to severely practical relapses a swinging light seemed to bring into greater relief that peculiar encased casketlike security of the lowtimbered tightlyfitting apartment with its toylike utilities of space and made the pretty oval face of rosey nott appear a characteristic ornament the sliding door of the cabin communicated with the main deck now roofed in and partitioned off so as to form a small passage that led to the open starboard gangway where a narrow enclosed staircase built on the ships side took the place of the ships ladder under her counter and opened in the street  a dash of rain against the window caused rosey to lift her eyes from her book  its much nicer here than at the ranch father she said coaxingly even leaving alone its being a beautiful ship instead of a shanty the wind dont whistle through the cracks and blow out the candle when youre reading nor the rain spoil your things hung up against the wall and you look more like a gentleman sitting in his ownshipyou know looking over his bills and getting ready to give his orders  vague and general as miss roseys compliment was it had its full effect upon her father who was at times dimly conscious of his hopeless rusticity and its incongruity with his surroundings yes he said awkwardly with a slight relaxation of his aggressive attitude yes in course its more bangup style but it dont payroseyit dont pay yers the pontiac that oughter be bringin in ez rents go at least three hundred a month dont make her taxes i bin thinkin seriously of sellin her  as rosey knew her father had experienced this serious contemplation on the first of every month for the last two years and cheerfully ignored it the next day she only said im sure the vacant rooms and lofts are all rented father  thats it returned mr nott thoughtfully plucking at his bushy whiskers with his fingers and thumb as if he were removing dead and sapless incumbrances in their growth thats just what it isthems ez in it themselves dont pay and them ez haz left their goodsthe goods dont pay the feller ez stored them iron sugar kettles in the forehold after trying to get me to make another advance on em sez he believes hell have to sacrifice em to me after all and only begs id give him a chance of buying back the half of em ten years from now at double what i advanced him the chap that left them five hundred cases of hair dye tween decks and then skipped out to sacramento met me the other day in the street and advised me to use a bottle ez an advertisement or try it on the starn of the pontiac for fireproof paint that foolishness ez all hes good for and yet thar might be suthin in the paint if a feller had nigger luck thers that new york chap ez bought up them damaged boxes of plug terbakker for fifty dollars a thousand and sold em for foundations for that new building in sansome street at a thousand clear profit its all luck rosey  the girls eyes had wandered again to the pages of her book perhaps she was already familiar with the text of her fathers monologue but recognizing an additional querulousness in his voice she laid the book aside and patiently folded her hands in her lap  thats rightfor ive suthin to tell ye the fact is sleight wants to buy the pontiac out and out just ez she stands with the two fifty vara lots she stands on  sleight wants to buy her sleight echoed rosey incredulously  you bet sleightthe big financier the smartest man in frisco  what does he want to buy her for asked rosey knitting her pretty brows  the apparently simple question suddenly puzzled mr nott he glanced feebly at his daughters face and frowned in vacant irritation thats so he said drawing a long breath theres suthin in that  what did he say continued the young girl impatiently  not much youve got the pontiac nott sez he you bet sez i whatll you take for her and the lot she stands on sez he short and sharp some fellers rosey said nott with a cunning smile would hev blurted out a big figger and been cotched that aint my style i just looked at him ill wait fur your figgers until next steamer day sez he and off he goes like a shot hes awfully sharp rosey  but if he is sharp father and he really wants to buy the ship returned rosey thoughtfully its only because he knows its valuable property and not because he likes it as we do he cant take that value away even if we dont sell it to him and all the while we have the comfort of the dear old pontiac dont you see  this exhaustive commercial reasoning was so sympathetic to mr notts instincts that he accepted it as conclusive he however deemed it wise to still preserve his practical attitude but that dont make it pay by the month rosey suthin must be done im thinking ill clean out that photographer  not just after hes taken such a pretty view of the cabin front of the pontiac from the street father no hes going to give us a copy and put the other in a shop window in montgomery street  thats so said mr nott musingly its no slouch of an advertisement the pontiac the property of a nott esq of st jo missouri send it on to your aunt phoebe sorter make the old folks open their eyesoh well seem hes been to some expense fittin up an entrance from the other street well let him slide but as to that dd old frenchman ferrers in the next loft with his stuckup airs and highfalutin style we must get quit of him hes regularly gouged me in that ere horsehair spekilation  how can you say that father said rosey with a slight increase of color it was your own offer you know those bales of curled horsehair were left behind by the late tenant to pay his rent when mr de ferrières rented the room afterwards you told him youd throw them in in the place of repairs and furniture it was your own offer  yes but i didnt reckon therd ever be a big price per pound paid for the darned stuff for sofys and cushions and sich  how do you know he knew it father responded rosey  then why did he look so silly at first and then put on airs when i joked him about it eh  perhaps he didnt understand your joking father hes a foreigner and shy and proud andnot like the others i dont think he knew what you meant then any more than he believed he was making a bargain before he may be poor but i think hes beenaagentleman  the young girls animation penetrated even mr notts slow comprehension her novel opposition and even the prettiness it enhanced gave him a dull premonition of pain his small round eyes became abstracted his mouth remained partly open even his fresh color slightly paled  you seem to have been takin stock of this yer man rosey he said with a faint attempt at archness if he warnt ez old ez a crow for all his young feathers id think he was makin up to you  but the passing glow had faded from her young cheeks and her eyes wandered again to her book he pays his rent regularly every steamer night she said quietly as if dismissing an exhausted subject and hell be here in a moment i dare say she took up her book and leaning her head on her hand once more became absorbed in its pages  an uneasy silence followed the rain beat against the windows the ticking of a clock became audible but still mr nott sat with vacant eyes fixed on his daughters face and the constrained smile on his lips he was conscious that he had never seen her look so pretty before yet he could not tell why this was no longer an unalloyed satisfaction not but that he had always accepted the admiration of others for her as a matter of course but for the first time he became conscious that she not only had an interest in others but apparently a superior knowledge of them how did she know these things about this man and why had she only now accidentally spoken of them he would have done so all this passed so vaguely through his unreflective mind that he was unable to retain any decided impression but the farreaching one that his lodger had obtained some occult influence over her through the exhibition of his baleful skill in the horsehair speculation them tricks is likely to take a young girls fancy i must look arter her he said to himself softly  a slow regular step in the gangway interrupted his paternal reflections hastily buttoning across his chest the peajacket which he usually wore at home as a single concession to his nautical surroundings he drew himself up with something of the assumption of a shipmaster despite certain bucolic suggestions of his boots and legs the footsteps approached nearer and a tall figure suddenly stood in the doorway  it was a figure so extraordinary that even in the strange masquerade of that early civilization it was remarkable a figure with whom father and daughter were already familiar without abatement of wonderthe figure of a rejuvenated old man padded powdered dyed and painted to the verge of caricature but without a single suggestion of ludicrousness or humor a face so artificial that it seemed almost a mask but like a mask more pathetic than amusing he was dressed in the extreme of fashion of a dozen years before his pearlgray trousers strapped tightly over his varnished boots his voluminous satin cravat and high collar embraced his rouged cheeks and dyed whiskers his closelybuttoned frock coat clinging to a waist that seemed accented by stays  he advanced two steps into the cabin with an upright precision of motion that might have hid the infirmities of age and said deliberately with a foreign accent  yourr accoumpt  in the actual presence of the apparition mr notts dignified resistance wavered but glancing uneasily at his daughter and seeing her calm eyes fixed on the speaker without embarrassment he folded his arms stiffly and with a lofty simulation of examining the ceiling said  ahem rosa the gentlemans account  it was an infelicitous action for the stranger who evidently had not noticed the presence of the young girl before started took a step quickly forward bent stiffly but profoundly over the little hand that held the account raised it to his lips and with a thousand pardons mademoiselle laid a small canvas bag containing the rent before the disorganized mr nott and stiffly vanished  the night was a troubled one to the simpleminded proprietor of the good ship pontiac unable to voice his uneasiness by further discussion but feeling that his late discomposing interview with his lodger demanded some marked protest he absented himself on the plea of business during the rest of the evening happily to his daughters utter obliviousness of the reason lights were burning brilliantly in countingrooms and offices the feverish life of the mercantile city was at its height with a vague idea of entering into immediate negotiations with mr sleight for the sale of the shipas a direct way out of his present perplexity he bent his steps towards the financiers office but paused and turned back before reaching the door he made his way to the wharf and gazed abstractedly at the lights reflected in the dark tremulous jellylike water but wherever he went he was accompanied by the absurd figure of his lodgera figure he had hitherto laughed at or half pitied but which now to his bewildered comprehension seemed to have a fateful significance here a new idea seized him and he hurried back to the ship slackening his pace only when he arrived at his own doorway here he paused a moment and slowly ascended the staircase when he reached the passage he coughed slightly and paused again then he pushed open the door of the darkened cabin and called softly  rosey  what is it father said roseys voice from the little stateroom on the rightroseys own bower  nothing said mr nott with an affectation of languid calmness i only wanted to know if you was comfortable its an awful busy night in town  yes father  i reckon thars tons o gold goin to the states tomorrow  yes father  pretty comfortable eh  yes father  well ill browse round a spell and turn in myself soon  yes father  mr nott took down a hanging lantern lighted it and passed out into the gangway another lamp hung from the companion hatch to light the tenants to the lower deck whence he descended this deck was divided fore and aft by a partitioned passagethe lofts or apartments being lighted from the ports and one or two by a door cut through the ships side communicating with an alley on either side this was the case with the loft occupied by mr notts strange lodger which besides a door in the passage had this independent communication with the alley nott had never known him to make use of the latter door on the contrary it was his regular habit to issue from his apartment at three oclock every afternoon dressed as he has been described stride deliberately through the passage to the upper deck and thence into the street where his strange figure was a feature of the principal promenade for two or three hours returning as regularly at eight oclock to the ship and the seclusion of his loft mr nott paused before the door under the pretense of throwing the light before him into the shadows of the forecastle all was silent within he was turning back when he was impressed by the regular recurrence of a peculiar rustling sound which he had at first referred to the rubbing of the wires of the swinging lantern against his clothing he set down the light and listened the sound was evidently on the other side of the partition the sound of some prolonged rustling scraping movement with regular intervals was it due to another of mr notts unprofitable tenantsthe rats no a bright idea flashed upon mr notts troubled mind it was de ferrières snoring he smiled grimly wonder if roseyd call him a gentleman if she heard that he chuckled to himself as he slowly made his way back to the cabin and the small stateroom opposite to his daughters during the rest of the night he dreamed of being compelled to give rosey in marriage to his lodger who added insult to the outrage by snoring audibly through the marriage service  meantime in her cradlelike nest in her nautical bower miss rosey slumbered as lightly waking from a vivid dream of venicea childs veniceseen from the swelling deck of the proudlyriding pontiac she was so impressed as to rise and cross on tiptoe to the little slanting porthole morning was already dawning over the flat straggling city but from every countinghouse and magazine the votive tapers of the feverish worshipers of trade and mammon were still flaring fiercely  ii  the day following steamer night was usually stale and flat at san francisco the reaction from the feverish exaltation of the previous twentyfour hours was seen in the listless faces and lounging feet of promenaders and was notable in the deserted offices and warehouses still redolent of last nights gas and strewn with the dead ashes of last nights fires there was a brief pause before the busy life which ran its course from steamer day to steamer day was once more taken up in that interval a few anxious speculators and investors breathed freely some critical situation was relieved or some impending catastrophe momentarily averted in particular a singular stroke of good fortune that morning befell mr nott he not only secured a new tenant but as he sagaciously believed introduced into the pontiac a counteracting influence to the subtle fascinations of de ferrières  the new tenant apparently possessed a combination of business shrewdness and brusque frankness that strongly impressed his landlord you see rosey said nott complacently describing the interview to his daughter when i sorter intimated in a keerless kind o way that sugar kettles and hair dye was about played out ez securities he just planked down the money for two months in advance there sez he thats your securitynow wheres mine i reckon i dont hitch on pardner sez i security what for spose you sell the ship sez he afore the two months is up ive heard that old sleight wants to buy her then you gets back your money sez i and lose my room sez he not much old man you sign a paper that whoever buys the ship inside o two months hez to buy me ez a tenant with it thats on the square so i sign the paper it was mighty cute in the young feller wasnt it he said scanning his daughters pretty puzzled face a little anxiously and dont you see ez i aint goin to sell the pontiac its just about ez cute in me eh hes a contractor somewhere around yer and wants to be near his work so he takes the room next to the frenchman that that shipcaptain quit for the mines and succeeds naterally to his chest and things hes mighty peartlooking that young feller roseylong black mustaches all his own color roseyand hes a regular highstepper you bet i reckon hes not only been a gentleman but ez now some o them contractors are very hightoned  i dont think we have any right to give him the captains chest father said rosey there may be some private things in it there were some letters and photographs in the hairdye mans trunk that you gave the photographer  thats just it rosey returned abner nott with sublime unconsciousness photographs and love letters you cant sell for cash and i dont mind givin em away if they kin make a fellercreature happy  but father have we the right to give em away  theyre collateral security rosey said her father grimly colateral he continued emphasizing each syllable by tapping the fist of one hand in the open palm of the other colateral is the word the big business sharps yer about call em you cant get round that he paused a moment and then as a new idea seemed to be painfully borne in his round eyes continued cautiously was that the reason why you wouldnt touch any of them dresses from the trunks of that opery gal ez skedaddled for sacramento and yet them trunks i regularly bought at auctionroseyat auction on specand they didnt realize the cost of drayage  a slight color mounted to roseys face no she said hastily not that hesitating a moment she then drew softly to his side and placing her arms around his neck turned his broad foolish face towards her own father she began when mother died would you have liked anybody to take her trunks and paw round her things and wear them  when your mother died just this side o sweetwater rosey said mr nott with beaming unconsciousness she had nt any trunks i reckon she had nt even an extra gown hanging up in the wagin cept the petticoat ez she had wrapped around yer it was about ez much ez we could do to skirmish round with injins alkali and cold and we sorter forgot to dress for dinner she never thought rosey that you and me would live to be inhabitin a paliss of a real ship ef she had she would have died a proud woman  he turned his small loving boarlike eyes upon her as a preternaturally innocent and trusting companion of ulysses might have regarded the transforming circe rosey turned away with the faintest sigh the habitual look of abstraction returned to her eyes as if she had once more taken refuge in her own ideal world unfortunately the change did not escape either the sensitive observation or the fatuous misconception of the sagacious parent yell be mountin a few furbelows and fixins rosey i reckon ez only natural mebbee yell have to prink up a little now that weve got a gentleman contractor in the ship ill see what i kin pick up in montgomery street and indeed he succeeded a few hours later in accomplishing with equal infelicity his generous design when she returned from her household tasks she found on her berth a purple velvet bonnet of extraordinary make and a pair of white satin slippers theyll do for a startoff rosey he explained and i got em at my figgers  but i go out so seldom father and a bonnet  thats so interrupted mr nott complacently it might be jest ez well for a young gal like yer to appear ez if she did go out or would go out if she wanted to so you kin be wearin that ar headstall kinder like this evening when the contractors here ez if youd jest come in from a pasear  miss rosey did not however immediately avail herself of her fathers purchase but contented herself with the usual scarlet ribbon that like a snood confined her brown hair when she returned to her tasks the space between the galley and the bulwarks had been her favorite resort in summer when not actually engaged in household work it was now lightly roofed over with boards and tarpaulin against the winter rain but still afforded her a verandalike space before the galley door where she could read or sew looking over the bow of the pontiac to the tossing bay or the farther range of the contra costa hills  hither miss rosey brought the purple prodigy partly to please her father partly with a view of subjecting it to violent radical changes but after trying it on before the tiny mirror in the galley once or twice her thoughts wandered away and she fell into one of her habitual reveries seated on a little stool before the galley door  she was aroused from it by the slight shaking and rattling of the doors of a small hatch on the deck not a dozen yards from where she sat it had been evidently fastened from below during the wet weather but as she gazed the fastenings were removed the doors were suddenly lifted and the head and shoulders of a young man emerged from the deck partly from her fathers description and partly from the impossibility of its being anybody else she at once conceived it to be the new lodger she had time to note that he was young and goodlooking graver perhaps than became his sudden pantomimic appearance but before she could observe him closely he had turned closed the hatch with a certain familiar dexterity and walked slowly towards the bows even in her slight bewilderment she observed that his step upon the deck seemed different to her fathers or the photographers and that he laid his hand on various objects with a halfcaressing ease and habit presently he paused and turned back and glancing at the galley door for the first time encountered her wondering eyes  it seemed so evident that she had been a curious spectator of his abrupt entrance on deck that he was at first disconcerted and confused but after a second glance at her he appeared to resume his composure and advanced a little defiantly towards the galley  i suppose i frightened you popping up the fore hatch just now  the what asked rosey  the fore hatch he repeated impatiently indicating it with a gesture  and thats the fore hatch she said abstractedly you seem to know ships  yesa little he said quietly i was below and unfastened the hatch to come up the quickest way and take a look round ive just hired a room here he added explanatorily  i thought so said rosey simply youre the contractor  the contractoroh yes you seem to know it all  fathers told me  oh hes your fathernott certainly i see now he continued looking at her with a half repressed smile certainly miss nott good morning he half added and walked towards the companionway something in the direction of his eyes as he turned away made rosey lift her hands to her head she had forgotten to remove her fathers baleful gift  she snatched it off and ran quickly to the companionway  sir she called  the young man turned halfway down the steps and looked up there was a faint color in her cheeks and her pretty brown hair was slightly disheveled from the hasty removal of the bonnet  fathers very particular about strangers being on this deck she said a little sharply  ohahim sorry i intruded  iithought id tell you said rosey frightened by her boldness into a feeble anticlimax  thank you  she came back slowly to the galley and picked up the unfortunate bonnet with a slight sense of remorse why should she feel angry with her poor fathers unhappy offering and what business had this strange young man to use the ship so familiarly yet she was vaguely conscious that she and her father with all their love and their domestic experience of it lacked a certain instinctive ease in its possession that the half indifferent stranger had shown on first treading its deck she walked to the hatchway and examined it with a new interest succeeding in lifting the hatch she gazed at the lower deck as she already knew the ladder had long since been removed to make room for one of the partitions the only way the stranger could have reached it was by leaping to one of the rings to make sure of this she let herself down holding on to the rings and dropped a couple of feet to the deck below she was in the narrow passage her father had penetrated the previous night before her was the door leading to de ferrifères loft always locked it was silent within it was the hour when the old frenchman made his habitual promenade in the city but the light from the newlyopened hatch allowed her to see more of the mysterious recesses of the forward bulkhead than she had known before and she was startled by observing another yawning hatchway at her feet from which the closelyfitting door had been lifted and which the new lodger had evidently forgotten to close again the young girl stooped down and peered cautiously into the black abyss nothing was to be seen nothing heard but the distant gurgle and click of water in some remoter depth she replaced the hatch and returned by way of the passage to the cabin  when her father came home that night she briefly recounted the interview with the new lodger and her discovery of his curiosity she did this with a possible increase of her usual shyness and abstraction and apparently more as a duty than a colloquial recreation but it pleased mr nott also to give it more than his usual misconception looking round the ship was heeh rosey he said with infinite archness in course kinder sweepin round the galley and offerin to fetch you wood and water eh even when the young girl had picked up her book with the usual faint smile of affectionate tolerance and then drifted away in its pages mr nott chuckled audibly i reckon old frenchy didnt come by when the young one was bedevlin you there  what father said rosey lifting her abstracted eyes to his face  at the moment it seemed impossible that any human intelligence could have suspected deceit or duplicity in roseys clear gaze but mr notts intelligence was superhuman i was sayin that mr ferrières didnt happen in while the young feller was thereeh  no father answered rosey with an effort to follow him out of the pages of her book why  but mr nott did not reply later in the evening he awkwardly waylaid the new lodger before the cabindoor as that gentleman would have passed on to his room  im afraid said the young man glancing at rosey that i intruded upon your daughter today i was a little curious to see the old ship and i didnt know what part of it was private  there aint no private part to this yer shipthat ez cepting the rooms and lofts said mr nott authoritatively then subjecting the anxious look of his daughter to his usual faculty for misconception he added thar aint no place whar you havent as much right to go ez any other man thar aint any man furriner or amerykan young or old dyed or undyed ez hev got any better rights you hear me young fellow mr renshawmy darter my dartermr renshaw rosey give the gentleman a chair shes only jest come in from a promeynade and hez jest taken off her bonnet he added with an arch look at rosey and a hurried look around the cabin as if he hoped to see the missing gift visible to the general eye so take a seat a minit wont ye  but mr renshaw after an observant glance at the young girls abstracted face brusquely excused himself ive got a letter to write he said with a half bow to rosey good night  he crossed the passage to the room that had been assigned to him and closing the door gave way to some irritability of temper in his efforts to light the lamp and adjust his writing materials for his excuse to mr nott was more truthful than most polite pretexts he had indeed a letter to write and one that being yet young in duplicity the near presence of his host rendered difficult for it ran as follows  dear sleight as i found i couldnt get a chance to make any examination of the ship except as occasion offered i just went in to rent lodgings in her from the godforsaken old ass who owns her and here i am a tenant for two months i contracted for that time in case the old fool should sell out to some one else before except that shes cut up a little between decks by the partitions for lofts that that pike county idiot has put into her she looks but little changed and her forehold as far as i can judge is intact it seems that nott bought her just as she stands with her cargo half out but he wasnt here when she broke cargo if anybody else had bought her but this cursed missourian who hasnt got the hayseed out of his hair i might have found out something from him and saved myself this kind of fooling which isnt in my line if i could get possession of a loft on the main deck well forward just over the forehold i could satisfy myself in a few hours but the loft is rented by that crazy frenchman who parades montgomery street every afternoon and though old pike county wants to turn him out im afraid i cant get it for a week to come  if anything should happen to me just you waltz down here and corral my things at once for this old frontier pirate has a way of confiscating his lodgers trunks  yours dick   iii  if mr renshaw indulged in any further curiosity regarding the interior of the pontiac he did not make his active researches manifest to rosey nor in spite of her fathers invitation did he again approach the galleya fact which gave her her first vague impression in his favor he seemed also to avoid the various advances which mr nott appeared impelled to make whenever they met in the passage but did so without seemingly avoiding her and marked his half contemptuous indifference to the elder nott by an increase of respect to the young girl she would have liked to ask him something about ships and was sure his conversation would have been more interesting than that of old captain bower to whose cabin he had succeeded who had once told her a ship was the devils hencoop she would have liked also to explain to him that she was not in the habit of wearing a purple bonnet but her thoughts were presently engrossed by an experience which interrupted the even tenor of her young life  she had been as she afterwards remembered impressed with a nervous restlessness one afternoon which made it impossible for her to perform her ordinary household duties or even to indulge her favorite recreation of reading or castlebuilding she wandered over the ship and impelled by the same vague feeling of unrest descended to the lower deck and the forward bulkhead where she had discovered the open hatch it had not been again disturbed nor was there any trace of further exploration a little ashamed she knew not why of revisiting the scene of mr renshaws researches she was turning back when she noticed that the door which communicated with de ferrières loft was partly open the circumstance was so unusual that she stopped before it in surprise there was no sound from within it was the hour when its queer occupant was always absent he must have forgotten to lock the door or it had been unfastened by other hands after a moment of hesitation she pushed it further open and stepped into the room  by the dim light of two portholes she could see that the floor was strewn and piled with the contents of a broken bale of curled horsehair of which a few untouched bales still remained against the wall a heap of morocco skins some already cut in the form of chaircushion covers and a few cushions unfinished and unstuffed lay in the light of the ports and gave the apartment the appearance of a cheap workshop a rude instrument for combining the horsehair awls buttons and thread heaped on a small bench showed that active work had been but recently interrupted a cheap earthenware ewer and basin on the floor and a pallet made of an open bale of horsehair on which a ragged quilt and blanket were flung indicated that the solitary worker dwelt and slept beside his work  the truth flashed upon the young girls active brain quickened by seclusion and fed by solitary books she read with keen eyes the miserable secret of her fathers strange guest in the povertystricken walls in the mute evidences of menial handicraft performed in loneliness and privation in this piteous adaptation of an accident to save the conscious shame of premeditated toil she knew now why he had stammeringly refused to receive her fathers offer to buy back the goods he had given him she knew now how hardly gained was the pittance that paid his rent and supported his childish vanity and grotesque pride from a peg in the corner hung the familiar masquerade that hid his povertythe pearlgray trousers the black frockcoat the tall shining hatin hideous contrast to the penury of his surroundings but if they were here where was he and in what new disguise had he escaped from his poverty a vague uneasiness caused her to hesitate and return to the open door she had nearly reached it when her eye fell on the pallet which it partly illuminated a singular resemblance in the ragged heap made her draw closer the faded quilt was a dressinggown and clutching its folds lay a white wasted hand  the emigrant childhood of rose nott had been more than once shadowed by scalpingknives and she was acquainted with death she went fearlessly to the couch and found that the dressinggown was only an enwrapping of the emaciated and lifeless body of de ferrières she did not retreat or call for help but examined him closely he was unconscious but not pulseless he had evidently been strong enough to open the door for air or succor but had afterwards fallen into a fit on the couch she flew to her fathers locker and the galley fire returned and shut the door behind her and by the skillful use of hot water and whiskey soon had the satisfaction of seeing a faint color take the place of the faded rouge in the ghastly cheeks she was still chafing his hands when he slowly opened his eyes with a start he made a quick attempt to push aside her hand and rise but she gently restrained him  ehwhat he stammered throwing his face back from hers with an effort and trying to turn it to the wall  you have been ill she said quietly drink this  with his face still turned away he lifted the cup to his chattering teeth when he had drained it he threw a trembling glance round the room and at the door  theres no one been here but myself she said quickly i happened to see the door open as i passed i didnt think it worth while to call any one  the searching look he gave her turned into an expression of relief which to her infinite uneasiness again feebly lightened into one of antiquated gallantry he drew the dressinggown around him with an air  ah it is a goddess mademoiselle that has deigned to enter the cell wherewherei amuse myself it is droll is it not i came here to makewhat you callthe experiment of your fathers fabric i make myselfha halike a workman ah bah the heat the darkness the plebeian motion make my head to go round i stagger i faint i cry out i fall but what of that the great god hears my cry and sends me an angel voilà  he attempted an easy gesture of gallantry but overbalanced himself and fell sideways on the pallet with a gasp yet there was so much genuine feeling mixed with his grotesque affectation so much piteous consciousness of the ineffectiveness of his falsehood that the young girl who had turned away came back and laid her hand upon his arm  you must lie still and try to sleep she said gently i will return again perhaps she added there is some one i can send for  he shook his head violently then in his old manner added after mademoiselleno one  i meanshe hesitated have you no friends  friendsah without doubt he shrugged his shoulders but mademoiselle will comprehend  you are better now said rosey quickly and no one need know anything if you dont wish it try to sleep you need not lock the door when i go i will see that no one comes in  he flushed faintly and averted his eyes it is too droll mademoiselle is it not  of course it is said rosey glancing round the miserable room  and mademoiselle is an angel  he carried her hand to his lips humblyhis first purely unaffected action she slipped through the door and softly closed it behind her  reaching the upper deck she was relieved to find her father had not returned and her absence had been unnoticed for she had resolved to keep de ferrières secret to herself from the moment that she had unwittingly discovered it and to do this and still be able to watch over him without her fathers knowledge required some caution she was conscious of his strange aversion to the unfortunate man without understanding the reason but as she was in the habit of entertaining his caprices more from affectionate tolerance of his weakness than reverence of his judgment she saw no disloyalty to him in withholding a confidence that might be disloyal to another it wont do father any good to know it she said to herself and if it did it oughtnt to she added with triumphant feminine logic but the impression made upon her by the spectacle she had just witnessed was stronger than any other consideration the revelation of de ferrièfres secret poverty seemed a chapter from a romance of her own weaving for a moment it lifted the miserable hero out of the depths of his folly and selfishness she forgot the weakness of the man in the strength of his dramatic surroundings it partly satisfied a craving she had felt it was not exactly the story of the ship as she had dreamed it but it was an episode in her experience of it that broke its monotony that she should soon learn perhaps from de ferrières own lips the true reason of his strange seclusion and that it involved more than appeared to her now she never for a moment doubted  at the end of an hour she again knocked softly at the door carrying some light nourishment she had prepared for him he was asleep but she was astounded to find that in the interval he had managed to dress himself completely in his antiquated finery it was a momentary shock to the allusion she had been fostering but she forgot it in the pitiable contrast between his haggard face and his pomatumed hair and beard the jauntiness of his attire and the collapse of his invalid figure when she had satisfied herself that his sleep was natural she busied herself softly in arranging the miserable apartment with a few feminine touches she removed the slovenliness of misery and placed the loose material and ostentatious evidences of his work on one side finding that he still slept and knowing the importance of this natural medication she placed the refreshment she had brought by his side and noiselessly quitted the apartment hurrying through the gathering darkness between decks she once or twice thought she heard footsteps and paused but encountering no one attributed the impression to her overconsciousness yet she thought it prudent to go to the galley first where she lingered a few moments before returning to the cabin on entering she was a little startled at observing a figure seated at her fathers desk but was relieved at finding it was mr renshaw  he rose and put aside the book he had idly picked up i am afraid i am an intentional intruder this time miss nott but i found no one here and i was tempted to look into this shipshape little snuggery you see the temptation got the better of me  his voice and smile were so frank and pleasant so free from his previous restraint yet still respectful so youthful yet manly that rosey was affected by them even in her preoccupation her eyes brightened and then dropped before his admiring glance had she known that the excitement of the last few hours had brought a wonderful charm into her pretty face had aroused the slumbering life of her halfwakened beauty she would have been more confused as it was she was only glad that the young man should turn out to be nice perhaps he might tell her something about ships perhaps if she had only known him longer she might with de ferrières permission have shared her confidence with him and enlisted his sympathy and assistance she contented herself with showing this anticipatory gratitude in her face as she begged him with the timidity of a maiden hostess to resume his seat  but mr renshaw seemed to talk only to make her talk and i am forced to admit that rosey found this almost as pleasant it was not long before he was in possession of her simple history from the day of her baby emigration to california to the transfer of her childish life to the old ship and even of much of the romantic fancies she had woven into her existence there whatever ulterior purpose he had in view he listened as attentively as if her artless chronicle was filled with practical information once when she had paused for breath he said gravely i must ask you to show me over this wonderful ship some day that i may see it with your eyes  but i think you know it already better than i do said rosey with a smile  mr renshaws brow clouded slightly ah he said with a touch of his former restraint and why  well said rosey timidly i thought you went round and touched things in a familiar way as if you had handled them before  the young man raised his eyes to roseys and kept them there long enough to bring back his gentler expression then because i found you trying on a very queer bonnet the first day i saw you he said mischievously i ought to believe you were in the habit of wearing one  in the first flush of mutual admiration young people are apt to find a laugh quite as significant as a sigh for an expression of sympathetic communion and this masterstroke of wit convulsed them both in the midst of it mr nott entered the cabin but the complacency with which he viewed the evident perfect understanding of the pair was destined to suffer some abatement rosey suddenly conscious that she was in some way participating in the ridicule of her father through his unhappy gift became embarrassed mr renshaws restraint returned with the presence of the old man in vain at first abner nott strove with profound levity to indicate his arch comprehension of the situation and in vain later becoming alarmed he endeavored with cheerful gravity to indicate his utter obliviousness of any but a business significance in their têteàtête  i oughtnt to hev intruded rosey he said when you and the gentleman were talkin of contracts mebbee but dont mind me im on the fly anyhow rosey dear hevin to see a man round the corner  but even the attitude of withdrawing did not prevent the exit of renshaw to his apartment and of rosey to the galley left alone in the cabin abner nott felt in the knots and tangles of his beard for a reason glancing down at his prodigious boots which covered with mud and gravel strongly emphasized his agricultural origin and gave him a general appearance of standing on his own broad acres he was struck with an idea its them boots he whispered to himself softly they somehow dont seem xactly to trump or follow suit in this yer cabin they dont hitch into anythin but jist slosh round loose and so to speak play it alone and them young critters natrally feels it and gets out o the way acting upon this instinct with his usual precipitate caution he at once proceeded to the nearest secondhand shop and purchasing a pair of enormous carpet slippers originally the property of a gouty seacaptain reappeared with a strong suggestion of newly upholstering the cabin the improvement however was fraught with a portentous circumstance mr notts footsteps which usually announced his approach all over the ship became stealthy and inaudible  meantime miss rosey had taken advantage of the absence of her father to visit her patient to avoid attracting attention she did not take a light but groped her way to the lower deck and rapped softly at the door it was instantly opened by de ferrières he had apparently appreciated the few changes she had already made in the room and had himself cleared away the pallet from which he had risen to make two low seats against the wall two bits of candle placed on the floor illuminated the beams above the dressinggown was artistically draped over the solitary chair and a pile of cushions formed another seat with elaborate courtesy he handed miss rosey to the chair he looked pale and weak though the gravity of the attack had evidently passed yet he persisted in remaining standing if i sit he explained with a gesture i shall again disgrace myself by sleeping in mademoiselles presence yes i shall sleepi shall dreamand wake to find her gone  more embarrassed by his recovery than when he was lying helplessly before her she said hesitatingly that she was glad he was better and that she hoped he liked the broth  it was manna from heaven mademoiselle see i have taken it allevery precious drop what else could i have done for mademoiselles kindness  he showed her the empty bowl a swift conviction came upon her that the man had been suffering from want of food the thought restored her selfpossession even while it brought the tears to her eyes i wish you would let me speak to fatheror some one she said impulsively and stopped  a quick and half insane gleam of terror and suspicion lit up his deep eyes for what mademoiselle for an accidentthat is nothingabsolutely nothing for i am strong and well nowsee he said tremblingly or for a whimfor a folly you may say that they will misunderstand no mademoiselle is good is wise she will say to herself i understand my friend monsieur de ferrières for the moment has a secret he would seem poor he would take the rôle of artisan he would shut himself up in these wallsperhaps i may guess why but it is his secret i think of it no more he caught her hand in his with a gesture that he would have made one of gallantry but that in its tremulous intensity became a piteous supplication  i have said nothing and will say nothing if you wish it said rosey hastily but others may find out how you live here this is not fit work for you you seem to be aa gentleman you ought to be a lawyer or a doctor or in a bank she continued timidly with a vague enumeration of the prevailing degrees of local gentility  he dropped her hand ah does not mademoiselle comprehend that it is because i am a gentleman that there is nothing between it and this look he continued almost fiercely what if i told you it is the lawyer it is the doctor it is the banker that brings me a gentleman to this eh ah bah what do i say this is honest what i do but the lawyer the banker the doctor what are they he shrugged his shoulders and pacing the apartment with a furtive glance at the half anxious half frightened girl suddenly stopped dragged a small portmanteau from behind the heap of bales and opened it look mademoiselle he said tremulously lifting a handful of worn and soiled letters and papers lookthese are the tools of your banker your lawyer your doctor with this the banker will make you poor the lawyer will prove you a thief the doctor will swear you are crazy eh what shall you call the work of a gentlemanthishe dragged the pile of cushions forwardor this  to the young girls observant eyes some of the papers appeared to be of a legal or official character and others like bills of lading with which she was familiar their half theatrical exhibition reminded her of some play she had seen they might be the clue to some story or the mere worthless hoardings of some diseased fancy whatever they were de ferrières did not apparently care to explain further indeed the next moment his manner changed to his old absurd extravagance but this is stupid for mademoiselle to hear what shall we speak of ah what should we speak of in mademoiselles presence  but are not these papers valuable asked rosey partly to draw her hosts thoughts back to their former channel  perhaps he paused and regarded the young girl fixedly does mademoiselle think so  i dont know said rosey how should i  ah if mademoiselle thought soif mademoiselle would deignhe stopped again and placed his hand upon his forehead it might be so he muttered  i must go now said rosey hurriedly rising with an awkward sense of constraint father will wonder where i am  i shall explain i will accompany you mademoiselle  no no said rosey quickly he must not know i have been here she stopped the honest blush flew to her cheek and then returned again because she had blushed  de ferrières gazed at her with an exalted look then drawing himself to his full height he said with an exaggerated and indescribable gesture go my child go tell your father that you have been alone and unprotected in the abode of poverty and suffering butthat it was in the presence of armand de ferrières  he threw open the door with a bow that nearly swept the ground but did not again offer to take her hand at once impressed and embarrassed at this crowning incongruity her pretty lips trembled between a smile and a cry as she said goodnight and slipped away into the darkness  erect and grotesque de ferrières retained the same attitude until the sound of her footsteps was lost when he slowly began to close the door but a strong arm arrested it from without and a large carpeted foot appeared at the bottom of the narrowing opening the door yielded and mr abner nott entered the room   iv  with an exclamation and a hurried glance around him de ferrières threw himself before the intruder but slowly lifting his large hand and placing it on his lodgers breast he quietly overbore the sick mans feeble resistance with an impact of power that seemed almost as moral as it was physical he did not appear to take any notice of the room or its miserable surroundings indeed scarcely of the occupant still pushing him with abstracted eyes and immobile face to the chair that rosey had just quitted he made him sit down and then took up his own position on the pile of cushions opposite his usually underdone complexion was of watery blueness but his dull abstracted glance appeared to exercise a certain dumb narcotic fascination on his lodger  i mout said nott slowly hev laid ye out here on sight without enny warnin or dropped ye in yer tracks in montgomery street wherever there was room to work a sixshooter in comfably johnson of petalunyhim ye know ez hed a game eyefetched flynn comin outer meetin one sunday and it was only on account of his wife and she a secondhand one so to speak there was walker of contra costa plugged that young sacramento chap whose name i disremember full o holes jest ez he was sayin goodby to his darter i mout hev done all this if it had settled things to please me for while you and flynn and that sacramento chap ez all about the same sort o men roseys a different kind from their sort o women  mademoiselle is an angel said de ferrières suddenly rising with an excess of extravagance a saint look i cram the lie ha down his throat who challenges it  ef by mamselle ye mean my rosey said nott quietly laying his powerful hands on de ferrières shoulders and slowly pinning him down again upon his chair yere about right though she aint mamselle yet ez i was sayin i might hev killed you offhand ef i hed thought it would hev been a good thing for rosey  for her ah well look i am ready interrupted de ferrières again springing to his feet and throwing open his coat with both hands see here at my heartfire  ez i was sayin continued nott once more pressing the excited man down in his chair i might hev wiped ye outand mebbee ye wouldnt hev keeredor you might hev wiped me out and i mout hev said thankee but i reckon this aint a case for whats comfable for you and me its whats good for rosey and the thing to kalkilate is whats to be done  his small round eyes for the first time rested on de ferrières face and were quickly withdrawn it was evident that this abstracted look which had fascinated his lodger was merely a resolute avoidance of de ferrières glance and it became apparent later that this avoidance was due to a ludicrous appreciation of de ferrières attractions  and after weve done that we must kalkilate what rosey is and what rosey wants praps ye allow you know what rosey is praps youve seen her prance round in velvet bonnets and white satin slippers and sich praps youve seen her readin tracks and vyages without waitin to spell a word or catch her breath but that aint the rosey ez i knows its a little child ez uster crawl in and out the tailboard of a mizzouri wagon on the alcalipizoned plains where there wasnt another bit of gods mercy on yearth to be seen for miles and miles its a little gal as uster hunger and thirst ez quiet and mannerly ez she now eats and drinks in plenty whose voice was ez steady with injins yellin round yer nest in the leaves on sweetwater ez in her purty cabin up yonder thats the gal ez i knows thats the rosey ez my ole woman puts into my arms one night arter we left laramie when the fever was high and sez abner sez she the chariot is swingin low for me tonight but thar aint room in it for her or you to git in or hitch on take her and rare her so we kin all jine on the other shore sez she and id knowed the other shore wasnt no kaliforny and that night praps the chariot swung lower than ever before and my ole woman stepped into it and left me and rosey to creep on in the old wagon alone its them kind o things added mr nott thoughtfully that seem to pint to my killin you on sight ez the best thing to be done and yet rosey mightnt like it  he had slipped one of his feet out of his huge carpet slippers and as he reached down to put it on again he added calmly and ez to yer marrying her it aint to be done  the utterly bewildered expression which transfigured de ferrières face at this announcement was unobserved by notts averted eyes nor did he perceive that his listener the next moment straightened his erect figure and adjusted his cravat  ef rosey he continued hez read in vyages and tracks in eyetalian and french countries of such chaps ez you and kalkilates youre the right kind to tie to mebbee it mout hev done if youd been livin over thar in a pallis but somehow it dont jibe in over here and agree with a shipand that ship lying comfable ashore in san francisco you dont seem to suit the climate you see and your general gait is likely to stampede the other cattle agin said nott with an ostentation of looking at his companion but really gazing on vacancy this fixedup antique style of yours goes better with them ivykivered ruins in rome and palmyry that roseys mixed you up with than it would yere i aint sayin he added as de ferrières was about to speak i aint sayin ez that child aint smitten with ye it aint no use to lie and say she dont prefer you to her old father or young chaps of her own age and kind ive seed it afor now i suspicioned it afor i seed her slip out o this place tonight thar keep your hair on such ez it is he added as de ferrières attempted a quick deprecatory gesture i aint askin yer how often she comes here nor what she sez to you nor you to her i aint asked her and i dont ask you ill allow ez youve settled all the preliminaries and bought her the ring and sich im only askin you now kalkilatin youve got all the keerds in your own hand what youll take to step out and leave the board  the dazed look of de ferrières might have forced itself even upon notts oneidead fatuity had it not been a part of that gentlemans system delicately to look another way at that moment so as not to embarrass his adversarys calculation pardon stammered de ferrières but i do not comprehend he raised his hand to his head i am not welli am stupid ah mon dieu  i aint sayin added nott more gently ez you dont feel bad its natral but it aint business im asking you he continued taking from his breastpocket a large wallet how much youll take in cash now and the rest next steamer day to give up rosey and leave the ship  de ferrières staggered to his feet despite notts restraining hand to leave mademoiselle and leave the ship he said huskily is it not  in course yer can leave things yer just ez you found em when you came you know continued nott for the first time looking round the miserable apartment its a business job ill take the bales back agin and you kin reckon up what youre out countin rosey and loss o time  he wishes me to gohe has said repeated de ferrières to himself thickly  ef you mean me when you say him and ez thar aint any other man around i reckon you doyes  and he asks mehethis man of the feet and the daughterasks mede ferrièreswhat i will take continued de ferrières buttoning his coat no it is a dream he walked stiffly to the corner where his portmanteau lay lifted it and going to the outer door a cut through the ships side that communicated with the alley unlocked it and flung it open to the night a thick mist like the breath of the ocean flowed into the room  you ask me what i shall take to go he said as he stood on the threshold i shall take what you cannot give monsieur but what i would not keep if i stood here another moment i take my honor monsieur andi take my leave  for a moment his grotesque figure was outlined in the opening and then disappeared as if he had dropped into an invisible ocean below stupefied and disconcerted a this complete success of his overtures abner nott remained speechless gazing at the vacant space until a cold influx of the mist recalled him then he rose and shuffled quickly to the door  hi ferrers look yersay wots your hurry pardner  but there was no response the thick mist which hid the surrounding objects seemed to deaden all sound also after a moments pause he closed the door but did not lock it and retreating to the center of the room remained blinking at the two candles and plucking some perplexing problem from his beard suddenly an idea seized him rosey where was she perhaps it had been a preconcerted plan and she had fled with him putting out the lights he stumbled hurriedly through the passage to the gangway above the cabindoor was open there was the sound of voicesrenshaws and roseys mr nott felt relieved but not unembarrassed he would have avoided his daughters presence that evening but even while making this resolution with characteristic infelicity he blundered into the room rosey looked up with a slight start renshaws animated face was changed to its former expression of inward discontent  you came in so like a ghost father said rosey with a slight peevishness that was new to her and i thought you were in town dont go mr renshaw  but mr renshaw intimated that he had already trespassed upon miss notts time and that no doubt her father wanted to talk with her to his surprise and annoyance however mr nott insisted on accompanying him to his room and without heeding renshaws cold goodnight entered and closed the door behind him  praps said mr nott with a troubled air you disremember that when you first kem here you asked me if you could hev that er loft that the frenchman had downstairs  no i dont remember it said renshaw almost rudely but he added after a pause with the air of a man obliged to revive a stale and unpleasant memory if i didwhat about it  nuthin only that you kin hev it tomorrow ez that ere frenchman is movin out responded nott i thought you was sorter keen about it when you first kem  umph well talk about it tomorrow something in the look of wearied perplexity with which mr nott was beginning to regard his own mal à propos presence arrested the young mans attention whats the reason you didnt sell this old ship long ago take a decent house in the town and bring up your daughter like a lady he asked with a sudden blunt goodhumor but even this implied blasphemy against the habitation he worshiped did not prevent mr nott from his usual misconstruction of the question  i reckon now roseys got highflown ideas of livin in a castle with ruins eh he said cunningly  havent heard her say returned renshaw abruptly goodnight  firmly convinced that rosey had been unable to conceal from mr renshaw the influence of her dreams of a castellated future with de ferrières he regained the cabin satisfying himself that his daughter had retired he sought his own couch but not to sleep the figure of de ferrières standing in the ship side and melting into the outer darkness haunted him and compelled him in dreams to rise and follow him through the alleys and byways of the crowded city again it was a part of his morbid suspicion that he now invested the absent man with a potential significance and an unknown power  what deeplaid plans might he not form to possess himself of rosey of which he abner nott would be ignorant unchecked by the restraint of a fathers roof he would now give full license to his power said hed take his honor with him muttered abner to himself in the dim watches of the night lookin at that sayin in its right light it looks bad   v  the elaborately untruthful account which mr nott gave his daughter of de ferrières sudden departure was more fortunate than his usual equivocations while it disappointed and slightly mortified her it did not seem to her inconsistent with what she already knew of him said his doctor had ordered him to quit town under an hour owing to a comin attack of hay fever and he had a friend from furrin parts waitin him at the springs rosey explained nott hesitating between his desire to avoid his daughters eyes and his wish to observe her countenance  was he worsei mean did he look badly father inquired rosey thoughtfully  i reckon not exactly bad kinder looked as if he mout be worse soon ef he didnt hump hisself  did you see himin his room asked rosey anxiously upon the answer to this simple question depended the future confidential relations of father and daughter if her father had himself detected the means by which his lodger existed she felt that her own obligations to secrecy had been removed but mr notts answer disposed of this vain hope it was a response after his usual fashion to the question he imagined she artfully wished to ask ie if he had discovered their rendezvous of the previous night this it was part of his peculiar delicacy to ignore yet his reply showed that he had been unconscious of the one miserable secret that he might have read easily  i was there an hour or sohim and me alonediscussin trade i reckon hes got a good thing outer that curled horsehair for i see hes got in an invoice o cushions ive stowed em all in the forrard bulkhead until he sends for em ez mr renshaw hez taken the loft  but although mr renshaw had taken the loft he did not seem in haste to occupy it he spent part of the morning in uneasily pacing his room in occasional sallies into the street from which he purposelessly returned and once or twice in distant and furtive contemplation of rosey at work in the galley this last observation was not unnoticed by the astute nott who at once conceiving that he was nourishing a secret and hopeless passion for rosey began to consider whether it was not his duty to warn the young man of her preoccupied affections but mr renshaws final disappearance obliged him to withhold his confidence till morning  this time mr renshaw left the ship with the evident determination of some settled purpose he walked rapidly until he reached the countinghouse of mr sleight when he was at once shown into a private office in a few moments mr sleight a brusque but passionless man joined him  well said sleight closing the door carefully what news  none said renshaw bluntly look here sleight he added turning to him suddenly let me out of this game i dont like it  does that mean youve found nothing asked sleight sarcastically  it means that i havent looked for anything and that i dont intend to without the full knowledge of that dd fool who owns the ship  youve changed your mind since you wrote that letter said sleight coolly producing from a drawer the note already known to the reader renshaw mechanically extended his hand to take it mr sleight dropped the letter back into the drawer which he quietly locked the apparently simple act dyed mr renshaws cheek with color but it vanished quickly and with it any token of his previous embarrassment he looked at sleight with the convinced air of a resolute man who had at last taken a disagreeable step but was willing to stand by the consequences  i have changed my mind he said coolly i found out that it was one thing to go down there as a skilled prospector might go to examine a mine that was to be valued according to his report of the indications but that it was entirely another thing to go and play the spy in a poor devils house in order to buy something he didnt know he was selling and wouldnt sell if he did  and something that the man he bought of didnt think of selling something he himself never paid for and never expected to buy sneered sleight  but something that we expect to buy from our knowledge of all this and it is that which makes all the difference  but you knew all this before  i never saw it in this light before i never thought of it until i was living there face to face with the old fool i was intending to overreach i never was sure of it until this morning when he actually turned out one of his lodgers that i might have the very room i required to play off our little game in comfortably when he did that i made up my mind to drop the whole thing and im here to do it  and let somebody else take the responsibilitywith the percentageunless youve also felt it your duty to warn nott too said sleight with a sneer  you only dare say that to me sleight said renshaw quietly because you have in that drawer an equal evidence of my folly and my confidence but if you are wise you will not presume too far on either let us see how we stand through the yarn of a drunken captain and a mutinous sailor you became aware of an unclaimed shipment of treasure concealed in an unknown ship that entered this harbor you are enabled through me to corroborate some facts and identify the ship you proposed to me as a speculation to identify the treasure if possible before you purchased the ship i accepted the offer without consideration on consideration i now decline it but without prejudice or loss to any one but myself as to your insinuation i need not remind you that my presence here today refutes it i would not require your permission to make a much better bargain with a goodnatured fool like nott than i could with you or if i did not care for the business i could have warned the girl  the girlwhat girl  renshaw bit his lip but answered boldly the old mans daughtera poor girlwhom this act would rob as well as her father  sleight looked at his companion attentively you might have said so at first and let up on this campmeetin exhortation well thenadmitting youve got the old man and the young girl on the same string and that youve played it pretty low down in the short time youve been therei suppose dick renshaw ive got to see your bluff well how much is it whats the figure you and she have settled on  for an instant mr sleight was in physical danger  but before he had finished speaking renshaws quick sense of the ludicrous had so far overcome his first indignation as to enable him even to admire the perfect moral insensibility of his companion as he rose and walked towards the door he half wondered that he had ever treated the affair seriously with a smile he replied  far from bluffing sleight i am throwing my cards on the table consider that ive passed out let some other man take my hand rake down the pot if you like old man i leave for sacramento tonight adios  when the door had closed behind him mr sleight summoned his clerk  is that petition for grading pontiac street ready  ive seen the largest property holders sir theyre only waiting for you to sign first mr sleight paused and then affixed his signature to the paper his clerk laid before him get the other names and send it up at once  if mr nott doesnt sign sir  no matter he will be assessed all the same mr sleight took up his hat  the lascar seaman that was here the other day has been wanting to see you sir i said you were busy  mr sleight put down his hat send him up  nevertheless mr sleight sat down and at once abstracted himself so completely as to be apparently in utter oblivion of the man who entered he was lithe and indianlooking bearing in dress and manner the careless slouch without the easy frankness of a sailor  well said sleight without looking up  i was only wantin to know ef you had any news for me boss  news echoed sleight as if absently news of what  that little matter of the pontiac we talked about boss returned the lascar with an uneasy servility in the whites of his teeth and eyes  oh said sleight thats played out its a regular fraud its an old forecastle yarn my man that you cant reel off in the cabin  the sailors face darkened  the man who was looking into it has thrown the whole thing up i tell you its played out repeated sleight without raising his head  its true bossevery word said the lascar with an appealing insinuation that seemed to struggle hard with savage earnestness you can swear me boss i wouldnt lie to a gentleman like you your man hasnt half looked or elseit must be there or  thats just it said sleight slowly whos to know that your friends havent been there alreadythat seems to have been your style  but no one knew it but me until i told you i swear to god i aint lying boss and i aint drunk saydont give it up boss that man of yours likely dont believe it because he dont know anything about it i doi could find it  a silence followed mr sleight remained completely absorbed in his papers for some moments then glancing at the lascar he took his pen wrote a hurried note folded it addressed it and holding it between his fingers leaned back in his chair  if you choose to take this note to my man he may give it another show mind i dont say that he will hes going to sacramento tonight but you could go down there and find him before he starts hes got a room there i believe while youre waiting for him you might keep your eyes open to satisfy yourself  ay ay sir said the sailor eagerly endeavoring to catch the eye of his employer but mr sleight looked straight before him and he turned to go  the sacramento boat goes at nine said mr sleight quietly  this time their glances met and the lascars eye glistened with subtle intelligence the next moment he was gone and mr sleight again became absorbed in his papers  meanwhile renshaw was making his way back to the pontiac with that lighthearted optimism that had characterized his parting with sleight it was this quality of his nature fostered perhaps by the easy civilization in which he moved that had originally drawn him into relations with the man he just quitted a quality that had been troubled and darkened by those relations yet when they were broken at once returned it consequently did not occur to him that he had only selfishly compromised with the difficulty it seemed to him enough that he had withdrawn from a compact he thought dishonorable he was not called upon to betray his partner in that compact merely to benefit others he had been willing to incur suspicion and loss to reinstate himself in his selfrespect more he could not do without justifying that suspicion the view taken by sleight was after all that which most business men would takewhich even the unbusinesslike nott would takewhich the girl herself might be tempted to listen to clearly he could do nothing but abandon the pontiac and her owner to the fate he could not in honor avert and even that fate was problematical it did not follow that the treasure was still concealed in the pontiac nor that nott would be willing to sell her he would make some excuse to notthe smiled to think he would probably be classed in the long line of absconding tenantshe would say goodby to rosey and leave for sacramento that night he ascended the stairs to the gangway with a freer breast than when he first entered the ship  mr nott was evidently absent and after a quick glance at the halfopen cabindoor renshaw turned towards the galley but miss rosey was not in her accustomed haunt and with a feeling of disappointment which seemed inconsistent with so slight a cause he crossed the deck impatiently and entered his room he was about to close the door when the prolonged rustle of a trailing skirt in the passage attracted his attention the sound was so unlike that made by any garment worn by rosey that he remained motionless with his hand on the door the sound approached nearer and the next moment a white veiled figure with a trailing skirt slowly swept past the room renshaws pulses halted for an instant in half superstitious awe as the apparition glided on and vanished in the cabindoor he could only see that it was the form of a beautiful and graceful womanbut nothing more bewildered and curious he forgot himself so far as to follow it and impulsively entered the cabin the figure turned uttered a little cry threw the veil aside and showed the half troubled half blushing face of rosey  ibegyour pardon stammered renshaw i didnt know it was you  i was trying on some things said rosey recovering her composure and pointing to an open trunk that seemed to contain a theatrical wardrobesome things father gave me long ago i wanted to see if there was anything i could use i thought i was all alone in the ship but fancying i heard a noise forward i came out to see what it was i suppose it must have been you  she raised her clear eyes to his with a slight touch of womanly reserve that was so incompatible with any vulgar vanity or girlish coquetry that he became the more embarrassed her dress too of a slightly antique shape rich but simple seemed to reveal and accent a certain repose of gentlewomanliness that he was now wishing to believe he had always noticed conscious of a superiority in her that now seemed to change their relations completely he alone remained silent awkward and embarrassed before the girl who had taken care of his room and who cooked in the galley what he had thoughtlessly considered a merely vulgar business intrigue against her stupid father now to his extravagant fancy assumed the proportions of a sacrilege to herself  youve had your revenge miss nott for the fright i once gave you he said a little uneasily for you quite startled me just now as you passed i began to think the pontiac was haunted i thought you were a ghost i dont know why such a ghost should frighten anybody he went on with a desperate attempt to recover his position by gallantry let me seethats donna elviras dressis it not  i dont think that was the poor womans name said rosey simply she died of yellow fever at new orleans as signora somebody  her ignorance seemed to mr renshaw so plainly to partake more of the nun than the provincial that he hesitated to explain to her that he meant the heroine of an opera  it seems dreadful to put on the poor things clothes doesnt it she added  mr renshaws eyes showed so plainly that he thought otherwise that she drew a little austerely towards the door of her stateroom  i must change these things before any one comes she said dryly  that means i must go i suppose but couldnt you let me wait here or in the gangway until then miss nott i am going away tonight and i maynt see you again he had not intended to say this but it slipped from his embarrassed tongue she stopped with her hand on the door  you are going away  ithinki must leave tonight i have some important business in sacramento  she raised her frank eyes to his the unmistakable look of disappointment that he saw in them gave his heart a sudden throb and sent the quick blood to his cheeks  its too bad she said abstractedly nobody ever seems to stay here long captain bower promised to tell me all about the ship and he went away the second week the photographer left before he finished the picture of the pontiac monsieur de ferrières has only just gone and now you are going  perhaps unlike them i have finished my season of usefulness here he replied with a bitterness he would have recalled the next moment but rosey with a faint sigh saying i wont be long entered the stateroom and closed the door behind her  renshaw bit his lip and pulled at the long silken threads of his mustache until they smarted why had he not gone at once why was it necessary to say he might not see her againand if he had said it why should he add anything more what was he waiting for now to endeavor to prove to her that he really bore no resemblance to captain bower the photographer the crazy frenchman de ferrières or would he be forced to tell her that he was running away from a conspiracy to defraud her fathermerely for something to say was there ever such folly rosey was not long as she had said but he was beginning to pace the narrow cabin impatiently when the door opened and she returned  she had resumed her ordinary calico gown but such was the impression left upon renshaws fancy that she seemed to wear it with a new grace at any other time he might have recognized the change as due to a new corset which strict veracity compels me to record rosey had adopted for the first time that morning howbeit her slight coquetry seemed to have passed for she closed the open trunk with a return of her old listless air and sitting on it rested her elbows on her knees and her oval chin in her hands  i wish you would do me a favor she said after a reflective pause  let me know what it is and it shall be done replied renshaw quickly  if you should come across monsieur de ferrières or hear of him i wish you would let me know he was very poorly when he left here and i should like to know if he was better he didnt say where he was going at least he didnt tell father but i fancy he and father dont agree  i shall be very glad of having even that opportunity of making you remember me miss nott returned renshaw with a faint smile i dont suppose either that it would be very difficult to get news of your friendeverybody seems to know him  but not as i did said rosey with an abstracted little sigh  mr renshaw opened his brown eyes upon her was he mistaken was this romantic girl only a little coquette playing her provincial airs on him you say he and your father didnt agree that means i suppose that you and he agreedand that was the result  i dont think father knew anything about it said rosey simply  mr renshaw rose and this was what he had been waiting to hear perhaps he said grimly you would also like news of the photographer and captain bower or did your father agree with them better  no said rosey quietly she remained silent for a moment and lifting her lashes said father always seemed to agree with you and thatshe hesitated  thats why you dont  i didnt say that said rosey with an incongruous increase of coldness and color i only meant to say it was that which makes it seem so hard you should go now  notwithstanding his previous determination renshaw found himself sitting down again confused and pleased wishing he had said moreor lesshe said nothing and rosey was forced to continue  its strange isnt itbut father was urging me this morning to make a visit to some friends at the old ranch i didnt want to go i like it much better here  but you cannot bury yourself here forever miss nott said renshaw with a sudden burst of honest enthusiasm sooner or later you will be forced to go where you will be properly appreciated where you will be admired and courted where your slightest wish will be law believe me without flattery you dont know your own power  it doesnt seem strong enough to keep even the little i like here said rosey with a slight glistening of the eyes but she added hastily you dont know how much the dear old ship is to me its the only home i think i ever had  but the ranch said renshaw  the ranch seemed to be only the old wagon halted in the road it was a very little improvement on outdoors said rosey with a little shiver but this is so cosy and snug and yet so strange and foreign do you know i think i began to understand why i like it so since you taught me so much about ships and voyages before that i only learned from books books deceive you i think more than people do dont you think so  she evidently did not notice the quick flush that covered his cheeks and apparently dazzled his troubled eyelids for she went on confidentially  i was thinking of you yesterday i was sitting by the galley door looking forward you remember the first day i saw you when you startled me by coming up out of the hatch  i wish you wouldnt think of that said renshaw with more earnestness than he would have made apparent  i dont want to either said rosey gravely for ive had a strange fancy about it i saw once when i was younger a picture in a print shop in montgomery street that haunted me i think it was called the pirate there were a number of wickedlooking sailors lying around the deck and coming out of the hatch was one figure with his hands on the deck and a cutlass in his mouth  thank you said renshaw  you dont understand he was horridlooking not at all like you i never thought of him when i first saw you but the other day i thought how dreadful it would have been if some one like him and not like you had come up then that made me nervous sometimes of being alone i think father is too he often goes about stealthily at night as if he was watching for something  renshaws face grew suddenly dark could it be possible that sleight had always suspected him and set spies to watchor was he guilty of some double intrigue  he thinks continued rosey with a faint smile that some one is looking round the ship and talks of setting beartraps i hope youre not mad mr renshaw she added suddenly catching sight of his changed expression at my foolishness in saying you reminded me of the pirate i meant nothing  i know youre incapable of meaning anything but good to anybody miss nott perhaps to me more than i deserve said renshaw with a sudden burst of feeling i wishi wishyou would do me a favor you asked me one just now he had taken her hand it seemed so like a mere illustration of his earnestness that she did not withdraw it your father tells you everything if he has any offer to dispose of the ship will you write to me at once before anything is concluded he winced a littlethe sentence of sleight whats the figure you and she have settled upon flashed across his mind he scarcely noticed that rosey had withdrawn her hand coldly  perhaps you had better speak to father as it is his business besides i shall not be here i shall be at the ranch  but you said you didnt want to go  ive changed my mind said rosey listlessly i shall go tonight  she rose as if to indicate that the interview was ended with an overpowering instinct that his whole future happiness depended upon his next act he made a step towards her with eager outstretched hands but she slightly lifted her own with a warning gesture i hear father comingyou will have a chance to talk business with him she said and vanished into her stateroom   vi  the heavy tread of abner nott echoed in the passage confused and embarrassed renshaw remained standing at the door that had closed upon rosey as her father entered the cabin providence which always fostered mr notts characteristic misconceptions left that perspicacious parent but one interpretation of the situation rosey had evidently just informed mr renshaw that she loved another  i was just saying goodby to miss nott said renshaw hastily regaining his composure with an effort i am going to sacramento tonight and will not return i  in course in course interrupted nott soothingly thats wot you say now and thats wot you allow to do thats wot they allus do  i mean said renshaw reddening at what he conceived to be an allusion to the absconding propensities of notts previous tenantsi mean that you shall keep the advance to cover any loss you might suffer through my giving up the rooms  certingly said nott laying his hand with a large sympathy on renshaws shoulder but well drop that just now we wont swap hosses in the middle of the river well square up accounts in your room he added raising his voice that rosey might overhear him after a preliminary wink at the young man yes sir well just square up and settle in there come along mr renshaw pushing him with paternal gentleness from the cabin with his hand still upon his shoulder he followed him into the passage half annoyed at his familiarity yet not altogether displeased by this illustration of roseys belief of his preference renshaw wonderingly accompanied him nott closed the door and pushing the young man into a chair deliberately seated himself at the table opposite its jist as well that rosey reckons that you and me is settlin our accounts he began cunningly and mebbee its just ez well ez she should reckon youre goin away  but i am going interrupted renshaw impatiently i leave tonight  surely surely said nott gently thats wot you kalkilate to do thats just natral in a young feller thats about what i reckon id hev done to her mother if anythin like this hed ever cropped up which it didnt not but what almiry jane had young fellers enough round her but cept ole judge peter ez was lamed in the war of 1812 there aint no similarity ez i kin see he added musingly  i am afraid i cant see any similarity either mr nott said renshaw struggling between a dawning sense of some impending absurdity and his growing passion for rosey for heavens sake speak out if youve got anything to say  mr nott leaned forward and placed his large hand on the young mans shoulder thats it thats what i sed to myself when i seed how things were pintin speak out sez i abner speak out if youve got anything to say you kin trust this yer mr renshaw he aint the kind of man to creep into the bosom of a mans ship for pupposes of his own he aint a man that would hunt round until he discovered a poor mans treasure and then try to rob  stop said renshaw with a set face and darkening eyes what treasure what man are you speaking of  why rosey and mr ferrers returned nott simply  renshaw sank into his seat again but the expression of relief which here passed swiftly over his face gave way to one of uneasy interest as nott went on  praps its a little highfalutin talkin of rosey ez a treasure but considerin mr renshaw ez shes the only propty ive kept by me for seventeen years ez hez paid interest and increased in valoo it aint sayin too much to call her so and ez ferrers knows this he oughter been content with gougin me in that horsehair spec without goin for rosey praps yer surprised at hearing me speak o my own flesh and blood ez if i was talkin hosstrade but you and me is busness men mr renshaw and we discusses ez such we aint goin to slosh round and slop over in potry and sentiment continued nott with a tremulous voice and a hand that slightly shook on renshaws shoulder we aint goin to git up and sing thou st lamed to love another thou st broken every vow weve parted from each other and my bozoms lonely now oh is it well to sever such hearts as ourn forever kin i forget thee never farewell farewell farewell ye never happend to hear jim baker sing that at the moosic hall on dupont street mr renshaw continued mr nott enthusiastically when he had recovered from that complete absence of punctuation which alone suggested verse to his intellect he sorter struck water down here indicating his heart every time  but what has miss nott to do with m de ferrières asked renshaw with a faint smile  mr nott regarded him with dumb round astonished eyes heznt she told yer  certainly not  and she didnt let on anythin about him he continued feebly  she said shed like to know wherehe stopped with the reflection that he was betraying her confidences  a dim foreboding of some new form of deceit to which even the man before him was a consenting party almost paralyzed notts faculties then she didnt tell yer that she and ferrers was sparkin and keepin kimpany together that she and him was engaged and was kalkilatin to run away to furrin parts that she cottoned to him more than to the ship or her father  she certainly did not and i shouldnt believe it said renshaw quickly  nott smiled he was amused he astutely recognized the usual trustfulness of love and youth there was clearly no deceit here renshaws attentive eyes saw the smile and his brow darkened  i like to hear yer say that mr renshaw said nott and its no more than rosey deserves ez its suthing onnatral and spelllike thats come over her through ferrers it aint my rosey but its gospel truth whether shes bewitched or not whether its them damn fool stories she readsand its like ez not hes just the kind o snipe to write em hisself and sorter advertise hisself dont yer seeshes allus stuck up for lim theyve had clandesent interviews and when i taxed him with it he ez much ez allowed it was so and reckoned he must leave so ez he could run her off you knowkinder stampede her with honor thems his very words  but that is all past he is gone and miss nott does not even know where he is said renshaw with a laugh which however concealed a vague uneasiness  mr nott rose and opened the door carefully when he had satisfied himself that no one was listening he came back and said in a whisper thats a lie not ez rosey means to lie but its a trick hes put upon that poor child that man mr renshaw hez been hangin round the pontiac ever since ive seed him twice with my own eyes pass the cabin windys more than that ive heard strange noises at night and seen strange faces in the alley over yer and only jist now ez i kem in i ketched sight of a furrinlookin chinee nigger slinking round the back door of what useter be ferrers loft  did he look like a sailor asked renshaw quickly with a return of his former suspicion  not more than i do said nott glancing complacently at his peajacket he had rings on his yeers like a wench  mr renshaw started but seeing notts eyes fixed on him he said lightly but what have these strange faces and this strange manprobably only a lascar sailor out of a jobto do with ferrières  friends o hisfeller furrin citizensspies on rosey dont you see but they cant play the old man mr renshaw ive told rosey she must make a visit to the old ranch once ive got her thar safe i reckon i kin manage mr ferrers and any number of chinee niggers he kin bring along  renshaw remained for a few moments lost in thought then rising suddenly he grasped mr notts hand with a frank smile but determined eyes i havent got the hang of this mr nottthe whole thing gets me i only know that ive changed my mind im not going to sacramento i shall stay here old man until i see you safe through the business or my names not dick renshaw theres my hand on it dont say a word maybe it is no more than i ought to doperhaps not half enough only remember not a word of this to your daughter she must believe that i leave tonight and the sooner you get her out of this cursed ship the better  deacon flints girls are goin up in tonights boat ill send rosey with them said nott with a cunning twinkle renshaw nodded nott seized his hand with a wink of unutterable significance  left to himself renshaw tried to review more calmly the circumstances in these strange revelations that had impelled him to change his resolution so suddenly that the ship was under the surveillance of unknown parties and that the description of them tallied with his own knowledge of a certain lascar sailor who was one of sleights informantsseemed to be more than probable that this seemed to point to sleights disloyalty to himself while he was acting as his agent or a double treachery on the part of sleights informants was in either case a reason and an excuse for his own interference but the connection of the absurd frenchman with the case which at first seemed a characteristic imbecility of his landlord bewildered him the more he thought of it rejecting any hypothesis of the girls affection for the antiquated figure whose sanity was a question of public criticism he was forced to the equally alarming theory that ferrières was cognizant of the treasure and that his attentions to rosey were to gain possession of it by marrying her might she not be dazzled by a picture of this wealth was it not possible that she was already in part possession of the secret and her strange attraction to the ship and what he had deemed her innocent craving for information concerning it a consequence why had he not thought of this before perhaps she had detected his purpose from the first and had deliberately checkmated him the thought did not increase his complacency as nott softly returned  its all right he began with a certain satisfaction in this rare opportunity for machiavellian diplomacy its all fixed now rosey tumbled to it at once partiklerly when i said you was bound to go but wot makes mr renshaw go father sez she wot makes everybody run away from the ship sez she rather peartlike and sassy for her mr renshaw hez contractin business sez i got a big thing up in sacramento thatll make his fortunsez ifor i wasnt goin to give yer away dont ye see he had some business to talk to you about the ship sez she lookin at me under the corner of her pockethandkerchief lots o business sez i then i reckon he dont care to hev me write to him sez she not a bit sez i he wouldnt answer ye if ye did yell never hear from that chap agin  but what the devilinterrupted the young man impetuously  keep yer hair on remonstrated the old man with dark intelligence ef youd seen the way she flounced into her stateroomshe rosey ez allus moves ez softly ez a spirityoud hev wished id hev unloaded a little more no sir gals is gals in some things all the time  renshaw rose and paced the room rapidly perhaps id better speak to her again before she goes he said impulsively  praps youd better not replied the imperturbable nott  irritated as he was renshaw could not avoid the reflection that the old man was right what indeed could he say to her with his present imperfect knowledge how could she write to him if that knowledge was correct  ef said nott kindly with a laying on of large benedictory and paternal hands ef yere willin to see rosey agin without speakin to her i reckon i ken fix it for yer im goin to take her down to the boat in half an hour ef yer should happenmind ef yer should happen to be down there seein some friends off and sorter promenadin up and down the wharf like them hightoned chaps on montgomery streetye might ketch her eye unconscious like or ye might do this he rose after a moments cogitation and with a face of profound mystery opened the door and beckoned renshaw to follow him leading the way cautiously he brought the young man into an open unpartitioned recess beside her stateroom it seemed to be used as a storeroom and renshaws eye was caught by a trunk the size and shape of the one that had provided rosey with the materials of her masquerade pointing to it mr nott said in a grave whisper this yer trunk is the companion trunk to roseys shes got the things them opery women wears this yer contains the he things the duds and fixins o the men o the same stripe throwing it open he continued now mr renshaw gals is gals its natral they should be took by fancy dress and store clothes on young chaps as on theirselves that man ferrers hez got the dead wood on all of ye in this sort of thing and hez been playing so to speak a lone hand all along and ef thars anythin in thar he added lifting part of a theatrical wardrobe that you think youd fancyanythin youd like to put on when ye promenade the wharf down yonderits yours dont ye be bashful but help yourself  it was fully a minute before renshaw fairly grasped the old mans meaning but when he didwhen the suggested spectacle of himself arrayed à la ferrières gravely promenading the wharf as a last gorgeous appeal to the affections of rosey rose before his fancy he gave way to a fit of genuine laughter the nervous tension of the past few hours relaxed he laughed until the tears came into his eyes he was still laughing when the door of the cabin suddenly opened and rosey appeared cold and distant on the threshold  ibeg your pardon stammered renshaw hastily i didnt meanto disturb youi  without looking at him rosey turned to her father i am ready she said coldly and closed the door again  a glance of artful intelligence came into notts eyes which had remained blankly staring at renshaws apparently causeless hilarity turning to him he winked solemnly that keerless kind o hosslaff jist fetched her he whispered and vanished before his chagrined companion could reply  when mr nott and his daughter departed renshaw was not in the ship neither did he make a spectacular appearance on the wharf as mr nott had fondly expected nor did he turn up again until after nine oclock when he found the old man in the cabin awaiting his return with some agitation a minit ago he said mysteriously closing the door behind renshaw i heard a voice in the passage and goin out who should i see agin but that darned furrin nigger ez i told yer bout kinder hidin in the dark his eyes shinin like a catamount i was jist reachin for my weppins when he riz up with a grin and handed me this yer letter i told him i reckoned youd gone to sacramento but he said he wez sure you was in your room and to prove it i went thar but when i kem back the dd skunk had vamosedgot frightened i reckonand wasnt nowhar to be seen  renshaw took the letter hastily it contained only a line in sleights hand if you change your mind the bearer may be of service to you  he turned abruptly to nott you say it was the same lascar you saw before  it was  then all i can say is he is no agent of de ferrières said renshaw turning away with a disappointed air mr nott would have asked another question but with an abrupt goodnight the young man entered his room locked the door and threw himself on his bed to reflect without interruption  but if he was in no mood to stand notts fatuous conjectures he was less inclined to be satisfied with his own had he been again carried away through his impulses evoked by the caprices of a pretty coquette and the absurd theories of her half imbecile father had he broken faith with sleight and remained in the ship for nothing and would not his change of resolution appear to be the result of sleights note but why had the lascar been haunting the ship before in the midst of these conjectures he fell asleep   vii  between three and four in the morning the clouds broke over the pontiac and the moon riding high picked out in black and silver the long hulk that lay cradled between the iron shells and warehouses and the wooden frames and tenements on either side the galley and covered gangway presented a mass of undefined shadow against which the white deck shone brightly stretching to the forecastle and bows where the tiny glass roof of the photographer glistened like a gem in the pontiacs crest so peaceful and motionless she lay that she might have been some petrifaction of a past age now first exhumed and laid bare to the cold light of the stars  nevertheless this calm security was presently invaded by a sense of stealthy life and motion what had seemed a fixed shadow suddenly detached itself from the deck and began to slip stanchion by stanchion along the bulwarks toward the companionway at the cabindoor it halted and crouched motionless then rising it glided forward with the same staccato movement until opposite the slight elevation of the forehatch suddenly it darted to the hatch unfastened and lifted it with a swift familiar dexterity and disappeared in the opening but as the moon shone upon its vanishing face it revealed the whitening eyes and teeth of the lascar seaman  dropping to the lower deck lightly he felt his way through the dark passage between the partitions evidently less familiar to him halting before each door to listen  returning forward he reached the second hatchway that had attracted roseys attention and noiselessly unclosed its fastenings a penetrating smell of bilge arose from the opening drawing a small bullseye lantern from his breast he lit it and unhesitatingly let himself down to the further depth the moving flash of his light revealed the recesses of the upper hold the abyss of the well amidships and glanced from the shining backs of moving zigzags of rats that seemed to outline the shadowy beams and transoms disregarding those curious spectators of his movements he turned his attention eagerly to the inner casings of the hold that seemed in one spot to have been strengthened by fresh timbers attacking this stealthily with the aid of some tools hidden in his oilskin clothing in the light of the lantern he bore a fanciful resemblance to the predatory animals around him the low continuous sound of rasping and gnawing of timber which followed heightened the resemblance at the end of a few minutes he had succeeded in removing enough of the outer planking to show that the entire filling of the casing between the stanchions was composed of small boxes dragging out one of them with feverish eagerness to the light the lascar forced it open in the rays of the bullseye a wedged mass of discolored coins showed with a lurid glow the story of the pontiac was truethe treasure was there  but mr sleight had overlooked the logical effect of this discovery on the natural villainy of his tool in the very moment of his triumphant execution of his patrons suggestions the idea of keeping the treasure to himself flashed upon his mind he had discovered itwhy should he give it up to anybody he had run all the risks if he were detected at that moment who would believe that his purpose there at midnight was only to satisfy some one else that the treasure was still intact no the circumstances were propitious he would get the treasure out of the ship at once drop it over her side hastily conceal it in the nearest lot adjacent and take it away at his convenience who would be the wiser for it  but it was necessary to reconnoiter first he knew that the loft overhead was empty he knew that it communicated with the alley for he had tried the door that morning he would convey the treasure there and drop it into the alley the boxes were heavy each one would require a separate journey to the ships side but he would at least secure something if he were interrupted he stripped the casing and gathered the boxes together in a pile  ah yes it was funny too that hethe lascar houndthe dd niggershould get what bigger and bullier men than he had died for the mates blood was on those boxes if the salt water had not washed it out it was a hell of a fight when they dragged the captainoh what was that was it the splash of a rat in the bilge or what  a superstitious terror had begun to seize him at the thought of blood the stifling hold seemed again filled with struggling figures he had known the air thick with cries and blasphemies that he had forgotten he rose to his feet and running quickly to the hatchway leaped to the deck above all was quiet the door leading to the empty loft yielded to his touch he entered and gliding through unbarred and opened the door that gave upon the alley the cold air and moonlight flowed in silently the way of escape was clear bah he would go back for the treasure  he had reached the passage when the door he had just opened was suddenly darkened turning rapidly he was conscious of a gaunt figure grotesque silent and erect looming on the threshold between him and the sky hidden in the shadow he made a stealthy step towards it with an iron wrench in his uplifted hand but the next moment his eyes dilated with superstitious horror the iron fell from his hand and with a scream like a frightened animal he turned and fled into the passage in the first access of his blind terror he tried to reach the deck above through the forehatch but was stopped by the sound of a heavy tread overhead the immediate fear of detection now overcame his superstition he would have even faced the apparition again to escape through the loft but before he could return there other footsteps approached rapidly from the end of the passage he would have to traverse there was but one chance of escape left nowthe forehold he had just quitted he might hide there until the alarm was over he glided back to the hatch lifted it and closed it softly over his head as the upper hatch was simultaneously raised and the small round eyes of abner nott peered down upon it the other footsteps proved to be renshaws but attracted by the open door of the loft he turned aside and entered as soon as he disappeared mr nott cautiously dropped through the opening to the deck below and going to the other hatch through which the lascar had vanished deliberately refastened it in a few moments renshaw returned with a light and found the old man sitting on the hatch  the loftdoor was open said renshaw theres little doubt whoever was here escaped that way  surely said nott there was a peculiar look of machiavellian sagacity in his face which irritated renshaw  then youre sure it was ferriferes you saw pass by your window before you called me he asked  nott nodded his head with an expression of infinite profundity  but you say he was going from the ship then it could not have been he who made the noise we heard down here  mebbee no and mebbee yes returned nott cautiously  but if he was already concealed inside the ship as that open door which you say you barred from the inside would indicate what the devil did he want with this said renshaw producing the monkeywrench he had picked up  mr nott examined the tool carefully and shook his head with momentous significance nevertheless his eyes wandered to the hatch on which he was seated  did you find anything disturbed there said renshaw following the direction of his eye was that hatch fastened as it is now  it was said nott calmly but ye wouldnt mind fetchin me a hammer and some o them big nails from the locker would yer while i hang round here just so ez to make sure against another attack  renshaw complied with his request but as nott proceeded to gravely nail down the fastenings of the hatch he turned impatiently away to complete his examination of the ship the doors of the other lofts and their fastenings appeared secure and undisturbed yet it was undeniable that a felonious entrance had been made but by whom or for what purpose still remained uncertain even now renshaw found it difficult to accept notts theory that de ferrières was the aggressor and rosey the object nor could he justify his own suspicion that the lascar had obtained a surreptitious entrance under sleights directions with a feeling that if rosey had been present he would have confessed all and demanded from her an equal confidence he began to hate his feeble purposeless and inefficient alliance with her father who believed but dared not tax his daughter with complicity in this outrage what could be done with a man whose only idea of action at such a moment was to nail up an undisturbed entrance in his invaded house he was so preoccupied with these thoughts that when nott rejoined him in the cabin he scarcely heeded his presence and was entirely oblivious of the furtive looks which the old man from time to time cast upon his face  i reckon ye wouldnt mind broke in nott suddenly ef i asked a favor of ye mr renshaw mebbee yell allow its askin too much in the matter of expense mebbee yell allow its askin too much in the matter o time but i kalkilate to pay all the expense and if youd let me know what yer vally yer time at i reckon i could stand that what id be askin is this would ye mind takin a letter from me to rosey and bringin back an answer  renshaw stared speechlessly at this absurd realization of his wish of a moment before i dont think i understand you he stammered  praps not returned nott with great gravity but thats not so much matter to you ez your time and expenses  i meant i should be glad to go if i can be of any service to you said renshaw hastily  you kin ketch the sevenoclock boat this morning and youll reach san rafael at ten  but i thought miss rosey went to petaluma interrupted renshaw quickly  nott regarded him with an expression of patronizing superiority thats what we ladled out to the public ginrally and to ferrers and his gang in partickler we said petalumey but if you go to madrono cottage san rafael youll find rosey thar  if mr renshaw required anything more to convince him of the necessity of coming to some understanding with rosey at once it would have been this last evidence of her fathers utterly dark and supremely inscrutable designs he assented quickly and nott handed him a note  yell be partickler to give this inter her own hands and wait for an answer said nott gravely  resisting the proposition to enter then and there into an elaborate calculation of the value of his time and the expenses of the trip renshaw found himself at seven oclock on the san rafael boat brief as was the journey it gave him time to reflect upon his coming interview with rosey he had resolved to begin by confessing all the attempt of last night had released him from any sense of duty to sleight besides he did not doubt that notts letter contained some reference to this affair only known to notts dark and tortuous intelligence  viii  madroño cottage lay at the entrance of a little cañada already green with the early winter rains and nestled in a thicket of the harlequin painted trees that gave it a name the young man was a little relieved to find that rosey had gone to the postoffice a mile away and that he would probably overtake her or meet her returningalone the roadlittle more than a trailwound along the crest of the hill looking across the cañada to the long dark heavilywooded flank of mount tamalpais that rose from the valley a dozen miles away a cessation of the warm rain a rift in the sky and the rare spectacle of cloud scenery combined with a certain sense of freedom restored that lighthearted gayety that became him most at a sudden turn of the road he caught sight of roseys figure coming towards him and quickened his step with the impulsiveness of a boy but she suddenly disappeared and when he again saw her she was on the other side of the trail apparently picking the leaves of a manzanita she had already seen him  somehow the frankness of his greeting was checked she looked up at him with cheeks that retained enough of their color to suggest why she had hesitated and said you here mr renshaw i thought you were in sacramento  and i thought you were in petaluma he retorted gayly i have a letter from your father the fact is one of those gentlemen who has been haunting the ship actually made an entry last night who he was and what he came for nobody knows perhaps your father gives you his suspicions he could not help looking at her narrowly as he handed her the note except that her pretty eyebrows were slightly raised in curiosity she seemed undisturbed as she opened the letter presently she raised her eyes to his  is this all father gave you  all  youre sure you havent dropped anything  nothing i have given you all he gave me  and that is all it is she exhibited the missive a perfectly blank sheet of paper folded like a note  renshaw felt the angry blood glow in his cheeks this is unpardonable i assure you miss nott there must be some mistake he himself has probably forgotten the inclosure he continued yet with an inward conviction that the act was perfectly premeditated on the part of the old man  the young girl held out her hand frankly dont think any more of it mr renshaw father is forgetful at times but tell me about last night  in a few words mr renshaw briefly but plainly related the details of the attempt upon the pontiac from the moment that he had been awakened by nott to his discovery of the unknown trespassers flight by the open door to the loft when he had finished he hesitated and then taking roseys hand said impulsively you will not be angry with me if i tell you all your father firmly believes that the attempt was made by the old frenchman de ferrières with a view of carrying you off  a dozen reasons other than the one her father would have attributed it to might have called the blood to her face but only innocence could have brought the look of astonished indignation to her eyes as she answered quickly  so that was what you were laughing at  not that miss nott said the young man eagerly though i wish to god i could accuse myself of nothing more disloyal do not speak i beg he added impatiently as rosey was about to reply i have no right to hear you i have no right to even stand in your presence until i have confessed everything i came to the pontiac i made your acquaintance miss nott through a fraud as wicked as anything your father charges to de ferrières i am not a contractor i never was an honest lodger in the pontiac i was simply a spy  but you didnt mean to beit was some mistake wasnt it said rosey quite white but more from sympathy with the offenders emotion than horror at the offense  i am afraid i did mean it but bear with me for a few moments longer and you shall know all its a long story will you walk on andtake my arm you do not shrink from me miss nott thank you i scarcely deserve the kindness  indeed so little did rosey shrink that he was conscious of a slight reassuring pressure on his arm as they moved forward and for the moment i fear the young man felt like exaggerating his offense for the sake of proportionate sympathy do you remember he continued one evening when i told you some sea tales you said you always thought there must be some story about the pontiac there was a story of the pontiac miss notta wicked storya terrible storywhich i might have told you which i ought to have told youwhich was the story that brought me there you were right too in saying that you thought i had known the pontiac before i stepped first on her deck that day i had  he laid his disengaged hand across lightly on roseys as if to assure himself that she was listening  i was at that time a sailor i had been fool enough to run away from college thinking it a fine romantic thing to ship before the mast for a voyage round the world i was a little disappointed perhaps but i made the best of it and in two years i was the second mate of a whaler lying in a little harbor of one of the uncivilized islands of the pacific while we were at anchor there a french trading vessel put in apparently for water she had the dregs of a mixed crew of lascars and portuguese who said they had lost the rest of their men by desertion and that the captain and mate had been carried off by fever there was something so queer in their story that our skipper took the law in his own hands and put me on board of her with a salvage crew but that night the french crew mutinied cut the cables and would have got to sea if we had not been armed and prepared and managed to drive them below when we had got them under hatches for a few hours they parleyed and offered to go quietly ashore as we were short of hands and unable to take them with us and as we had no evidence against them we let them go took the ship to callao turned her over to the authorities lodged a claim for salvage and continued our voyage when we returned we found the truth of the story was known she had been a french trader from marseilles owned by her captain her crew had mutinied in the pacific killed their officers and the only passengerthe owner of the cargo they had made away with the cargo and a treasure of nearly half a million of spanish gold for trading purposes which belonged to the passenger in course of time the ship was sold for salvage and put into the south american trade until the breaking out of the californian gold excitement when she was sent with a cargo to san francisco that ship was the pontiac which your father bought  a slight shudder ran through the girls frame i wishi wish you hadnt told me she said i shall never close my eyes again comfortably on board of her i know  i would say that you had purified her of all stains of her pastbut there may be one that remains and that in most peoples eyes would be no detraction you look puzzled miss nottbut i am coming to the explanation and the end of my story a ship of war was sent to the island to punish the mutineers and pirates for such they were but they could not be found a private expedition was sent to discover the treasure which they were supposed to have buried but in vain about two months ago mr sleight told me one of his shipmasters had sent him a lascar sailor who had to dispose of a valuable secret regarding the pontiac for a percentage that secret was that the treasure was never taken by the mutineers out of the pontiac they were about to land and bury it when we boarded them they took advantage of their imprisonment under hatches to bury it in the ship they hid it in the hold so securely and safely that it was never detected by us or the callao authorities i was then asked as one who knew the vessel to undertake a private examination of her with a view of purchasing her from your father without awakening his suspicions i assented you have my confession now miss nott you know my crime i am at your mercy  roseys arm only tightened around his own her eyes sought his and you didnt find anything she said  the question sounded so oddly like sleights that renshaw returned a little stiffly  i didnt look  why asked rosey simply  because stammered renshaw with an uneasy consciousness of having exaggerated his sentiment it didnt seem honorable it didnt seem fair to you  oh you silly you might have looked and told me  but said renshaw do you think that would have been fair to sleight  as fair to him as to us for dont you see it wouldnt belong to any of us it would belong to the friends or the family of the man who lost it  but there were no heirs replied renshaw that was proved by some impostor who pretended to be his brother and libelled the pontiac at callao but the courts decided he was a lunatic  then it belongs to the poor pirates who risked their own lives for it rather than to sleight who did nothing she was silent for a moment and then resumed with energy i believe he was at the bottom of that attack last night  i have thought so too said renshaw  then i must go back at once she continued impulsively father must not be left alone  nor must you said renshaw quickly do let me return with you and share with you and your father the trouble i have brought upon you do not he added in a lower tone deprive me of the only chance of expiating my offense of making myself worthy your forgiveness  i am sure said rosey lowering her lids and half withdrawing her arm i am sure i have nothing to forgive you did not believe the treasure belonged to us any more than to anybody else until you knew me  that is true said the young man attempting to take her hand  i mean said rosey blushing and showing a distracting row of little teeth in one of her infrequent laughs oh you know what i mean she withdrew her arm gently and became interested in the selection of certain wayside bay leaves as they passed along all the same i dont believe in this treasure she said abruptly as if to change the subject i dont believe it ever was hidden inside the pontiac  that can be easily ascertained now said renshaw  but its a pity you didnt find it out while you were about it said rosey it would have saved so much talk and trouble  i have told you why i didnt search the ship responded renshaw with a slight bitterness but it seems i could only avoid being a great rascal by becoming a great fool  you never intended to be a rascal said rosey earnestly and you couldnt be a fool except in heeding what a silly girl says i only meant if you had taken me into your confidence it would have been better  might i not say the same to you regarding your friend the old frenchman returned renshaw what if i were to confess to you that i lately suspected him of knowing the secret and of trying to gain your assistance  instead of indignantly repudiating the suggestion to the young mans great discomfiture rosey only knit her pretty brows and remained for some moments silent presently she asked timidly  do you think it wrong to tell another persons secret for their own good  no said renshaw promptly  then ill tell you monsieur de ferrières but only because i believe from what you have just said that he will turn out to have some right to the treasure  then with kindling eyes and a voice eloquent with sympathy rosey told the story of her accidental discovery of de ferrières miserable existence in the loft clothing it with the unconscious poetry of her fresh young imagination she lightly passed over his antique gallantry and grotesque weakness exalting only his lonely sufferings and mysterious wrongs renshaw listened lost between shame for his late suspicions and admiration for her thoughtful delicacy until she began to speak of de ferrières strange allusions to the foreign papers in his portmanteau i think some were law papers and i am almost certain i saw the word callao printed on one of them  it may be so said renshaw thoughtfully the old frenchman has always passed for a harmless wandering eccentric i hardly think public curiosity has ever even sought to know his name much less his history but had we not better first try to find if there is any property before we examine his claims to it  as you please said rosey with a slight pout but you will find it much easier to discover him than his treasure its always easier to find the thing youre not looking for  until you want it said renshaw with sudden gravity  how pretty it looks over there said rosey turning her conscious eyes to the opposite mountain  very  they had reached the top of the hill and in the near distance the chimney of madroño cottage was even now visible at the expected sight they unconsciously stoppedunconsciously disappointed rosey broke the embarrassing silence  theres another way home but its a roundabout way she said timidly  let us take it said renshaw  she hesitated the boat goes at four and we must return tonight  the more reason why we should make the most of our time now said renshaw with a faint smile tomorrow all things may be changed tomorrow you may find yourself an heiress miss nott tomorrow he added with a slight tremor in his voice i may have earned your forgiveness only to say farewell to you forever let me keep this sunshine this picture this companionship with you long enough to say now what perhaps i must not say tomorrow  they were silent for a moment and then by a common instinct turned together into a narrow trail scarce wide enough for two that diverged from the straight practical path before them it was indeed a roundabout way home so roundabout in fact that as they wandered on it seemed even to double on its track occasionally lingering long and becoming indistinct under the shadow of madroño and willow at one time stopping blindly before a fallen tree in the hollow where they had quite lost it and had to sit down to recall it a rough way often requiring the mutual help of each others hands and eyes to tread together in security an uncertain way not to be found without whispered consultation and concession and yet a way eventually bringing them hand in hand happy and hopeful to the gate of madroño cottage and if there was only just time for rosey to prepare to take the boat it was due to the deviousness of the way if a stray curl was lying loose on roseys cheek and a long hair had caught in renshaws button it was owing to the roughness of the way and if in the tones of their voices and in the glances of their eyes there was a maturer seriousness it was due to the dim uncertainty of the path they had traveled and would hereafter tread together   ix  when mr nott had satisfied himself of renshaws departure he coolly bolted the door at the head of the companionway thus cutting off any communication with the lower deck taking a long rifle from the rack above his berth he carefully examined the hammer and cap and then cautiously let himself down through the forehatch to the deck below after a deliberate survey of the still intact fastenings of the hatch over the forehold he proceeded quietly to unloose them again with the aid of the tools that still lay there when the hatch was once more free he lifted it and withdrawing a few feet from the opening sat himself down rifle in hand a profound silence reigned throughout the lower deck  ye kin rize up out o that said nott gently  there was a stealthy rustle below that seemed to approach the hatch and then with a sudden bound the lascar leaped on the deck but at the same instant nott covered him with his rifle a slight shade of disappointment and surprise had crossed the old mans face and clouded his small round eyes at the apparition of the lascar but his hand was none the less firm upon the trigger as the frightened prisoner sank on his knees with his hands clasped in the attitude of supplication for mercy  ef youre thinkin o skippin afore ive done with yer said nott with labored gentleness i oughter warn ye that its my style to drop injins at two hundred yards and this deck aint anywhere more n fifty its an uncomfortable style a nasty stylebut its my style i thought id tell yer so yer could take it easy where you air wheres ferrers  even in the mans insane terror his utter bewilderment at the question was evident ferrers he gasped dont know him i swear to god boss  praps said nott with infinite cunning yer dont know the man ez kem into the loft from the alley last nightpraps yer didnt see an airy frenchman with a dyed mustache eh i thought that would fetch ye he continued as the man started at the evidence that his vision of last night was a living man praps you and him didnt break into this ship last night jist to run off with my darter rosey praps yer dont know rosey eh praps yer dont know ez ferrers wants to marry her and hez been hangin round yer ever since he lefteh  scarcely believing the evidence of his senses that the old man whose treasure he had been trying to steal was utterly ignorant of his real offense and yet uncertain of the penalty of the other crime of which he was accused the lascar writhed his body and stammered vaguely mercy mercy  well said nott cautiously ez i reckon the hide of a dead chinee nigger aint any more vallyble than that of a dead injin i dont care ef i let up on yerseein the cussedness aint yours but ef i let yer off this once you must take a message to ferrers from me  let me off this time boss and i swear to god i will said the lascar eagerly  ye kin say to ferrerslet me seedeliberated nott leaning on his rifle with cautious reflection ye kin say to ferrers like thissez you ferrers sez you the old man sez that afore you went away you sez to him sez you i take my honor with me sez youhave you got that interrupted nott suddenly  yes boss  i take my honor with me sez you repeated nott slowly now sez youthe old man sez sez hetell ferrers sez he that his honor havin run away agin he sends it back to him and ef he ever ketches it around after this hell shoot it on sight hev yer got that  yes stammered the bewildered captive  then git  the lascar sprang to his feet with the agility of a panther leaped through the hatch above him and disappeared over the bow of the ship with an unhesitating directness that showed that every avenue of escape had been already contemplated by him slipping lightly from the cutwater to the ground he continued his flight only stopping at the private office of mr sleight  when mr renshaw and rosey nott arrived on board the pontiac that evening they were astonished to find the passage before the cabin completely occupied with trunks and boxes and the bulk of their household goods apparently in the process of removal mr nott who was superintending the work of two chinamen betrayed not only no surprise at the appearance of the young people but not the remotest recognition of their own bewilderment at his occupation  kalkilatin he remarked casually to his daughter youd rather look arter your fixins rosey ive left em till the last praps yer and mr renshaw wouldnt mind sittin down on that locker until ive strapped this yer box  but what does it all mean father said rosey taking the old man by the lappels of his peajacket and slightly emphasizing her question what in the name of goodness are you doing  breakin camp rosey dear breakin camp jist ez we uster replied nott with cheerful philosophy kinder like ole times aint it lord rosey he continued stopping and following up the reminiscence with the end of the rope in his hand as if it were a clue dont ye mind that day we started outer livermore pass and seed the hull o the kaliforny coast stretchin yondereh but dont ye be skeered rosey dear he added quickly as if in recognition of the alarm expressed in her face i aint turning ye outer house and home ive jist hired that ere madroño cottage from the peters ontil we kin look round  but youre not leaving the ship father continued rosey impetuously you havent sold it to that man sleight  mr nott rose and carefully closed the cabindoor then drawing a large wallet from his pocket he said its singlar ye should hev got the name right the first pop aint it rosey but its sleight sure enough all the time this yer check he added producing a paper from the depths of the wallet this yer check for 25000 dollars is wot he paid for it only two hours ago  but said renshaw springing to his feet furiously youre duped swindledbetrayed  young man said nott throwing a certain dignity into his habitual gesture of placing his hands on renshaws shoulders i bought this yer ship five years ago jist ez she stood for 8000 dollars kalkilatin wot she cost me in repairs and taxes and wot she brought me in since then accordin to my figgerin i dont call a clear profit of 15000 dollars much of a swindle  tell him all said rosey quickly more alarmed at renshaws despairing face than at the news itself tell him everything dickmr renshaw it may not be too late  in a voice half choked with passionate indignation renshaw hurriedly repeated the story of the hidden treasure and the plot to rescue it prompted frequently by roseys tenacious memory and assisted by her deft and tactful explanations but to their surprise the imperturbable countenance of abner nott never altered a slight moisture of kindly paternal tolerance of their extravagance glistened in his little eyes but nothing more  ef there was a part o this ship a plank or a bolt ez i dont know ez i hevnt touched with my own hand and looked into with my own eyes thar might be suthin in that story i dont let on to be a sailor like you but ez i know the ship ez a boy knows his first boss as a woman knows her first babby i reckon thar aint no treasure yer onless it was brought into the pontiac last night by them chaps  but are you mad sleight would not pay three times the value of the ship today if he were not positive and that positive knowledge was gained last night by the villain who broke into the pontiacno doubt the lascar  surely said nott meditatively the lascar theres suthin in that that lascar i fastened down in the hold last night unbeknownst to you mr renshaw and let him out again this morning ekally unbeknownst  and you let him carry his information to sleightwithout a word said renshaw with a sickening sense of notts utter fatuity  i sent him back with a message to the man he kem from said nott winking both his eyes at renshaw significantly and making signs behind his daughters back  rosey conscious of her lovers irritation and more eager to soothe his impatience than from any faith in her suggestion interfered why not examine the place where he was concealed he may have left some traces of his search  the two men looked at each other seein ez ive turned the pontiac over to sleight jist as it stands i dont know ez its zactly on the square said nott doubtfully  youve a right to know at least what you deliver to him interrupted renshaw brusquely bring a lantern  followed by rosey renshaw and nott hurriedly sought the lower deck and the open hatch of the forehold the two men leaped down first with the lantern and then assisted rosey to descend renshaw took a step forward and uttered a cry  the rays of the lantern fell on the ships side the lascar had during his forced seclusion put back the boxes of treasure and replaced the planking yet not so carefully but that the quick eye of renshaw had discovered it the next moment he had stripped away the planking again and the hurriedly restored box which the lascar had found fell to the deck scattering part of its ringing contents rosey turned pale renshaws eyes flashed fire only abner nott remained quiet and impassive  are you satisfied you have been duped said renshaw passionately  to their surprise mr nott stooped down and picking up one of the coins handed it gravely to renshaw would ye mind heftin that ere coin in your handfeelin it bitin it scrapin it with a knife and kinder seem how it compares with other coins  what do you mean said renshaw  i mean that that yer cointhat all the coins in this yer box that all the coins in them other boxesand thars forty on emis all and every one of em counterfeits  the piece dropped unconsciously from renshaws hand and striking another that lay on the deck gave out a dull suspicious ring  they waz counterfeits got up by them dutch supercargo sharps for dealin with the injins and cannibals and south sea heathens ez bows down to wood and stone it satisfied them ez well ez them buttons ye puts in missionary boxes i reckon and cepting ez freight dont cost nothin i found em tucked in the ribs o the old pontiac when i bought her and i nailed em up in thar lest they should fall into dishonest hands its a lucky thing mr renshaw that they comes into the honest fingers of a square man like sleightaint it  he turned his small guileless eyes upon renshaw with such childlike simplicity that it checked the hysterical laugh that was rising to the young mans lips  but did any one know of this but yourself  i reckon not i once suspicioned that old capen bowers who was always foolin round the hold yer must hev noticed the bulge in the casin but when he took to axin questions i axed othersye know my style rosey come  he led the way grimly back to the cabin the young people following but turning suddenly at the companion way he observed renshaws arm around the waist of his daughter he said nothing until they had reached the cabin when he closed the door softly and looking at them both gently said with infinite cunning  ef it is nt too late rosey ye kin tell this young man ez how i forgive him for havin diskivered the treasure of the pontiac                                       it was nearly eighteen months afterwards that mr nott one morning entered the room of his soninlaw at mandroño cottage drawing him aside he said with his old air of mystery now ez roseys ailin and dont seem to be so eager to diskiver whats become of mr ferrers i dont mind tellin ye that over a year ago i heard he died suddenly in sacramento thar was suthin in the paper about his bein a lunatic and claimin to be a relation to somebody on the pontiac but likes ez not its only the way those newspaper fellows got hold of the story of his wantin to marry rosey
