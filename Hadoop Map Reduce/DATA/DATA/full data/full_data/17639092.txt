pm on the afternoon of may 7 1915 the lusitania had been struck by two torpedoes in succession and was sinking rapidly while the boats were being launched with all possible speed the women and children were being lined up awaiting their turn some still clung desperately to husbands and fathers others clutched their children closely to their breasts one girl stood alone slightly apart from the rest she was quite young not more than eighteen she did not seem afraid and her grave steadfast eyes looked straight ahead  i beg your pardon  a mans voice beside her made her start and turn she had noticed the speaker more than once amongst the firstclass passengers there had been a hint of mystery about him which had appealed to her imagination he spoke to no one if anyone spoke to him he was quick to rebuff the overture also he had a nervous way of looking over his shoulder with a swift suspicious glance  she noticed now that he was greatly agitated there were beads of perspiration on his brow he was evidently in a state of overmastering fear and yet he did not strike her as the kind of man who would be afraid to meet death  yes her grave eyes met his inquiringly  he stood looking at her with a kind of desperate irresolution  it must be he muttered to himself yesit is the only way then aloud he said abruptly you are an american  yes  a patriotic one  the girl flushed  i guess youve no right to ask such a thing of course i am  dont be offended you wouldnt be if you knew how much there was at stake but ive got to trust some oneand it must be a woman  why  because of women and children first he looked round and lowered his voice im carrying papersvitally important papers they may make all the difference to the allies in the war you understand these papers have got to be saved theyve more chance with you than with me will you take them  the girl held out her hand  waiti must warn you there may be a riskif ive been followed i dont think i have but one never knows if so there will be danger have you the nerve to go through with it  the girl smiled  ill go through with it all right and im real proud to be chosen what am i to do with them afterwards  watch the newspapers ill advertise in the personal column of the times beginning shipmate at the end of three days if theres nothingwell youll know im down and out then take the packet to the american embassy and deliver it into the ambassadors own hands is that clear  quite clear  then be readyim going to say goodbye he took her hand in his goodbye good luck to you he said in a louder tone  her hand closed on the oilskin packet that had lain in his palm  the lusitania settled with a more decided list to starboard in answer to a quick command the girl went forward to take her place in the boat    chapter i the young adventurers ltd  tommy old thing  tuppence old bean  the two young people greeted each other affectionately and momentarily blocked the dover street tube exit in doing so the adjective old was misleading their united ages would certainly not have totalled fortyfive  not seen you for simply centuries continued the young man where are you off to come and chew a bun with me were getting a bit unpopular hereblocking the gangway as it were lets get out of it  the girl assenting they started walking down dover street towards piccadilly  now then said tommy where shall we go  the very faint anxiety which underlay his tone did not escape the astute ears of miss prudence cowley known to her intimate friends for some mysterious reason as tuppence she pounced at once  tommy youre stony  not a bit of it declared tommy unconvincingly rolling in cash  you always were a shocking liar said tuppence severely though you did once persuade sister greenbank that the doctor had ordered you beer as a tonic but forgotten to write it on the chart do you remember  tommy chuckled  i should think i did wasnt the old cat in a rage when she found out not that she was a bad sort really old mother greenbank good old hospitaldemobbed like everything else i suppose  tuppence sighed  yes you too  tommy nodded  two months ago  gratuity hinted tuppence  spent  oh tommy  no old thing not in riotous dissipation no such luck the cost of livingordinary plain or garden living nowadays is i assure you if you do not know  my dear child interrupted tuppence there is nothing i do not know about the cost of living here we are at lyons and we will each of us pay for our own thats it and tuppence led the way upstairs  the place was full and they wandered about looking for a table catching odds and ends of conversation as they did so  anddo you know she sat down and cried when i told her she couldnt have the flat after all it was simply a bargain my dear just like the one mabel lewis brought from paris  funny scraps one does overhear murmured tommy i passed two johnnies in the street today talking about some one called jane finn did you ever hear such a name  but at that moment two elderly ladies rose and collected parcels and tuppence deftly ensconced herself in one of the vacant seats  tommy ordered tea and buns tuppence ordered tea and buttered toast  and mind the tea comes in separate teapots she added severely  tommy sat down opposite her his bared head revealed a shock of exquisitely slickedback red hair his face was pleasantly uglynondescript yet unmistakably the face of a gentleman and a sportsman his brown suit was well cut but perilously near the end of its tether  they were an essentially modernlooking couple as they sat there tuppence had no claim to beauty but there was character and charm in the elfin lines of her little face with its determined chin and large wideapart grey eyes that looked mistily out from under straight black brows she wore a small bright green toque over her black bobbed hair and her extremely short and rather shabby skirt revealed a pair of uncommonly dainty ankles her appearance presented a valiant attempt at smartness  the tea came at last and tuppence rousing herself from a fit of meditation poured it out  now then said tommy taking a large bite of bun lets get uptodate remember i havent seen you since that time in hospital in 1916  very well tuppence helped herself liberally to buttered toast abridged biography of miss prudence cowley fifth daughter of archdeacon cowley of little missendell suffolk miss cowley left the delights and drudgeries of her home life early in the war and came up to london where she entered an officers hospital first month washed up six hundred and fortyeight plates every day second month promoted to drying aforesaid plates third month promoted to peeling potatoes fourth month promoted to cutting bread and butter fifth month promoted one floor up to duties of wardmaid with mop and pail sixth month promoted to waiting at table seventh month pleasing appearance and nice manners so striking that am promoted to waiting on the sisters eighth month slight check in career sister bond ate sister westhavens egg grand row wardmaid clearly to blame inattention in such important matters cannot be too highly censured mop and pail again how are the mighty fallen ninth month promoted to sweeping out wards where i found a friend of my childhood in lieutenant thomas beresford bow tommy whom i had not seen for five long years the meeting was affecting tenth month reproved by matron for visiting the pictures in company with one of the patients namely the aforementioned lieutenant thomas beresford eleventh and twelfth months parlourmaid duties resumed with entire success at the end of the year left hospital in a blaze of glory after that the talented miss cowley drove successively a trade delivery van a motorlorry and a general the last was the pleasantest he was quite a young general  what brighter was that inquired tommy perfectly sickening the way those brass hats drove from the war office to the savoy and from the savoy to the war office  ive forgotten his name now confessed tuppence to resume that was in a way the apex of my career i next entered a government office we had several very enjoyable tea parties i had intended to become a land girl a postwoman and a bus conductress by way of rounding off my careerbut the armistice intervened i clung to the office with the true limpet touch for many long months but alas i was combed out at last since then ive been looking for a job now thenyour turn  theres not so much promotion in mine said tommy regretfully and a great deal less variety i went out to france again as you know then they sent me to mesopotamia and i got wounded for the second time and went into hospital out there then i got stuck in egypt till the armistice happened kicked my heels there some time longer and as i told you finally got demobbed and for ten long weary months ive been job hunting there arent any jobs and if there were they wouldnt give em to me what good am i what do i know about business nothing  tuppence nodded gloomily  what about the colonies she suggested  tommy shook his head  i shouldnt like the coloniesand im perfectly certain they wouldnt like me  rich relations  again tommy shook his head  oh tommy not even a greataunt  ive got an old uncle whos more or less rolling but hes no good  why not  wanted to adopt me once i refused  i think i remember hearing about it said tuppence slowly you refused because of your mother  tommy flushed  yes it would have been a bit rough on the mater as you know i was all she had old boy hated herwanted to get me away from her just a bit of spite  your mothers dead isnt she said tuppence gently  tommy nodded  tuppences large grey eyes looked misty  youre a good sort tommy i always knew it  rot said tommy hastily well thats my position im just about desperate  so am i ive hung out as long as i could ive touted round ive answered advertisements ive tried every mortal blessed thing ive screwed and saved and pinched but its no good i shall have to go home  dont you want to  of course i dont want to whats the good of being sentimental fathers a dearim awfully fond of himbut youve no idea how i worry him he has that delightful early victorian view that short skirts and smoking are immoral you can imagine what a thorn in the flesh i am to him he just heaved a sigh of relief when the war took me off you see there are seven of us at home its awful all housework and mothers meetings i have always been the changeling i dont want to go back butoh tommy what else is there to do  tommy shook his head sadly there was a silence and then tuppence burst out  money money money i think about money morning noon and night i dare say its mercenary of me but there it is  same here agreed tommy with feeling  ive thought over every imaginable way of getting it too continued tuppence there are only three to be left it to marry it or to make it first is ruled out i havent got any rich elderly relatives any relatives i have are in homes for decayed gentlewomen i always help old ladies over crossings and pick up parcels for old gentlemen in case they should turn out to be eccentric millionaires but not one of them has ever asked me my nameand quite a lot never said thank you  there was a pause  of course resumed tuppence marriage is my best chance i made up my mind to marry money when i was quite young any thinking girl would im not sentimental you know she paused come now you cant say im sentimental she added sharply  certainly not agreed tommy hastily no one would ever think of sentiment in connection with you  thats not very polite replied tuppence but i dare say you mean it all right well there it is im ready and willingbut i never meet any rich men all the boys i know are about as hard up as i am  what about the general inquired tommy  i fancy he keeps a bicycle shop in time of peace explained tuppence no there it is now you could marry a rich girl  im like you i dont know any  that doesnt matter you can always get to know one now if i see a man in a fur coat come out of the ritz i cant rush up to him and say look here youre rich id like to know you  do you suggest that i should do that to a similarly garbed female  dont be silly you tread on her foot or pick up her handkerchief or something like that if she thinks you want to know her shes flattered and will manage it for you somehow  you overrate my manly charms murmured tommy  on the other hand proceeded tuppence my millionaire would probably run for his life nomarriage is fraught with difficulties remainsto make money  weve tried that and failed tommy reminded her  weve tried all the orthodox ways yes but suppose we try the unorthodox tommy lets be adventurers  certainly replied tommy cheerfully how do we begin  thats the difficulty if we could make ourselves known people might hire us to commit crimes for them  delightful commented tommy especially coming from a clergymans daughter  the moral guilt tuppence pointed out would be theirsnot mine you must admit that theres a difference between stealing a diamond necklace for yourself and being hired to steal it  there wouldnt be the least difference if you were caught  perhaps not but i shouldnt be caught im so clever  modesty always was your besetting sin remarked tommy  dont rag look here tommy shall we really shall we form a business partnership  form a company for the stealing of diamond necklaces  that was only an illustration lets have awhat do you call it in bookkeeping  dont know never did any  i havebut i always got mixed up and used to put credit entries on the debit side and vice versaso they fired me out oh i knowa joint venture it struck me as such a romantic phrase to come across in the middle of musty old figures its got an elizabethan flavour about itmakes one think of galleons and doubloons a joint venture  trading under the name of the young adventurers ltd is that your idea tuppence  its all very well to laugh but i feel there might be something in it  how do you propose to get in touch with your wouldbe employers  advertisement replied tuppence promptly have you got a bit of paper and a pencil men usually seem to have just like we have hairpins and powderpuffs  tommy handed over a rather shabby green notebook and tuppence began writing busily  shall we begin young officer twice wounded in the war  certainly not  oh very well my dear boy but i can assure you that that sort of thing might touch the heart of an elderly spinster and she might adopt you and then there would be no need for you to be a young adventurer at all  i dont want to be adopted  i forgot you had a prejudice against it i was only ragging you the papers are full up to the brim with that type of thing now listenhows this two young adventurers for hire willing to do anything go anywhere pay must be good we might as well make that clear from the start then we might add no reasonable offer refusedlike flats and furniture  i should think any offer we get in answer to that would be a pretty unreasonable one  tommy youre a genius thats ever so much more chic no unreasonable offer refusedif pay is good hows that  i shouldnt mention pay again it looks rather eager  it couldnt look as eager as i feel but perhaps you are right now ill read it straight through two young adventurers for hire willing to do anything go anywhere pay must be good no unreasonable offer refused how would that strike you if you read it  it would strike me as either being a hoax or else written by a lunatic  its not half so insane as a thing i read this morning beginning petunia and signed best boy she tore out the leaf and handed it to tommy there you are times i think reply to box soandso i expect it will be about five shillings heres half a crown for my share  tommy was holding the paper thoughtfully his faced burned a deeper red  shall we really try it he said at last shall we tuppence just for the fun of the thing  tommy youre a sport i knew you would be lets drink to success she poured some cold dregs of tea into the two cups  heres to our joint venture and may it prosper  the young adventurers ltd responded tommy  they put down the cups and laughed rather uncertainly tuppence rose  i must return to my palatial suite at the hostel  perhaps it is time i strolled round to the ritz agreed tommy with a grin where shall we meet and when  twelve oclock tomorrow piccadilly tube station will that suit you  my time is my own replied mr beresford magnificently  so long then  goodbye old thing  the two young people went off in opposite directions tuppences hostel was situated in what was charitably called southern belgravia for reasons of economy she did not take a bus  she was halfway across st jamess park when a mans voice behind her made her start  excuse me it said but may i speak to you for a moment    chapter ii mr whittingtons offer  tuppence turned sharply but the words hovering on the tip of her tongue remained unspoken for the mans appearance and manner did not bear out her first and most natural assumption she hesitated as if he read her thoughts the man said quickly  i can assure you i mean no disrespect  tuppence believed him although she disliked and distrusted him instinctively she was inclined to acquit him of the particular motive which she had at first attributed to him she looked him up and down he was a big man clean shaven with a heavy jowl his eyes were small and cunning and shifted their glance under her direct gaze  well what is it she asked  the man smiled  i happened to overhear part of your conversation with the young gentleman in lyons  wellwhat of it  nothingexcept that i think i may be of some use to you  another inference forced itself into tuppences mind  you followed me here  i took that liberty  and in what way do you think you could be of use to me  the man took a card from his pocket and handed it to her with a bow  tuppence took it and scrutinized it carefully it bore the inscription mr edward whittington below the name were the words esthonia glassware co and the address of a city office mr whittington spoke again  if you will call upon me tomorrow morning at eleven oclock i will lay the details of my proposition before you  at eleven oclock said tuppence doubtfully  at eleven oclock  tuppence made up her mind  very well ill be there  thank you good evening  he raised his hat with a flourish and walked away tuppence remained for some minutes gazing after him then she gave a curious movement of her shoulders rather as a terrier shakes himself  the adventures have begun she murmured to herself what does he want me to do i wonder theres something about you mr whittington that i dont like at all but on the other hand im not the least bit afraid of you and as ive said before and shall doubtless say again little tuppence can look after herself thank you  and with a short sharp nod of her head she walked briskly onward as a result of further meditations however she turned aside from the direct route and entered a post office there she pondered for some moments a telegraph form in her hand the thought of a possible five shillings spent unnecessarily spurred her to action and she decided to risk the waste of ninepence  disdaining the spiky pen and thick black treacle which a beneficent government had provided tuppence drew out tommys pencil which she had retained and wrote rapidly dont put in advertisement will explain tomorrow she addressed it to tommy at his club from which in one short month he would have to resign unless a kindly fortune permitted him to renew his subscription  it may catch him she murmured anyway its worth trying  after handing it over the counter she set out briskly for home stopping at a bakers to buy three pennyworth of new buns  later in her tiny cubicle at the top of the house she munched buns and reflected on the future what was the esthonia glassware co and what earthly need could it have for her services a pleasurable thrill of excitement made tuppence tingle at any rate the country vicarage had retreated into the background again the morrow held possibilities  it was a long time before tuppence went to sleep that night and when at length she did she dreamed that mr whittington had set her to washing up a pile of esthonia glassware which bore an unaccountable resemblance to hospital plates  it wanted some five minutes to eleven when tuppence reached the block of buildings in which the offices of the esthonia glassware co were situated to arrive before the time would look overeager so tuppence decided to walk to the end of the street and back again she did so on the stroke of eleven she plunged into the recesses of the building the esthonia glassware co was on the top floor there was a lift but tuppence chose to walk up  slightly out of breath she came to a halt outside the ground glass door with the legend painted across it esthonia glassware co  tuppence knocked in response to a voice from within she turned the handle and walked into a small rather dirty outer office  a middleaged clerk got down from a high stool at a desk near the window and came towards her inquiringly  i have an appointment with mr whittington said tuppence  will you come this way please he crossed to a partition door with private on it knocked then opened the door and stood aside to let her pass in  mr whittington was seated behind a large desk covered with papers tuppence felt her previous judgment confirmed there was something wrong about mr whittington the combination of his sleek prosperity and his shifty eye was not attractive  he looked up and nodded  so youve turned up all right thats good sit down will you  tuppence sat down on the chair facing him she looked particularly small and demure this morning she sat there meekly with downcast eyes whilst mr whittington sorted and rustled amongst his papers finally he pushed them away and leaned over the desk  now my dear young lady let us come to business his large face broadened into a smile you want work well i have work to offer you what should you say now to l100 down and all expenses paid mr whittington leaned back in his chair and thrust his thumbs into the armholes of his waistcoat  tuppence eyed him warily  and the nature of the work she demanded  nominalpurely nominal a pleasant trip that is all  where to  mr whittington smiled again  paris  oh said tuppence thoughtfully to herself she said of course if father heard that he would have a fit but somehow i dont see mr whittington in the role of the gay deceiver  yes continued whittington what could be more delightful to put the clock back a few yearsa very few i am sureand reenter one of those charming pensionnats de jeunes filles with which paris abounds  tuppence interrupted him  a pensionnat  exactly madame colombiers in the avenue de neuilly  tuppence knew the name well nothing could have been more select she had had several american friends there she was more than ever puzzled  you want me to go to madame colombiers for how long  that depends possibly three months  and that is all there are no other conditions  none whatever you would of course go in the character of my ward and you would hold no communication with your friends i should have to request absolute secrecy for the time being by the way you are english are you not  yes  yet you speak with a slight american accent  my great pal in hospital was a little american girl i dare say i picked it up from her i can soon get out of it again  on the contrary it might be simpler for you to pass as an american details about your past life in england might be more difficult to sustain yes i think that would be decidedly better then  one moment mr whittington you seem to be taking my consent for granted  whittington looked surprised  surely you are not thinking of refusing i can assure you that madame colombiers is a most highclass and orthodox establishment and the terms are most liberal  exactly said tuppence thats just it the terms are almost too liberal mr whittington i cannot see any way in which i can be worth that amount of money to you  no said whittington softly well i will tell you i could doubtless obtain some one else for very much less what i am willing to pay for is a young lady with sufficient intelligence and presence of mind to sustain her part well and also one who will have sufficient discretion not to ask too many questions  tuppence smiled a little she felt that whittington had scored  theres another thing so far there has been no mention of mr beresford where does he come in  mr beresford  my partner said tuppence with dignity you saw us together yesterday  ah yes but im afraid we shant require his services  then its off tuppence rose its both or neither sorrybut thats how it is good morning mr whittington  wait a minute let us see if something cant be managed sit down again miss he paused interrogatively  tuppences conscience gave her a passing twinge as she remembered the archdeacon she seized hurriedly on the first name that came into her head  jane finn she said hastily and then paused openmouthed at the effect of those two simple words  all the geniality had faded out of whittingtons face it was purple with rage and the veins stood out on the forehead and behind it all there lurked a sort of incredulous dismay he leaned forward and hissed savagely  so thats your little game is it  tuppence though utterly taken aback nevertheless kept her head she had not the faintest comprehension of his meaning but she was naturally quickwitted and felt it imperative to keep her end up as she phrased it  whittington went on  been playing with me have you all the time like a cat and mouse knew all the time what i wanted you for but kept up the comedy is that it eh he was cooling down the red colour was ebbing out of his face he eyed her keenly whos been blabbing rita  tuppence shook her head she was doubtful as to how long she could sustain this illusion but she realized the importance of not dragging an unknown rita into it  no she replied with perfect truth rita knows nothing about me  his eyes still bored into her like gimlets  how much do you know he shot out  very little indeed answered tuppence and was pleased to note that whittingtons uneasiness was augmented instead of allayed to have boasted that she knew a lot might have raised doubts in his mind  anyway snarled whittington you knew enough to come in here and plump out that name  it might be my own name tuppence pointed out  its likely isnt it then there would be two girls with a name like that  or i might just have hit upon it by chance continued tuppence intoxicated with the success of truthfulness  mr whittington brought his fist down upon the desk with a bang  quit fooling how much do you know and how much do you want  the last five words took tuppences fancy mightily especially after a meagre breakfast and a supper of buns the night before her present part was of the adventuress rather than the adventurous order but she did not deny its possibilities she sat up and smiled with the air of one who has the situation thoroughly well in hand  my dear mr whittington she said let us by all means lay our cards upon the table and pray do not be so angry you heard me say yesterday that i proposed to live by my wits it seems to me that i have now proved i have some wits to live by i admit i have knowledge of a certain name but perhaps my knowledge ends there  yesand perhaps it doesnt snarled whittington  you insist on misjudging me said tuppence and sighed gently  as i said once before said whittington angrily quit fooling and come to the point you cant play the innocent with me you know a great deal more than youre willing to admit  tuppence paused a moment to admire her own ingenuity and then said softly  i shouldnt like to contradict you mr whittington  so we come to the usual questionhow much  tuppence was in a dilemma so far she had fooled whittington with complete success but to mention a palpably impossible sum might awaken his suspicions an idea flashed across her brain  suppose we say a little something down and a fuller discussion of the matter later  whittington gave her an ugly glance  blackmail eh  tuppence smiled sweetly  oh no shall we say payment of services in advance  whittington grunted  you see explained tuppence still sweetly im so very fond of money  youre about the limit thats what you are growled whittington with a sort of unwilling admiration you took me in all right thought you were quite a meek little kid with just enough brains for my purpose  life moralized tuppence is full of surprises  all the same continued whittington some ones been talking you say it isnt rita was it oh come in  the clerk followed his discreet knock into the room and laid a paper at his masters elbow  telephone message just come for you sir  whittington snatched it up and read it a frown gathered on his brow  thatll do brown you can go  the clerk withdrew closing the door behind him whittington turned to tuppence  come tomorrow at the same time im busy now heres fifty to go on with  he rapidly sorted out some notes and pushed them across the table to tuppence then stood up obviously impatient for her to go  the girl counted the notes in a businesslike manner secured them in her handbag and rose  good morning mr whittington she said politely at least au revoir i should say  exactly au revoir whittington looked almost genial again a reversion that aroused in tuppence a faint misgiving au revoir my clever and charming young lady  tuppence sped lightly down the stairs a wild elation possessed her a neighbouring clock showed the time to be five minutes to twelve  lets give tommy a surprise murmured tuppence and hailed a taxi  the cab drew up outside the tube station tommy was just within the entrance his eyes opened to their fullest extent as he hurried forward to assist tuppence to alight she smiled at him affectionately and remarked in a slightly affected voice  pay the thing will you old bean ive got nothing smaller than a fivepound note    chapter iii a set back  the moment was not quite so triumphant as it ought to have been to begin with the resources of tommys pockets were somewhat limited in the end the fare was managed the lady recollecting a plebeian twopence and the driver still holding the varied assortment of coins in his hand was prevailed upon to move on which he did after one last hoarse demand as to what the gentleman thought he was giving him  i think youve given him too much tommy said tuppence innocently i fancy he wants to give some of it back  it was possibly this remark which induced the driver to move away  well said mr beresford at length able to relieve his feelings what thedickens did you want to take a taxi for  i was afraid i might be late and keep you waiting said tuppence gently  afraidyoumightbelate oh lord i give it up said mr beresford  and really and truly continued tuppence opening her eyes very wide i havent got anything smaller than a fivepound note  you did that part of it very well old bean but all the same the fellow wasnt taken innot for a moment  no said tuppence thoughtfully he didnt believe it thats the curious part about speaking the truth no one does believe it i found that out this morning now lets go to lunch how about the savoy  tommy grinned  how about the ritz  on second thoughts i prefer the piccadilly its nearer we shant have to take another taxi come along  is this a new brand of humour or is your brain really unhinged inquired tommy  your last supposition is the correct one i have come into money and the shock has been too much for me for that particular form of mental trouble an eminent physician recommends unlimited hors doeuvre lobster a lamericane chicken newberg and peche melba lets go and get them  tuppence old girl what has really come over you  oh unbelieving one tuppence wrenched open her bag look here and here and here  great jehosaphat my dear girl dont wave fishers aloft like that  theyre not fishers theyre five times better than fishers and this ones ten times better  tommy groaned  i must have been drinking unawares am i dreaming tuppence or do i really behold a large quantity of fivepound notes being waved about in a dangerous fashion  even so o king now will you come and have lunch  ill come anywhere but what have you been doing holding up a bank  all in good time what an awful place piccadilly circus is theres a huge bus bearing down on us it would be too terrible if they killed the fivepound notes  grill room inquired tommy as they reached the opposite pavement in safety  the others more expensive demurred tuppence  thats mere wicked wanton extravagance come on below  are you sure i can get all the things i want there  that extremely unwholesome menu you were outlining just now of course you canor as much as is good for you anyway  and now tell me said tommy unable to restrain his pentup curiosity any longer as they sat in state surrounded by the many hors doeuvre of tuppences dreams  miss cowley told him  and the curious part of it is she ended that i really did invent the name of jane finn i didnt want to give my own because of poor fatherin case i should get mixed up in anything shady  perhaps thats so said tommy slowly but you didnt invent it  what  no i told it to you dont you remember i said yesterday id overheard two people talking about a female called jane finn thats what brought the name into your mind so pat  so you did i remember now how extraordinary tuppence tailed off into silence suddenly she aroused herself tommy  yes  what were they like the two men you passed  tommy frowned in an effort at remembrance  one was a big fat sort of chap clean shaven i thinkand dark  thats him cried tuppence in an ungrammatical squeal thats whittington what was the other man like  i cant remember i didnt notice him particularly it was really the outlandish name that caught my attention  and people say that coincidences dont happen tuppence tackled her peche melba happily  but tommy had become serious  look here tuppence old girl what is this going to lead to  more money replied his companion  i know that youve only got one idea in your head what i mean is what about the next step how are you going to keep the game up  oh tuppence laid down her spoon youre right tommy it is a bit of a poser  after all you know you cant bluff him forever youre sure to slip up sooner or later and anyway im not at all sure that it isnt actionableblackmail you know  nonsense blackmail is saying youll tell unless you are given money now theres nothing i could tell because i dont really know anything  hm said tommy doubtfully well anyway what are we going to do whittington was in a hurry to get rid of you this morning but next time hell want to know something more before he parts with his money hell want to know how much you know and where you got your information from and a lot of other things that you cant cope with what are you going to do about it  tuppence frowned severely  we must think order some turkish coffee tommy stimulating to the brain oh dear what a lot i have eaten  you have made rather a hog of yourself so have i for that matter but i flatter myself that my choice of dishes was more judicious than yours two coffees this was to the waiter one turkish one french  tuppence sipped her coffee with a deeply reflective air and snubbed tommy when he spoke to her  be quiet im thinking  shades of pelmanism said tommy and relapsed into silence  there said tuppence at last ive got a plan obviously what weve got to do is to find out more about it all  tommy applauded  dont jeer we can only find out through whittington we must discover where he lives what he doessleuth him in fact now i cant do it because he knows me but he only saw you for a minute or two in lyons hes not likely to recognize you after all one young man is much like another  i repudiate that remark utterly im sure my pleasing features and distinguished appearance would single me out from any crowd  my plan is this tuppence went on calmly ill go alone tomorrow ill put him off again like i did today it doesnt matter if i dont get any more money at once fifty pounds ought to last us a few days  or even longer  youll hang about outside when i come out i shant speak to you in case hes watching but ill take up my stand somewhere near and when he comes out of the building ill drop a handkerchief or something and off you go  off i go where  follow him of course silly what do you think of the idea  sort of thing one reads about in books i somehow feel that in real life one will feel a bit of an ass standing in the street for hours with nothing to do people will wonder what im up to  not in the city every ones in such a hurry probably no one will even notice you at all  thats the second time youve made that sort of remark never mind i forgive you anyway it will be rather a lark what are you doing this afternoon  well said tuppence meditatively i had thought of hats or perhaps silk stockings or perhaps  hold hard admonished tommy theres a limit to fifty pounds but lets do dinner and a show tonight at all events  rather  the day passed pleasantly the evening even more so two of the fivepound notes were now irretrievably dead  they met by arrangement the following morning and proceeded citywards tommy remained on the opposite side of the road while tuppence plunged into the building  tommy strolled slowly down to the end of the street then back again just as he came abreast of the building tuppence darted across the road  tommy  yes whats up  the place is shut i cant make anyone hear  thats odd  isnt it come up with me and lets try again  tommy followed her as they passed the third floor landing a young clerk came out of an office he hesitated a moment then addressed himself to tuppence  were you wanting the esthonia glassware  yes please  its closed down since yesterday afternoon company being wound up they say not that ive ever heard of it myself but anyway the office is to let  ththank you faltered tuppence i suppose you dont know mr whittingtons address  afraid i dont they left rather suddenly  thank you very much said tommy come on tuppence  they descended to the street again where they gazed at one another blankly  thats torn it said tommy at length  and i never suspected it wailed tuppence  cheer up old thing it cant be helped  cant it though tuppences little chin shot out defiantly do you think this is the end if so youre wrong its just the beginning  the beginning of what  of our adventure tommy dont you see if they are scared enough to run away like this it shows that there must be a lot in this jane finn business well well get to the bottom of it well run them down well be sleuths in earnest  yes but theres no one left to sleuth  no thats why well have to start all over again lend me that bit of pencil thanks wait a minutedont interrupt there tuppence handed back the pencil and surveyed the piece of paper on which she had written with a satisfied eye  whats that  advertisement  youre not going to put that thing in after all  no its a different one she handed him the slip of paper  tommy read the words on it aloud  wanted any information respecting jane finn apply ya    chapter iv who is jane finn  the next day passed slowly it was necessary to curtail expenditure carefully husbanded forty pounds will last a long time luckily the weather was fine and walking is cheap dictated tuppence an outlying picture house provided them with recreation for the evening  the day of disillusionment had been a wednesday on thursday the advertisement had duly appeared on friday letters might be expected to arrive at tommys rooms  he had been bound by an honourable promise not to open any such letters if they did arrive but to repair to the national gallery where his colleague would meet him at ten oclock  tuppence was first at the rendezvous she ensconced herself on a red velvet seat and gazed at the turners with unseeing eyes until she saw the familiar figure enter the room  well  well returned mr beresford provokingly which is your favourite picture  dont be a wretch arent there any answers  tommy shook his head with a deep and somewhat overacted melancholy  i didnt want to disappoint you old thing by telling you right off its too bad good money wasted he sighed still there it is the advertisement has appeared andthere are only two answers  tommy you devil almost screamed tuppence give them to me how could you be so mean  your language tuppence your language theyre very particular at the national gallery government show you know and do remember as i have pointed out to you before that as a clergymans daughter  i ought to be on the stage finished tuppence with a snap  that is not what i intended to say but if you are sure that you have enjoyed to the full the reaction of joy after despair with which i have kindly provided you free of charge let us get down to our mail as the saying goes  tuppence snatched the two precious envelopes from him unceremoniously and scrutinized them carefully  thick paper this one it looks rich well keep it to the last and open the other first  right you are one two three go  tuppences little thumb ripped open the envelope and she extracted the contents   dear sir  referring to your advertisement in this mornings paper i may be able to be of some use to you perhaps you could call and see me at the above address at eleven oclock tomorrow morning  yours truly  a carter   27 carshalton gardens said tuppence referring to the address thats gloucester road way plenty of time to get there if we tube  the following said tommy is the plan of campaign it is my turn to assume the offensive ushered into the presence of mr carter he and i wish each other good morning as is customary he then says please take a seat mrer to which i reply promptly and significantly edward whittington whereupon mr carter turns purple in the face and gasps out how much pocketing the usual fee of fifty pounds i rejoin you in the road outside and we proceed to the next address and repeat the performance  dont be absurd tommy now for the other letter oh this is from the ritz  a hundred pounds instead of fifty  ill read it  dear sir  re your advertisement i should be glad if you would call round somewhere about lunchtime  yours truly  julius p hersheimmer   ha said tommy do i smell a boche or only an american millionaire of unfortunate ancestry at all events well call at lunchtime its a good timefrequently leads to free food for two  tuppence nodded assent  now for carter well have to hurry  carshalton terrace proved to be an unimpeachable row of what tuppence called ladylike looking houses they rang the bell at no 27 and a neat maid answered the door she looked so respectable that tuppences heart sank upon tommys request for mr carter she showed them into a small study on the ground floor where she left them hardly a minute elapsed however before the door opened and a tall man with a lean hawklike face and a tired manner entered the room  mr y a he said and smiled his smile was distinctly attractive do sit down both of you  they obeyed he himself took a chair opposite to tuppence and smiled at her encouragingly there was something in the quality of his smile that made the girls usual readiness desert her  as he did not seem inclined to open the conversation tuppence was forced to begin  we wanted to knowthat is would you be so kind as to tell us anything you know about jane finn  jane finn ah mr carter appeared to reflect well the question is what do you know about her  tuppence drew herself up  i dont see that thats got anything to do with it  no but it has you know really it has he smiled again in his tired way and continued reflectively so that brings us down to it again what do you know about jane finn  come now he continued as tuppence remained silent you must know something to have advertised as you did he leaned forward a little his weary voice held a hint of persuasiveness suppose you tell me  there was something very magnetic about mr carters personality tuppence seemed to shake herself free of it with an effort as she said  we couldnt do that could we tommy  but to her surprise her companion did not back her up his eyes were fixed on mr carter and his tone when he spoke held an unusual note of deference  i dare say the little we know wont be any good to you sir but such as it is youre welcome to it  tommy cried out tuppence in surprise  mr carter slewed round in his chair his eyes asked a question  tommy nodded  yes sir i recognized you at once saw you in france when i was with the intelligence as soon as you came into the room i knew  mr carter held up his hand  no names please im known as mr carter here its my cousins house by the way shes willing to lend it to me sometimes when its a case of working on strictly unofficial lines well nowhe looked from one to the otherwhos going to tell me the story  fire ahead tuppence directed tommy its your yarn  yes little lady out with it  and obediently tuppence did out with it telling the whole story from the forming of the young adventurers ltd downwards  mr carter listened in silence with a resumption of his tired manner now and then he passed his hand across his lips as though to hide a smile when she had finished he nodded gravely  not much but suggestive quite suggestive if youll excuse my saying so youre a curious young couple i dont knowyou might succeed where others have failed i believe in luck you knowalways have  he paused a moment and then went on  well how about it youre out for adventure how would you like to work for me all quite unofficial you know expenses paid and a moderate screw  tuppence gazed at him her lips parted her eyes growing wider and wider  what should we have to do she breathed  mr carter smiled  just go on with what youre doing now find jane finn  yes butwho is jane finn  mr carter nodded gravely  yes youre entitled to know that i think  he leaned back in his chair crossed his legs brought the tips of his fingers together and began in a low monotone  secret diplomacy which by the way is nearly always bad policy does not concern you it will be sufficient to say that in the early days of 1915 a certain document came into being it was the draft of a secret agreementtreatycall it what you like it was drawn up ready for signature by the various representatives and drawn up in americaat that time a neutral country it was dispatched to england by a special messenger selected for that purpose a young fellow called danvers it was hoped that the whole affair had been kept so secret that nothing would have leaked out that kind of hope is usually disappointed somebody always talks  danvers sailed for england on the lusitania he carried the precious papers in an oilskin packet which he wore next his skin it was on that particular voyage that the lusitania was torpedoed and sunk danvers was among the list of those missing eventually his body was washed ashore and identified beyond any possible doubt but the oilskin packet was missing  the question was had it been taken from him or had he himself passed it on into anothers keeping there were a few incidents that strengthened the possibility of the latter theory after the torpedo struck the ship in the few moments during the launching of the boats danvers was seen speaking to a young american girl no one actually saw him pass anything to her but he might have done so it seems to me quite likely that he entrusted the papers to this girl believing that she as a woman had a greater chance of bringing them safely to shore  but if so where was the girl and what had she done with the papers by later advice from america it seemed likely that danvers had been closely shadowed on the way over was this girl in league with his enemies or had she in her turn been shadowed and either tricked or forced into handing over the precious packet  we set to work to trace her out it proved unexpectedly difficult her name was jane finn and it duly appeared among the list of the survivors but the girl herself seemed to have vanished completely inquiries into her antecedents did little to help us she was an orphan and had been what we should call over here a pupil teacher in a small school out west her passport had been made out for paris where she was going to join the staff of a hospital she had offered her services voluntarily and after some correspondence they had been accepted having seen her name in the list of the saved from the lusitania the staff of the hospital were naturally very surprised at her not arriving to take up her billet and at not hearing from her in any way  well every effort was made to trace the young ladybut all in vain we tracked her across ireland but nothing could be heard of her after she set foot in england no use was made of the draft treatyas might very easily have been doneand we therefore came to the conclusion that danvers had after all destroyed it the war entered on another phase the diplomatic aspect changed accordingly and the treaty was never redrafted rumours as to its existence were emphatically denied the disappearance of jane finn was forgotten and the whole affair was lost in oblivion  mr carter paused and tuppence broke in impatiently  but why has it all cropped up again the wars over  a hint of alertness came into mr carters manner  because it seems that the papers were not destroyed after all and that they might be resurrected today with a new and deadly significance  tuppence stared mr carter nodded  yes five years ago that draft treaty was a weapon in our hands today it is a weapon against us it was a gigantic blunder if its terms were made public it would mean disaster it might possibly bring about another warnot with germany this time that is an extreme possibility and i do not believe in its likelihood myself but that document undoubtedly implicates a number of our statesmen whom we cannot afford to have discredited in any way at the present moment as a party cry for labour it would be irresistible and a labour government at this juncture would in my opinion be a grave disability for british trade but that is a mere nothing to the real danger  he paused and then said quietly  you may perhaps have heard or read that there is bolshevist influence at work behind the present labour unrest  tuppence nodded  that is the truth bolshevist gold is pouring into this country for the specific purpose of procuring a revolution and there is a certain man a man whose real name is unknown to us who is working in the dark for his own ends the bolshevists are behind the labour unrestbut this man is behind the bolshevists who is he we do not know he is always spoken of by the unassuming title of mr brown but one thing is certain he is the master criminal of this age he controls a marvellous organization most of the peace propaganda during the war was originated and financed by him his spies are everywhere  a naturalized german asked tommy  on the contrary i have every reason to believe he is an englishman he was progerman as he would have been proboer what he seeks to attain we do not knowprobably supreme power for himself of a kind unique in history we have no clue as to his real personality it is reported that even his own followers are ignorant of it where we have come across his tracks he has always played a secondary part somebody else assumes the chief role but afterwards we always find that there has been some nonentity a servant or a clerk who has remained in the background unnoticed and that the elusive mr brown has escaped us once more  oh tuppence jumped i wonder  yes  i remember in mr whittingtons office the clerkhe called him brown you dont think  carter nodded thoughtfully  very likely a curious point is that the name is usually mentioned an idiosyncrasy of genius can you describe him at all  i really didnt notice he was quite ordinaryjust like anyone else  mr carter sighed in his tired manner  that is the invariable description of mr brown brought a telephone message to the man whittington did he notice a telephone in the outer office  tuppence thought  no i dont think i did  exactly that message was mr browns way of giving an order to his subordinate he overheard the whole conversation of course was it after that that whittington handed you over the money and told you to come the following day  tuppence nodded  yes undoubtedly the hand of mr brown mr carter paused well there it is you see what you are pitting yourselves against possibly the finest criminal brain of the age i dont quite like it you know youre such young things both of you i shouldnt like anything to happen to you  it wont tuppence assured him positively  ill look after her sir said tommy  and ill look after you retorted tuppence resenting the manly assertion  well then look after each other said mr carter smiling now lets get back to business theres something mysterious about this draft treaty that we havent fathomed yet weve been threatened with itin plain and unmistakable terms the revolutionary element as good as declare that its in their hands and that they intend to produce it at a given moment on the other hand they are clearly at fault about many of its provisions the government consider it as mere bluff on their part and rightly or wrongly have stuck to the policy of absolute denial im not so sure there have been hints indiscreet allusions that seem to indicate that the menace is a real one the position is much as though they had got hold of an incriminating document but couldnt read it because it was in cipherbut we know that the draft treaty wasnt in ciphercouldnt be in the nature of thingsso that wont wash but theres something of course jane finn may be dead for all we knowbut i dont think so the curious thing is that theyre trying to get information about the girl from us  what  yes one or two little things have cropped up and your story little lady confirms my idea they know were looking for jane finn well theyll produce a jane finn of their ownsay at a pensionnat in paris tuppence gasped and mr carter smiled no one knows in the least what she looks like so thats all right shes primed with a trumpedup tale and her real business is to get as much information as possible out of us see the idea  then you thinktuppence paused to grasp the supposition fullythat it was as jane finn that they wanted me to go to paris  mr carter smiled more wearily than ever  i believe in coincidences you know he said    chapter v mr julius p hersheimmer   well said tuppence recovering herself it really seems as though it were meant to be  carter nodded  i know what you mean im superstitious myself luck and all that sort of thing fate seems to have chosen you out to be mixed up in this  tommy indulged in a chuckle  my word i dont wonder whittington got the wind up when tuppence plumped out that name i should have myself but look here sir were taking up an awful lot of your time have you any tips to give us before we clear out  i think not my experts working in stereotyped ways have failed you will bring imagination and an open mind to the task dont be discouraged if that too does not succeed for one thing there is a likelihood of the pace being forced  tuppence frowned uncomprehendingly  when you had that interview with whittington they had time before them i have information that the big coup was planned for early in the new year but the government is contemplating legislative action which will deal effectually with the strike menace theyll get wind of it soon if they havent already and its possible that that may bring things to a head i hope it will myself the less time they have to mature their plans the better im just warning you that you havent much time before you and that you neednt be cast down if you fail its not an easy proposition anyway thats all  tuppence rose  i think we ought to be businesslike what exactly can we count upon you for mr carter mr carters lips twitched slightly but he replied succinctly funds within reason detailed information on any point and no official recognition i mean that if you get yourselves into trouble with the police i cant officially help you out of it youre on your own  tuppence nodded sagely  i quite understand that ill write out a list of the things i want to know when ive had time to think nowabout money  yes miss tuppence do you want to say how much  not exactly weve got plenty to go with for the present but when we want more  it will be waiting for you  yes butim sure i dont want to be rude about the government if youve got anything to do with it but you know one really has the devil of a time getting anything out of it and if we have to fill up a blue form and send it in and then after three months they send us a green one and so onwell that wont be much use will it  mr carter laughed outright  dont worry miss tuppence you will send a personal demand to me here and the money in notes shall be sent by return of post as to salary shall we say at the rate of three hundred a year and an equal sum for mr beresford of course  tuppence beamed upon him  how lovely you are kind i do love money ill keep beautiful accounts of our expenses all debit and credit and the balance on the right side and red line drawn sideways with the totals the same at the bottom i really know how to do it when i think  im sure you do well goodbye and good luck to you both  he shook hands with them and in another minute they were descending the steps of 27 carshalton terrace with their heads in a whirl  tommy tell me at once who is mr carter  tommy murmured a name in her ear  oh said tuppence impressed  and i can tell you old bean hes it  oh said tuppence again then she added reflectively  i like him dont you he looks so awfully tired and bored and yet you feel that underneath hes just like steel all keen and flashing oh she gave a skip pinch me tommy do pinch me i cant believe its real  mr beresford obliged  ow thats enough yes were not dreaming weve got a job  and what a job the joint venture has really begun  its more respectable than i thought it would be said tuppence thoughtfully  luckily i havent got your craving for crime what time is it lets have lunchoh  the same thought sprang to the minds of each tommy voiced it first  julius p hersheimmer  we never told mr carter about hearing from him  well there wasnt much to tellnot till weve seen him come on wed better take a taxi  now whos being extravagant  all expenses paid remember hop in  at any rate we shall make a better effect arriving this way said tuppence leaning back luxuriously im sure blackmailers never arrive in buses  weve ceased being blackmailers tommy pointed out  im not sure i have said tuppence darkly  on inquiring for mr hersheimmer they were at once taken up to his suite an impatient voice cried come in in answer to the pageboys knock and the lad stood aside to let them pass in  mr julius p hersheimmer was a great deal younger than either tommy or tuppence had pictured him the girl put him down as thirtyfive he was of middle height and squarely built to match his jaw his face was pugnacious but pleasant no one could have mistaken him for anything but an american though he spoke with very little accent  get my note sit down and tell me right away all you know about my cousin  your cousin  sure thing jane finn  is she your cousin  my father and her mother were brother and sister explained mr hersheimmer meticulously  oh cried tuppence then you know where she is  no mr hersheimmer brought down his fist with a bang on the table im darned if i do dont you  we advertised to receive information not to give it said tuppence severely  i guess i know that i can read but i thought maybe it was her back history you were after and that youd know where she was now  well we wouldnt mind hearing her back history said tuppence guardedly  but mr hersheimmer seemed to grow suddenly suspicious  see here he declared this isnt sicily no demanding ransom or threatening to crop her ears if i refuse these are the british isles so quit the funny business or ill just sing out for that beautiful big british policeman i see out there in piccadilly  tommy hastened to explain  we havent kidnapped your cousin on the contrary were trying to find her were employed to do so  mr hersheimmer leant back in his chair  put me wise he said succinctly  tommy fell in with this demand in so far as he gave him a guarded version of the disappearance of jane finn and of the possibility of her having been mixed up unawares in some political show he alluded to tuppence and himself as private inquiry agents commissioned to find her and added that they would therefore be glad of any details mr hersheimmer could give them  that gentleman nodded approval  i guess thats all right i was just a mite hasty but london gets my goat i only know little old new york just trot out your questions and ill answer  for the moment this paralysed the young adventurers but tuppence recovering herself plunged boldly into the breach with a reminiscence culled from detective fiction  when did you last see the deceyour cousin i mean  never seen her responded mr hersheimmer  what demanded tommy astonished  hersheimmer turned to him  no sir as i said before my father and her mother were brother and sister just as you might betommy did not correct this view of their relationshipbut they didnt always get on together and when my aunt made up her mind to marry amos finn who was a poor school teacher out west my father was just mad said if he made his pile as he seemed in a fair way to do shed never see a cent of it well the upshot was that aunt jane went out west and we never heard from her again  the old man did pile it up he went into oil and he went into steel and he played a bit with railroads and i can tell you he made wall street sit up he paused then he diedlast falland i got the dollars well would you believe it my conscience got busy kept knocking me up and saying what about your aunt jane way out west it worried me some you see i figured it out that amos finn would never make good he wasnt the sort end of it was i hired a man to hunt her down result she was dead and amos finn was dead but theyd left a daughterjanewhod been torpedoed in the lusitania on her way to paris she was saved all right but they didnt seem able to hear of her over this side i guessed they werent hustling any so i thought id come along over and speed things up i phoned scotland yard and the admiralty first thing the admiralty rather choked me off but scotland yard were very civilsaid they would make inquiries even sent a man round this morning to get her photograph im off to paris tomorrow just to see what the prefecture is doing i guess if i go to and fro hustling them they ought to get busy  the energy of mr hersheimmer was tremendous they bowed before it  but say now he ended youre not after her for anything contempt of court or something british a proudspirited young american girl might find your rules and regulations in war time rather irksome and get up against it if thats the case and theres such a thing as graft in this country ill buy her off  tuppence reassured him  thats good then we can work together what about some lunch shall we have it up here or go down to the restaurant  tuppence expressed a preference for the latter and julius bowed to her decision  oysters had just given place to sole colbert when a card was brought to hersheimmer  inspector japp cid scotland yard again another man this time what does he expect i can tell him that i didnt tell the first chap i hope they havent lost that photograph that western photographers place was burned down and all his negatives destroyedthis is the only copy in existence i got it from the principal of the college there  an unformulated dread swept over tuppence  youyou dont know the name of the man who came this morning  yes i do no i dont half a second it was on his card oh i know inspector brown quiet unassuming sort of chap    chapter vi a plan of campaign  a veil might with profit be drawn over the events of the next halfhour suffice it to say that no such person as inspector brown was known to scotland yard the photograph of jane finn which would have been of the utmost value to the police in tracing her was lost beyond recovery once again mr brown had triumphed  the immediate result of this set back was to effect a rapprochement between julius hersheimmer and the young adventurers all barriers went down with a crash and tommy and tuppence felt they had known the young american all their lives they abandoned the discreet reticence of private inquiry agents and revealed to him the whole history of the joint venture whereat the young man declared himself tickled to death  he turned to tuppence at the close of the narration  ive always had a kind of idea that english girls were just a mite mossgrown oldfashioned and sweet you know but scared to move round without a footman or a maiden aunt i guess im a bit behind the times  the upshot of these confidential relations was that tommy and tuppence took up their abode forthwith at the ritz in order as tuppence put it to keep in touch with jane finns only living relation and put like that she added confidentially to tommy nobody could boggle at the expense  nobody did which was the great thing  and now said the young lady on the morning after their installation to work  mr beresford put down the daily mail which he was reading and applauded with somewhat unnecessary vigour he was politely requested by his colleague not to be an ass  dash it all tommy weve got to do something for our money  tommy sighed  yes i fear even the dear old government will not support us at the ritz in idleness for ever  therefore as i said before we must do something  well said tommy picking up the daily mail again do it i shant stop you  you see continued tuppence ive been thinking  she was interrupted by a fresh bout of applause  its all very well for you to sit there being funny tommy it would do you no harm to do a little brain work too  my union tuppence my union it does not permit me to work before 11 am  tommy do you want something thrown at you it is absolutely essential that we should without delay map out a plan of campaign  hear hear  well lets do it  tommy laid his paper finally aside theres something of the simplicity of the truly great mind about you tuppence fire ahead im listening  to begin with said tuppence what have we to go upon  absolutely nothing said tommy cheerily  wrong tuppence wagged an energetic finger we have two distinct clues  what are they  first clue we know one of the gang  whittington  yes id recognize him anywhere  hum said tommy doubtfully i dont call that much of a clue you dont know where to look for him and its about a thousand to one against your running against him by accident  im not so sure about that replied tuppence thoughtfully ive often noticed that once coincidences start happening they go on happening in the most extraordinary way i dare say its some natural law that we havent found out still as you say we cant rely on that but there are places in london where simply every one is bound to turn up sooner or later piccadilly circus for instance one of my ideas was to take up my stand there every day with a tray of flags  what about meals inquired the practical tommy  how like a man what does mere food matter  thats all very well youve just had a thundering good breakfast no ones got a better appetite than you have tuppence and by teatime youd be eating the flags pins and all but honestly i dont think much of the idea whittington maynt be in london at all  thats true anyway i think clue no 2 is more promising  lets hear it  its nothing much only a christian namerita whittington mentioned it that day  are you proposing a third advertisement wanted female crook answering to the name of rita  i am not i propose to reason in a logical manner that man danvers was shadowed on the way over wasnt he and its more likely to have been a woman than a man  i dont see that at all  i am absolutely certain that it would be a woman and a goodlooking one replied tuppence calmly  on these technical points i bow to your decision murmured mr beresford  now obviously this woman whoever she was was saved  how do you make that out  if she wasnt how would they have known jane finn had got the papers  correct proceed o sherlock  now theres just a chance i admit its only a chance that this woman may have been rita  and if so  if so weve got to hunt through the survivors of the lusitania till we find her  then the first thing is to get a list of the survivors  ive got it i wrote a long list of things i wanted to know and sent it to mr carter i got his reply this morning and among other things it encloses the official statement of those saved from the lusitania hows that for clever little tuppence  full marks for industry zero for modesty but the great point is is there a rita on the list  thats just what i dont know confessed tuppence  dont know  yes look here together they bent over the list you see very few christian names are given theyre nearly all mrs or miss  tommy nodded  that complicates matters he murmured thoughtfully  tuppence gave her characteristic terrier shake  well weve just got to get down to it thats all well start with the london area just note down the addresses of any of the females who live in london or roundabout while i put on my hat  five minutes later the young couple emerged into piccadilly and a few seconds later a taxi was bearing them to the laurels glendower road n7 the residence of mrs edgar keith whose name figured first in a list of seven reposing in tommys pocketbook  the laurels was a dilapidated house standing back from the road with a few grimy bushes to support the fiction of a front garden tommy paid off the taxi and accompanied tuppence to the front door bell as she was about to ring it he arrested her hand  what are you going to say  what am i going to say why i shall sayoh dear i dont know its very awkward  i thought as much said tommy with satisfaction how like a woman no foresight now just stand aside and see how easily the mere male deals with the situation he pressed the bell tuppence withdrew to a suitable spot  a slatternly looking servant with an extremely dirty face and a pair of eyes that did not match answered the door  tommy had produced a notebook and pencil  good morning he said briskly and cheerfully from the hampstead borough council the new voting register mrs edgar keith lives here does she not  yaas said the servant  christian name asked tommy his pencil poised  missuss eleanor jane  eleanor spelt tommy any sons or daughters over twentyone  naow  thank you tommy closed the notebook with a brisk snap good morning  the servant volunteered her first remark  i thought perhaps as youd come about the gas she observed cryptically and shut the door  tommy rejoined his accomplice  you see tuppence he observed childs play to the masculine mind  i dont mind admitting that for once youve scored handsomely i should never have thought of that  good wheeze wasnt it and we can repeat it ad lib  lunchtime found the young couple attacking a steak and chips in an obscure hostelry with avidity they had collected a gladys mary and a marjorie been baffled by one change of address and had been forced to listen to a long lecture on universal suffrage from a vivacious american lady whose christian name had proved to be sadie  ah said tommy imbibing a long draught of beer i feel better wheres the next draw  the notebook lay on the table between them tuppence picked it up  mrs vandemeyer she read 20 south audley mansions miss wheeler 43 clapington road battersea shes a ladys maid as far as i remember so probably wont be there and anyway shes not likely  then the mayfair lady is clearly indicated as the first port of call  tommy im getting discouraged  buck up old bean we always knew it was an outside chance and anyway were only starting if we draw a blank in london theres a fine tour of england ireland and scotland before us  true said tuppence her flagging spirits reviving and all expenses paid but oh tommy i do like things to happen quickly so far adventure has succeeded adventure but this morning has been dull as dull  you must stifle this longing for vulgar sensation tuppence remember that if mr brown is all he is reported to be its a wonder that he has not ere now done us to death thats a good sentence quite a literary flavour about it  youre really more conceited than i amwith less excuse ahem but it certainly is queer that mr brown has not yet wreaked vengeance upon us you see i can do it too we pass on our way unscathed  perhaps he doesnt think us worth bothering about suggested the young man simply  tuppence received the remark with great disfavour  how horrid you are tommy just as though we didnt count  sorry tuppence what i meant was that we work like moles in the dark and that he has no suspicion of our nefarious schemes ha ha  ha ha echoed tuppence approvingly as she rose  south audley mansions was an imposinglooking block of flats just off park lane no 20 was on the second floor  tommy had by this time the glibness born of practice he rattled off the formula to the elderly woman looking more like a housekeeper than a servant who opened the door to him  christian name  margaret  tommy spelt it but the other interrupted him  no g u e  oh marguerite french way i see he paused then plunged boldly we had her down as rita vandemeyer but i suppose thats incorrect  shes mostly called that sir but marguerites her name  thank you thats all good morning  hardly able to contain his excitement tommy hurried down the stairs tuppence was waiting at the angle of the turn  you heard  yes oh tommy  tommy squeezed her arm sympathetically  i know old thing i feel the same  itsits so lovely to think of thingsand then for them really to happen cried tuppence enthusiastically  her hand was still in tommys they had reached the entrance hall there were footsteps on the stairs above them and voices  suddenly to tommys complete surprise tuppence dragged him into the little space by the side of the lift where the shadow was deepest  what the  hush  two men came down the stairs and passed out through the entrance tuppences hand closed tighter on tommys arm  quickfollow them i darent he might recognize me i dont know who the other man is but the bigger of the two was whittington    chapter vii the house in soho  whittington and his companion were walking at a good pace tommy started in pursuit at once and was in time to see them turn the corner of the street his vigorous strides soon enabled him to gain upon them and by the time he in his turn reached the corner the distance between them was sensibly lessened the small mayfair streets were comparatively deserted and he judged it wise to content himself with keeping them in sight  the sport was a new one to him though familiar with the technicalities from a course of novel reading he had never before attempted to follow anyone and it appeared to him at once that in actual practice the proceeding was fraught with difficulties supposing for instance that they should suddenly hail a taxi in books you simply leapt into another promised the driver a sovereignor its modern equivalentand there you were in actual fact tommy foresaw that it was extremely likely there would be no second taxi therefore he would have to run what happened in actual fact to a young man who ran incessantly and persistently through the london streets in a main road he might hope to create the illusion that he was merely running for a bus but in these obscure aristocratic byways he could not but feel that an officious policeman might stop him to explain matters  at this juncture in his thoughts a taxi with flag erect turned the corner of the street ahead tommy held his breath would they hail it  he drew a sigh of relief as they allowed it to pass unchallenged their course was a zigzag one designed to bring them as quickly as possible to oxford street when at length they turned into it proceeding in an easterly direction tommy slightly increased his pace little by little he gained upon them on the crowded pavement there was little chance of his attracting their notice and he was anxious if possible to catch a word or two of their conversation in this he was completely foiled they spoke low and the din of the traffic drowned their voices effectually  just before the bond street tube station they crossed the road tommy unperceived faithfully at their heels and entered the big lyons there they went up to the first floor and sat at a small table in the window it was late and the place was thinning out tommy took a seat at the table next to them sitting directly behind whittington in case of recognition on the other hand he had a full view of the second man and studied him attentively he was fair with a weak unpleasant face and tommy put him down as being either a russian or a pole he was probably about fifty years of age his shoulders cringed a little as he talked and his eyes small and crafty shifted unceasingly  having already lunched heartily tommy contented himself with ordering a welsh rarebit and a cup of coffee whittington ordered a substantial lunch for himself and his companion then as the waitress withdrew he moved his chair a little closer to the table and began to talk earnestly in a low voice the other man joined in listen as he would tommy could only catch a word here and there but the gist of it seemed to be some directions or orders which the big man was impressing on his companion and with which the latter seemed from time to time to disagree whittington addressed the other as boris  tommy caught the word ireland several times also propaganda but of jane finn there was no mention suddenly in a lull in the clatter of the room he got one phrase entire whittington was speaking ah but you dont know flossie shes a marvel an archbishop would swear she was his own mother she gets the voice right every time and thats really the principal thing  tommy did not hear boriss reply but in response to it whittington said something that sounded like of courseonly in an emergency  then he lost the thread again but presently the phrases became distinct again whether because the other two had insensibly raised their voices or because tommys ears were getting more attuned he could not tell but two words certainly had a most stimulating effect upon the listener they were uttered by boris and they were mr brown  whittington seemed to remonstrate with him but he merely laughed  why not my friend it is a name most respectablemost common did he not choose it for that reason ah i should like to meet himmr brown  there was a steely ring in whittingtons voice as he replied  who knows you may have met him already  bah retorted the other that is childrens talka fable for the police do you know what i say to myself sometimes that he is a fable invented by the inner ring a bogy to frighten us with it might be so  and it might not  i wonder or is it indeed true that he is with us and amongst us unknown to all but a chosen few if so he keeps his secret well and the idea is a good one yes we never know we look at each otherone of us is mr brownwhich he commandsbut also he serves among usin the midst of us and no one knows which he is  with an effort the russian shook off the vagary of his fancy he looked at his watch  yes said whittington we might as well go  he called the waitress and asked for his bill tommy did likewise and a few moments later was following the two men down the stairs  outside whittington hailed a taxi and directed the driver to go to waterloo  taxis were plentiful here and before whittingtons had driven off another was drawing up to the curb in obedience to tommys peremptory hand  follow that other taxi directed the young man dont lose it  the elderly chauffeur showed no interest he merely grunted and jerked down his flag the drive was uneventful tommys taxi came to rest at the departure platform just after whittingtons tommy was behind him at the bookingoffice he took a firstclass single ticket to bournemouth tommy did the same as he emerged boris remarked glancing up at the clock you are early you have nearly half an hour  boriss words had aroused a new train of thought in tommys mind clearly whittington was making the journey alone while the other remained in london therefore he was left with a choice as to which he would follow obviously he could not follow both of them unlesslike boris he glanced up at the clock and then to the announcement board of the trains the bournemouth train left at 330 it was now ten past whittington and boris were walking up and down by the bookstall he gave one doubtful look at them then hurried into an adjacent telephone box he dared not waste time in trying to get hold of tuppence in all probability she was still in the neighbourhood of south audley mansions but there remained another ally he rang up the ritz and asked for julius hersheimmer there was a click and a buzz oh if only the young american was in his room there was another click and then hello in unmistakable accents came over the wire  that you hersheimmer beresford speaking im at waterloo ive followed whittington and another man here no time to explain whittingtons off to bournemouth by the 330 can you get there by then  the reply was reassuring  sure ill hustle  the telephone rang off tommy put back the receiver with a sigh of relief his opinion of juliuss power of hustling was high he felt instinctively that the american would arrive in time  whittington and boris were still where he had left them if boris remained to see his friend off all was well then tommy fingered his pocket thoughtfully in spite of the carte blanche assured to him he had not yet acquired the habit of going about with any considerable sum of money on him the taking of the firstclass ticket to bournemouth had left him with only a few shillings in his pocket it was to be hoped that julius would arrive better provided  in the meantime the minutes were creeping by 315 320 325 327 supposing julius did not get there in time 329 doors were banging tommy felt cold waves of despair pass over him then a hand fell on his shoulder  here i am son your british traffic beats description put me wise to the crooks right away  thats whittingtonthere getting in now that big dark man the other is the foreign chap hes talking to  im on to them which of the two is my bird  tommy had thought out this question  got any money with you  julius shook his head and tommys face fell  i guess i havent more than three or four hundred dollars with me at the moment explained the american  tommy gave a faint whoop of relief  oh lord you millionaires you dont talk the same language climb aboard the lugger heres your ticket whittingtons your man  me for whittington said julius darkly the train was just starting as he swung himself aboard so long tommy the train slid out of the station  tommy drew a deep breath the man boris was coming along the platform towards him tommy allowed him to pass and then took up the chase once more  from waterloo boris took the tube as far as piccadilly circus then he walked up shaftesbury avenue finally turning off into the maze of mean streets round soho tommy followed him at a judicious distance  they reached at length a small dilapidated square the houses there had a sinister air in the midst of their dirt and decay boris looked round and tommy drew back into the shelter of a friendly porch the place was almost deserted it was a culdesac and consequently no traffic passed that way the stealthy way the other had looked round stimulated tommys imagination from the shelter of the doorway he watched him go up the steps of a particularly evillooking house and rap sharply with a peculiar rhythm on the door it was opened promptly he said a word or two to the doorkeeper then passed inside the door was shut to again  it was at this juncture that tommy lost his head what he ought to have done what any sane man would have done was to remain patiently where he was and wait for his man to come out again what he did do was entirely foreign to the sober common sense which was as a rule his leading characteristic something as he expressed it seemed to snap in his brain without a moments pause for reflection he too went up the steps and reproduced as far as he was able the peculiar knock  the door swung open with the same promptness as before a villainousfaced man with closecropped hair stood in the doorway  well he grunted  it was at that moment that the full realization of his folly began to come home to tommy but he dared not hesitate he seized at the first words that came into his mind  mr brown he said  to his surprise the man stood aside  upstairs he said jerking his thumb over his shoulder second door on your left    chapter viii the adventures of tommy   taken aback though he was by the mans words tommy did not hesitate if audacity had successfully carried him so far it was to be hoped it would carry him yet farther he quietly passed into the house and mounted the ramshackle staircase everything in the house was filthy beyond words the grimy paper of a pattern now indistinguishable hung in loose festoons from the wall in every angle was a grey mass of cobweb  tommy proceeded leisurely by the time he reached the bend of the staircase he had heard the man below disappear into a back room clearly no suspicion attached to him as yet to come to the house and ask for mr brown appeared indeed to be a reasonable and natural proceeding  at the top of the stairs tommy halted to consider his next move in front of him ran a narrow passage with doors opening on either side of it from the one nearest him on the left came a low murmur of voices it was this room which he had been directed to enter but what held his glance fascinated was a small recess immediately on his right half concealed by a torn velvet curtain it was directly opposite the lefthanded door and owing to its angle it also commanded a good view of the upper part of the staircase as a hidingplace for one or at a pinch two men it was ideal being about two feet deep and three feet wide it attracted tommy mightily he thought things over in his usual slow and steady way deciding that the mention of mr brown was not a request for an individual but in all probability a password used by the gang his lucky use of it had gained him admission so far he had aroused no suspicion but he must decide quickly on his next step  suppose he were boldly to enter the room on the left of the passage would the mere fact of his having been admitted to the house be sufficient perhaps a further password would be required or at any rate some proof of identity the doorkeeper clearly did not know all the members of the gang by sight but it might be different upstairs on the whole it seemed to him that luck had served him very well so far but that there was such a thing as trusting it too far to enter that room was a colossal risk he could not hope to sustain his part indefinitely sooner or later he was almost bound to betray himself and then he would have thrown away a vital chance in mere foolhardiness  a repetition of the signal knock sounded on the door below and tommy his mind made up slipped quickly into the recess and cautiously drew the curtain farther across so that it shielded him completely from sight there were several rents and slits in the ancient material which afforded him a good view he would watch events and any time he chose could after all join the assembly modelling his behaviour on that of the new arrival  the man who came up the staircase with a furtive softfooted tread was quite unknown to tommy he was obviously of the very dregs of society the low beetling brows and the criminal jaw the bestiality of the whole countenance were new to the young man though he was a type that scotland yard would have recognized at a glance  the man passed the recess breathing heavily as he went he stopped at the door opposite and gave a repetition of the signal knock a voice inside called out something and the man opened the door and passed in affording tommy a momentary glimpse of the room inside he thought there must be about four or five people seated round a long table that took up most of the space but his attention was caught and held by a tall man with closecropped hair and a short pointed navallooking beard who sat at the head of the table with papers in front of him as the newcomer entered he glanced up and with a correct but curiously precise enunciation which attracted tommys notice he asked  your number comrade  fourteen govnor replied the other hoarsely  correct  the door shut again  if that isnt a hun im a dutchman said tommy to himself and running the show darned systematically tooas they always do lucky i didnt roll in id have given the wrong number and there would have been the deuce to pay no this is the place for me hullo heres another knock  this visitor proved to be of an entirely different type to the last tommy recognized in him an irish sinn feiner certainly mr browns organization was a farreaching concern the common criminal the wellbred irish gentleman the pale russian and the efficient german master of the ceremonies truly a strange and sinister gathering who was this man who held in his finger these curiously variegated links of an unknown chain  in this case the procedure was exactly the same the signal knock the demand for a number and the reply correct  two knocks followed in quick succession on the door below the first man was quite unknown to tommy who put him down as a city clerk a quiet intelligentlooking man rather shabbily dressed the second was of the working classes and his face was vaguely familiar to the young man  three minutes later came another a man of commanding appearance exquisitely dressed and evidently well born his face again was not unknown to the watcher though he could not for the moment put a name to it  after his arrival there was a long wait in fact tommy concluded that the gathering was now complete and was just cautiously creeping out from his hidingplace when another knock sent him scuttling back to cover  this lastcomer came up the stairs so quietly that he was almost abreast of tommy before the young man had realized his presence  he was a small man very pale with a gentle almost womanish air the angle of the cheekbones hinted at his slavonic ancestry otherwise there was nothing to indicate his nationality as he passed the recess he turned his head slowly the strange light eyes seemed to burn through the curtain tommy could hardly believe that the man did not know he was there and in spite of himself he shivered he was no more fanciful than the majority of young englishmen but he could not rid himself of the impression that some unusually potent force emanated from the man the creature reminded him of a venomous snake  a moment later his impression was proved correct the newcomer knocked on the door as all had done but his reception was very different the bearded man rose to his feet and all the others followed suit the german came forward and shook hands his heels clicked together  we are honoured he said we are greatly honoured i much feared that it would be impossible  the other answered in a low voice that had a kind of hiss in it  there were difficulties it will not be possible again i fear but one meeting is essentialto define my policy i can do nothing withoutmr brown he is here  the change in the germans voice was audible as he replied with slight hesitation  we have received a message it is impossible for him to be present in person he stopped giving a curious impression of having left the sentence unfinished  a very slow smile overspread the face of the other he looked round at a circle of uneasy faces  ah i understand i have read of his methods he works in the dark and trusts no one but all the same it is possible that he is among us now he looked round him again and again that expression of fear swept over the group each man seemed eyeing his neighbour doubtfully  the russian tapped his cheek  so be it let us proceed  the german seemed to pull himself together he indicated the place he had been occupying at the head of the table the russian demurred but the other insisted  it is the only possible place he said fornumber one perhaps number fourteen will shut the door  in another moment tommy was once more confronting bare wooden panels and the voices within had sunk once more to a mere undistinguishable murmur tommy became restive the conversation he had overheard had stimulated his curiosity he felt that by hook or by crook he must hear more  there was no sound from below and it did not seem likely that the doorkeeper would come upstairs after listening intently for a minute or two he put his head round the curtain the passage was deserted tommy bent down and removed his shoes then leaving them behind the curtain he walked gingerly out on his stockinged feet and kneeling down by the closed door he laid his ear cautiously to the crack to his intense annoyance he could distinguish little more just a chance word here and there if a voice was raised which merely served to whet his curiosity still farther  he eyed the handle of the door tentatively could he turn it by degrees so gently and imperceptibly that those in the room would notice nothing he decided that with great care it could be done very slowly a fraction of an inch at a time he moved it round holding his breath in his excessive care a little morea little more stillwould it never be finished ah at last it would turn no farther  he stayed so for a minute or two then drew a deep breath and pressed it ever so slightly inward the door did not budge tommy was annoyed if he had to use too much force it would almost certainly creak he waited until the voices rose a little then he tried again still nothing happened he increased the pressure had the beastly thing stuck finally in desperation he pushed with all his might but the door remained firm and at last the truth dawned upon him it was locked or bolted on the inside  for a moment or two tommys indignation got the better of him  well im damned he said what a dirty trick  as his indignation cooled he prepared to face the situation clearly the first thing to be done was to restore the handle to its original position if he let it go suddenly the men inside would be almost certain to notice it so with the same infinite pains he reversed his former tactics all went well and with a sigh of relief the young man rose to his feet there was a certain bulldog tenacity about tommy that made him slow to admit defeat checkmated for the moment he was far from abandoning the conflict he still intended to hear what was going on in the locked room as one plan had failed he must hunt about for another  he looked round him a little farther along the passage on the left was a second door he slipped silently along to it he listened for a moment or two then tried the handle it yielded and he slipped inside  the room which was untenanted was furnished as a bedroom like everything else in the house the furniture was falling to pieces and the dirt was if anything more abundant  but what interested tommy was the thing he had hoped to find a communicating door between the two rooms up on the left by the window carefully closing the door into the passage behind him he stepped across to the other and examined it closely the bolt was shot across it it was very rusty and had clearly not been used for some time by gently wriggling it to and fro tommy managed to draw it back without making too much noise then he repeated his former manoeuvres with the handlethis time with complete success the door swung opena crack a mere fraction but enough for tommy to hear what went on there was a velvet portiere on the inside of this door which prevented him from seeing but he was able to recognize the voices with a reasonable amount of accuracy  the sinn feiner was speaking his rich irish voice was unmistakable  thats all very well but more money is essential no moneyno results  another voice which tommy rather thought was that of boris replied  will you guarantee that there are results  in a month from nowsooner or later as you wishi will guarantee you such a reign of terror in ireland as shall shake the british empire to its foundations  there was a pause and then came the soft sibilant accents of number one  good you shall have the money boris you will see to that  boris asked a question  via the irish americans and mr potter as usual  i guess thatll be all right said a new voice with a transatlantic intonation though id like to point out here and now that things are getting a mite difficult theres not the sympathy there was and a growing disposition to let the irish settle their own affairs without interference from america  tommy felt that boris had shrugged his shoulders as he answered  does that matter since the money only nominally comes from the states  the chief difficulty is the landing of the ammunition said the sinn feiner the money is conveyed in easily enoughthanks to our colleague here  another voice which tommy fancied was that of the tall commandinglooking man whose face had seemed familiar to him said  think of the feelings of belfast if they could hear you  that is settled then said the sibilant tones now in the matter of the loan to an english newspaper you have arranged the details satisfactorily boris  i think so  that is good an official denial from moscow will be forthcoming if necessary  there was a pause and then the clear voice of the german broke the silence  i am directed bymr brown to place the summaries of the reports from the different unions before you that of the miners is most satisfactory we must hold back the railways there may be trouble with the ase  for a long time there was a silence broken only by the rustle of papers and an occasional word of explanation from the german then tommy heard the light taptap of fingers drumming on the table  andthe date my friend said number one  the 29th  the russian seemed to consider  that is rather soon  i know but it was settled by the principal labour leaders and we cannot seem to interfere too much they must believe it to be entirely their own show  the russian laughed softly as though amused  yes yes he said that is true they must have no inkling that we are using them for our own ends they are honest menand that is their value to us it is curiousbut you cannot make a revolution without honest men the instinct of the populace is infallible he paused and then repeated as though the phrase pleased him every revolution has had its honest men they are soon disposed of afterwards  there was a sinister note in his voice  the german resumed  clymes must go he is too farseeing number fourteen will see to that  there was a hoarse murmur  thats all right govnor and then after a moment or two suppose im nabbed  you will have the best legal talent to defend you replied the german quietly but in any case you will wear gloves fitted with the fingerprints of a notorious housebreaker you have little to fear  oh i aint afraid govnor all for the good of the cause the streets is going to run with blood so they say he spoke with a grim relish dreams of it sometimes i does and diamonds and pearls rolling about in the gutter for anyone to pick up  tommy heard a chair shifted then number one spoke  then all is arranged we are assured of success  ithink so but the german spoke with less than his usual confidence  number ones voice held suddenly a dangerous quality  what has gone wrong  nothing but  but what  the labour leaders without them as you say we can do nothing if they do not declare a general strike on the 29th  why should they not  as youve said theyre honest and in spite of everything weve done to discredit the government in their eyes im not sure that they havent got a sneaking faith and belief in it  but  i know they abuse it unceasingly but on the whole public opinion swings to the side of the government they will not go against it  again the russians fingers drummed on the table  to the point my friend i was given to understand that there was a certain document in existence which assured success  that is so if that document were placed before the leaders the result would be immediate they would publish it broadcast throughout england and declare for the revolution without a moments hesitation the government would be broken finally and completely  then what more do you want  the document itself said the german bluntly  ah it is not in your possession but you know where it is  no  does anyone know where it is  one personperhaps and we are not sure of that even  who is this person  a girl  tommy held his breath  a girl the russians voice rose contemptuously and you have not made her speak in russia we have ways of making a girl talk  this case is different said the german sullenly  howdifferent he paused a moment then went on where is the girl now  the girl  yes  she is  but tommy heard no more a crashing blow descended on his head and all was darkness    chapter ix tuppence enters domestic service  when tommy set forth on the trail of the two men it took all tuppences selfcommand to refrain from accompanying him however she contained herself as best she might consoled by the reflection that her reasoning had been justified by events the two men had undoubtedly come from the second floor flat and that one slender thread of the name rita had set the young adventurers once more upon the track of the abductors of jane finn  the question was what to do next tuppence hated letting the grass grow under her feet tommy was amply employed and debarred from joining him in the chase the girl felt at a loose end she retraced her steps to the entrance hall of the mansions it was now tenanted by a small liftboy who was polishing brass fittings and whistling the latest air with a good deal of vigour and a reasonable amount of accuracy  he glanced round at tuppences entry there was a certain amount of the gamin element in the girl at all events she invariably got on well with small boys a sympathetic bond seemed instantly to be formed she reflected that an ally in the enemys camp so to speak was not to be despised  well william she remarked cheerfully in the best approved hospitalearlymorning style getting a good shine up  the boy grinned responsively  albert miss he corrected  albert be it said tuppence she glanced mysteriously round the hall the effect was purposely a broad one in case albert should miss it she leaned towards the boy and dropped her voice i want a word with you albert  albert ceased operations on the fittings and opened his mouth slightly  look do you know what this is with a dramatic gesture she flung back the left side of her coat and exposed a small enamelled badge it was extremely unlikely that albert would have any knowledge of itindeed it would have been fatal for tuppences plans since the badge in question was the device of a local training corps originated by the archdeacon in the early days of the war its presence in tuppences coat was due to the fact that she had used it for pinning in some flowers a day or two before but tuppence had sharp eyes and had noted the corner of a threepenny detective novel protruding from alberts pocket and the immediate enlargement of his eyes told her that her tactics were good and that the fish would rise to the bait  american detective force she hissed  albert fell for it  lord he murmured ecstatically  tuppence nodded at him with the air of one who has established a thorough understanding  know who im after she inquired genially  albert still roundeyed demanded breathlessly  one of the flats  tuppence nodded and jerked a thumb up the stairs  no 20 calls herself vandemeyer vandemeyer ha ha  alberts hand stole to his pocket  a crook he queried eagerly  a crook i should say so ready rita they call her in the states  ready rita repeated albert deliriously oh aint it just like the pictures  it was tuppence was a great frequenter of the kinema  annie always said as how she was a bad lot continued the boy  whos annie inquired tuppence idly  ouseparlourmaid shes leaving today manys the time annies said to me mark my words albert i wouldnt wonder if the police was to come after her one of these days just like that but shes a stunner to look at aint she  shes some peach allowed tuppence carelessly finds it useful in her layout you bet has she been wearing any of the emeralds by the way  emeralds thems the green stones isnt they  tuppence nodded  thats what were after her for you know old man rysdale  albert shook his head  peter b rysdale the oil king  it seems sort of familiar to me  the sparklers belonged to him finest collection of emeralds in the world worth a million dollars  lumme came ecstatically from albert it sounds more like the pictures every minute  tuppence smiled gratified at the success of her efforts  we havent exactly proved it yet but were after her andshe produced a longdrawnout winki guess she wont get away with the goods this time  albert uttered another ejaculation indicative of delight  mind you sonny not a word of this said tuppence suddenly i guess i oughtnt to have put you wise but in the states we know a real smart lad when we see one  ill not breathe a word protested albert eagerly aint there anything i could do a bit of shadowing maybe or such like  tuppence affected to consider then shook her head  not at the moment but ill bear you in mind son whats this about the girl you say is leaving  annie regular turn up they ad as annie said servants is some one nowadays and to be treated accordingly and what with her passing the word round she wont find it so easy to get another  wont she said tuppence thoughtfully i wonder  an idea was dawning in her brain she thought a minute or two then tapped albert on the shoulder  see here son my brains got busy how would it be if you mentioned that youd got a young cousin or a friend of yours had that might suit the place you get me  im there said albert instantly you leave it to me miss and ill fix the whole thing up in two ticks  some lad commented tuppence with a nod of approval you might say that the young woman could come in right away you let me know and if its ok ill be round tomorrow at eleven oclock  where am i to let you know to  ritz replied tuppence laconically name of cowley  albert eyed her enviously  it must be a good job this tec business  it sure is drawled tuppence especially when old man rysdale backs the bill but dont fret son if this goes well you shall come in on the ground floor  with which promise she took leave of her new ally and walked briskly away from south audley mansions well pleased with her mornings work  but there was no time to be lost she went straight back to the ritz and wrote a few brief words to mr carter having dispatched this and tommy not having yet returnedwhich did not surprise hershe started off on a shopping expedition which with an interval for tea and assorted creamy cakes occupied her until well after six oclock and she returned to the hotel jaded but satisfied with her purchases starting with a cheap clothing store and passing through one or two secondhand establishments she had finished the day at a wellknown hairdressers now in the seclusion of her bedroom she unwrapped that final purchase five minutes later she smiled contentedly at her reflection in the glass with an actresss pencil she had slightly altered the line of her eyebrows and that taken in conjunction with the new luxuriant growth of fair hair above so changed her appearance that she felt confident that even if she came face to face with whittington he would not recognize her she would wear elevators in her shoes and the cap and apron would be an even more valuable disguise from hospital experience she knew only too well that a nurse out of uniform is frequently unrecognized by her patients  yes said tuppence aloud nodding at the pert reflection in the glass youll do she then resumed her normal appearance  dinner was a solitary meal tuppence was rather surprised at tommys nonreturn julius too was absentbut that to the girls mind was more easily explained his hustling activities were not confined to london and his abrupt appearances and disappearances were fully accepted by the young adventurers as part of the days work it was quite on the cards that julius p hersheimmer had left for constantinople at a moments notice if he fancied that a clue to his cousins disappearance was to be found there the energetic young man had succeeded in making the lives of several scotland yard men unbearable to them and the telephone girls at the admiralty had learned to know and dread the familiar hullo he had spent three hours in paris hustling the prefecture and had returned from there imbued with the idea possibly inspired by a weary french official that the true clue to the mystery was to be found in ireland  i dare say hes dashed off there now thought tuppence all very well but this is very dull for me here i am bursting with news and absolutely no one to tell it to tommy might have wired or something i wonder where he is anyway he cant have lost the trail as they say that reminds me and miss cowley broke off in her meditations and summoned a small boy  ten minutes later the lady was ensconced comfortably on her bed smoking cigarettes and deep in the perusal of garnaby williams the boy detective which with other threepenny works of lurid fiction she had sent out to purchase she felt and rightly that before the strain of attempting further intercourse with albert it would be as well to fortify herself with a good supply of local colour  the morning brought a note from mr carter  dear miss tuppence  you have made a splendid start and i congratulate you i feel though that i should like to point out to you once more the risks you are running especially if you pursue the course you indicate those people are absolutely desperate and incapable of either mercy or pity i feel that you probably underestimate the danger and therefore warn you again that i can promise you no protection you have given us valuable information and if you choose to withdraw now no one could blame you at any rate think the matter over well before you decide  if in spite of my warnings you make up your mind to go through with it you will find everything arranged you have lived for two years with miss dufferin the parsonage llanelly and mrs vandemeyer can apply to her for a reference  may i be permitted a word or two of advice stick as near to the truth as possibleit minimizes the danger of slips i suggest that you should represent yourself to be what you are a former vad who has chosen domestic service as a profession there are many such at the present time that explains away any incongruities of voice or manner which otherwise might awaken suspicion  whichever way you decide good luck to you  your sincere friend  mr carter   tuppences spirits rose mercurially mr carters warnings passed unheeded the young lady had far too much confidence in herself to pay any heed to them  with some reluctance she abandoned the interesting part she had sketched out for herself although she had no doubts of her own powers to sustain a role indefinitely she had too much common sense not to recognize the force of mr carters arguments  there was still no word or message from tommy but the morning post brought a somewhat dirty postcard with the words its ok scrawled upon it  at tenthirty tuppence surveyed with pride a slightly battered tin trunk containing her new possessions it was artistically corded it was with a slight blush that she rang the bell and ordered it to be placed in a taxi she drove to paddington and left the box in the cloak room she then repaired with a handbag to the fastnesses of the ladies waitingroom ten minutes later a metamorphosed tuppence walked demurely out of the station and entered a bus  it was a few minutes past eleven when tuppence again entered the hall of south audley mansions albert was on the lookout attending to his duties in a somewhat desultory fashion he did not immediately recognize tuppence when he did his admiration was unbounded  blest if id have known you that rigouts tophole  glad you like it albert replied tuppence modestly by the way am i your cousin or am i not  your voice too cried the delighted boy its as english as anything no i said as a friend of mine knew a young gal annie wasnt best pleased shes stopped on till todayto oblige she said but really its so as to put you against the place  nice girl said tuppence  albert suspected no irony  shes style about her and keeps her silver a treatbut my word aint she got a temper are you going up now miss step inside the lift no 20 did you say and he winked  tuppence quelled him with a stern glance and stepped inside  as she rang the bell of no 20 she was conscious of alberts eyes slowly descending beneath the level of the floor  a smart young woman opened the door  ive come about the place said tuppence  its a rotten place said the young woman without hesitation regular old catalways interfering accused me of tampering with her letters me the flap was half undone anyway theres never anything in the wastepaper basketshe burns everything shes a wrong un thats what she is swell clothes but no class cook knows something about herbut she wont tellscared to death of her and suspicious shes on to you in a minute if you as much as speak to a fellow i can tell you  but what more annie could tell tuppence was never destined to learn for at that moment a clear voice with a peculiarly steely ring to it called  annie  the smart young woman jumped as if she had been shot  yes maam  who are you talking to  its a young woman about the situation maam  show her in then at once  yes maam  tuppence was ushered into a room on the right of the long passage a woman was standing by the fireplace she was no longer in her first youth and the beauty she undeniably possessed was hardened and coarsened in her youth she must have been dazzling her pale gold hair owing a slight assistance to art was coiled low on her neck her eyes of a piercing electric blue seemed to possess a faculty of boring into the very soul of the person she was looking at her exquisite figure was enhanced by a wonderful gown of indigo charmeuse and yet despite her swaying grace and the almost ethereal beauty of her face you felt instinctively the presence of something hard and menacing a kind of metallic strength that found expression in the tones of her voice and in that gimletlike quality of her eyes  for the first time tuppence felt afraid she had not feared whittington but this woman was different as if fascinated she watched the long cruel line of the red curving mouth and again she felt that sensation of panic pass over her her usual selfconfidence deserted her vaguely she felt that deceiving this woman would be very different to deceiving whittington mr carters warning recurred to her mind here indeed she might expect no mercy  fighting down that instinct of panic which urged her to turn tail and run without further delay tuppence returned the ladys gaze firmly and respectfully  as though that first scrutiny had been satisfactory mrs vandemeyer motioned to a chair  you can sit down how did you hear i wanted a houseparlourmaid   through a friend who knows the lift boy here he thought the place might suit me  again that basilisk glance seemed to pierce her through  you speak like an educated girl  glibly enough tuppence ran through her imaginary career on the lines suggested by mr carter it seemed to her as she did so that the tension of mrs vandemeyers attitude relaxed  i see she remarked at length is there anyone i can write to for a reference  i lived last with a miss dufferin the parsonage llanelly i was with her two years  and then you thought you would get more money by coming to london i suppose well it doesnt matter to me i will give you l50l60whatever you want you can come in at once  yes maam today if you like my box is at paddington  go and fetch it in a taxi then its an easy place i am out a good deal by the way whats your name  prudence cooper maam  very well prudence go away and fetch your box i shall be out to lunch the cook will show you where everything is  thank you maam  tuppence withdrew the smart annie was not in evidence in the hall below a magnificent hall porter had relegated albert to the background tuppence did not even glance at him as she passed meekly out  the adventure had begun but she felt less elated than she had done earlier in the morning it crossed her mind that if the unknown jane finn had fallen into the hands of mrs vandemeyer it was likely to have gone hard with her    chapter x enter sir james peel edgerton  tuppence betrayed no awkwardness in her new duties the daughters of the archdeacon were well grounded in household tasks they were also experts in training a raw girl the inevitable result being that the raw girl once trained departed elsewhere where her newly acquired knowledge commanded a more substantial remuneration than the archdeacons meagre purse allowed  tuppence had therefore very little fear of proving inefficient mrs vandemeyers cook puzzled her she evidently went in deadly terror of her mistress the girl thought it probable that the other woman had some hold over her for the rest she cooked like a chef as tuppence had an opportunity of judging that evening mrs vandemeyer was expecting a guest to dinner and tuppence accordingly laid the beautifully polished table for two she was a little exercised in her own mind as to this visitor it was highly possible that it might prove to be whittington although she felt fairly confident that he would not recognize her yet she would have been better pleased had the guest proved to be a total stranger however there was nothing for it but to hope for the best  at a few minutes past eight the front door bell rang and tuppence went to answer it with some inward trepidation she was relieved to see that the visitor was the second of the two men whom tommy had taken upon himself to follow  he gave his name as count stepanov tuppence announced him and mrs vandemeyer rose from her seat on a low divan with a quick murmur of pleasure  it is delightful to see you boris ivanovitch she said  and you madame he bowed low over her hand  tuppence returned to the kitchen  count stepanov or some such she remarked and affecting a frank and unvarnished curiosity whos he  a russian gentleman i believe  come here much  once in a while what dyou want to know for  fancied he might be sweet on the missus thats all explained the girl adding with an appearance of sulkiness how you do take one up  im not quite easy in my mind about the souffle explained the other  you know something thought tuppence to herself but aloud she only said going to dish up now righto  whilst waiting at table tuppence listened closely to all that was said she remembered that this was one of the men tommy was shadowing when she had last seen him already although she would hardly admit it she was becoming uneasy about her partner where was he why had no word of any kind come from him she had arranged before leaving the ritz to have all letters or messages sent on at once by special messenger to a small stationers shop near at hand where albert was to call in frequently true it was only yesterday morning that she had parted from tommy and she told herself that any anxiety on his behalf would be absurd still it was strange that he had sent no word of any kind  but listen as she might the conversation presented no clue boris and mrs vandemeyer talked on purely indifferent subjects plays they had seen new dances and the latest society gossip after dinner they repaired to the small boudoir where mrs vandemeyer stretched on the divan looked more wickedly beautiful than ever tuppence brought in the coffee and liqueurs and unwillingly retired as she did so she heard boris say  new isnt she  she came in today the other was a fiend this girl seems all right she waits well  tuppence lingered a moment longer by the door which she had carefully neglected to close and heard him say  quite safe i suppose  really boris you are absurdly suspicious i believe shes the cousin of the hall porter or something of the kind and nobody even dreams that i have any connection with ourmutual friend mr brown  for heavens sake be careful rita that door isnt shut  well shut it then laughed the woman  tuppence removed herself speedily  she dared not absent herself longer from the back premises but she cleared away and washed up with a breathless speed acquired in hospital then she slipped quietly back to the boudoir door the cook more leisurely was still busy in the kitchen and if she missed the other would only suppose her to be turning down the beds  alas the conversation inside was being carried on in too low a tone to permit of her hearing anything of it she dared not reopen the door however gently mrs vandemeyer was sitting almost facing it and tuppence respected her mistresss lynxeyed powers of observation  nevertheless she felt she would give a good deal to overhear what was going on possibly if anything unforeseen had happened she might get news of tommy for some moments she reflected desperately then her face brightened she went quickly along the passage to mrs vandemeyers bedroom which had long french windows leading on to a balcony that ran the length of the flat slipping quickly through the window tuppence crept noiselessly along till she reached the boudoir window as she had thought it stood a little ajar and the voices within were plainly audible  tuppence listened attentively but there was no mention of anything that could be twisted to apply to tommy mrs vandemeyer and the russian seemed to be at variance over some matter and finally the latter exclaimed bitterly  with your persistent recklessness you will end by ruining us  bah laughed the woman notoriety of the right kind is the best way of disarming suspicion you will realize that one of these daysperhaps sooner than you think  in the meantime you are going about everywhere with peel edgerton not only is he perhaps the most celebrated kc in england but his special hobby is criminology it is madness  i know that his eloquence has saved untold men from the gallows said mrs vandemeyer calmly what of it i may need his assistance in that line myself some day if so how fortunate to have such a friend at courtor perhaps it would be more to the point to say in court  boris got up and began striding up and down he was very excited  you are a clever woman rita but you are also a fool be guided by me and give up peel edgerton  mrs vandemeyer shook her head gently  i think not  you refuse there was an ugly ring in the russians voice  i do  then by heaven snarled the russian we will see but mrs vandemeyer also rose to her feet her eyes flashing  you forget boris she said i am accountable to no one i take my orders only frommr brown  the other threw up his hands in despair  you are impossible he muttered impossible already it may be too late they say peel edgerton can smell a criminal how do we know what is at the bottom of his sudden interest in you perhaps even now his suspicions are aroused he guesses  mrs vandemeyer eyed him scornfully  reassure yourself my dear boris he suspects nothing with less than your usual chivalry you seem to forget that i am commonly accounted a beautiful woman i assure you that is all that interests peel edgerton  boris shook his head doubtfully  he has studied crime as no other man in this kingdom has studied it do you fancy that you can deceive him  mrs vandemeyers eyes narrowed  if he is all that you sayit would amuse me to try  good heavens rita  besides added mrs vandemeyer he is extremely rich i am not one who despises money the sinews of war you know boris  moneymoney that is always the danger with you rita i believe you would sell your soul for money i believe he paused then in a low sinister voice he said slowly sometimes i believe that you would sellus  mrs vandemeyer smiled and shrugged her shoulders  the price at any rate would have to be enormous she said lightly it would be beyond the power of anyone but a millionaire to pay  ah snarled the russian you see i was right  my dear boris can you not take a joke  was it a joke  of course  then all i can say is that your ideas of humour are peculiar my dear rita  mrs vandemeyer smiled  let us not quarrel boris touch the bell we will have some drinks  tuppence beat a hasty retreat she paused a moment to survey herself in mrs vandemeyers long glass and be sure that nothing was amiss with her appearance then she answered the bell demurely  the conversation that she had overheard although interesting in that it proved beyond doubt the complicity of both rita and boris threw very little light on the present preoccupations the name of jane finn had not even been mentioned  the following morning a few brief words with albert informed her that nothing was waiting for her at the stationers it seemed incredible that tommy if all was well with him should not send any word to her a cold hand seemed to close round her heart supposing she choked her fears down bravely it was no good worrying but she leapt at a chance offered her by mrs vandemeyer  what day do you usually go out prudence  fridays my usual day maam  mrs vandemeyer lifted her eyebrows  and today is friday but i suppose you hardly wish to go out today as you only came yesterday  i was thinking of asking you if i might maam  mrs vandemeyer looked at her a minute longer and then smiled  i wish count stepanov could hear you he made a suggestion about you last night her smile broadened catlike your request is verytypical i am satisfied you do not understand all thisbut you can go out today it makes no difference to me as i shall not be dining at home  thank you maam  tuppence felt a sensation of relief once she was out of the others presence once again she admitted to herself that she was afraid horribly afraid of the beautiful woman with the cruel eyes  in the midst of a final desultory polishing of her silver tuppence was disturbed by the ringing of the front door bell and went to answer it this time the visitor was neither whittington nor boris but a man of striking appearance  just a shade over average height he nevertheless conveyed the impression of a big man his face cleanshaven and exquisitely mobile was stamped with an expression of power and force far beyond the ordinary magnetism seemed to radiate from him  tuppence was undecided for the moment whether to put him down as an actor or a lawyer but her doubts were soon solved as he gave her his name sir james peel edgerton  she looked at him with renewed interest this then was the famous kc whose name was familiar all over england she had heard it said that he might one day be prime minister he was known to have refused office in the interests of his profession preferring to remain a simple member for a scotch constituency  tuppence went back to her pantry thoughtfully the great man had impressed her she understood boriss agitation peel edgerton would not be an easy man to deceive  in about a quarter of an hour the bell rang and tuppence repaired to the hall to show the visitor out he had given her a piercing glance before now as she handed him his hat and stick she was conscious of his eyes raking her through as she opened the door and stood aside to let him pass out he stopped in the doorway  not been doing this long eh  tuppence raised her eyes astonished she read in his glance kindliness and something else more difficult to fathom  he nodded as though she had answered  vad and hard up i suppose  did mrs vandemeyer tell you that asked tuppence suspiciously  no child the look of you told me good place here  very good thank you sir  ah but there are plenty of good places nowadays and a change does no harm sometimes  do you mean began tuppence  but sir james was already on the topmost stair he looked back with his kindly shrewd glance  just a hint he said thats all  tuppence went back to the pantry more thoughtful than ever    chapter xi julius tells a story  dressed appropriately tuppence duly sallied forth for her afternoon out albert was in temporary abeyance but tuppence went herself to the stationers to make quite sure that nothing had come for her satisfied on this point she made her way to the ritz on inquiry she learnt that tommy had not yet returned it was the answer she had expected but it was another nail in the coffin of her hopes she resolved to appeal to mr carter telling him when and where tommy had started on his quest and asking him to do something to trace him the prospect of his aid revived her mercurial spirits and she next inquired for julius hersheimmer the reply she got was to the effect that he had returned about half an hour ago but had gone out immediately  tuppences spirits revived still more it would be something to see julius perhaps he could devise some plan for finding out what had become of tommy she wrote her note to mr carter in juliuss sittingroom and was just addressing the envelope when the door burst open  what the hell began julius but checked himself abruptly i beg your pardon miss tuppence those fools down at the office would have it that beresford wasnt here any longerhadnt been here since wednesday is that so  tuppence nodded  you dont know where he is she asked faintly  i how should i know i havent had one darned word from him though i wired him yesterday morning  i expect your wires at the office unopened  but where is he  i dont know i hoped you might  i tell you i havent had one darned word from him since we parted at the depot on wednesday  what depot  waterloo your london and south western road  waterloo frowned tuppence  why yes didnt he tell you  i havent seen him either replied tuppence impatiently go on about waterloo what were you doing there  he gave me a call over the phone told me to get a move on and hustle said he was trailing two crooks  oh said tuppence her eyes opening i see go on  i hurried along right away beresford was there he pointed out the crooks the big one was mine the guy you bluffed tommy shoved a ticket into my hand and told me to get aboard the cars he was going to sleuth the other crook julius paused i thought for sure youd know all this  julius said tuppence firmly stop walking up and down it makes me giddy sit down in that armchair and tell me the whole story with as few fancy turns of speech as possible  mr hersheimmer obeyed  sure he said where shall i begin  where you left off at waterloo  well began julius i got into one of your dear oldfashioned firstclass british compartments the train was just off first thing i knew a guard came along and informed me mighty politely that i wasnt in a smokingcarriage i handed him out half a dollar and that settled that i did a bit of prospecting along the corridor to the next coach whittington was there right enough when i saw the skunk with his big sleek fat face and thought of poor little jane in his clutches i felt real mad that i hadnt got a gun with me id have tickled him up some  we got to bournemouth all right whittington took a cab and gave the name of an hotel i did likewise and we drove up within three minutes of each other he hired a room and i hired one too so far it was all plain sailing he hadnt the remotest notion that anyone was on to him well he just sat around in the hotel lounge reading the papers and so on till it was time for dinner he didnt hurry any over that either  i began to think that there was nothing doing that hed just come on the trip for his health but i remembered that he hadnt changed for dinner though it was by way of being a slapup hotel so it seemed likely enough that hed be going out on his real business afterwards  sure enough about nine oclock so he did took a car across the townmighty pretty place by the way i guess ill take jane there for a spell when i find herand then paid it off and struck out along those pinewoods on the top of the cliff i was there too you understand we walked maybe for half an hour theres a lot of villas all the way along but by degrees they seemed to get more and more thinned out and in the end we got to one that seemed the last of the bunch big house it was with a lot of piny grounds around it  it was a pretty black night and the carriage drive up to the house was dark as pitch i could hear him ahead though i couldnt see him i had to walk carefully in case he might get on to it that he was being followed i turned a curve and i was just in time to see him ring the bell and get admitted to the house i just stopped where i was it was beginning to rain and i was soon pretty near soaked through also it was almighty cold  whittington didnt come out again and by and by i got kind of restive and began to mouch around all the ground floor windows were shuttered tight but upstairs on the first floor it was a twostoried house i noticed a window with a light burning and the curtains not drawn  now just opposite to that window there was a tree growing it was about thirty foot away from the house maybe and i sort of got it into my head that if i climbed up that tree id very likely be able to see into that room of course i knew there was no reason why whittington should be in that room rather than in any otherless reason in fact for the betting would be on his being in one of the receptionrooms downstairs but i guess id got the hump from standing so long in the rain and anything seemed better than going on doing nothing so i started up  it wasnt so easy by a long chalk the rain had made the boughs mighty slippery and it was all i could do to keep a foothold but bit by bit i managed it until at last there i was level with the window  but then i was disappointed i was too far to the left i could only see sideways into the room a bit of curtain and a yard of wallpaper was all i could command well that wasnt any manner of good to me but just as i was going to give it up and climb down ignominiously some one inside moved and threw his shadow on my little bit of walland by gum it was whittington  after that my blood was up id just got to get a look into that room it was up to me to figure out how i noticed that there was a long branch running out from the tree in the right direction if i could only swarm about halfway along it the proposition would be solved but it was mighty uncertain whether it would bear my weight i decided id just got to risk that and i started very cautiously inch by inch i crawled along the bough creaked and swayed in a nasty fashion and it didnt do to think of the drop below but at last i got safely to where i wanted to be  the room was mediumsized furnished in a kind of bare hygienic way there was a table with a lamp on it in the middle of the room and sitting at that table facing towards me was whittington right enough he was talking to a woman dressed as a hospital nurse she was sitting with her back to me so i couldnt see her face although the blinds were up the window itself was shut so i couldnt catch a word of what they said whittington seemed to be doing all the talking and the nurse just listened now and then she nodded and sometimes shed shake her head as though she were answering questions he seemed very emphaticonce or twice he beat with his fist on the table the rain had stopped now and the sky was clearing in that sudden way it does  presently he seemed to get to the end of what he was saying he got up and so did she he looked towards the window and asked somethingi guess it was whether it was raining anyway she came right across and looked out just then the moon came out from behind the clouds i was scared the woman would catch sight of me for i was full in the moonlight i tried to move back a bit the jerk i gave was too much for that rotten old branch with an almighty crash down it came and julius p hersheimmer with it  oh julius breathed tuppence how exciting go on  well luckily for me i pitched down into a good soft bed of earthbut it put me out of action for the time sure enough the next thing i knew i was lying in bed with a hospital nurse not whittingtons one on one side of me and a little blackbearded man with gold glasses and medical man written all over him on the other he rubbed his hands together and raised his eyebrows as i stared at him ah he said so our young friend is coming round again capital capital  i did the usual stunt said whats happened and where am i but i knew the answer to the last well enough theres no moss growing on my brain i think thatll do for the present sister said the little man and the nurse left the room in a sort of brisk welltrained way but i caught her handing me out a look of deep curiosity as she passed through the door  that look of hers gave me an idea now then doc i said and tried to sit up in bed but my right foot gave me a nasty twinge as i did so a slight sprain explained the doctor nothing serious youll be about again in a couple of days  i noticed you walked lame interpolated tuppence  julius nodded and continued  how did it happen i asked again he replied dryly you fell with a considerable portion of one of my trees into one of my newly planted flowerbeds  i liked the man he seemed to have a sense of humour i felt sure that he at least was plumb straight sure doc i said im sorry about the tree and i guess the new bulbs will be on me but perhaps youd like to know what i was doing in your garden i think the facts do call for an explanation he replied well to begin with i wasnt after the spoons  he smiled my first theory but i soon altered my mind by the way you are an american are you not i told him my name and you i am dr hall and this as you doubtless know is my private nursing home  i didnt know but i wasnt going to put him wise i was just thankful for the information i liked the man and i felt he was straight but i wasnt going to give him the whole story for one thing he probably wouldnt have believed it  i made up my mind in a flash why doctor i said i guess i feel an almighty fool but i owe it to you to let you know that it wasnt the bill sikes business i was up to then i went on and mumbled out something about a girl i trotted out the stern guardian business and a nervous breakdown and finally explained that i had fancied i recognized her among the patients at the home hence my nocturnal adventures i guess it was just the kind of story he was expecting quite a romance he said genially when id finished now doc i went on will you be frank with me have you here now or have you had here at any time a young girl called jane finn he repeated the name thoughtfully jane finn he said no  i was chagrined and i guess i showed it you are sure quite sure mr hersheimmer it is an uncommon name and i should not have been likely to forget it  well that was flat it laid me out for a space id kind of hoped my search was at an end thats that i said at last now theres another matter when i was hugging that darned branch i thought i recognized an old friend of mine talking to one of your nurses i purposely didnt mention any name because of course whittington might be calling himself something quite different down here but the doctor answered at once mr whittington perhaps thats the fellow i replied whats he doing down here dont tell me his nerves are out of order  dr hall laughed no he came down to see one of my nurses nurse edith who is a niece of his why fancy that i exclaimed is he still here no he went back to town almost immediately what a pity i ejaculated but perhaps i could speak to his niecenurse edith did you say her name was  but the doctor shook his head im afraid that too is impossible nurse edith left with a patient tonight also i seem to be real unlucky i remarked have you mr whittingtons address in town i guess id like to look him up when i get back i dont know his address i can write to nurse edith for it if you like i thanked him dont say who it is wants it id like to give him a little surprise  that was about all i could do for the moment of course if the girl was really whittingtons niece she might be too cute to fall into the trap but it was worth trying next thing i did was to write out a wire to beresford saying where i was and that i was laid up with a sprained foot and telling him to come down if he wasnt busy i had to be guarded in what i said however i didnt hear from him and my foot soon got all right it was only ricked not really sprained so today i said goodbye to the little doctor chap asked him to send me word if he heard from nurse edith and came right away back to town say miss tuppence youre looking mighty pale  its tommy said tuppence what can have happened to him  buck up i guess hes all right really why shouldnt he be see here it was a foreignlooking guy he went off after maybe theyve gone abroadto poland or something like that  tuppence shook her head  he couldnt without passports and things besides ive seen that man boris something since he dined with mrs vandemeyer last night  mrs who  i forgot of course you dont know all that  im listening said julius and gave vent to his favourite expression put me wise  tuppence thereupon related the events of the last two days juliuss astonishment and admiration were unbounded  bully for you fancy you a menial it just tickles me to death then he added seriously but say now i dont like it miss tuppence i sure dont youre just as plucky as they make em but i wish youd keep right out of this these crooks were up against would as soon croak a girl as a man any day  do you think im afraid said tuppence indignantly valiantly repressing memories of the steely glitter in mrs vandemeyers eyes  i said before you were darned plucky but that doesnt alter facts  oh bother me said tuppence impatiently lets think about what can have happened to tommy ive written to mr carter about it she added and told him the gist of her letter  julius nodded gravely  i guess thats good as far as it goes but its for us to get busy and do something  what can we do asked tuppence her spirits rising  i guess wed better get on the track of boris you say hes been to your place is he likely to come again  he might i really dont know  i see well i guess id better buy a car a slapup one dress as a chauffeur and hang about outside then if boris comes you could make some kind of signal and id trail him hows that  splendid but he mightnt come for weeks  well have to chance that im glad you like the plan he rose  where are you going  to buy the car of course replied julius surprised what make do you like i guess youll do some riding in it before weve finished  oh said tuppence faintly i like rollsroyces but  sure agreed julius what you say goes ill get one  but you cant at once cried tuppence people wait ages sometimes  little julius doesnt affirmed mr hersheimmer dont you worry any ill be round in the car in half an hour  tuppence got up  youre awfully good julius but i cant help feeling that its rather a forlorn hope im really pinning my faith to mr carter  then i shouldnt  why  just an idea of mine  oh but he must do something theres no one else by the way i forgot to tell you of a queer thing that happened this morning  and she narrated her encounter with sir james peel edgerton julius was interested  what did the guy mean do you think he asked  i dont quite know said tuppence meditatively but i think that in an ambiguous legal without prejudishish lawyers way he was trying to warn me  why should he  i dont know confessed tuppence but he looked kind and simply awfully clever i wouldnt mind going to him and telling him everything  somewhat to her surprise julius negatived the idea sharply  see here he said we dont want any lawyers mixed up in this that guy couldnt help us any  well i believe he could reiterated tuppence obstinately  dont you think it so long ill be back in half an hour  thirtyfive minutes had elapsed when julius returned he took tuppence by the arm and walked her to the window  there she is  oh said tuppence with a note of reverence in her voice as she gazed down at the enormous car  shes some pacemaker i can tell you said julius complacently  how did you get it gasped tuppence  she was just being sent home to some bigwig  well  i went round to his house said julius i said that i reckoned a car like that was worth every penny of twenty thousand dollars then i told him that it was worth just about fifty thousand dollars to me if hed get out  well said tuppence intoxicated  well returned julius he got out thats all    chapter xii a friend in need  friday and saturday passed uneventfully tuppence had received a brief answer to her appeal from mr carter in it he pointed out that the young adventurers had undertaken the work at their own risk and had been fully warned of the dangers if anything had happened to tommy he regretted it deeply but he could do nothing  this was cold comfort somehow without tommy all the savour went out of the adventure and for the first time tuppence felt doubtful of success while they had been together she had never questioned it for a minute although she was accustomed to take the lead and to pride herself on her quickwittedness in reality she had relied upon tommy more than she realized at the time there was something so eminently sober and clearheaded about him his common sense and soundness of vision were so unvarying that without him tuppence felt much like a rudderless ship it was curious that julius who was undoubtedly much cleverer than tommy did not give her the same feeling of support she had accused tommy of being a pessimist and it is certain that he always saw the disadvantages and difficulties which she herself was optimistically given to overlooking but nevertheless she had really relied a good deal on his judgment he might be slow but he was very sure  it seemed to the girl that for the first time she realized the sinister character of the mission they had undertaken so lightheartedly it had begun like a page of romance now shorn of its glamour it seemed to be turning to grim reality tommythat was all that mattered many times in the day tuppence blinked the tears out of her eyes resolutely little fool she would apostrophize herself dont snivel of course youre fond of him youve known him all your life but theres no need to be sentimental about it  in the meantime nothing more was seen of boris he did not come to the flat and julius and the car waited in vain tuppence gave herself over to new meditations whilst admitting the truth of juliuss objections she had nevertheless not entirely relinquished the idea of appealing to sir james peel edgerton indeed she had gone so far as to look up his address in the red book had he meant to warn her that day if so why surely she was at least entitled to demand an explanation he had looked at her so kindly perhaps he might tell them something concerning mrs vandemeyer which might lead to a clue to tommys whereabouts  anyway tuppence decided with her usual shake of the shoulders it was worth trying and try it she would sunday was her afternoon out she would meet julius persuade him to her point of view and they would beard the lion in his den  when the day arrived julius needed a considerable amount of persuading but tuppence held firm it can do no harm was what she always came back to in the end julius gave in and they proceeded in the car to carlton house terrace  the door was opened by an irreproachable butler tuppence felt a little nervous after all perhaps it was colossal cheek on her part she had decided not to ask if sir james was at home but to adopt a more personal attitude  will you ask sir james if i can see him for a few minutes i have an important message for him  the butler retired returning a moment or two later  sir james will see you will you step this way  he ushered them into a room at the back of the house furnished as a library the collection of books was a magnificent one and tuppence noticed that all one wall was devoted to works on crime and criminology there were several deeppadded leather armchairs and an oldfashioned open hearth in the window was a big rolltop desk strewn with papers at which the master of the house was sitting  he rose as they entered  you have a message for me ahhe recognized tuppence with a smileits you is it brought a message from mrs vandemeyer i suppose  not exactly said tuppence in fact im afraid i only said that to be quite sure of getting in oh by the way this is mr hersheimmer sir james peel edgerton  pleased to meet you said the american shooting out a hand  wont you both sit down asked sir james he drew forward two chairs  sir james said tuppence plunging boldly i dare say you will think it is most awful cheek of me coming here like this because of course its nothing whatever to do with you and then youre a very important person and of course tommy and i are very unimportant she paused for breath  tommy queried sir james looking across at the american  no thats julius explained tuppence im rather nervous and that makes me tell it badly what i really want to know is what you meant by what you said to me the other day did you mean to warn me against mrs vandemeyer you did didnt you  my dear young lady as far as i recollect i only mentioned that there were equally good situations to be obtained elsewhere  yes i know but it was a hint wasnt it  well perhaps it was admitted sir james gravely  well i want to know more i want to know just why you gave me a hint  sir james smiled at her earnestness  suppose the lady brings a libel action against me for defamation of character  of course said tuppence i know lawyers are always dreadfully careful but cant we say without prejudice first and then say just what we want to  well said sir james still smiling without prejudice then if i had a young sister forced to earn her living i should not like to see her in mrs vandemeyers service i felt it incumbent on me just to give you a hint it is no place for a young and inexperienced girl that is all i can tell you  i see said tuppence thoughtfully thank you very much but im not really inexperienced you know i knew perfectly that she was a bad lot when i went thereas a matter of fact thats why i went she broke off seeing some bewilderment on the lawyers face and went on i think perhaps id better tell you the whole story sir james ive a sort of feeling that youd know in a minute if i didnt tell the truth and so you might as well know all about it from the beginning what do you think julius  as youre bent on it id go right ahead with the facts replied the american who had so far sat in silence  yes tell me all about it said sir james i want to know who tommy is  thus encouraged tuppence plunged into her tale and the lawyer listened with close attention  very interesting he said when she finished a great deal of what you tell me child is already known to me ive had certain theories of my own about this jane finn youve done extraordinarily well so far but its rather too bad ofwhat do you know him asmr carter to pitchfork you two young things into an affair of this kind by the way where did mr hersheimmer come in originally you didnt make that clear  julius answered for himself  im janes first cousin he explained returning the lawyers keen gaze  ah  oh sir james broke out tuppence what do you think has become of tommy  hm the lawyer rose and paced slowly up and down when you arrived young lady i was just packing up my traps going to scotland by the night train for a few days fishing but there are different kinds of fishing ive a good mind to stay and see if we cant get on the track of that young chap  oh tuppence clasped her hands ecstatically  all the same as i said before its too bad ofof carter to set you two babies on a job like this now dont get offended misser  cowley prudence cowley but my friends call me tuppence  well miss tuppence then as im certainly going to be a friend dont be offended because i think youre young youth is a failing only too easily outgrown now about this young tommy of yours  yes tuppence clasped her hands  frankly things look bad for him hes been butting in somewhere where he wasnt wanted not a doubt of it but dont give up hope  and you really will help us there julius he didnt want me to come she added by way of explanation  hm said the lawyer favouring julius with another keen glance and why was that  i reckoned it would be no good worrying you with a petty little business like this  i see he paused a moment this petty little business as you call it bears directly on a very big business bigger perhaps than either you or miss tuppence know if this boy is alive he may have very valuable information to give us therefore we must find him  yes but how cried tuppence ive tried to think of everything  sir james smiled  and yet theres one person quite near at hand who in all probability knows where he is or at all events where he is likely to be  who is that asked tuppence puzzled  mrs vandemeyer  yes but shed never tell us  ah that is where i come in i think it quite likely that i shall be able to make mrs vandemeyer tell me what i want to know  how demanded tuppence opening her eyes very wide  oh just by asking her questions replied sir james easily thats the way we do it you know  he tapped with his finger on the table and tuppence felt again the intense power that radiated from the man  and if she wont tell asked julius suddenly  i think she will i have one or two powerful levers still in that unlikely event there is always the possibility of bribery  sure and thats where i come in cried julius bringing his fist down on the table with a bang you can count on me if necessary for one million dollars yes sir one million dollars  sir james sat down and subjected julius to a long scrutiny  mr hersheimmer he said at last that is a very large sum  i guess itll have to be these arent the kind of folk to offer sixpence to  at the present rate of exchange it amounts to considerably over two hundred and fifty thousand pounds  thats so maybe you think im talking through my hat but i can deliver the goods all right with enough over to spare for your fee  sir james flushed slightly  there is no question of a fee mr hersheimmer i am not a private detective  sorry i guess i was just a mite hasty but ive been feeling bad about this money question i wanted to offer a big reward for news of jane some days ago but your crusted institution of scotland yard advised me against it said it was undesirable  they were probably right said sir james dryly  but its all ok about julius put in tuppence hes not pulling your leg hes got simply pots of money  the old man piled it up in style explained julius now lets get down to it whats your idea  sir james considered for a moment or two  there is no time to be lost the sooner we strike the better he turned to tuppence is mrs vandemeyer dining out tonight do you know  yes i think so but she will not be out late otherwise she would have taken the latchkey  good i will call upon her about ten oclock what time are you supposed to return  about ninethirty or ten but i could go back earlier  you must not do that on any account it might arouse suspicion if you did not stay out till the usual time be back by ninethirty i will arrive at ten mr hersheimmer will wait below in a taxi perhaps  hes got a new rollsroyce car said tuppence with vicarious pride  even better if i succeed in obtaining the address from her we can go there at once taking mrs vandemeyer with us if necessary you understand  yes tuppence rose to her feet with a skip of delight oh i feel so much better  dont build on it too much miss tuppence go easy  julius turned to the lawyer  say then ill call for you in the car round about ninethirty is that right  perhaps that will be the best plan it would be unnecessary to have two cars waiting about now miss tuppence my advice to you is to go and have a good dinner a really good one mind and dont think ahead more than you can help  he shook hands with them both and a moment later they were outside  isnt he a duck inquired tuppence ecstatically as she skipped down the steps oh julius isnt he just a duck  well i allow he seems to be the goods all right and i was wrong about its being useless to go to him say shall we go right away back to the ritz  i must walk a bit i think i feel so excited drop me in the park will you unless youd like to come too  i want to get some petrol he explained and send off a cable or two  all right ill meet you at the ritz at seven well have to dine upstairs i cant show myself in these glad rags  sure ill get felix help me choose the menu hes some head waiter that so long  tuppence walked briskly along towards the serpentine first glancing at her watch it was nearly six oclock she remembered that she had had no tea but felt too excited to be conscious of hunger she walked as far as kensington gardens and then slowly retraced her steps feeling infinitely better for the fresh air and exercise it was not so easy to follow sir jamess advice and put the possible events of the evening out of her head as she drew nearer and nearer to hyde park corner the temptation to return to south audley mansions was almost irresistible  at any rate she decided it would do no harm just to go and look at the building perhaps then she could resign herself to waiting patiently for ten oclock  south audley mansions looked exactly the same as usual what tuppence had expected she hardly knew but the sight of its red brick stolidity slightly assuaged the growing and entirely unreasonable uneasiness that possessed her she was just turning away when she heard a piercing whistle and the faithful albert came running from the building to join her  tuppence frowned it was no part of the programme to have attention called to her presence in the neighbourhood but albert was purple with suppressed excitement  i say miss shes agoing  whos going demanded tuppence sharply  the crook ready rita mrs vandemeyer shes apacking up and shes just sent down word for me to get her a taxi  what tuppence clutched his arm  its the truth miss i thought maybe as you didnt know about it  albert cried tuppence youre a brick if it hadnt been for you wed have lost her  albert flushed with pleasure at this tribute  theres no time to lose said tuppence crossing the road ive got to stop her at all costs i must keep her here until she broke off albert theres a telephone here isnt there  the boy shook his head  the flats mostly have their own miss but theres a box just round the corner  go to it then at once and ring up the ritz hotel ask for mr hersheimmer and when you get him tell him to get sir james and come on at once as mrs vandemeyer is trying to hook it if you cant get him ring up sir james peel edgerton youll find his number in the book and tell him whats happening you wont forget the names will you  albert repeated them glibly you trust to me miss itll be all right but what about you arent you afraid to trust yourself with her  no no thats all right but go and telephone be quick  drawing a long breath tuppence entered the mansions and ran up to the door of no 20 how she was to detain mrs vandemeyer until the two men arrived she did not know but somehow or other it had to be done and she must accomplish the task singlehanded what had occasioned this precipitate departure did mrs vandemeyer suspect her  speculations were idle tuppence pressed the bell firmly she might learn something from the cook  nothing happened and after waiting some minutes tuppence pressed the bell again keeping her finger on the button for some little while at last she heard footsteps inside and a moment later mrs vandemeyer herself opened the door she lifted her eyebrows at the sight of the girl  you  i had a touch of toothache maam said tuppence glibly so thought it better to come home and have a quiet evening  mrs vandemeyer said nothing but she drew back and let tuppence pass into the hall  how unfortunate for you she said coldly you had better go to bed  oh i shall be all right in the kitchen maam cook will  cook is out said mrs vandemeyer in a rather disagreeable tone i sent her out so you see you had better go to bed  suddenly tuppence felt afraid there was a ring in mrs vandemeyers voice that she did not like at all also the other woman was slowly edging her up the passage tuppence turned at bay  i dont want  then in a flash a rim of cold steel touched her temple and mrs vandemeyers voice rose cold and menacing  you damned little fool do you think i dont know no dont answer if you struggle or cry out ill shoot you like a dog  the rim of steel pressed a little harder against the girls temple  now then march went on mrs vandemeyer this wayinto my room in a minute when ive done with you youll go to bed as i told you to and youll sleepoh yes my little spy youll sleep all right  there was a sort of hideous geniality in the last words which tuppence did not at all like for the moment there was nothing to be done and she walked obediently into mrs vandemeyers bedroom the pistol never left her forehead the room was in a state of wild disorder clothes were flung about right and left a suitcase and a hat box halfpacked stood in the middle of the floor  tuppence pulled herself together with an effort her voice shook a little but she spoke out bravely  come now she said this is nonsense you cant shoot me why every one in the building would hear the report  id risk that said mrs vandemeyer cheerfully but as long as you dont sing out for help youre all rightand i dont think you will youre a clever girl you deceived me all right i hadnt a suspicion of you so ive no doubt that you understand perfectly well that this is where im on top and youre underneath now thensit on the bed put your hands above your head and if you value your life dont move them  tuppence obeyed passively her good sense told her that there was nothing else to do but accept the situation if she shrieked for help there was very little chance of anyone hearing her whereas there was probably quite a good chance of mrs vandemeyers shooting her in the meantime every minute of delay gained was valuable  mrs vandemeyer laid down the revolver on the edge of the washstand within reach of her hand and still eyeing tuppence like a lynx in case the girl should attempt to move she took a little stoppered bottle from its place on the marble and poured some of its contents into a glass which she filled up with water  whats that asked tuppence sharply  something to make you sleep soundly  tuppence paled a little  are you going to poison me she asked in a whisper  perhaps said mrs vandemeyer smiling agreeably  then i shant drink it said tuppence firmly id much rather be shot at any rate that would make a row and some one might hear it but i wont be killed off quietly like a lamb  mrs vandemeyer stamped her foot  dont be a little fool do you really think i want a hue and cry for murder out after me if youve any sense at all youll realize that poisoning you wouldnt suit my book at all its a sleeping draught thats all youll wake up tomorrow morning none the worse i simply dont want the bother of tying you up and gagging you thats the alternativeand you wont like it i can tell you i can be very rough if i choose so drink this down like a good girl and youll be none the worse for it  in her heart of hearts tuppence believed her the arguments she had adduced rang true it was a simple and effective method of getting her out of the way for the time being nevertheless the girl did not take kindly to the idea of being tamely put to sleep without as much as one bid for freedom she felt that once mrs vandemeyer gave them the slip the last hope of finding tommy would be gone  tuppence was quick in her mental processes all these reflections passed through her mind in a flash and she saw where a chance a very problematical chance lay and she determined to risk all in one supreme effort  accordingly she lurched suddenly off the bed and fell on her knees before mrs vandemeyer clutching her skirts frantically  i dont believe it she moaned its poisoni know its poison oh dont make me drink ither voice rose to a shriekdont make me drink it  mrs vandemeyer glass in hand looked down with a curling lip at this sudden collapse  get up you little idiot dont go on drivelling there how you ever had the nerve to play your part as you did i cant think she stamped her foot get up i say  but tuppence continued to cling and sob interjecting her sobs with incoherent appeals for mercy every minute gained was to the good moreover as she grovelled she moved imperceptibly nearer to her objective  mrs vandemeyer gave a sharp impatient exclamation and jerked the girl to her knees  drink it at once imperiously she pressed the glass to the girls lips  tuppence gave one last despairing moan  you swear it wont hurt me she temporized  of course it wont hurt you dont be a fool  will you swear it  yes yes said the other impatiently i swear it  tuppence raised a trembling left hand to the glass  very well her mouth opened meekly  mrs vandemeyer gave a sigh of relief off her guard for the moment then quick as a flash tuppence jerked the glass upward as hard as she could the fluid in it splashed into mrs vandemeyers face and during her momentary gasp tuppences right hand shot out and grasped the revolver where it lay on the edge of the washstand the next moment she had sprung back a pace and the revolver pointed straight at mrs vandemeyers heart with no unsteadiness in the hand that held it  in the moment of victory tuppence betrayed a somewhat unsportsmanlike triumph  now whos on top and whos underneath she crowed  the others face was convulsed with rage for a minute tuppence thought she was going to spring upon her which would have placed the girl in an unpleasant dilemma since she meant to draw the line at actually letting off the revolver however with an effort mrs vandemeyer controlled herself and at last a slow evil smile crept over her face  not a fool then after all you did that well girl but you shall pay for itoh yes you shall pay for it i have a long memory  im surprised you should have been gulfed so easily said tuppence scornfully did you really think i was the kind of girl to roll about on the floor and whine for mercy  you may dosome day said the other significantly  the cold malignity of her manner sent an unpleasant chill down tuppences spine but she was not going to give in to it  supposing we sit down she said pleasantly our present attitude is a little melodramatic nonot on the bed draw a chair up to the table thats right now ill sit opposite you with the revolver in front of mejust in case of accidents splendid now lets talk  what about said mrs vandemeyer sullenly  tuppence eyed her thoughtfully for a minute she was remembering several things boriss words i believe you would sellus and her answer the price would have to be enormous given lightly it was true yet might not there be a substratum of truth in it long ago had not whittington asked whos been blabbing rita would rita vandemeyer prove to be the weak spot in the armour of mr brown  keeping her eyes fixed steadily on the others face tuppence replied quietly  money  mrs vandemeyer started clearly the reply was unexpected  what do you mean  ill tell you you said just now that you had a long memory a long memory isnt half as useful as a long purse i dare say it relieves your feelings a good deal to plan out all sorts of dreadful things to do to me but is that practical revenge is very unsatisfactory every one always says so but moneytuppence warmed to her pet creedwell theres nothing unsatisfactory about money is there  do you think said mrs vandemeyer scornfully that i am the kind of woman to sell my friends  yes said tuppence promptly if the price was big enough  a paltry hundred pounds or so  no said tuppence i should suggesta hundred thousand  her economical spirit did not permit her to mention the whole million dollars suggested by julius  a flush crept over mrs vandemeyers face  what did you say she asked her fingers playing nervously with a brooch on her breast in that moment tuppence knew that the fish was hooked and for the first time she felt a horror of her own moneyloving spirit it gave her a dreadful sense of kinship to the woman fronting her  a hundred thousand pounds repeated tuppence  the light died out of mrs vandemeyers eyes she leaned back in her chair  bah she said you havent got it  no admitted tuppence i haventbut i know some one who has  who  a friend of mine  must be a millionaire remarked mrs vandemeyer unbelievingly  as a matter of fact he is hes an american hell pay you that without a murmur you can take it from me that its a perfectly genuine proposition  mrs vandemeyer sat up again  im inclined to believe you she said slowly  there was silence between them for some time then mrs vandemeyer looked up  what does he want to know this friend of yours  tuppence went through a momentary struggle but it was juliuss money and his interests must come first  he wants to know where jane finn is she said boldly  mrs vandemeyer showed no surprise  im not sure where she is at the present moment she replied  but you could find out  oh yes returned mrs vandemeyer carelessly there would be no difficulty about that  thentuppences voice shook a littletheres a boy a friend of mine im afraid somethings happened to him through your pal boris  whats his name  tommy beresford  never heard of him but ill ask boris hell tell me anything he knows  thank you tuppence felt a terrific rise in her spirits it impelled her to more audacious efforts theres one thing more  well  tuppence leaned forward and lowered her voice  who is mr brown  her quick eyes saw the sudden paling of the beautiful face with an effort mrs vandemeyer pulled herself together and tried to resume her former manner but the attempt was a mere parody  she shrugged her shoulders  you cant have learnt much about us if you dont know that nobody knows who mr brown is  you do said tuppence quietly  again the colour deserted the others face  what makes you think that  i dont know said the girl truthfully but im sure  mrs vandemeyer stared in front of her for a long time  yes she said hoarsely at last i know i was beautiful you seevery beautiful  you are still said tuppence with admiration  mrs vandemeyer shook her head there was a strange gleam in her electricblue eyes  not beautiful enough she said in a soft dangerous voice notbeautifulenough and sometimes lately ive been afraid its dangerous to know too much she leaned forward across the table swear that my name shant be brought into itthat no one shall ever know  i swear it and onces he caught youll be out of danger  a terrified look swept across mrs vandemeyers face  shall i shall i ever be she clutched tuppences arm youre sure about the money  quite sure  when shall i have it there must be no delay  this friend of mine will be here presently he may have to send cables or something like that but there wont be any delayhes a terrific hustler  a resolute look settled on mrs vandemeyers face  ill do it its a great sum of money and besidesshe gave a curious smileit is notwise to throw over a woman like me  for a moment or two she remained smiling and lightly tapping her fingers on the table suddenly she started and her face blanched  what was that  i heard nothing  mrs vandemeyer gazed round her fearfully  if there should be some one listening  nonsense who could there be  even the walls might have ears whispered the other i tell you im frightened you dont know him  think of the hundred thousand pounds said tuppence soothingly  mrs vandemeyer passed her tongue over her dried lips  you dont know him she reiterated hoarsely hesah  with a shriek of terror she sprang to her feet her outstretched hand pointed over tuppences head then she swayed to the ground in a dead faint  tuppence looked round to see what had startled her  in the doorway were sir james peel edgerton and julius hersheimmer    chapter xiii the vigil  sir james brushed past julius and hurriedly bent over the fallen woman  heart he said sharply seeing us so suddenly must have given her a shock brandyand quickly or shell slip through our fingers  julius hurried to the washstand  not there said tuppence over her shoulder in the tantalus in the diningroom second door down the passage  between them sir james and tuppence lifted mrs vandemeyer and carried her to the bed there they dashed water on her face but with no result the lawyer fingered her pulse  touch and go he muttered i wish that young fellow would hurry up with the brandy  at that moment julius reentered the room carrying a glass half full of the spirit which he handed to sir james while tuppence lifted her head the lawyer tried to force a little of the spirit between her closed lips finally the woman opened her eyes feebly tuppence held the glass to her lips  drink this  mrs vandemeyer complied the brandy brought the colour back to her white cheeks and revived her in a marvellous fashion she tried to sit upthen fell back with a groan her hand to her side  its my heart she whispered i mustnt talk  she lay back with closed eyes  sir james kept his finger on her wrist a minute longer then withdrew it with a nod  shell do now  all three moved away and stood together talking in low voices one and all were conscious of a certain feeling of anticlimax clearly any scheme for crossquestioning the lady was out of the question for the moment for the time being they were baffled and could do nothing  tuppence related how mrs vandemeyer had declared herself willing to disclose the identity of mr brown and how she had consented to discover and reveal to them the whereabouts of jane finn julius was congratulatory  thats all right miss tuppence splendid i guess that hundred thousand pounds will look just as good in the morning to the lady as it did over night theres nothing to worry over she wont speak without the cash anyway you bet  there was certainly a good deal of common sense in this and tuppence felt a little comforted  what you say is true said sir james meditatively i must confess however that i cannot help wishing we had not interrupted at the minute we did still it cannot be helped it is only a matter of waiting until the morning  he looked across at the inert figure on the bed mrs vandemeyer lay perfectly passive with closed eyes he shook his head  well said tuppence with an attempt at cheerfulness we must wait until the morning thats all but i dont think we ought to leave the flat  what about leaving that bright boy of yours on guard  albert and suppose she came round again and hooked it albert couldnt stop her  i guess she wont want to make tracks away from the dollars  she might she seemed very frightened of mr brown  what real plumb scared of him  yes she looked round and said even walls had ears  maybe she meant a dictaphone said julius with interest  miss tuppence is right said sir james quietly we must not leave the flatif only for mrs vandemeyers sake  julius stared at him  you think hed get after her between now and tomorrow morning how could he know even  you forget your own suggestion of a dictaphone said sir james dryly we have a very formidable adversary i believe if we exercise all due care that there is a very good chance of his being delivered into our hands but we must neglect no precaution we have an important witness but she must be safeguarded i would suggest that miss tuppence should go to bed and that you and i mr hersheimmer should share the vigil  tuppence was about to protest but happening to glance at the bed she saw mrs vandemeyer her eyes halfopen with such an expression of mingled fear and malevolence on her face that it quite froze the words on her lips  for a moment she wondered whether the faint and the heart attack had been a gigantic sham but remembering the deadly pallor she could hardly credit the supposition as she looked the expression disappeared as by magic and mrs vandemeyer lay inert and motionless as before for a moment the girl fancied she must have dreamt it but she determined nevertheless to be on the alert  well said julius i guess wed better make a move out of here any way  the others fell in with his suggestion sir james again felt mrs vandemeyers pulse  perfectly satisfactory he said in a low voice to tuppence shell be absolutely all right after a nights rest  the girl hesitated a moment by the bed the intensity of the expression she had surprised had impressed her powerfully mrs vandemeyer lifted her lids she seemed to be struggling to speak tuppence bent over her  dontleave she seemed unable to proceed murmuring something that sounded like sleepy then she tried again  tuppence bent lower still it was only a breath  mrbrown the voice stopped  but the halfclosed eyes seemed still to send an agonized message  moved by a sudden impulse the girl said quickly  i shant leave the flat i shall sit up all night  a flash of relief showed before the lids descended once more apparently mrs vandemeyer slept but her words had awakened a new uneasiness in tuppence what had she meant by that low murmur mr brown tuppence caught herself nervously looking over her shoulder the big wardrobe loomed up in a sinister fashion before her eyes plenty of room for a man to hide in that halfashamed of herself tuppence pulled it open and looked inside no oneof course she stooped down and looked under the bed there was no other possible hidingplace  tuppence gave her familiar shake of the shoulders it was absurd this giving way to nerves slowly she went out of the room julius and sir james were talking in a low voice sir james turned to her  lock the door on the outside please miss tuppence and take out the key there must be no chance of anyone entering that room  the gravity of his manner impressed them and tuppence felt less ashamed of her attack of nerves  say remarked julius suddenly theres tuppences bright boy i guess id better go down and ease his young mind thats some lad tuppence  how did you get in by the way asked tuppence suddenly i forgot to ask  well albert got me on the phone all right i ran round for sir james here and we came right on the boy was on the look out for us and was just a mite worried about what might have happened to you hed been listening outside the door of the flat but couldnt hear anything anyhow he suggested sending us up in the coal lift instead of ringing the bell and sure enough we landed in the scullery and came right along to find you alberts still below and must be just hopping mad by this time with which julius departed abruptly  now then miss tuppence said sir james you know this place better than i do where do you suggest we should take up our quarters  tuppence considered for a moment or two  i think mrs vandemeyers boudoir would be the most comfortable she said at last and led the way there  sir james looked round approvingly  this will do very well and now my dear young lady do go to bed and get some sleep  tuppence shook her head resolutely  i couldnt thank you sir james i should dream of mr brown all night  but youll be so tired child  no i shant id rather stay upreally  the lawyer gave in  julius reappeared some minutes later having reassured albert and rewarded him lavishly for his services having in his turn failed to persuade tuppence to go to bed he said decisively  at any rate youve got to have something to eat right away wheres the larder  tuppence directed him and he returned in a few minutes with a cold pie and three plates  after a hearty meal the girl felt inclined to poohpooh her fancies of half an hour before the power of the money bribe could not fail  and now miss tuppence said sir james we want to hear your adventures  thats so agreed julius  tuppence narrated her adventures with some complacence julius occasionally interjected an admiring bully sir james said nothing until she had finished when his quiet well done miss tuppence made her flush with pleasure  theres one thing i dont get clearly said julius what put her up to clearing out  i dont know confessed tuppence  sir james stroked his chin thoughtfully  the room was in great disorder that looks as though her flight was unpremeditated almost as though she got a sudden warning to go from some one  mr brown i suppose said julius scoffingly  the lawyer looked at him deliberately for a minute or two  why not he said remember you yourself have once been worsted by him  julius flushed with vexation  i feel just mad when i think of how i handed out janes photograph to him like a lamb gee if i ever lay hands on it again ill freeze on to it likelike hell  that contingency is likely to be a remote one said the other dryly  i guess youre right said julius frankly and in any case its the original im out after where do you think she can be sir james  the lawyer shook his head  impossible to say but ive a very good idea where she has been  you have where  sir james smiled  at the scene of your nocturnal adventures the bournemouth nursing home  there impossible i asked  no my dear sir you asked if anyone of the name of jane finn had been there now if the girl had been placed there it would almost certainly be under an assumed name  bully for you cried julius i never thought of that  it was fairly obvious said the other  perhaps the doctors in it too suggested tuppence  julius shook his head  i dont think so i took to him at once no im pretty sure dr halls all right  hall did you say asked sir james that is curiousreally very curious  why demanded tuppence  because i happened to meet him this morning ive known him slightly on and off for some years and this morning i ran across him in the street staying at the metropole he told me he turned to julius didnt he tell you he was coming up to town  julius shook his head  curious mused sir james you did not mention his name this afternoon or i would have suggested your going to him for further information with my card as introduction  i guess im a mutt said julius with unusual humility i ought to have thought of the false name stunt  how could you think of anything after falling out of that tree cried tuppence im sure anyone else would have been killed right off  well i guess it doesnt matter now anyway said julius weve got mrs vandemeyer on a string and thats all we need  yes said tuppence but there was a lack of assurance in her voice  a silence settled down over the party little by little the magic of the night began to gain a hold on them there were sudden creaks of the furniture imperceptible rustlings in the curtains suddenly tuppence sprang up with a cry  i cant help it i know mr browns somewhere in the flat i can feel him  sure tuppence how could he be this doors open into the hall no one could have come in by the front door without our seeing and hearing him  i cant help it i feel hes here  she looked appealingly at sir james who replied gravely  with due deference to your feelings miss tuppence and mine as well for that matter i do not see how it is humanly possible for anyone to be in the flat without our knowledge  the girl was a little comforted by his wards  sitting up at night is always rather jumpy she confessed  yes said sir james we are in the condition of people holding a seance perhaps if a medium were present we might get some marvellous results  do you believe in spiritualism asked tuppence opening her eyes wide  the lawyer shrugged his shoulders  there is some truth in it without a doubt but most of the testimony would not pass muster in the witnessbox  the hours drew on with the first faint glimmerings of dawn sir james drew aside the curtains they beheld what few londoners see the slow rising of the sun over the sleeping city somehow with the coming of the light the dreads and fancies of the past night seemed absurd tuppences spirits revived to the normal  hooray she said its going to be a gorgeous day and we shall find tommy and jane finn and everything will be lovely i shall ask mr carter if i cant be made a dame  at seven oclock tuppence volunteered to go and make some tea she returned with a tray containing the teapot and four cups  whos the other cup for inquired julius  the prisoner of course i suppose we might call her that  taking her tea seems a kind of anticlimax to last night said julius thoughtfully  yes it does admitted tuppence but anyway here goes perhaps youd both come too in case she springs on me or anything you see we dont know what mood shell wake up in  sir james and julius accompanied her to the door  wheres the key oh of course ive got it myself  she put it in the lock and turned it then paused  supposing after all shes escaped she murmured in a whisper  plumb impossible replied julius reassuringly  but sir james said nothing  tuppence drew a long breath and entered she heaved a sigh of relief as she saw that mrs vandemeyer was lying on the bed  good morning she remarked cheerfully ive brought you some tea  mrs vandemeyer did not reply tuppence put down the cup on the table by the bed and went across to draw up the blinds when she turned mrs vandemeyer still lay without a movement with a sudden fear clutching at her heart tuppence ran to the bed the hand she lifted was cold as ice mrs vandemeyer would never speak now  her cry brought the others a very few minutes sufficed mrs vandemeyer was deadmust have been dead some hours she had evidently died in her sleep  if that isnt the cruellest luck cried julius in despair  the lawyer was calmer but there was a curious gleam in his eyes  if it is luck he replied  you dont thinkbut say thats plumb impossibleno one could have got in  no admitted the lawyer i dont see how they could and yetshe is on the point of betraying mr brown andshe dies is it only chance  but how  yes how that is what we must find out he stood there silently gently stroking his chin we must find out he said quietly and tuppence felt that if she was mr brown she would not like the tone of those simple words  juliuss glance went to the window  the windows open he remarked do you think  tuppence shook her head  the balcony only goes along as far as the boudoir we were there  he might have slipped out suggested julius  but sir james interrupted him  mr browns methods are not so crude in the meantime we must send for a doctor but before we do so is there anything in this room that might be of value to us  hastily the three searched a charred mass in the grate indicated that mrs vandemeyer had been burning papers on the eve of her flight nothing of importance remained though they searched the other rooms as well  theres that said tuppence suddenly pointing to a small oldfashioned safe let into the wall its for jewellery i believe but there might be something else in it  the key was in the lock and julius swung open the door and searched inside he was some time over the task  well said tuppence impatiently  there was a pause before julius answered then he withdrew his head and shut to the door  nothing he said  in five minutes a brisk young doctor arrived hastily summoned he was deferential to sir james whom he recognized  heart failure or possibly an overdose of some sleepingdraught he sniffed rather an odour of chloral in the air  tuppence remembered the glass she had upset a new thought drove her to the washstand she found the little bottle from which mrs vandemeyer had poured a few drops  it had been three parts full nowit was empty    chapter xiv a consultation  nothing was more surprising and bewildering to tuppence than the ease and simplicity with which everything was arranged owing to sir jamess skilful handling the doctor accepted quite readily the theory that mrs vandemeyer had accidentally taken an overdose of chloral he doubted whether an inquest would be necessary if so he would let sir james know he understood that mrs vandemeyer was on the eve of departure for abroad and that the servants had already left sir james and his young friends had been paying a call upon her when she was suddenly stricken down and they had spent the night in the flat not liking to leave her alone did they know of any relatives they did not but sir james referred him to mrs vandemeyers solicitor  shortly afterwards a nurse arrived to take charge and the other left the illomened building  and what now asked julius with a gesture of despair i guess were down and out for good  sir james stroked his chin thoughtfully  no he said quietly there is still the chance that dr hall may be able to tell us something  gee id forgotten him  the chance is slight but it must not be neglected i think i told you that he is staying at the metropole i should suggest that we call upon him there as soon as possible shall we say after a bath and breakfast  it was arranged that tuppence and julius should return to the ritz and call for sir james in the car this programme was faithfully carried out and a little after eleven they drew up before the metropole they asked for dr hall and a pageboy went in search of him in a few minutes the little doctor came hurrying towards them  can you spare us a few minutes dr hall said sir james pleasantly let me introduce you to miss cowley mr hersheimmer i think you already know  a quizzical gleam came into the doctors eye as he shook hands with julius  ah yes my young friend of the tree episode ankle all right eh  i guess its cured owing to your skilful treatment doc  and the heart trouble ha ha  still searching said julius briefly  to come to the point can we have a word with you in private asked sir james  certainly i think there is a room here where we shall be quite undisturbed  he led the way and the others followed him they sat down and the doctor looked inquiringly at sir james  dr hall i am very anxious to find a certain young lady for the purpose of obtaining a statement from her i have reason to believe that she has been at one time or another in your establishment at bournemouth i hope i am transgressing no professional etiquette in questioning you on the subject  i suppose it is a matter of testimony  sir james hesitated a moment then he replied  yes  i shall be pleased to give you any information in my power what is the young ladys name mr hersheimmer asked me i remember he half turned to julius  the name said sir james bluntly is really immaterial she would be almost certainly sent to you under an assumed one but i should like to know if you are acquainted with a mrs vandemeyer  mrs vandemeyer of 20 south audley mansions i know her slightly  you are not aware of what has happened  what do you mean  you do not know that mrs vandemeyer is dead  dear dear i had no idea of it when did it happen  she took an overdose of chloral last night  purposely  accidentally it is believed i should not like to say myself anyway she was found dead this morning  very sad a singularly handsome woman i presume she was a friend of yours since you are acquainted with all these details  i am acquainted with the details becausewell it was i who found her dead  indeed said the doctor starting  yes said sir james and stroked his chin reflectively  this is very sad news but you will excuse me if i say that i do not see how it bears on the subject of your inquiry  it bears on it in this way is it not a fact that mrs vandemeyer committed a young relative of hers to your charge  julius leaned forward eagerly  that is the case said the doctor quietly  under the name of  janet vandemeyer i understood her to be a niece of mrs vandemeyers  and she came to you  as far as i can remember in june or july of 1915  was she a mental case  she is perfectly sane if that is what you mean i understood from mrs vandemeyer that the girl had been with her on the lusitania when that illfated ship was sunk and had suffered a severe shock in consequence  were on the right track i think sir james looked round  as i said before im a mutt returned julius  the doctor looked at them all curiously  you spoke of wanting a statement from her he said supposing she is not able to give one  what you have just said that she is perfectly sane  so she is nevertheless if you want a statement from her concerning any events prior to may 7 1915 she will not be able to give it to you  they looked at the little man stupefied he nodded cheerfully  its a pity he said a great pity especially as i gather sir james that the matter is important but there it is she can tell you nothing  but why man darn it all why  the little man shifted his benevolent glance to the excited young american  because janet vandemeyer is suffering from a complete loss of memory  what  quite so an interesting case a very interesting case not so uncommon really as you would think there are several very well known parallels its the first case of the kind that ive had under my own personal observation and i must admit that ive found it of absorbing interest there was something rather ghoulish in the little mans satisfaction  and she remembers nothing said sir james slowly  nothing prior to may 7 1915 after that date her memory is as good as yours or mine  then the first thing she remembers  is landing with the survivors everything before that is a blank she did not know her own name or where she had come from or where she was she couldnt even speak her own tongue  but surely all this is most unusual put in julius  no my dear sir quite normal under the circumstances severe shock to the nervous system loss of memory proceeds nearly always on the same lines i suggested a specialist of course theres a very good man in parismakes a study of these casesbut mrs vandemeyer opposed the idea of publicity that might result from such a course  i can imagine she would said sir james grimly  i fell in with her views there is a certain notoriety given to these cases and the girl was very youngnineteen i believe it seemed a pity that her infirmity should be talked aboutmight damage her prospects besides there is no special treatment to pursue in such cases it is really a matter of waiting  waiting  yes sooner or later the memory will returnas suddenly as it went but in all probability the girl will have entirely forgotten the intervening period and will take up life where she left offat the sinking of the lusitania  and when do you expect this to happen  the doctor shrugged his shoulders  ah that i cannot say sometimes it is a matter of months sometimes it has been known to be as long as twenty years sometimes another shock does the trick one restores what the other took away  another shock eh said julius thoughtfully  exactly there was a case in colorado the little mans voice trailed on voluble mildly enthusiastic  julius did not seem to be listening he had relapsed into his own thoughts and was frowning suddenly he came out of his brown study and hit the table such a resounding bang with his fist that every one jumped the doctor most of all  ive got it i guess doc id like your medical opinion on the plan im about to outline say jane was to cross the herring pond again and the same thing was to happen the submarine the sinking ship every one to take to the boatsand so on wouldnt that do the trick wouldnt it give a mighty big bump to her subconscious self or whatever the jargon is and start it functioning again right away  a very interesting speculation mr hersheimmer in my own opinion it would be successful it is unfortunate that there is no chance of the conditions repeating themselves as you suggest  not by nature perhaps doc but im talking about art  art  why yes whats the difficulty hire a liner  a liner murmured dr hall faintly  hire some passengers hire a submarinethats the only difficulty i guess governments are apt to be a bit hidebound over their engines of war they wont sell to the firstcomer still i guess that can be got over ever heard of the word graft sir well graft gets there every time i reckon that we shant really need to fire a torpedo if every one hustles round and screams loud enough that the ship is sinking it ought to be enough for an innocent young girl like jane by the time shes got a lifebelt on her and is being hustled into a boat with a welldrilled lot of artistes doing the hysterical stunt on deck whyshe ought to be right back where she was in may 1915 hows that for the bare outline  dr hall looked at julius everything that he was for the moment incapable of saying was eloquent in that look  no said julius in answer to it im not crazy the things perfectly possible its done every day in the states for the movies havent you seen trains in collision on the screen whats the difference between buying up a train and buying up a liner get the properties and you can go right ahead  dr hall found his voice  but the expense my dear sir his voice rose the expense it will be colossal  money doesnt worry me any explained julius simply  dr hall turned an appealing face to sir james who smiled slightly  mr hersheimmer is very well offvery well off indeed  the doctors glance came back to julius with a new and subtle quality in it this was no longer an eccentric young fellow with a habit of falling off trees the doctors eyes held the deference accorded to a really rich man  very remarkable plan very remarkable he murmured the moviesof course your american word for the kinema very interesting i fear we are perhaps a little behind the times over here in our methods and you really mean to carry out this remarkable plan of yours  you bet your bottom dollar i do  the doctor believed himwhich was a tribute to his nationality if an englishman had suggested such a thing he would have had grave doubts as to his sanity  i cannot guarantee a cure he pointed out perhaps i ought to make that quite clear  sure thats all right said julius you just trot out jane and leave the rest to me  jane  miss janet vandemeyer then can we get on the long distance to your place right away and ask them to send her up or shall i run down and fetch her in my car  the doctor stared  i beg your pardon mr hersheimmer i thought you understood  understood what  that miss vandemeyer is no longer under my care    chapter xv tuppence receives a proposal  julius sprang up  what  i thought you were aware of that  when did she leave  let me see today is monday is it not it must have been last wednesdaywhy surelyyes it was the same evening that youerfell out of my tree  that evening before or after  let me seeoh yes afterwards a very urgent message arrived from mrs vandemeyer the young lady and the nurse who was in charge of her left by the night train  julius sank back again into his chair  nurse edithleft with a patienti remember he muttered my god to have been so near  dr hall looked bewildered  i dont understand is the young lady not with her aunt after all  tuppence shook her head she was about to speak when a warning glance from sir james made her hold her tongue the lawyer rose  im much obliged to you hall were very grateful for all youve told us im afraid were now in the position of having to track miss vandemeyer anew what about the nurse who accompanied her i suppose you dont know where she is  the doctor shook his head  weve not heard from her as it happens i understood she was to remain with miss vandemeyer for a while but what can have happened surely the girl has not been kidnapped  that remains to be seen said sir james gravely  the other hesitated  you do not think i ought to go to the police  no no in all probability the young lady is with other relations  the doctor was not completely satisfied but he saw that sir james was determined to say no more and realized that to try and extract more information from the famous kc would be mere waste of labour accordingly he wished them goodbye and they left the hotel for a few minutes they stood by the car talking  how maddening cried tuppence to think that julius must have been actually under the same roof with her for a few hours  i was a darned idiot muttered julius gloomily  you couldnt know tuppence consoled him could he she appealed to sir james  i should advise you not to worry said the latter kindly no use crying over spilt milk you know  the great thing is what to do next added tuppence the practical  sir james shrugged his shoulders  you might advertise for the nurse who accompanied the girl that is the only course i can suggest and i must confess i do not hope for much result otherwise there is nothing to be done  nothing said tuppence blankly andtommy  we must hope for the best said sir james oh yes we must go on hoping  but over her downcast head his eyes met juliuss and almost imperceptibly he shook his head julius understood the lawyer considered the case hopeless the young americans face grew grave sir james took tuppences hand  you must let me know if anything further comes to light letters will always be forwarded  tuppence stared at him blankly  you are going away  i told you dont you remember to scotland  yes but i thought the girl hesitated  sir james shrugged his shoulders  my dear young lady i can do nothing more i fear our clues have all ended in thin air you can take my word for it that there is nothing more to be done if anything should arise i shall be glad to advise you in any way i can  his words gave tuppence an extraordinarily desolate feeling  i suppose youre right she said anyway thank you very much for trying to help us goodbye  julius was bending over the car a momentary pity came into sir jamess keen eyes as he gazed into the girls downcast face  dont be too disconsolate miss tuppence he said in a low voice remember holidaytime isnt always all playtime one sometimes manages to put in some work as well  something in his tone made tuppence glance up sharply he shook his head with a smile  no i shant say any more great mistake to say too much remember that never tell all you knownot even to the person you know best understand goodbye  he strode away tuppence stared after him she was beginning to understand sir jamess methods once before he had thrown her a hint in the same careless fashion was this a hint what exactly lay behind those last brief words did he mean that after all he had not abandoned the case that secretly he would be working on it still while  her meditations were interrupted by julius who adjured her to get right in  youre looking kind of thoughtful he remarked as they started off did the old guy say anything more  tuppence opened her mouth impulsively and then shut it again sir jamess words sounded in her ears never tell all you knownot even to the person you know best and like a flash there came into her mind another memory julius before the safe in the flat her own question and the pause before his reply nothing was there really nothing or had he found something he wished to keep to himself if he could make a reservation so could she  nothing particular she replied  she felt rather than saw julius throw a sideways glance at her  say shall we go for a spin in the park  if you like  for a while they ran on under the trees in silence it was a beautiful day the keen rush through the air brought a new exhilaration to tuppence  say miss tuppence do you think im ever going to find jane  julius spoke in a discouraged voice the mood was so alien to him that tuppence turned and stared at him in surprise he nodded  thats so im getting down and out over the business sir james today hadnt got any hope at all i could see that i dont like himwe dont gee together somehowbut hes pretty cute and i guess he wouldnt quit if there was any chance of successnow would he  tuppence felt rather uncomfortable but clinging to her belief that julius also had withheld something from her she remained firm  he suggested advertising for the nurse she reminded him  yes with a forlorn hope flavour to his voice noim about fed up ive half a mind to go back to the states right away  oh no cried tuppence weve got to find tommy  i sure forgot beresford said julius contritely thats so we must find him but afterwell ive been daydreaming ever since i started on this tripand these dreams are rotten poor business im quit of them say miss tuppence theres something id like to ask you  yes  you and beresford what about it  i dont understand you replied tuppence with dignity adding rather inconsequently and anyway youre wrong  not got a sort of kindly feeling for one another  certainly not said tuppence with warmth tommy and i are friendsnothing more  i guess every pair of lovers has said that sometime or another observed julius  nonsense snapped tuppence do i look the sort of girl thats always falling in love with every man she meets  you do not you look the sort of girl thats mighty often getting fallen in love with  oh said tuppence rather taken aback thats a compliment i suppose  sure now lets get down to this supposing we never find beresford andand  all rightsay it i can face facts supposing hesdead well  and all this business fiddles out what are you going to do  i dont know said tuppence forlornly  youll be darned lonesome you poor kid  i shall be all right snapped tuppence with her usual resentment of any kind of pity  what about marriage inquired julius got any views on the subject  i intend to marry of course replied tuppence that is ifshe paused knew a momentary longing to draw back and then stuck to her guns bravelyi can find some one rich enough to make it worth my while thats frank isnt it i dare say you despise me for it  i never despise business instinct said julius what particular figure have you in mind  figure asked tuppence puzzled do you mean tall or short  no sumincome  oh ii havent quite worked that out  what about me  you  sure thing  oh i couldnt  why not  i tell you i couldnt  again why not  it would seem so unfair  i dont see anything unfair about it i call your bluff thats all i admire you immensely miss tuppence more than any girl ive ever met youre so darned plucky id just love to give you a real rattling good time say the word and well run round right away to some highclass jeweller and fix up the ring business  i cant gasped tuppence  because of beresford  no no no  well then  tuppence merely continued to shake her head violently  you cant reasonably expect more dollars than ive got  oh it isnt that gasped tuppence with an almost hysterical laugh but thanking you very much and all that i think id better say no  id be obliged if youd do me the favour to think it over until tomorrow  its no use  still i guess well leave it like that  very well said tuppence meekly  neither of them spoke again until they reached the ritz  tuppence went upstairs to her room she felt morally battered to the ground after her conflict with juliuss vigorous personality sitting down in front of the glass she stared at her own reflection for some minutes  fool murmured tuppence at length making a grimace little fool everything you wanteverything youve ever hoped for and you go and bleat out no like an idiotic little sheep its your one chance why dont you take it grab it snatch at it what more do you want  as if in answer to her own question her eyes fell on a small snapshot of tommy that stood on her dressingtable in a shabby frame for a moment she struggled for selfcontrol and then abandoning all presence she held it to her lips and burst into a fit of sobbing  oh tommy tommy she cried i do love you soand i may never see you again  at the end of five minutes tuppence sat up blew her nose and pushed back her hair  thats that she observed sternly lets look facts in the face i seem to have fallen in lovewith an idiot of a boy who probably doesnt care two straws about me here she paused anyway she resumed as though arguing with an unseen opponent i dont know that he does hed never have dared to say so ive always jumped on sentimentand here i am being more sentimental than anybody what idiots girls are ive always thought so i suppose i shall sleep with his photograph under my pillow and dream about him all night its dreadful to feel youve been false to your principles  tuppence shook her head sadly as she reviewed her backsliding  i dont know what to say to julius im sure oh what a fool i feel ill have to say somethinghes so american and thorough hell insist upon having a reason i wonder if he did find anything in that safe  tuppences meditations went off on another tack she reviewed the events of last night carefully and persistently somehow they seemed bound up with sir jamess enigmatical words  suddenly she gave a great startthe colour faded out of her face her eyes fascinated gazed in front of her the pupils dilated  impossible she murmured impossible i must be going mad even to think of such a thing  monstrousyet it explained everything  after a moments reflection she sat down and wrote a note weighing each word as she did so finally she nodded her head as though satisfied and slipped it into an envelope which she addressed to julius she went down the passage to his sittingroom and knocked at the door as she had expected the room was empty she left the note on the table  a small pageboy was waiting outside her own door when she returned to it  telegram for you miss  tuppence took it from the salver and tore it open carelessly then she gave a cry the telegram was from tommy    chapter xvi further adventures of tommy  from a darkness punctuated with throbbing stabs of fire tommy dragged his senses slowly back to life when he at last opened his eyes he was conscious of nothing but an excruciating pain through his temples he was vaguely aware of unfamiliar surroundings where was he what had happened he blinked feebly this was not his bedroom at the ritz and what the devil was the matter with his head  damn said tommy and tried to sit up he had remembered he was in that sinister house in soho he uttered a groan and fell back through his almostclosed lids he reconnoitred carefully  he is coming to remarked a voice very near tommys ear he recognized it at once for that of the bearded and efficient german and lay artistically inert he felt that it would be a pity to come round too soon and until the pain in his head became a little less acute he felt quite incapable of collecting his wits painfully he tried to puzzle out what had happened obviously somebody must have crept up behind him as he listened and struck him down with a blow on the head they knew him now for a spy and would in all probability give him short shrift undoubtedly he was in a tight place nobody knew where he was therefore he need expect no outside assistance and must depend solely on his own wits  well here goes murmured tommy to himself and repeated his former remark  damn he observed and this time succeeded in sitting up  in a minute the german stepped forward and placed a glass to his lips with the brief command drink tommy obeyed the potency of the draught made him choke but it cleared his brain in a marvellous manner  he was lying on a couch in the room in which the meeting had been held on one side of him was the german on the other the villainousfaced doorkeeper who had let him in the others were grouped together at a little distance away but tommy missed one face the man known as number one was no longer of the company  feel better asked the german as he removed the empty glass  yes thanks returned tommy cheerfully  ah my young friend it is lucky for you your skull is so thick the good conrad struck hard he indicated the evilfaced doorkeeper by a nod the man grinned  tommy twisted his head round with an effort  oh he said so youre conrad are you it strikes me the thickness of my skull was lucky for you too when i look at you i feel its almost a pity ive enabled you to cheat the hangman  the man snarled and the bearded man said quietly  he would have run no risk of that  just as you like replied tommy i know its the fashion to run down the police i rather believe in them myself  his manner was nonchalant to the last degree tommy beresford was one of those young englishmen not distinguished by any special intellectual ability but who are emphatically at their best in what is known as a tight place their natural diffidence and caution fall from them like a glove tommy realized perfectly that in his own wits lay the only chance of escape and behind his casual manner he was racking his brains furiously  the cold accents of the german took up the conversation  have you anything to say before you are put to death as a spy  simply lots of things replied tommy with the same urbanity as before  do you deny that you were listening at that door  i do not i must really apologizebut your conversation was so interesting that it overcame my scruples  how did you get in  dear old conrad here tommy smiled deprecatingly at him i hesitate to suggest pensioning off a faithful servant but you really ought to have a better watchdog  conrad snarled impotently and said sullenly as the man with the beard swung round upon him  he gave the word how was i to know  yes tommy chimed in how was he to know dont blame the poor fellow his hasty action has given me the pleasure of seeing you all face to face  he fancied that his words caused some discomposure among the group but the watchful german stilled it with a wave of his hand  dead men tell no tales he said evenly  ah said tommy but im not dead yet  you soon will be my young friend said the german  an assenting murmur came from the others  tommys heart beat faster but his casual pleasantness did not waver  i think not he said firmly i should have a great objection to dying  he had got them puzzled he saw that by the look on his captors face  can you give us any reason why we should not put you to death asked the german  several replied tommy look here youve been asking me a lot of questions let me ask you one for a change why didnt you kill me off at once before i regained consciousness  the german hesitated and tommy seized his advantage  because you didnt know how much i knewand where i obtained that knowledge if you kill me now you never will know  but here the emotions of boris became too much for him he stepped forward waving his arms  you hellhound of a spy he screamed we will give you short shrift kill him kill him  there was a roar of applause  you hear said the german his eyes on tommy what have you to say to that  say tommy shrugged his shoulders pack of fools let them ask themselves a few questions how did i get into this place remember what dear old conrad saidwith your own password wasnt it how did i get hold of that you dont suppose i came up those steps haphazard and said the first thing that came into my head  tommy was pleased with the concluding words of this speech his only regret was that tuppence was not present to appreciate its full flavour  that is true said the working man suddenly comrades we have been betrayed  an ugly murmur arose tommy smiled at them encouragingly  thats better how can you hope to make a success of any job if you dont use your brains  you will tell us who has betrayed us said the german but that shall not save youoh no you shall tell us all that you know boris here knows pretty ways of making people speak  bah said tommy scornfully fighting down a singularly unpleasant feeling in the pit of his stomach you will neither torture me nor kill me  and why not asked boris  because youd kill the goose that lays the golden eggs replied tommy quietly  there was a momentary pause it seemed as though tommys persistent assurance was at last conquering they were no longer completely sure of themselves the man in the shabby clothes stared at tommy searchingly  hes bluffing you boris he said quietly  tommy hated him had the man seen through him  the german with an effort turned roughly to tommy  what do you mean  what do you think i mean parried tommy searching desperately in his own mind  suddenly boris stepped forward and shook his fist in tommys face  speak you swine of an englishmanspeak  dont get so excited my good fellow said tommy calmly thats the worst of you foreigners you cant keep calm now i ask you do i look as though i thought there were the least chance of your killing me  he looked confidently round and was glad they could not hear the persistent beating of his heart which gave the lie to his words  no admitted boris at last sullenly you do not  thank god hes not a mind reader thought tommy aloud he pursued his advantage  and why am i so confident because i know something that puts me in a position to propose a bargain  a bargain the bearded man took him up sharply  yesa bargain my life and liberty against he paused  against what  the group pressed forward you could have heard a pin drop  slowly tommy spoke  the papers that danvers brought over from america in the lusitania  the effect of his words was electrical every one was on his feet the german waved them back he leaned over tommy his face purple with excitement  himmel you have got them then  with magnificent calm tommy shook his head  you know where they are persisted the german  again tommy shook his head not in the least  thenthen angry and baffled the words failed him  tommy looked round he saw anger and bewilderment on every face but his calm assurance had done its workno one doubted but that something lay behind his words  i dont know where the papers arebut i believe that i can find them i have a theory  pah  tommy raised his hand and silenced the clamours of disgust  i call it a theorybut im pretty sure of my factsfacts that are known to no one but myself in any case what do you lose if i can produce the papersyou give me my life and liberty in exchange is it a bargain  and if we refuse said the german quietly  tommy lay back on the couch  the 29th he said thoughtfully is less than a fortnight ahead  for a moment the german hesitated then he made a sign to conrad  take him into the other room  for five minutes tommy sat on the bed in the dingy room next door his heart was beating violently he had risked all on this throw how would they decide and all the while that this agonized questioning went on within him he talked flippantly to conrad enraging the crossgrained doorkeeper to the point of homicidal mania  at last the door opened and the german called imperiously to conrad to return  lets hope the judge hasnt put his black cap on remarked tommy frivolously thats right conrad march me in the prisoner is at the bar gentlemen  the german was seated once more behind the table he motioned to tommy to sit down opposite to him  we accept he said harshly on terms the papers must be delivered to us before you go free  idiot said tommy amiably how do you think i can look for them if you keep me tied by the leg here  what do you expect then  i must have liberty to go about the business in my own way  the german laughed  do you think we are little children to let you walk out of here leaving us a pretty story full of promises  no said tommy thoughtfully though infinitely simpler for me i did not really think you would agree to that plan very well we must arrange a compromise how would it be if you attached little conrad here to my person hes a faithful fellow and very ready with the fist  we prefer said the german coldly that you should remain here one of our number will carry out your instructions minutely if the operations are complicated he will return to you with a report and you can instruct him further  youre tying my hands complained tommy its a very delicate affair and the other fellow will muff it up as likely as not and then where shall i be i dont believe one of you has got an ounce of tact  the german rapped the table  those are our terms otherwise death  tommy leaned back wearily  i like your style curt but attractive so be it then but one thing is essential i must see the girl  what girl  jane finn of course  the other looked at him curiously for some minutes then he said slowly and as though choosing his words with care  do you not know that she can tell you nothing  tommys heart beat a little faster would he succeed in coming face to face with the girl he was seeking  i shall not ask her to tell me anything he said quietly not in so many words that is  then why see her  tommy paused  to watch her face when i ask her one question he replied at last  again there was a look in the germans eyes that tommy did not quite understand  she will not be able to answer your question  that does not matter i shall have seen her face when i ask it  and you think that will tell you anything he gave a short disagreeable laugh more than ever tommy felt that there was a factor somewhere that he did not understand the german looked at him searchingly i wonder whether after all you know as much as we think he said softly  tommy felt his ascendancy less sure than a moment before his hold had slipped a little but he was puzzled what had he said wrong he spoke out on the impulse of the moment  there may be things that you know which i do not i have not pretended to be aware of all the details of your show but equally ive got something up my sleeve that you dont know about and thats where i mean to score danvers was a damned clever fellow he broke off as if he had said too much  but the germans face had lightened a little  danvers he murmured i see he paused a minute then waved to conrad take him away upstairsyou know  wait a minute said tommy what about the girl  that may perhaps be arranged  it must be  we will see about it only one person can decide that  who asked tommy but he knew the answer  mr brown  shall i see him  perhaps  come said conrad harshly  tommy rose obediently outside the door his gaoler motioned to him to mount the stairs he himself followed close behind on the floor above conrad opened a door and tommy passed into a small room conrad lit a hissing gas burner and went out tommy heard the sound of the key being turned in the lock  he set to work to examine his prison it was a smaller room than the one downstairs and there was something peculiarly airless about the atmosphere of it then he realized that there was no window he walked round it the walls were filthily dirty as everywhere else four pictures hung crookedly on the wall representing scenes from faust marguerite with her box of jewels the church scene siebel and his flowers and faust and mephistopheles the latter brought tommys mind back to mr brown again in this sealed and closed chamber with its closefitting heavy door he felt cut off from the world and the sinister power of the archcriminal seemed more real shout as he would no one could ever hear him the place was a living tomb  with an effort tommy pulled himself together he sank on to the bed and gave himself up to reflection his head ached badly also he was hungry the silence of the place was dispiriting  anyway said tommy trying to cheer himself i shall see the chiefthe mysterious mr brown and with a bit of luck in bluffing i shall see the mysterious jane finn also after that  after that tommy was forced to admit the prospect looked dreary    chapter xvii annette  the troubles of the future however soon faded before the troubles of the present and of these the most immediate and pressing was that of hunger tommy had a healthy and vigorous appetite the steak and chips partaken of for lunch seemed now to belong to another decade he regretfully recognized the fact that he would not make a success of a hunger strike  he prowled aimlessly about his prison once or twice he discarded dignity and pounded on the door but nobody answered the summons  hang it all said tommy indignantly they cant mean to starve me to death a newborn fear passed through his mind that this might perhaps be one of those pretty ways of making a prisoner speak which had been attributed to boris but on reflection he dismissed the idea  its that sour faced brute conrad he decided thats a fellow i shall enjoy getting even with one of these days this is just a bit of spite on his part im certain of it  further meditations induced in him the feeling that it would be extremely pleasant to bring something down with a whack on conrads eggshaped head tommy stroked his own head tenderly and gave himself up to the pleasures of imagination finally a bright idea flashed across his brain why not convert imagination into reality conrad was undoubtedly the tenant of the house the others with the possible exception of the bearded german merely used it as a rendezvous therefore why not wait in ambush for conrad behind the door and when he entered bring down a chair or one of the decrepit pictures smartly on to his head one would of course be careful not to hit too hard and thenand then simply walk out if he met anyone on the way down welltommy brightened at the thought of an encounter with his fists such an affair was infinitely more in his line than the verbal encounter of this afternoon intoxicated by his plan tommy gently unhooked the picture of the devil and faust and settled himself in position his hopes were high the plan seemed to him simple but excellent  time went on but conrad did not appear night and day were the same in this prison room but tommys wristwatch which enjoyed a certain degree of accuracy informed him that it was nine oclock in the evening tommy reflected gloomily that if supper did not arrive soon it would be a question of waiting for breakfast at ten oclock hope deserted him and he flung himself on the bed to seek consolation in sleep in five minutes his woes were forgotten  the sound of the key turning in the lock awoke him from his slumbers not belonging to the type of hero who is famous for awaking in full possession of his faculties tommy merely blinked at the ceiling and wondered vaguely where he was then he remembered and looked at his watch it was eight oclock  its either early morning tea or breakfast deduced the young man and pray god its the latter  the door swung open too late tommy remembered his scheme of obliterating the unprepossessing conrad a moment later he was glad that he had for it was not conrad who entered but a girl she carried a tray which she set down on the table  in the feeble light of the gas burner tommy blinked at her he decided at once that she was one of the most beautiful girls he had ever seen her hair was a full rich brown with sudden glints of gold in it as though there were imprisoned sunbeams struggling in its depths there was a wildrose quality about her face her eyes set wide apart were hazel a golden hazel that again recalled a memory of sunbeams  a delirious thought shot through tommys mind  are you jane finn he asked breathlessly  the girl shook her head wonderingly  my name is annette monsieur  she spoke in a soft broken english  oh said tommy rather taken aback francaise he hazarded  oui monsieur monsieur parle francais  not for any length of time said tommy whats that breakfast  the girl nodded tommy dropped off the bed and came and inspected the contents of the tray it consisted of a loaf some margarine and a jug of coffee  the living is not equal to the ritz he observed with a sigh but for what we are at last about to receive the lord has made me truly thankful amen  he drew up a chair and the girl turned away to the door  wait a sec cried tommy there are lots of things i want to ask you annette what are you doing in this house dont tell me youre conrads niece or daughter or anything because i cant believe it  i do the service monsieur i am not related to anybody  i see said tommy you know what i asked you just now have you ever heard that name  i have heard people speak of jane finn i think  you dont know where she is  annette shook her head  shes not in this house for instance  oh no monsieur i must go nowthey will be waiting for me  she hurried out the key turned in the lock  i wonder who they are mused tommy as he continued to make inroads on the loaf with a bit of luck that girl might help me to get out of here she doesnt look like one of the gang  at one oclock annette reappeared with another tray but this time conrad accompanied her  good morning said tommy amiably you have not used pears soap i see  conrad growled threateningly  no light repartee have you old bean there there we cant always have brains as well as beauty what have we for lunch stew how did i know elementary my dear watsonthe smell of onions is unmistakable  talk away grunted the man its little enough time youll have to talk in maybe  the remark was unpleasant in its suggestion but tommy ignored it he sat down at the table  retire varlet he said with a wave of his hand prate not to thy betters  that evening tommy sat on the bed and cogitated deeply would conrad again accompany the girl if he did not should he risk trying to make an ally of her he decided that he must leave no stone unturned his position was desperate  at eight oclock the familiar sound of the key turning made him spring to his feet the girl was alone  shut the door he commanded i want to speak to you she obeyed  look here annette i want you to help me get out of this she shook her head  impossible there are three of them on the floor below  oh tommy was secretly grateful for the information but you would help me if you could  no monsieur  why not  the girl hesitated  i thinkthey are my own people you have spied upon them they are quite right to keep you here  theyre a bad lot annette if youll help me ill take you away from the lot of them and youd probably get a good whack of money  but the girl merely shook her head  i dare not monsieur i am afraid of them  she turned away  wouldnt you do anything to help another girl cried tommy shes about your age too wont you save her from their clutches  you mean jane finn  yes  it is her you came here to look for yes  thats it  the girl looked at him then passed her hand across her forehead  jane finn always i hear that name it is familiar  tommy came forward eagerly  you must know something about her  but the girl turned away abruptly  i know nothingonly the name she walked towards the door suddenly she uttered a cry tommy stared she had caught sight of the picture he had laid against the wall the night before for a moment he caught a look of terror in her eyes as inexplicably it changed to relief then abruptly she went out of the room tommy could make nothing of it did she fancy that he had meant to attack her with it surely not he rehung the picture on the wall thoughtfully  three more days went by in dreary inaction tommy felt the strain telling on his nerves he saw no one but conrad and annette and the girl had become dumb she spoke only in monosyllables a kind of dark suspicion smouldered in her eyes tommy felt that if this solitary confinement went on much longer he would go mad he gathered from conrad that they were waiting for orders from mr brown perhaps thought tommy he was abroad or away and they were obliged to wait for his return  but the evening of the third day brought a rude awakening  it was barely seven oclock when he heard the tramp of footsteps outside in the passage in another minute the door was flung open conrad entered with him was the evillooking number 14 tommys heart sank at the sight of them  evenin govnor said the man with a leer got those ropes mate  the silent conrad produced a length of fine cord the next minute number 14s hands horribly dexterous were winding the cord round his limbs while conrad held him down  what the devil began tommy  but the slow speechless grin of the silent conrad froze the words on his lips  number 14 proceeded deftly with his task in another minute tommy was a mere helpless bundle then at last conrad spoke  thought youd bluffed us did you with what you knew and what you didnt know bargained with us and all the time it was bluff bluff you know less than a kitten but your numbers up now all right you bswine  tommy lay silent there was nothing to say he had failed somehow or other the omnipotent mr brown had seen through his pretensions suddenly a thought occurred to him  a very good speech conrad he said approvingly but wherefore the bonds and fetters why not let this kind gentleman here cut my throat without delay  garn said number 14 unexpectedly think were as green as to do you in here and have the police nosing round not alf weve ordered the carriage for your lordship tomorrow mornin but in the meantime were not taking any chances see  nothing said tommy could be plainer than your wordsunless it was your face  stow it said number 14  with pleasure replied tommy youre making a sad mistakebut yours will be the loss  you dont kid us that way again said number 14 talking as though you were still at the blooming ritz arent you  tommy made no reply he was engaged in wondering how mr brown had discovered his identity he decided that tuppence in the throes of anxiety had gone to the police and that his disappearance having been made public the gang had not been slow to put two and two together  the two men departed and the door slammed tommy was left to his meditations they were not pleasant ones already his limbs felt cramped and stiff he was utterly helpless and he could see no hope anywhere  about an hour had passed when he heard the key softly turned and the door opened it was annette tommys heart beat a little faster he had forgotten the girl was it possible that she had come to his help  suddenly he heard conrads voice  come out of it annette he doesnt want any supper tonight  oui oui je sais bien but i must take the other tray we need the things on it  well hurry up growled conrad  without looking at tommy the girl went over to the table and picked up the tray she raised a hand and turned out the light  curse youconrad had come to the doorwhy did you do that  i always turn it out you should have told me shall i relight it monsieur conrad  no come on out of it  le beau petit monsieur cried annette pausing by the bed in the darkness you have tied him up well hein he is like a trussed chicken the frank amusement in her tone jarred on the boy but at that moment to his amazement he felt her hand running lightly over his bonds and something small and cold was pressed into the palm of his hand  come on annette  mais me voila  the door shut tommy heard conrad say  lock it and give me the key  the footsteps died away tommy lay petrified with amazement the object annette had thrust into his hand was a small penknife the blade open from the way she had studiously avoided looking at him and her action with the light he came to the conclusion that the room was overlooked there must be a peephole somewhere in the walls remembering how guarded she had always been in her manner he saw that he had probably been under observation all the time had he said anything to give himself away hardly he had revealed a wish to escape and a desire to find jane finn but nothing that could have given a clue to his own identity true his question to annette had proved that he was personally unacquainted with jane finn but he had never pretended otherwise the question now was did annette really know more were her denials intended primarily for the listeners on that point he could come to no conclusion  but there was a more vital question that drove out all others could he bound as he was manage to cut his bonds he essayed cautiously to rub the open blade up and down on the cord that bound his two wrists together it was an awkward business and drew a smothered ow of pain from him as the knife cut into his wrist but slowly and doggedly he went on sawing to and fro he cut the flesh badly but at last he felt the cord slacken with his hands free the rest was easy five minutes later he stood upright with some difficulty owing to the cramp in his limbs his first care was to bind up his bleeding wrist then he sat on the edge of the bed to think conrad had taken the key of the door so he could expect little more assistance from annette the only outlet from the room was the door consequently he would perforce have to wait until the two men returned to fetch him but when they did tommy smiled moving with infinite caution in the dark room he found and unhooked the famous picture he felt an economical pleasure that his first plan would not be wasted there was now nothing to do but to wait he waited  the night passed slowly tommy lived through an eternity of hours but at last he heard footsteps he stood upright drew a deep breath and clutched the picture firmly  the door opened a faint light streamed in from outside conrad went straight towards the gas to light it tommy deeply regretted that it was he who had entered first it would have been pleasant to get even with conrad number 14 followed as he stepped across the threshold tommy brought the picture down with terrific force on his head number 14 went down amidst a stupendous crash of broken glass in a minute tommy had slipped out and pulled to the door the key was in the lock he turned it and withdrew it just as conrad hurled himself against the door from the inside with a volley of curses  for a moment tommy hesitated there was the sound of some one stirring on the floor below then the germans voice came up the stairs  gott im himmel conrad what is it  tommy felt a small hand thrust into his beside him stood annette she pointed up a rickety ladder that apparently led to some attics  quickup here she dragged him after her up the ladder in another moment they were standing in a dusty garret littered with lumber tommy looked round  this wont do its a regular trap theres no way out  hush wait the girl put her finger to her lips she crept to the top of the ladder and listened  the banging and beating on the door was terrific the german and another were trying to force the door in annette explained in a whisper  they will think you are still inside they cannot hear what conrad says the door is too thick  i thought you could hear what went on in the room  there is a peephole into the next room it was clever of you to guess but they will not think of thatthey are only anxious to get in  yesbut look here  leave it to me she bent down to his amazement tommy saw that she was fastening the end of a long piece of string to the handle of a big cracked jug she arranged it carefully then turned to tommy  have you the key of the door  yes  give it to me  he handed it to her  i am going down do you think you can go halfway and then swing yourself down behind the ladder so that they will not see you  tommy nodded  theres a big cupboard in the shadow of the landing stand behind it take the end of this string in your hand when ive let the others outpull  before he had time to ask her anything more she had flitted lightly down the ladder and was in the midst of the group with a loud cry  mon dieu mon dieu questce quil y a  the german turned on her with an oath  get out of this go to your room  very cautiously tommy swung himself down the back of the ladder so long as they did not turn round all was well he crouched behind the cupboard they were still between him and the stairs  ah annette appeared to stumble over something she stooped mon dieu voila la clef  the german snatched it from her he unlocked the door conrad stumbled out swearing  where is he have you got him  we have seen no one said the german sharply his face paled who do you mean  conrad gave vent to another oath  hes got away  impossible he would have passed us  at that moment with an ecstatic smile tommy pulled the string a crash of crockery came from the attic above in a trice the men were pushing each other up the rickety ladder and had disappeared into the darkness above  quick as a flash tommy leapt from his hidingplace and dashed down the stairs pulling the girl with him there was no one in the hall he fumbled over the bolts and chain at last they yielded the door swung open he turned annette had disappeared  tommy stood spellbound had she run upstairs again what madness possessed her he fumed with impatience but he stood his ground he would not go without her  and suddenly there was an outcry overhead an exclamation from the german and then annettes voice clear and high  ma foi he has escaped and quickly who would have thought it  tommy still stood rooted to the ground was that a command to him to go he fancied it was  and then louder still the words floated down to him  this is a terrible house i want to go back to marguerite to marguerite to marguerite  tommy had run back to the stairs she wanted him to go and leave her but why at all costs he must try and get her away with him then his heart sank conrad was leaping down the stairs uttering a savage cry at the sight of him after him came the others  tommy stopped conrads rush with a straight blow with his fist it caught the other on the point of the jaw and he fell like a log the second man tripped over his body and fell from higher up the staircase there was a flash and a bullet grazed tommys ear he realized that it would be good for his health to get out of this house as soon as possible as regards annette he could do nothing he had got even with conrad which was one satisfaction the blow had been a good one  he leapt for the door slamming it behind him the square was deserted in front of the house was a bakers van evidently he was to have been taken out of london in that and his body found many miles from the house in soho the driver jumped to the pavement and tried to bar tommys way again tommys fist shot out and the driver sprawled on the pavement  tommy took to his heels and rannone too soon the front door opened and a hail of bullets followed him fortunately none of them hit him he turned the corner of the square  theres one thing he thought to himself they cant go on shooting theyll have the police after them if they do i wonder they dared to there  he heard the footsteps of his pursuers behind him and redoubled his own pace once he got out of these byways he would be safe there would be a policeman about somewherenot that he really wanted to invoke the aid of the police if he could possibly do without it it meant explanations and general awkwardness in another moment he had reason to bless his luck he stumbled over a prostrate figure which started up with a yell of alarm and dashed off down the street tommy drew back into a doorway in a minute he had the pleasure of seeing his two pursuers of whom the german was one industriously tracking down the red herring  tommy sat down quietly on the doorstep and allowed a few moments to elapse while he recovered his breath then he strolled gently in the opposite direction he glanced at his watch it was a little after halfpast five it was rapidly growing light at the next corner he passed a policeman the policeman cast a suspicious eye on him tommy felt slightly offended then passing his hand over his face he laughed he had not shaved or washed for three days what a guy he must look  he betook himself without more ado to a turkish bath establishment which he knew to be open all night he emerged into the busy daylight feeling himself once more and able to make plans  first of all he must have a square meal he had eaten nothing since midday yesterday he turned into an abc shop and ordered eggs and bacon and coffee whilst he ate he read a morning paper propped up in front of him suddenly he stiffened there was a long article on kramenin who was described as the man behind bolshevism in russia and who had just arrived in londonsome thought as an unofficial envoy his career was sketched lightly and it was firmly asserted that he and not the figurehead leaders had been the author of the russian revolution  in the centre of the page was his portrait  so thats who number 1 is said tommy with his mouth full of eggs and bacon not a doubt about it i must push on  he paid for his breakfast and betook himself to whitehall there he sent up his name and the message that it was urgent a few minutes later he was in the presence of the man who did not here go by the name of mr carter there was a frown on his face  look here youve no business to come asking for me in this way i thought that was distinctly understood  it was sir but i judged it important to lose no time  and as briefly and succinctly as possible he detailed the experiences of the last few days  halfway through mr carter interrupted him to give a few cryptic orders through the telephone all traces of displeasure had now left his face he nodded energetically when tommy had finished  quite right every moments of value fear we shall be too late anyway they wouldnt wait would clear out at once still they may have left something behind them that will be a clue you say youve recognized number 1 to be kramenin thats important we want something against him badly to prevent the cabinet falling on his neck too freely what about the others you say two faces were familiar to you ones a labour man you think just look through these photos and see if you can spot him  a minute later tommy held one up mr carter exhibited some surprise  ah westway shouldnt have thought it poses as being moderate as for the other fellow i think i can give a good guess he handed another photograph to tommy and smiled at the others exclamation im right then who is he irishman prominent unionist mp all a blind of course weve suspected itbut couldnt get any proof yes youve done very well young man the 29th you say is the date that gives us very little timevery little time indeed  but tommy hesitated  mr carter read his thoughts  we can deal with the general strike menace i think its a tossupbut weve got a sporting chance but if that draft treaty turns upwere done england will be plunged in anarchy ah whats that the car come on beresford well go and have a look at this house of yours  two constables were on duty in front of the house in soho an inspector reported to mr carter in a low voice the latter turned to tommy  the birds have flownas we thought we might as well go over it  going over the deserted house seemed to tommy to partake of the character of a dream everything was just as it had been the prison room with the crooked pictures the broken jug in the attic the meeting room with its long table but nowhere was there a trace of papers everything of that kind had either been destroyed or taken away and there was no sign of annette  what you tell me about the girl puzzled me said mr carter you believe that she deliberately went back  it would seem so sir she ran upstairs while i was getting the door open  hm she must belong to the gang then but being a woman didnt feel like standing by to see a personable young man killed but evidently shes in with them or she wouldnt have gone back  i cant believe shes really one of them sir sheseemed so different  goodlooking i suppose said mr carter with a smile that made tommy flush to the roots of his hair he admitted annettes beauty rather shamefacedly  by the way observed mr carter have you shown yourself to miss tuppence yet shes been bombarding me with letters about you  tuppence i was afraid she might get a bit rattled did she go to the police  mr carter shook his head  then i wonder how they twigged me  mr carter looked inquiringly at him and tommy explained the other nodded thoughtfully  true thats rather a curious point unless the mention of the ritz was an accidental remark  it might have been sir but they must have found out about me suddenly in some way  well said mr carter looking round him theres nothing more to be done here what about some lunch with me  thanks awfully sir but i think id better get back and rout out tuppence  of course give her my kind regards and tell her not to believe youre killed too readily next time  tommy grinned  i take a lot of killing sir  so i perceive said mr carter dryly well goodbye remember youre a marked man now and take reasonable care of yourself  thank you sir  hailing a taxi briskly tommy stepped in and was swiftly borne to the ritz dwelling the while on the pleasurable anticipation of startling tuppence  wonder what shes been up to dogging rita most likely by the way i suppose thats who annette meant by marguerite i didnt get it at the time the thought saddened him a little for it seemed to prove that mrs vandemeyer and the girl were on intimate terms  the taxi drew up at the ritz tommy burst into its sacred portals eagerly but his enthusiasm received a check he was informed that miss cowley had gone out a quarter of an hour ago    chapter xviii the telegram  baffled for the moment tommy strolled into the restaurant and ordered a meal of surpassing excellence his four days imprisonment had taught him anew to value good food  he was in the middle of conveying a particularly choice morsel of sole a la jeanette to his mouth when he caught sight of julius entering the room tommy waved a menu cheerfully and succeeded in attracting the others attention at the sight of tommy juliuss eyes seemed as though they would pop out of his head he strode across and pumphandled tommys hand with what seemed to the latter quite unnecessary vigour  holy snakes he ejaculated is it really you  of course it is why shouldnt it be  why shouldnt it be say man dont you know youve been given up for dead i guess wed have had a solemn requiem for you in another few days  who thought i was dead demanded tommy  tuppence  she remembered the proverb about the good dying young i suppose there must be a certain amount of original sin in me to have survived where is tuppence by the way  isnt she here  no the fellows at the office said shed just gone out  gone shopping i guess i dropped her here in the car about an hour ago but say cant you shed that british calm of yours and get down to it what on gods earth have you been doing all this time  if youre feeding here replied tommy order now its going to be a long story  julius drew up a chair to the opposite side of the table summoned a hovering waiter and dictated his wishes then he turned to tommy  fire ahead i guess youve had some few adventures  one or two replied tommy modestly and plunged into his recital  julius listened spellbound half the dishes that were placed before him he forgot to eat at the end he heaved a long sigh  bully for you reads like a dime novel  and now for the home front said tommy stretching out his hand for a peach  weel drawled julius i dont mind admitting weve had some adventures too  he in his turn assumed the role of narrator beginning with his unsuccessful reconnoitring at bournemouth he passed on to his return to london the buying of the car the growing anxieties of tuppence the call upon sir james and the sensational occurrences of the previous night  but who killed her asked tommy i dont quite understand  the doctor kidded himself she took it herself replied julius dryly  and sir james what did he think  being a legal luminary he is likewise a human oyster replied julius i should say he reserved judgment he went on to detail the events of the morning  lost her memory eh said tommy with interest by jove that explains why they looked at me so queerly when i spoke of questioning her bit of a slip on my part that but it wasnt the sort of thing a fellow would be likely to guess  they didnt give you any sort of hint as to where jane was  tommy shook his head regretfully  not a word im a bit of an ass as you know i ought to have got more out of them somehow  i guess youre lucky to be here at all that bluff of yours was the goods all right how you ever came to think of it all so pat beats me to a frazzle  i was in such a funk i had to think of something said tommy simply  there was a moments pause and then tommy reverted to mrs vandemeyers death  theres no doubt it was chloral  i believe not at least they call it heart failure induced by an overdose or some such claptrap its all right we dont want to be worried with an inquest but i guess tuppence and i and even the highbrow sir james have all got the same idea  mr brown hazarded tommy  sure thing  tommy nodded  all the same he said thoughtfully mr brown hasnt got wings i dont see how he got in and out  how about some highclass thought transference stunt some magnetic influence that irresistibly impelled mrs vandemeyer to commit suicide  tommy looked at him with respect  good julius distinctly good especially the phraseology but it leaves me cold i yearn for a real mr brown of flesh and blood i think the gifted young detectives must get to work study the entrances and exits and tap the bumps on their foreheads until the solution of the mystery dawns on them lets go round to the scene of the crime i wish we could get hold of tuppence the ritz would enjoy the spectacle of the glad reunion  inquiry at the office revealed the fact that tuppence had not yet returned  all the same i guess ill have a look round upstairs said julius she might be in my sittingroom he disappeared  suddenly a diminutive boy spoke at tommys elbow  the young ladyshes gone away by train i think sir he murmured shyly  what tommy wheeled round upon him  the small boy became pinker than before  the taxi sir i heard her tell the driver charing cross and to look sharp  tommy stared at him his eyes opening wide in surprise emboldened the small boy proceeded so i thought having asked for an abc and a bradshaw  tommy interrupted him  when did she ask for an abc and a bradshaw  when i took her the telegram sir  a telegram  yes sir  when was that  about halfpast twelve sir  tell me exactly what happened  the small boy drew a long breath  i took up a telegram to no 891the lady was there she opened it and gave a gasp and then she said very jolly like bring me up a bradshaw and an abc and look sharp henry my name isnt henry but  never mind your name said tommy impatiently go on  yes sir i brought them and she told me to wait and looked up something and then she looks up at the clock and hurry up she says tell them to get me a taxi and she begins ashoving on of her hat in front of the glass and she was down in two ticks almost as quick as i was and i seed her going down the steps and into the taxi and i heard her call out what i told you  the small boy stopped and replenished his lungs tommy continued to stare at him at that moment julius rejoined him he held an open letter in his hand  i say hersheimmertommy turned to himtuppence has gone off sleuthing on her own  shucks  yes she has she went off in a taxi to charing cross in the deuce of a hurry after getting a telegram his eye fell on the letter in juliuss hand oh she left a note for you thats all right wheres she off to  almost unconsciously he held out his hand for the letter but julius folded it up and placed it in his pocket he seemed a trifle embarrassed  i guess this is nothing to do with it its about something elsesomething i asked her that she was to let me know about  oh tommy looked puzzled and seemed waiting for more  see here said julius suddenly id better put you wise i asked miss tuppence to marry me this morning  oh said tommy mechanically he felt dazed juliuss words were totally unexpected for the moment they benumbed his brain  id like to tell you continued julius that before i suggested anything of the kind to miss tuppence i made it clear that i didnt want to butt in in any way between her and you  tommy roused himself  thats all right he said quickly tuppence and i have been pals for years nothing more he lit a cigarette with a hand that shook ever so little thats quite all right tuppence always said that she was looking out for  he stopped abruptly his face crimsoning but julius was in no way discomposed  oh i guess itll be the dollars thatll do the trick miss tuppence put me wise to that right away theres no humbug about her we ought to gee along together very well  tommy looked at him curiously for a minute as though he were about to speak then changed his mind and said nothing tuppence and julius well why not had she not lamented the fact that she knew no rich men had she not openly avowed her intention of marrying for money if she ever had the chance her meeting with the young american millionaire had given her the chanceand it was unlikely she would be slow to avail herself of it she was out for money she had always said so why blame her because she had been true to her creed  nevertheless tommy did blame her he was filled with a passionate and utterly illogical resentment it was all very well to say things like thatbut a real girl would never marry for money tuppence was utterly coldblooded and selfish and he would be delighted if he never saw her again and it was a rotten world  juliuss voice broke in on these meditations  yes we ought to get along together very well ive heard that a girl always refuses you oncea sort of convention  tommy caught his arm  refuses did you say refuses  sure thing didnt i tell you that she just rapped out a no without any kind of reason to it the eternal feminine the huns call it ive heard but shell come round right enough likely enough i hustled her some  but tommy interrupted regardless of decorum  what did she say in that note he demanded fiercely  the obliging julius handed it to him  theres no earthly clue in it as to where shes gone he assured tommy but you might as well see for yourself if you dont believe me  the note in tuppences wellknown schoolboy writing ran as follows   dear julius  its always better to have things in black and white i dont feel i can be bothered to think of marriage until tommy is found lets leave it till then  yours affectionately  tuppence   tommy handed it back his eyes shining his feelings had undergone a sharp reaction he now felt that tuppence was all that was noble and disinterested had she not refused julius without hesitation true the note betokened signs of weakening but he could excuse that it read almost like a bribe to julius to spur him on in his efforts to find tommy but he supposed she had not really meant it that way darling tuppence there was not a girl in the world to touch her when he saw herhis thoughts were brought up with a sudden jerk  as you say he remarked pulling himself together theres not a hint here as to what shes up to hihenry  the small boy came obediently tommy produced five shillings  one thing more do you remember what the young lady did with the telegram  henry gasped and spoke  she crumpled it up into a ball and threw it into the grate and made a sort of noise like whoop sir  very graphic henry said tommy heres your five shillings come on julius we must find that telegram  they hurried upstairs tuppence had left the key in her door the room was as she had left it in the fireplace was a crumpled ball of orange and white tommy disentangled it and smoothed out the telegram  come at once moat house ebury yorkshire great developmentstommy  they looked at each other in stupefaction julius spoke first  you didnt send it  of course not what does it mean  i guess it means the worst said julius quietly theyve got her  what  sure thing they signed your name and she fell into the trap like a lamb  my god what shall we do  get busy and go after her right now theres no time to waste its almighty luck that she didnt take the wire with her if she had wed probably never have traced her but weve got to hustle wheres that bradshaw  the energy of julius was infectious left to himself tommy would probably have sat down to think things out for a good halfhour before he decided on a plan of action but with julius hersheimmer about hustling was inevitable  after a few muttered imprecations he handed the bradshaw to tommy as being more conversant with its mysteries tommy abandoned it in favour of an abc  here we are ebury yorks from kings cross or st pancras boy must have made a mistake it was kings cross not charing cross 1250 thats the train she went by 210 thats gone 320 is the nextand a damned slow train too  what about the car  tommy shook his head  send it up if you like but wed better stick to the train the great thing is to keep calm  julius groaned  thats so but it gets my goat to think of that innocent young girl in danger  tommy nodded abstractedly he was thinking in a moment or two he said  i say julius what do they want her for anyway  eh i dont get you  what i mean is that i dont think its their game to do her any harm explained tommy puckering his brow with the strain of his mental processes shes a hostage thats what she is shes in no immediate danger because if we tumble on to anything shed be damned useful to them as long as theyve got her theyve got the whip hand of us see  sure thing said julius thoughtfully thats so  besides added tommy as an afterthought ive great faith in tuppence  the journey was wearisome with many stops and crowded carriages they had to change twice once at doncaster once at a small junction ebury was a deserted station with a solitary porter to whom tommy addressed himself  can you tell me the way to the moat house  the moat house its a tidy step from here the big house near the sea you mean  tommy assented brazenly after listening to the porters meticulous but perplexing directions they prepared to leave the station it was beginning to rain and they turned up the collars of their coats as they trudged through the slush of the road suddenly tommy halted  wait a moment he ran back to the station and tackled the porter anew  look here do you remember a young lady who arrived by an earlier train the 1250 from london shed probably ask you the way to the moat house  he described tuppence as well as he could but the porter shook his head several people had arrived by the train in question he could not call to mind one young lady in particular but he was quite certain that no one had asked him the way to the moat house  tommy rejoined julius and explained depression was settling on him like a leaden weight he felt convinced that their quest was going to be unsuccessful the enemy had over three hours start three hours was more than enough for mr brown he would not ignore the possibility of the telegram having been found  the way seemed endless once they took the wrong turning and went nearly half a mile out of their direction it was past seven oclock when a small boy told them that t moat house was just past the next corner  a rusty iron gate swinging dismally on its hinges an overgrown drive thick with leaves there was something about the place that struck a chill to both their hearts they went up the deserted drive the leaves deadened their footsteps the daylight was almost gone it was like walking in a world of ghosts overhead the branches flapped and creaked with a mournful note occasionally a sodden leaf drifted silently down startling them with its cold touch on their cheek  a turn of the drive brought them in sight of the house that too seemed empty and deserted the shutters were closed the steps up to the door overgrown with moss was it indeed to this desolate spot that tuppence had been decoyed it seemed hard to believe that a human footstep had passed this way for months  julius jerked the rusty bell handle a jangling peal rang discordantly echoing through the emptiness within no one came they rang again and againbut there was no sign of life then they walked completely round the house everywhere silence and shuttered windows if they could believe the evidence of their eyes the place was empty  nothing doing said julius  they retraced their steps slowly to the gate  there must be a village handy continued the young american wed better make inquiries there theyll know something about the place and whether theres been anyone there lately  yes thats not a bad idea  proceeding up the road they soon came to a little hamlet on the outskirts of it they met a workman swinging his bag of tools and tommy stopped him with a question  the moat house its empty been empty for years mrs sweenys got the key if you want to go over itnext to the post office  tommy thanked him they soon found the post office which was also a sweet and general fancy shop and knocked at the door of the cottage next to it a clean wholesomelooking woman opened it she readily produced the key of the moat house  though i doubt if its the kind of place to suit you sir in a terrible state of repair ceilings leaking and all twould need a lot of money spent on it  thanks said tommy cheerily i dare say itll be a washout but houses are scarce nowadays  that they are declared the woman heartily my daughter and soninlaw have been looking for a decent cottage for i dont know how long its all the war upset things terribly it has but excuse me sir itll be too dark for you to see much of the house hadnt you better wait until tomorrow  thats all right well have a look around this evening anyway wed have been here before only we lost our way whats the best place to stay at for the night round here  mrs sweeny looked doubtful  theres the yorkshire arms but its not much of a place for gentlemen like you  oh it will do very well thanks by the way youve not had a young lady here asking for this key today  the woman shook her head  no ones been over the place for a long time  thanks very much  they retraced their steps to the moat house as the front door swung back on its hinges protesting loudly julius struck a match and examined the floor carefully then he shook his head  id swear no ones passed this way look at the dust thick not a sign of a footmark  they wandered round the deserted house everywhere the same tale thick layers of dust apparently undisturbed  this gets me said julius i dont believe tuppence was ever in this house  she must have been  julius shook his head without replying  well go over it again tomorrow said tommy perhaps well see more in the daylight  on the morrow they took up the search once more and were reluctantly forced to the conclusion that the house had not been invaded for some considerable time they might have left the village altogether but for a fortunate discovery of tommys as they were retracing their steps to the gate he gave a sudden cry and stooping picked something up from among the leaves and held it out to julius it was a small gold brooch  thats tuppences  are you sure  absolutely ive often seen her wear it  julius drew a deep breath  i guess that settles it she came as far as here anyway well make that pub our headquarters and raise hell round here until we find her somebody must have seen her  forthwith the campaign began tommy and julius worked separately and together but the result was the same nobody answering to tuppences description had been seen in the vicinity they were baffledbut not discouraged finally they altered their tactics tuppence had certainly not remained long in the neighbourhood of the moat house that pointed to her having been overcome and carried away in a car they renewed inquiries had anyone seen a car standing somewhere near the moat house that day again they met with no success  julius wired to town for his own car and they scoured the neighbourhood daily with unflagging zeal a grey limousine on which they had set high hopes was traced to harrogate and turned out to be the property of a highly respectable maiden lady  each day saw them set out on a new quest julius was like a hound on the leash he followed up the slenderest clue every car that had passed through the village on the fateful day was tracked down he forced his way into country properties and submitted the owners of the motors to a searching crossexamination his apologies were as thorough as his methods and seldom failed in disarming the indignation of his victims but as day succeeded day they were no nearer to discovering tuppences whereabouts so well had the abduction been planned that the girl seemed literally to have vanished into thin air  and another preoccupation was weighing on tommys mind  do you know how long weve been here he asked one morning as they sat facing each other at breakfast a week were no nearer to finding tuppence and next sunday is the 29th  shucks said julius thoughtfully id almost forgotten about the 29th ive been thinking of nothing but tuppence  so have i at least i hadnt forgotten about the 29th but it didnt seem to matter a damn in comparison to finding tuppence but todays the 23rd and times getting short if were ever going to get hold of her at all we must do it before the 29thher life wont be worth an hours purchase afterwards the hostage game will be played out by then im beginning to feel that weve made a big mistake in the way weve set about this weve wasted time and were no forrader  im with you there weve been a couple of mutts whove bitten off a bigger bit than they can chew im going to quit fooling right away  what do you mean  ill tell you im going to do what we ought to have done a week ago im going right back to london to put the case in the hands of your british police we fancied ourselves as sleuths sleuths it was a piece of damnfool foolishness im through ive had enough of it scotland yard for me  youre right said tommy slowly i wish to god wed gone there right away  better late than never weve been like a couple of babes playing here we go round the mulberry bush now im going right along to scotland yard to ask them to take me by the hand and show me the way i should go i guess the professional always scores over the amateur in the end are you coming along with me  tommy shook his head  whats the good one of us is enough i might as well stay here and nose round a bit longer something might turn up one never knows  sure thing well so long ill be back in a couple of shakes with a few inspectors along i shall tell them to pick out their brightest and best  but the course of events was not to follow the plan julius had laid down later in the day tommy received a wire   join me manchester midland hotel important newsjulius   at 730 that night tommy alighted from a slow crosscountry train julius was on the platform  thought youd come by this train if you werent out when my wire arrived  tommy grasped him by the arm  what is it is tuppence found  julius shook his head  no but i found this waiting in london just arrived  he handed the telegraph form to the other tommys eyes opened as he read   jane finn found come manchester midland hotel immediatelypeel edgerton   julius took the form back and folded it up  queer he said thoughtfully i thought that lawyer chap had quit    chapter xix jane finn  my train got in half an hour ago explained julius as he led the way out of the station i reckoned youd come by this before i left london and wired accordingly to sir james hes booked rooms for us and will be round to dine at eight  what made you think hed ceased to take any interest in the case asked tommy curiously  what he said replied julius dryly the old birds as close as an oyster like all the darned lot of them he wasnt going to commit himself till he was sure he could deliver the goods  i wonder said tommy thoughtfully  julius turned on him  you wonder what  whether that was his real reason  sure you bet your life it was  tommy shook his head unconvinced  sir james arrived punctually at eight oclock and julius introduced tommy sir james shook hands with him warmly  i am delighted to make your acquaintance mr beresford i have heard so much about you from miss tuppencehe smiled involuntarilythat it really seems as though i already know you quite well  thank you sir said tommy with his cheerful grin he scanned the great lawyer eagerly like tuppence he felt the magnetism of the others personality he was reminded of mr carter the two men totally unlike so far as physical resemblance went produced a similar effect beneath the weary manner of the one and the professional reserve of the other lay the same quality of mind keenedged like a rapier  in the meantime he was conscious of sir jamess close scrutiny when the lawyer dropped his eyes the young man had the feeling that the other had read him through and through like an open book he could not but wonder what the final judgment was but there was little chance of learning that sir james took in everything but gave out only what he chose a proof of that occurred almost at once  immediately the first greetings were over julius broke out into a flood of eager questions how had sir james managed to track the girl why had he not let them know that he was still working on the case and so on  sir james stroked his chin and smiled at last he said  just so just so well shes found and thats the great thing isnt it eh come now thats the great thing  sure it is but just how did you strike her trail miss tuppence and i thought youd quit for good and all  ah the lawyer shot a lightning glance at him then resumed operations on his chin you thought that did you did you really hm dear me  but i guess i can take it we were wrong pursued julius  well i dont know that i should go so far as to say that but its certainly fortunate for all parties that weve managed to find the young lady  but where is she demanded julius his thoughts flying off on another tack i thought youd be sure to bring her along  that would hardly be possible said sir james gravely  why  because the young lady was knocked down in a street accident and has sustained slight injuries to the head she was taken to the infirmary and on recovering consciousness gave her name as jane finn whenahi heard that i arranged for her to be removed to the house of a doctora friend of mine and wired at once for you she relapsed into unconsciousness and has not spoken since  shes not seriously hurt  oh a bruise and a cut or two really from a medical point of view absurdly slight injuries to have produced such a condition her state is probably to be attributed to the mental shock consequent on recovering her memory  its come back cried julius excitedly  sir james tapped the table rather impatiently  undoubtedly mr hersheimmer since she was able to give her real name i thought you had appreciated that point  and you just happened to be on the spot said tommy seems quite like a fairy tale  but sir james was far too wary to be drawn  coincidences are curious things he said dryly  nevertheless tommy was now certain of what he had before only suspected sir jamess presence in manchester was not accidental far from abandoning the case as julius supposed he had by some means of his own successfully run the missing girl to earth the only thing that puzzled tommy was the reason for all this secrecy he concluded that it was a foible of the legal mind  julius was speaking  after dinner he announced i shall go right away and see jane  that will be impossible i fear said sir james it is very unlikely they would allow her to see visitors at this time of night i should suggest tomorrow morning about ten oclock  julius flushed there was something in sir james which always stirred him to antagonism it was a conflict of two masterful personalities  all the same i reckon ill go round there tonight and see if i cant ginger them up to break through their silly rules  it will be quite useless mr hersheimmer  the words came out like the crack of a pistol and tommy looked up with a start julius was nervous and excited the hand with which he raised his glass to his lips shook slightly but his eyes held sir jamess defiantly for a moment the hostility between the two seemed likely to burst into flame but in the end julius lowered his eyes defeated  for the moment i reckon youre the boss  thank you said the other we will say ten oclock then with consummate ease of manner he turned to tommy i must confess mr beresford that it was something of a surprise to me to see you here this evening the last i heard of you was that your friends were in grave anxiety on your behalf nothing had been heard of you for some days and miss tuppence was inclined to think you had got into difficulties  i had sir tommy grinned reminiscently i was never in a tighter place in my life  helped out by questions from sir james he gave an abbreviated account of his adventures the lawyer looked at him with renewed interest as he brought the tale to a close  you got yourself out of a tight place very well he said gravely i congratulate you you displayed a great deal of ingenuity and carried your part through well  tommy blushed his face assuming a prawnlike hue at the praise  i couldnt have got away but for the girl sir  no sir james smiled a little it was lucky for you she happened toertake a fancy to you tommy appeared about to protest but sir james went on theres no doubt about her being one of the gang i suppose  im afraid not sir i thought perhaps they were keeping her there by force but the way she acted didnt fit in with that you see she went back to them when she could have got away  sir james nodded thoughtfully  what did she say something about wanting to be taken to marguerite  yes sir i suppose she meant mrs vandemeyer  she always signed herself rita vandemeyer all her friends spoke of her as rita still i suppose the girl must have been in the habit of calling her by her full name and at the moment she was crying out to her mrs vandemeyer was either dead or dying curious there are one or two points that strike me as being obscuretheir sudden change of attitude towards yourself for instance by the way the house was raided of course  yes sir but theyd all cleared out  naturally said sir james dryly  and not a clue left behind  i wonder the lawyer tapped the table thoughtfully  something in his voice made tommy look up would this mans eyes have seen something where theirs had been blind he spoke impulsively  i wish youd been there sir to go over the house  i wish i had said sir james quietly he sat for a moment in silence then he looked up and since then what have you been doing  for a moment tommy stared at him then it dawned on him that of course the lawyer did not know  i forgot that you didnt know about tuppence he said slowly the sickening anxiety forgotten for a while in the excitement of knowing jane finn was found at last swept over him again  the lawyer laid down his knife and fork sharply  has anything happened to miss tuppence his voice was keenedged  shes disappeared said julius  when  a week ago  how  sir jamess questions fairly shot out between them tommy and julius gave the history of the last week and their futile search  sir james went at once to the root of the matter  a wire signed with your name they knew enough of you both for that they werent sure of how much you had learnt in that house their kidnapping of miss tuppence is the countermove to your escape if necessary they could seal your lips with a threat of what might happen to her  tommy nodded  thats just what i thought sir  sir james looked at him keenly you had worked that out had you not badnot at all bad the curious thing is that they certainly did not know anything about you when they first held you prisoner you are sure that you did not in any way disclose your identity  tommy shook his head  thats so said julius with a nod therefore i reckon some one put them wiseand not earlier than sunday afternoon  yes but who  that almighty omniscient mr brown of course  there was a faint note of derision in the americans voice which made sir james look up sharply  you dont believe in mr brown mr hersheimmer  no sir i do not returned the young american with emphasis not as such that is to say i reckon it out that hes a figureheadjust a bogy name to frighten the children with the real head of this business is that russian chap kramenin i guess hes quite capable of running revolutions in three countries at once if he chose the man whittington is probably the head of the english branch  i disagree with you said sir james shortly mr brown exists he turned to tommy did you happen to notice where that wire was handed in  no sir im afraid i didnt  hm got it with you  its upstairs sir in my kit  id like to have a look at it sometime no hurry youve wasted a weektommy hung his heada day or so more is immaterial well deal with miss jane finn first afterwards well set to work to rescue miss tuppence from bondage i dont think shes in any immediate danger that is so long as they dont know that weve got jane finn and that her memory has returned we must keep that dark at all costs you understand  the other two assented and after making arrangements for meeting on the morrow the great lawyer took his leave  at ten oclock the two young men were at the appointed spot sir james had joined them on the doorstep he alone appeared unexcited he introduced them to the doctor  mr hersheimmermr beresforddr roylance hows the patient  going on well evidently no idea of the flight of time asked this morning how many had been saved from the lusitania was it in the papers yet that of course was only what was to be expected she seems to have something on her mind though  i think we can relieve her anxiety may we go up  certainly  tommys heart beat sensibly faster as they followed the doctor upstairs jane finn at last the longsought the mysterious the elusive jane finn how wildly improbable success had seemed and here in this house her memory almost miraculously restored lay the girl who held the future of england in her hands a half groan broke from tommys lips if only tuppence could have been at his side to share in the triumphant conclusion of their joint venture then he put the thought of tuppence resolutely aside his confidence in sir james was growing there was a man who would unerringly ferret out tuppences whereabouts in the meantime jane finn and suddenly a dread clutched at his heart it seemed too easy suppose they should find her dead stricken down by the hand of mr brown  in another minute he was laughing at these melodramatic fancies the doctor held open the door of a room and they passed in on the white bed bandages round her head lay the girl somehow the whole scene seemed unreal it was so exactly what one expected that it gave the effect of being beautifully staged  the girl looked from one to the other of them with large wondering eyes sir james spoke first  miss finn he said this is your cousin mr julius p hersheimmer  a faint flush flitted over the girls face as julius stepped forward and took her hand  how do cousin jane he said lightly  but tommy caught the tremor in his voice  are you really uncle hirams son she asked wonderingly  her voice with the slight warmth of the western accent had an almost thrilling quality it seemed vaguely familiar to tommy but he thrust the impression aside as impossible  sure thing  we used to read about uncle hiram in the papers continued the girl in her low soft tones but i never thought id meet you one day mother figured it out that uncle hiram would never get over being mad with her  the old man was like that admitted julius but i guess the new generations sort of different got no use for the family feud business first thing i thought about soon as the war was over was to come along and hunt you up  a shadow passed over the girls face  theyve been telling me thingsdreadful thingsthat my memory went and that there are years i shall never know aboutyears lost out of my life  you didnt realize that yourself  the girls eyes opened wide  why no it seems to me as though it were no time since we were being hustled into those boats i can see it all now she closed her eyes with a shudder  julius looked across at sir james who nodded  dont worry any it isnt worth it now see here jane theres something we want to know about there was a man aboard that boat with some mighty important papers on him and the big guns in this country have got a notion that he passed on the goods to you is that so  the girl hesitated her glance shifting to the other two julius understood  mr beresford is commissioned by the british government to get those papers back sir james peel edgerton is an english member of parliament and might be a big gun in the cabinet if he liked its owing to him that weve ferreted you out at last so you can go right ahead and tell us the whole story did danvers give you the papers  yes he said theyd have a better chance with me because they would save the women and children first  just as we thought said sir james  he said they were very importantthat they might make all the difference to the allies but if its all so long ago and the wars over what does it matter now  i guess history repeats itself jane first there was a great hue and cry over those papers then it all died down and now the whole caboodles started all over againfor rather different reasons then you can hand them over to us right away  but i cant  what  i havent got them  youhaventgot them julius punctuated the words with little pauses  noi hid them  you hid them  yes i got uneasy people seemed to be watching me it scared mebadly she put her hand to her head its almost the last thing i remember before waking up in the hospital  go on said sir james in his quiet penetrating tones what do you remember  she turned to him obediently  it was at holyhead i came that wayi dont remember why  that doesnt matter go on  in the confusion on the quay i slipped away nobody saw me i took a car told the man to drive me out of the town i watched when we got on the open road no other car was following us i saw a path at the side of the road i told the man to wait  she paused then went on the path led to the cliff and down to the sea between big yellow gorse bushesthey were like golden flames i looked round there wasnt a soul in sight but just level with my head there was a hole in the rock it was quite smalli could only just get my hand in but it went a long way back i took the oilskin packet from round my neck and shoved it right in as far as i could then i tore off a bit of gorsemy but it did prickand plugged the hole with it so that youd never guess there was a crevice of any kind there then i marked the place carefully in my own mind so that id find it again there was a queer boulder in the path just therefor all the world like a dog sitting up begging then i went back to the road the car was waiting and i drove back i just caught the train i was a bit ashamed of myself for fancying things maybe but by and by i saw the man opposite me wink at a woman who was sitting next to me and i felt scared again and was glad the papers were safe i went out in the corridor to get a little air i thought id slip into another carriage but the woman called me back said id dropped something and when i stooped to look something seemed to hit mehere she placed her hand to the back of her head i dont remember anything more until i woke up in the hospital  there was a pause  thank you miss finn it was sir james who spoke i hope we have not tired you  oh thats all right my head aches a little but otherwise i feel fine  julius stepped forward and took her hand again  so long cousin jane im going to get busy after those papers but ill be back in two shakes of a dogs tail and ill tote you up to london and give you the time of your young life before we go back to the states i mean itso hurry up and get well     chapter xx too late  in the street they held an informal council of war sir james had drawn a watch from his pocket the boat train to holyhead stops at chester at 1214 if you start at once i think you can catch the connection  tommy looked up puzzled  is there any need to hurry sir today is only the 24th  i guess its always well to get up early in the morning said julius before the lawyer had time to reply well make tracks for the depot right away  a little frown had settled on sir jamess brow  i wish i could come with you i am due to speak at a meeting at two oclock it is unfortunate  the reluctance in his tone was very evident it was clear on the other hand that julius was easily disposed to put up with the loss of the others company  i guess theres nothing complicated about this deal he remarked just a game of hideandseek thats all  i hope so said sir james  sure thing what else could it be  you are still young mr hersheimmer at my age you will probably have learnt one lesson never underestimate your adversary  the gravity of his tone impressed tommy but had little effect upon julius  you think mr brown might come along and take a hand if he does im ready for him he slapped his pocket i carry a gun little willie here travels round with me everywhere he produced a murderouslooking automatic and tapped it affectionately before returning it to its home but he wont be needed this trip theres nobody to put mr brown wise  the lawyer shrugged his shoulders  there was nobody to put mr brown wise to the fact that mrs vandemeyer meant to betray him nevertheless mrs vandemeyer died without speaking  julius was silenced for once and sir james added on a lighter note  i only want to put you on your guard goodbye and good luck take no unnecessary risks once the papers are in your hands if there is any reason to believe that you have been shadowed destroy them at once good luck to you the game is in your hands now he shook hands with them both  ten minutes later the two young men were seated in a firstclass carriage en route for chester  for a long time neither of them spoke when at length julius broke the silence it was with a totally unexpected remark  say he observed thoughtfully did you ever make a darned fool of yourself over a girls face  tommy after a moments astonishment searched his mind  cant say i have he replied at last not that i can recollect anyhow why  because for the last two months ive been making a sentimental idiot of myself over jane first moment i clapped eyes on her photograph my heart did all the usual stunts you read about in novels i guess im ashamed to admit it but i came over here determined to find her and fix it all up and take her back as mrs julius p hersheimmer  oh said tommy amazed  julius uncrossed his legs brusquely and continued  just shows what an almighty fool a man can make of himself one look at the girl in the flesh and i was cured  feeling more tonguetied than ever tommy ejaculated oh again  no disparagement to jane mind you continued the other shes a real nice girl and some fellow will fall in love with her right away  i thought her a very goodlooking girl said tommy finding his tongue  sure she is but shes not like her photo one bit at least i suppose she is in a waymust bebecause i recognized her right off if id seen her in a crowd id have said theres a girl whose face i know right away without any hesitation but there was something about that photojulius shook his head and heaved a sighi guess romance is a mighty queer thing  it must be said tommy coldly if you can come over here in love with one girl and propose to another within a fortnight  julius had the grace to look discomposed  well you see id got a sort of tired feeling that id never find janeand that it was all plumb foolishness anyway and thenoh well the french for instance are much more sensible in the way they look at things they keep romance and marriage apart  tommy flushed  well im damned if thats  julius hastened to interrupt  say now dont be hasty i dont mean what you mean i take it americans have a higher opinion of morality than you have even what i meant was that the french set about marriage in a businesslike wayfind two people who are suited to one another look after the money affairs and see the whole thing practically and in a businesslike spirit  if you ask me said tommy were all too damned businesslike nowadays were always saying will it pay the men are bad enough and the girls are worse  cool down son dont get so heated  i feel heated said tommy  julius looked at him and judged it wise to say no more  however tommy had plenty of time to cool down before they reached holyhead and the cheerful grin had returned to his countenance as they alighted at their destination  after consultation and with the aid of a road map they were fairly well agreed as to direction so were able to hire a taxi without more ado and drive out on the road leading to treaddur bay they instructed the man to go slowly and watched narrowly so as not to miss the path they came to it not long after leaving the town and tommy stopped the car promptly asked in a casual tone whether the path led down to the sea and hearing it did paid off the man in handsome style  a moment later the taxi was slowly chugging back to holyhead tommy and julius watched it out of sight and then turned to the narrow path  its the right one i suppose asked tommy doubtfully there must be simply heaps along here  sure it is look at the gorse remember what jane said  tommy looked at the swelling hedges of golden blossom which bordered the path on either side and was convinced  they went down in single file julius leading twice tommy turned his head uneasily julius looked back  what is it  i dont know ive got the wind up somehow keep fancying theres some one following us  cant be said julius positively wed see him  tommy had to admit that this was true nevertheless his sense of uneasiness deepened in spite of himself he believed in the omniscience of the enemy  i rather wish that fellow would come along said julius he patted his pocket little william here is just aching for exercise  do you always carry ithimwith you inquired tommy with burning curiosity  most always i guess you never know what might turn up  tommy kept a respectful silence he was impressed by little william it seemed to remove the menace of mr brown farther away  the path was now running along the side of the cliff parallel to the sea suddenly julius came to such an abrupt halt that tommy cannoned into him  whats up he inquired  look there if that doesnt beat the band  tommy looked standing out half obstructing the path was a huge boulder which certainly bore a fanciful resemblance to a begging terrier  well said tommy refusing to share juliuss emotion its what we expected to see isnt it  julius looked at him sadly and shook his head  british phlegm sure we expected itbut it kind of rattles me all the same to see it sitting there just where we expected to find it  tommy whose calm was perhaps more assumed than natural moved his feet impatiently  push on what about the hole  they scanned the cliffside narrowly tommy heard himself saying idiotically  the gorse wont be there after all these years  and julius replied solemnly  i guess youre right  tommy suddenly pointed with a shaking hand  what about that crevice there  julius replied in an awestricken voice  thats itfor sure  they looked at each other  when i was in france said tommy reminiscently whenever my batman failed to call me he always said that he had come over queer i never believed it but whether he felt it or not there is such a sensation ive got it now badly  he looked at the rock with a kind of agonized passion  damn it he cried its impossible five years think of it birdsnesting boys picnic parties thousands of people passing it cant be there its a hundred to one against its being there its against all reason  indeed he felt it to be impossiblemore perhaps because he could not believe in his own success where so many others had failed the thing was too easy therefore it could not be the hole would be empty  julius looked at him with a widening smile  i guess youre rattled now all right he drawled with some enjoyment well here goes he thrust his hand into the crevice and made a slight grimace its a tight fit janes hand must be a few sizes smaller than mine i dont feel anythingnosay whats this gee whiz and with a flourish he waved aloft a small discoloured packet its the goods all right sewn up in oilskin hold it while i get my penknife  the unbelievable had happened tommy held the precious packet tenderly between his hands they had succeeded  its queer he murmured idly youd think the stitches would have rotted they look just as good as new  they cut them carefully and ripped away the oilskin inside was a small folded sheet of paper with trembling fingers they unfolded it the sheet was blank they stared at each other puzzled  a dummy hazarded julius was danvers just a decoy  tommy shook his head that solution did not satisfy him suddenly his face cleared  ive got it sympathetic ink  you think so  worth trying anyhow heat usually does the trick get some sticks well make a fire  in a few minutes the little fire of twigs and leaves was blazing merrily tommy held the sheet of paper near the glow the paper curled a little with the heat nothing more  suddenly julius grasped his arm and pointed to where characters were appearing in a faint brown colour  gee whiz youve got it say that idea of yours was great it never occurred to me  tommy held the paper in position some minutes longer until he judged the heat had done its work then he withdrew it a moment later he uttered a cry  across the sheet in neat brown printing ran the words with the compliments of mr brown    chapter xxi tommy makes a discovery  for a moment or two they stood staring at each other stupidly dazed with the shock somehow inexplicably mr brown had forestalled them tommy accepted defeat quietly not so julius  how in tarnation did he get ahead of us thats what beats me he ended up  tommy shook his head and said dully  it accounts for the stitches being new we might have guessed  never mind the darned stitches how did he get ahead of us we hustled all we knew its downright impossible for anyone to get here quicker than we did and anyway how did he know do you reckon there was a dictaphone in janes room i guess there must have been  but tommys common sense pointed out objections  no one could have known beforehand that she was going to be in that housemuch less that particular room  thats so admitted julius then one of the nurses was a crook and listened at the door hows that  i dont see that it matters anyway said tommy wearily he may have found out some months ago and removed the papers thenno by jove that wont wash theyd have been published at once  sure thing they would no some ones got ahead of us today by an hour or so but how they did it gets my goat  i wish that chap peel edgerton had been with us said tommy thoughtfully  why julius stared the mischief was done when we came  yes tommy hesitated he could not explain his own feelingthe illogical idea that the kcs presence would somehow have averted the catastrophe he reverted to his former point of view its no good arguing about how it was done the games up weve failed theres only one thing for me to do  whats that  get back to london as soon as possible mr carter must be warned its only a matter of hours now before the blow falls but at any rate he ought to know the worst  the duty was an unpleasant one but tommy had no intention of shirking it he must report his failure to mr carter after that his work was done he took the midnight mail to london julius elected to stay the night at holyhead  half an hour after arrival haggard and pale tommy stood before his chief  ive come to report sir ive failedfailed badly  mr carter eyed him sharply  you mean that the treaty  is in the hands of mr brown sir  ah said mr carter quietly the expression on his face did not change but tommy caught the flicker of despair in his eyes it convinced him as nothing else had done that the outlook was hopeless  well said mr carter after a minute or two we mustnt sag at the knees i suppose im glad to know definitely we must do what we can  through tommys mind flashed the assurance its hopeless and he knows its hopeless  the other looked up at him  dont take it to heart lad he said kindly you did your best you were up against one of the biggest brains of the century and you came very near success remember that  thank you sir its awfully decent of you  i blame myself i have been blaming myself ever since i heard this other news  something in his tone attracted tommys attention a new fear gripped at his heart  is theresomething more sir  im afraid so said mr carter gravely he stretched out his hand to a sheet on the table  tuppence faltered tommy  read for yourself  the typewritten words danced before his eyes the description of a green toque a coat with a handkerchief in the pocket marked plc he looked an agonized question at mr carter the latter replied to it  washed up on the yorkshire coastnear ebury im afraidit looks very much like foul play  my god gasped tommy tuppence those devilsill never rest till ive got even with them ill hunt them down ill  the pity on mr carters face stopped him  i know what you feel like my poor boy but its no good youll waste your strength uselessly it may sound harsh but my advice to you is cut your losses times merciful youll forget  forget tuppence never  mr carter shook his head  so you think now well it wont bear thinking ofthat brave little girl im sorry about the whole businessconfoundedly sorry  tommy came to himself with a start  im taking up your time sir he said with an effort theres no need for you to blame yourself i dare say we were a couple of young fools to take on such a job you warned us all right but i wish to god id been the one to get it in the neck goodbye sir  back at the ritz tommy packed up his few belongings mechanically his thoughts far away he was still bewildered by the introduction of tragedy into his cheerful commonplace existence what fun they had had together he and tuppence and nowoh he couldnt believe itit couldnt be true tuppencedead little tuppence brimming over with life it was a dream a horrible dream nothing more  they brought him a note a few kind words of sympathy from peel edgerton who had read the news in the paper there had been a large headline exvad feared drowned the letter ended with the offer of a post on a ranch in the argentine where sir james had considerable interests  kind old beggar muttered tommy as he flung it aside  the door opened and julius burst in with his usual violence he held an open newspaper in his hand  say whats all this they seem to have got some fool idea about tuppence  its true said tommy quietly  you mean theyve done her in  tommy nodded  i suppose when they got the treaty shewasnt any good to them any longer and they were afraid to let her go  well im darned said julius little tuppence she sure was the pluckiest little girl  but suddenly something seemed to crack in tommys brain he rose to his feet  oh get out you dont really care damn you you asked her to marry you in your rotten coldblooded way but i loved her id have given the soul out of my body to save her from harm id have stood by without a word and let her marry you because you could have given her the sort of time she ought to have had and i was only a poor devil without a penny to bless himself with but it wouldnt have been because i didnt care  see here began julius temperately  oh go to the devil i cant stand your coming here and talking about little tuppence go and look after your cousin tuppence is my girl ive always loved her from the time we played together as kids we grew up and it was just the same i shall never forget when i was in hospital and she came in in that ridiculous cap and apron it was like a miracle to see the girl i loved turn up in a nurses kit  but julius interrupted him  a nurses kit gee whiz i must be going to colney hatch i could swear ive seen jane in a nurses cap too and thats plumb impossible no by gum ive got it it was her i saw talking to whittington at that nursing home in bournemouth she wasnt a patient there she was a nurse  i dare say said tommy angrily shes probably been in with them from the start i shouldnt wonder if she stole those papers from danvers to begin with  im darned if she did shouted julius shes my cousin and as patriotic a girl as ever stepped  i dont care a damn what she is but get out of here retorted tommy also at the top of his voice  the young men were on the point of coming to blows but suddenly with an almost magical abruptness juliuss anger abated  all right son he said quietly im going i dont blame you any for what youve been saying its mighty lucky you did say it ive been the most almighty blithering darned idiot that its possible to imagine calm downtommy had made an impatient gestureim going right away nowgoing to the london and north western railway depot if you want to know  i dont care a damn where youre going growled tommy  as the door closed behind julius he returned to his suitcase  thats the lot he murmured and rang the bell  take my luggage down  yes sir going away sir  im going to the devil said tommy regardless of the menials feelings  that functionary however merely replied respectfully  yes sir shall i call a taxi  tommy nodded  where was he going he hadnt the faintest idea beyond a fixed determination to get even with mr brown he had no plans he reread sir jamess letter and shook his head tuppence must be avenged still it was kind of the old fellow  better answer it i suppose he went across to the writingtable with the usual perversity of bedroom stationery there were innumerable envelopes and no paper he rang no one came tommy fumed at the delay then he remembered that there was a good supply in juliuss sittingroom the american had announced his immediate departure there would be no fear of running up against him besides he wouldnt mind if he did he was beginning to be rather ashamed of the things he had said old julius had taken them jolly well hed apologize if he found him there  but the room was deserted tommy walked across to the writingtable and opened the middle drawer a photograph carelessly thrust in face upwards caught his eye for a moment he stood rooted to the ground then he took it out shut the drawer walked slowly over to an armchair and sat down still staring at the photograph in his hand  what on earth was a photograph of the french girl annette doing in julius hersheimmers writingtable    chapter xxii in downing street  the prime minister tapped the desk in front of him with nervous fingers his face was worn and harassed he took up his conversation with mr carter at the point it had broken off i dont understand he said do you really mean that things are not so desperate after all  so this lad seems to think  lets have a look at his letter again  mr carter handed it over it was written in a sprawling boyish hand  dear mr carter  somethings turned up that has given me a jar of course i may be simply making an awful ass of myself but i dont think so if my conclusions are right that girl at manchester was just a plant the whole thing was prearranged sham packet and all with the object of making us think the game was uptherefore i fancy that we must have been pretty hot on the scent  i think i know who the real jane finn is and ive even got an idea where the papers are that lasts only a guess of course but ive a sort of feeling itll turn out right anyhow i enclose it in a sealed envelope for what its worth im going to ask you not to open it until the very last moment midnight on the 28th in fact youll understand why in a minute you see ive figured it out that those things of tuppences are a plant too and shes no more drowned than i am the way i reason is this as a last chance theyll let jane finn escape in the hope that shes been shamming this memory stunt and that once she thinks shes free shell go right away to the cache of course its an awful risk for them to take because she knows all about thembut theyre pretty desperate to get hold of that treaty but if they know that the papers have been recovered by us neither of those two girls lives will be worth an hours purchase i must try and get hold of tuppence before jane escapes  i want a repeat of that telegram that was sent to tuppence at the ritz sir james peel edgerton said you would be able to manage that for me hes frightfully clever  one last thingplease have that house in soho watched day and night  yours etc  thomas beresford   the prime minister looked up  the enclosure  mr carter smiled dryly  in the vaults of the bank i am taking no chances  you dont thinkthe prime minister hesitated a minutethat it would be better to open it now surely we ought to secure the document that is provided the young mans guess turns out to be correct at once we can keep the fact of having done so quite secret  can we im not so sure there are spies all round us once its known i wouldnt give thathe snapped his fingersfor the life of those two girls no the boy trusted me and i shant let him down  well well we must leave it at that then whats he like this lad  outwardly hes an ordinary cleanlimbed rather blockheaded young englishman slow in his mental processes on the other hand its quite impossible to lead him astray through his imagination he hasnt got anyso hes difficult to deceive he worries things out slowly and once hes got hold of anything he doesnt let go the little ladys quite different more intuition and less common sense they make a pretty pair working together pace and stamina  he seems confident mused the prime minister  yes and thats what gives me hope hes the kind of diffident youth who would have to be very sure before he ventured an opinion at all  a half smile came to the others lips  and it is thisboy who will defeat the master criminal of our time  thisboy as you say but i sometimes fancy i see a shadow behind  you mean  peel edgerton  peel edgerton said the prime minister in astonishment  yes i see his hand in this he struck the open letter hes thereworking in the dark silently unobtrusively ive always felt that if anyone was to run mr brown to earth peel edgerton would be the man i tell you hes on the case now but doesnt want it known by the way i got rather an odd request from him the other day  yes  he sent me a cutting from some american paper it referred to a mans body found near the docks in new york about three weeks ago he asked me to collect any information on the subject i could  well  carter shrugged his shoulders  i couldnt get much young fellow about thirtyfivepoorly dressedface very badly disfigured he was never identified  and you fancy that the two matters are connected in some way  somehow i do i may be wrong of course  there was a pause then mr carter continued  i asked him to come round here not that well get anything out of him he doesnt want to tell his legal instincts are too strong but theres no doubt he can throw light on one or two obscure points in young beresfords letter ah here he is  the two men rose to greet the newcomer a half whimsical thought flashed across the premiers mind my successor perhaps  weve had a letter from young beresford said mr carter coming to the point at once youve seen him i suppose  you suppose wrong said the lawyer  oh mr carter was a little nonplussed  sir james smiled and stroked his chin  he rang me up he volunteered  would you have any objection to telling us exactly what passed between you  not at all he thanked me for a certain letter which i had written to himas a matter of fact i had offered him a job then he reminded me of something i had said to him at manchester respecting that bogus telegram which lured miss cowley away i asked him if anything untoward had occurred he said it hadthat in a drawer in mr hersheimmers room he had discovered a photograph the lawyer paused then continued i asked him if the photograph bore the name and address of a californian photographer he replied youre on to it sir it had then he went on to tell me something i didnt know the original of that photograph was the french girl annette who saved his life  what  exactly i asked the young man with some curiosity what he had done with the photograph he replied that he had put it back where he found it the lawyer paused again that was good you knowdistinctly good he can use his brains that young fellow i congratulated him the discovery was a providential one of course from the moment that the girl in manchester was proved to be a plant everything was altered young beresford saw that for himself without my having to tell it him but he felt he couldnt trust his judgment on the subject of miss cowley did i think she was alive i told him duly weighing the evidence that there was a very decided chance in favour of it that brought us back to the telegram  yes  i advised him to apply to you for a copy of the original wire it had occurred to me as probable that after miss cowley flung it on the floor certain words might have been erased and altered with the express intention of setting searchers on a false trail  carter nodded he took a sheet from his pocket and read aloud   come at once astley priors gatehouse kent great developmentstommy   very simple said sir james and very ingenious just a few words to alter and the thing was done and the one important clue they overlooked  what was that  the pageboys statement that miss cowley drove to charing cross they were so sure of themselves that they took it for granted he had made a mistake  then young beresford is now  at gatehouse kent unless i am much mistaken  mr carter looked at him curiously  i rather wonder youre not there too peel edgerton  ah im busy on a case  i thought you were on your holiday  oh ive not been briefed perhaps it would be more correct to say im preparing a case any more facts about that american chap for me  im afraid not is it important to find out who he was  oh i know who he was said sir james easily i cant prove it yetbut i know  the other two asked no questions they had an instinct that it would be mere waste of breath  but what i dont understand said the primeminister suddenly is how that photograph came to be in mr hersheimmers drawer  perhaps it never left it suggested the lawyer gently  but the bogus inspector inspector brown  ah said sir james thoughtfully he rose to his feet i mustnt keep you go on with the affairs of the nation i must get back tomy case  two days later julius hersheimmer returned from manchester a note from tommy lay on his table   dear hersheimmer  sorry i lost my temper in case i dont see you again goodbye ive been offered a job in the argentine and might as well take it  yours  tommy beresford   a peculiar smile lingered for a moment on juliuss face he threw the letter into the wastepaper basket  the darned fool he murmured    chapter xxiii a race against time  after ringing up sir james tommys next procedure was to make a call at south audley mansions he found albert discharging his professional duties and introduced himself without more ado as a friend of tuppences albert unbent immediately  things has been very quiet here lately he said wistfully hope the young ladys keeping well sir  thats just the point albert shes disappeared  you dont mean as the crooks have got her  they have  in the underworld  no dash it all in this world  its a hexpression sir explained albert at the pictures the crooks always have a restoorant in the underworld but do you think as theyve done her in sir  i hope not by the way have you by any chance an aunt a cousin a grandmother or any other suitable female relation who might be represented as being likely to kick the bucket  a delighted grin spread slowly over alberts countenance  im on sir my poor aunt what lives in the country has been mortal bad for a long time and shes asking for me with her dying breath  tommy nodded approval  can you report this in the proper quarter and meet me at charing cross in an hours time  ill be there sir you can count on me  as tommy had judged the faithful albert proved an invaluable ally the two took up their quarters at the inn in gatehouse to albert fell the task of collecting information there was no difficulty about it  astley priors was the property of a dr adams the doctor no longer practiced had retired the landlord believed but he took a few private patientshere the good fellow tapped his forehead knowinglybalmy ones you understand the doctor was a popular figure in the village subscribed freely to all the local sportsa very pleasant affable gentleman been there long oh a matter of ten years or somight be longer scientific gentleman he was professors and people often came down from town to see him anyway it was a gay house always visitors  in the face of all this volubility tommy felt doubts was it possible that this genial wellknown figure could be in reality a dangerous criminal his life seemed so open and aboveboard no hint of sinister doings suppose it was all a gigantic mistake tommy felt a cold chill at the thought  then he remembered the private patientsbalmy ones he inquired carefully if there was a young lady amongst them describing tuppence but nothing much seemed to be known about the patientsthey were seldom seen outside the grounds a guarded description of annette also failed to provoke recognition  astley priors was a pleasant redbrick edifice surrounded by wellwooded grounds which effectually shielded the house from observation from the road  on the first evening tommy accompanied by albert explored the grounds owing to alberts insistence they dragged themselves along painfully on their stomachs thereby producing a great deal more noise than if they had stood upright in any case these precautions were totally unnecessary the grounds like those of any other private house after nightfall seemed untenanted tommy had imagined a possible fierce watchdog alberts fancy ran to a puma or a tame cobra but they reached a shrubbery near the house quite unmolested  the blinds of the diningroom window were up there was a large company assembled round the table the port was passing from hand to hand it seemed a normal pleasant company through the open window scraps of conversation floated out disjointedly on the night air it was a heated discussion on county cricket  again tommy felt that cold chill of uncertainty it seemed impossible to believe that these people were other than they seemed had he been fooled once more the fairbearded spectacled gentleman who sat at the head of the table looked singularly honest and normal  tommy slept badly that night the following morning the indefatigable albert having cemented an alliance with the greengrocers boy took the latters place and ingratiated himself with the cook at malthouse he returned with the information that she was undoubtedly one of the crooks but tommy mistrusted the vividness of his imagination questioned he could adduce nothing in support of his statement except his own opinion that she wasnt the usual kind you could see that at a glance  the substitution being repeated much to the pecuniary advantage of the real greengrocers boy on the following day albert brought back the first piece of hopeful news there was a french young lady staying in the house tommy put his doubts aside here was confirmation of his theory but time pressed today was the 27th the 29th was the muchtalkedof labour day about which all sorts of rumours were running riot newspapers were getting agitated sensational hints of a labour coup detat were freely reported the government said nothing it knew and was prepared there were rumours of dissension among the labour leaders they were not of one mind the more farseeing among them realized that what they proposed might well be a deathblow to the england that at heart they loved they shrank from the starvation and misery a general strike would entail and were willing to meet the government halfway but behind them were subtle insistent forces at work urging the memories of old wrongs deprecating the weakness of halfandhalf measures fomenting misunderstandings  tommy felt that thanks to mr carter he understood the position fairly accurately with the fatal document in the hands of mr brown public opinion would swing to the side of the labour extremists and revolutionists failing that the battle was an even chance the government with a loyal army and police force behind them might winbut at a cost of great suffering but tommy nourished another and a preposterous dream with mr brown unmasked and captured he believed rightly or wrongly that the whole organization would crumble ignominiously and instantaneously the strange permeating influence of the unseen chief held it together without him tommy believed an instant panic would set in and the honest men left to themselves an eleventhhour reconciliation would be possible  this is a oneman show said tommy to himself the thing to do is to get hold of the man  it was partly in furtherance of this ambitious design that he had requested mr carter not to open the sealed envelope the draft treaty was tommys bait every now and then he was aghast at his own presumption how dared he think that he had discovered what so many wiser and clever men had overlooked nevertheless he stuck tenaciously to his idea  that evening he and albert once more penetrated the grounds of astley priors tommys ambition was somehow or other to gain admission to the house itself as they approached cautiously tommy gave a sudden gasp  on the second floor window some one standing between the window and the light in the room threw a silhouette on the blind it was one tommy would have recognized anywhere tuppence was in that house  he clutched albert by the shoulder  stay here when i begin to sing watch that window  he retreated hastily to a position on the main drive and began in a deep roar coupled with an unsteady gait the following ditty            i am a soldier           a jolly british soldier    you can see that im a soldier by my feet   it had been a favourite on the gramophone in tuppences hospital days he did not doubt but that she would recognize it and draw her own conclusions tommy had not a note of music in his voice but his lungs were excellent the noise he produced was terrific  presently an unimpeachable butler accompanied by an equally unimpeachable footman issued from the front door the butler remonstrated with him tommy continued to sing addressing the butler affectionately as dear old whiskers the footman took him by one arm the butler by the other they ran him down the drive and neatly out of the gate the butler threatened him with the police if he intruded again it was beautifully donesoberly and with perfect decorum anyone would have sworn that the butler was a real butler the footman a real footmanonly as it happened the butler was whittington  tommy retired to the inn and waited for alberts return at last that worthy made his appearance  well cried tommy eagerly  its all right while they was arunning of you out the window opened and something was chucked out he handed a scrap of paper to tommy it was wrapped round a letterweight  on the paper were scrawled three words tomorrowsame time  good egg cried tommy were getting going  i wrote a message on a piece of paper wrapped it round a stone and chucked it through the window continued albert breathlessly  tommy groaned  your zeal will be the undoing of us albert what did you say  said we was astaying at the inn if she could get away to come there and croak like a frog  shell know thats you said tommy with a sigh of relief your imagination runs away with you you know albert why you wouldnt recognize a frog croaking if you heard it  albert looked rather crestfallen  cheer up said tommy no harm done that butlers an old friend of minei bet he knew who i was though he didnt let on its not their game to show suspicion thats why weve found it fairly plain sailing they dont want to discourage me altogether on the other hand they dont want to make it too easy im a pawn in their game albert thats what i am you see if the spider lets the fly walk out too easily the fly might suspect it was a putup job hence the usefulness of that promising youth mr t beresford whos blundered in just at the right moment for them but later mr t beresford had better look out  tommy retired for the night in a state of some elation he had elaborated a careful plan for the following evening he felt sure that the inhabitants of astley priors would not interfere with him up to a certain point it was after that that tommy proposed to give them a surprise  about twelve oclock however his calm was rudely shaken he was told that some one was demanding him in the bar the applicant proved to be a rudelooking carter well coated with mud  well my good fellow what is it asked tommy  might this be for you sir the carter held out a very dirty folded note on the outside of which was written take this to the gentleman at the inn near astley priors he will give you ten shillings  the handwriting was tuppences tommy appreciated her quickwittedness in realizing that he might be staying at the inn under an assumed name he snatched at it  thats all right  the man withheld it  what about my ten shillings  tommy hastily produced a tenshilling note and the man relinquished his find tommy unfastened it  dear tommy  i knew it was you last night dont go this evening theyll be lying in wait for you theyre taking us away this morning i heard something about walesholyhead i think ill drop this on the road if i get a chance annette told me how youd escaped buck up  yours  twopence   tommy raised a shout for albert before he had even finished perusing this characteristic epistle  pack my bag were off  yes sir the boots of albert could be heard racing upstairs holyhead did that mean that after alltommy was puzzled he read on slowly  the boots of albert continued to be active on the floor above  suddenly a second shout came from below  albert im a damned fool unpack that bag  yes sir  tommy smoothed out the note thoughtfully  yes a damned fool he said softly but sos some one else and at last i know who it is    chapter xxiv julius takes a hand  in his suite at claridges kramenin reclined on a couch and dictated to his secretary in sibilant russian  presently the telephone at the secretarys elbow purred and he took up the receiver spoke for a minute or two then turned to his employer  some one below is asking for you  who is it  he gives the name of mr julius p hersheimmer  hersheimmer repeated kramenin thoughtfully i have heard that name before  his father was one of the steel kings of america explained the secretary whose business it was to know everything this young man must be a millionaire several times over  the others eyes narrowed appreciatively  you had better go down and see him ivan find out what he wants  the secretary obeyed closing the door noiselessly behind him in a few minutes he returned  he declines to state his businesssays it is entirely private and personal and that he must see you  a millionaire several times over murmured kramenin bring him up my dear ivan  the secretary left the room once more and returned escorting julius  monsieur kramenin said the latter abruptly  the russian studying him attentively with his pale venomous eyes bowed  pleased to meet you said the american ive got some very important business id like to talk over with you if i can see you alone he looked pointedly at the other  my secretary monsieur grieber from whom i have no secrets  that may be sobut i have said julius dryly so id be obliged if youd tell him to scoot  ivan said the russian softly perhaps you would not mind retiring into the next room  the next room wont do interrupted julius i know these ducal suitesand i want this one plumb empty except for you and me send him round to a store to buy a pennorth of peanuts  though not particularly enjoying the americans free and easy manner of speech kramenin was devoured by curiosity will your business take long to state  might be an all night job if you caught on  very good ivan i shall not require you again this evening go to the theatretake a night off  thank you your excellency  the secretary bowed and departed  julius stood at the door watching his retreat finally with a satisfied sigh he closed it and came back to his position in the centre of the room  now mr hersheimmer perhaps you will be so kind as to come to the point  i guess that wont take a minute drawled julius then with an abrupt change of manner hands upor i shoot  for a moment kramenin stared blindly into the big automatic then with almost comical haste he flung up his hands above his head in that instant julius had taken his measure the man he had to deal with was an abject physical cowardthe rest would be easy  this is an outrage cried the russian in a high hysterical voice an outrage do you mean to kill me  not if you keep your voice down dont go edging sideways towards that bell thats better  what do you want do nothing rashly remember my life is of the utmost value to my country i may have been maligned  i reckon said julius that the man who let daylight into you would be doing humanity a good turn but you neednt worry any im not proposing to kill you this tripthat is if youre reasonable  the russian quailed before the stern menace in the others eyes he passed his tongue over his dry lips  what do you want money  no i want jane finn  jane finn inever heard of her  youre a darned liar you know perfectly who i mean  i tell you ive never heard of the girl  and i tell you retorted julius that little willie here is just hopping mad to go off  the russian wilted visibly  you wouldnt dare  oh yes i would son  kramenin must have recognized something in the voice that carried conviction for he said sullenly  well granted i do know who you meanwhat of it  you will tell me nowright herewhere she is to be found  kramenin shook his head  i darent  why not  i darent you ask an impossibility  afraid eh of whom mr brown ah that tickles you up there is such a person then i doubted it and the mere mention of him scares you stiff  i have seen him said the russian slowly spoken to him face to face i did not know it until afterwards he was one of a crowd i should not know him again who is he really i do not know but i know thishe is a man to fear  hell never know said julius  he knows everythingand his vengeance is swift even ikrameninwould not be exempt  then you wont do as i ask you  you ask an impossibility  sure thats a pity for you said julius cheerfully but the world in general will benefit he raised the revolver  stop shrieked the russian you cannot mean to shoot me  of course i do ive always heard you revolutionists held life cheap but it seems theres a difference when its your own life in question i gave you just one chance of saving your dirty skin and that you wouldnt take  they would kill me  well said julius pleasantly its up to you but ill just say this little willie here is a dead cert and if i was you id take a sporting chance with mr brown  you will hang if you shoot me muttered the russian irresolutely  no stranger thats where youre wrong you forget the dollars a big crowd of solicitors will get busy and theyll get some highbrow doctors on the job and the end of it all will be that theyll say my brain was unhinged i shall spend a few months in a quiet sanatorium my mental health will improve the doctors will declare me sane again and all will end happily for little julius i guess i can bear a few months retirement in order to rid the world of you but dont you kid yourself ill hang for it  the russian believed him corrupt himself he believed implicitly in the power of money he had read of american murder trials running much on the lines indicated by julius he had bought and sold justice himself this virile young american with the significant drawling voice had the whip hand of him  im going to count five continued julius and i guess if you let me get past four you neednt worry any about mr brown maybe hell send some flowers to the funeral but you wont smell them are you ready ill begin onetwo threefour  the russian interrupted with a shriek  do not shoot i will do all you wish  julius lowered the revolver  i thought youd hear sense where is the girl  at gatehouse in kent astley priors the place is called  is she a prisoner there  shes not allowed to leave the housethough its safe enough really the little fool has lost her memory curse her  thats been annoying for you and your friends i reckon what about the other girl the one you decoyed away over a week ago  shes there too said the russian sullenly  thats good said julius isnt it all panning out beautifully and a lovely night for the run  what run demanded kramenin with a stare  down to gatehouse sure i hope youre fond of motoring  what do you mean i refuse to go  now dont get mad you must see im not such a kid as to leave you here youd ring up your friends on that telephone first thing ah he observed the fall on the others face you see youd got it all fixed no sir youre coming along with me this your bedroom next door here walk right in little willie and i will come behind put on a thick coat thats right fur lined and you a socialist now were ready we walk downstairs and out through the hall to where my cars waiting and dont you forget ive got you covered every inch of the way i can shoot just as well through my coat pocket one word or a glance even at one of those liveried menials and therell sure be a strange face in the sulphur and brimstone works  together they descended the stairs and passed out to the waiting car the russian was shaking with rage the hotel servants surrounded them a cry hovered on his lips but at the last minute his nerve failed him the american was a man of his word  when they reached the car julius breathed a sigh of relief the dangerzone was passed fear had successfully hypnotized the man by his side  get in he ordered then as he caught the others sidelong glance no the chauffeur wont help you any naval man was on a submarine in russia when the revolution broke out a brother of his was murdered by your people george  yes sir the chauffeur turned his head  this gentleman is a russian bolshevik we dont want to shoot him but it may be necessary you understand  perfectly sir  i want to go to gatehouse in kent know the road at all  yes sir it will be about an hour and a halfs run  make it an hour im in a hurry  ill do my best sir the car shot forward through the traffic  julius ensconced himself comfortably by the side of his victim he kept his hand in the pocket of his coat but his manner was urbane to the last degree  there was a man i shot once in arizona he began cheerfully  at the end of the hours run the unfortunate kramenin was more dead than alive in succession to the anecdote of the arizona man there had been a tough from frisco and an episode in the rockies juliuss narrative style if not strictly accurate was picturesque  slowing down the chauffeur called over his shoulder that they were just coming into gatehouse julius bade the russian direct them his plan was to drive straight up to the house there kramenin was to ask for the two girls julius explained to him that little willie would not be tolerant of failure kramenin by this time was as putty in the others hands the terrific pace they had come had still further unmanned him he had given himself up for dead at every corner  the car swept up the drive and stopped before the porch the chauffeur looked round for orders  turn the car first george then ring the bell and get back to your place keep the engine going and be ready to scoot like hell when i give the word  very good sir  the front door was opened by the butler kramenin felt the muzzle of the revolver pressed against his ribs  now hissed julius and be careful  the russian beckoned his lips were white and his voice was not very steady  it is ikramenin bring down the girl at once there is no time to lose  whittington had come down the steps he uttered an exclamation of astonishment at seeing the other  you whats up surely you know the plan  kramenin interrupted him using the words that have created many unnecessary panics  we have been betrayed plans must be abandoned we must save our own skins the girl and at once its our only chance  whittington hesitated but for hardly a moment  you have ordersfrom him  naturally should i be here otherwise hurry there is no time to be lost the other little fool had better come too  whittington turned and ran back into the house the agonizing minutes went by thentwo figures hastily huddled in cloaks appeared on the steps and were hustled into the car the smaller of the two was inclined to resist and whittington shoved her in unceremoniously julius leaned forward and in doing so the light from the open door lit up his face another man on the steps behind whittington gave a startled exclamation concealment was at an end  get a move on george shouted julius  the chauffeur slipped in his clutch and with a bound the car started  the man on the steps uttered an oath his hand went to his pocket there was a flash and a report the bullet just missed the taller girl by an inch  get down jane cried julius flat on the bottom of the car he thrust her sharply forward then standing up he took careful aim and fired  have you hit him cried tuppence eagerly  sure replied julius he isnt killed though skunks like that take a lot of killing are you all right tuppence  of course i am wheres tommy and whos this she indicated the shivering kramenin  tommys making tracks for the argentine i guess he thought youd turned up your toes steady through the gate george thats right itll take em at least five minutes to get busy after us theyll use the telephone i guess so look out for snares aheadand dont take the direct route whos this did you say tuppence let me present monsieur kramenin i persuaded him to come on the trip for his health  the russian remained mute still livid with terror  but what made them let us go demanded tuppence suspiciously  i reckon monsieur kramenin here asked them so prettily they just couldnt refuse  this was too much for the russian he burst out vehemently  curse youcurse you they know now that i betrayed them my life wont be safe for an hour in this country  thats so assented julius id advise you to make tracks for russia right away  let me go then cried the other i have done what you asked why do you still keep me with you  not for the pleasure of your company i guess you can get right off now if you want to i thought youd rather i tooled you back to london  you may never reach london snarled the other let me go here and now  sure thing pull up george the gentlemans not making the return trip if i ever come to russia monsieur kramenin i shall expect a rousing welcome and  but before julius had finished his speech and before the car had finally halted the russian had swung himself out and disappeared into the night  just a mite impatient to leave us commented julius as the car gathered way again and no idea of saying goodbye politely to the ladies say jane you can get up on the seat now  for the first time the girl spoke  how did you persuade him she asked  julius tapped his revolver  little willie here takes the credit  splendid cried the girl the colour surged into her face her eyes looked admiringly at julius  annette and i didnt know what was going to happen to us said tuppence old whittington hurried us off we thought it was lambs to the slaughter  annette said julius is that what you call her  his mind seemed to be trying to adjust itself to a new idea  its her name said tuppence opening her eyes very wide  shucks retorted julius she may think its her name because her memorys gone poor kid but its the one real and original jane finn weve got here  what cried tuppence  but she was interrupted with an angry spurt a bullet embedded itself in the upholstery of the car just behind her head  down with you cried julius its an ambush these guys have got busy pretty quickly push her a bit george  the car fairly leapt forward three more shots rang out but went happily wide julius upright leant over the back of the car  nothing to shoot at he announced gloomily but i guess therell be another little picnic soon ah  he raised his hand to his cheek  you are hurt said annette quickly  only a scratch  the girl sprang to her feet  let me out let me out i say stop the car it is me theyre after im the one they want you shall not lose your lives because of me let me go she was fumbling with the fastenings of the door  julius took her by both arms and looked at her she had spoken with no trace of foreign accent  sit down kid he said gently i guess theres nothing wrong with your memory been fooling them all the time eh  the girl looked at him nodded and then suddenly burst into tears julius patted her on the shoulder  there therejust you sit tight were not going to let you quit  through her sobs the girl said indistinctly  youre from home i can tell by your voice it makes me homesick  sure im from home im your cousinjulius hersheimmer i came over to europe on purpose to find youand a pretty dance youve led me  the car slackened speed george spoke over his shoulder  crossroads here sir im not sure of the way  the car slowed down till it hardly moved as it did so a figure climbed suddenly over the back and plunged head first into the midst of them  sorry said tommy extricating himself  a mass of confused exclamations greeted him he replied to them severally  was in the bushes by the drive hung on behind couldnt let you know before at the pace you were going it was all i could do to hang on now then you girls get out  get out  yes theres a station just up that road train due in three minutes youll catch it if you hurry  what the devil are you driving at demanded julius do you think you can fool them by leaving the car  you and i arent going to leave the car only the girls  youre crazed beresford stark staring mad you cant let those girls go off alone itll be the end of it if you do  tommy turned to tuppence  get out at once tuppence take her with you and do just as i say no one will do you any harm youre safe take the train to london go straight to sir james peel edgerton mr carter lives out of town but youll be safe with him  darn you cried julius youre mad jane you stay where you are  with a sudden swift movement tommy snatched the revolver from juliuss hand and levelled it at him  now will you believe im in earnest get out both of you and do as i sayor ill shoot  tuppence sprang out dragging the unwilling jane after her  come on its all right if tommys surehes sure be quick well miss the train  they started running  juliuss pentup rage burst forth  what the hell  tommy interrupted him  dry up i want a few words with you mr julius hersheimmer    chapter xxv janes story  her arm through janes dragging her along tuppence reached the station her quick ears caught the sound of the approaching train  hurry up she panted or well miss it  they arrived on the platform just as the train came to a standstill tuppence opened the door of an empty firstclass compartment and the two girls sank down breathless on the padded seats  a man looked in then passed on to the next carriage jane started nervously her eyes dilated with terror she looked questioningly at tuppence  is he one of them do you think she breathed  tuppence shook her head  no no its all right she took janes hand in hers tommy wouldnt have told us to do this unless he was sure wed be all right  but he doesnt know them as i do the girl shivered you cant understand five years five long years sometimes i thought i should go mad  never mind its all over  is it  the train was moving now speeding through the night at a gradually increasing rate suddenly jane finn started up  what was that i thought i saw a facelooking in through the window  no theres nothing see tuppence went to the window and lifting the strap let the pane down  youre sure  quite sure  the other seemed to feel some excuse was necessary  i guess im acting like a frightened rabbit but i cant help it if they caught me now theyd her eyes opened wide and staring  dont implored tuppence lie back and dont think you can be quite sure that tommy wouldnt have said it was safe if it wasnt  my cousin didnt think so he didnt want us to do this  no said tuppence rather embarrassed  what are you thinking of said jane sharply  why  your voice was soqueer  i was thinking of something confessed tuppence but i dont want to tell younot now i may be wrong but i dont think so its just an idea that came into my head a long time ago tommys got it tooim almost sure he has but dont you worrytherell be time enough for that later and it maynt be so at all do what i tell youlie back and dont think of anything  ill try the long lashes drooped over the hazel eyes  tuppence for her part sat bolt uprightmuch in the attitude of a watchful terrier on guard in spite of herself she was nervous her eyes flashed continually from one window to the other she noted the exact position of the communication cord what it was that she feared she would have been hard put to it to say but in her own mind she was far from feeling the confidence displayed in her words not that she disbelieved in tommy but occasionally she was shaken with doubts as to whether anyone so simple and honest as he was could ever be a match for the fiendish subtlety of the archcriminal  if they once reached sir james peel edgerton in safety all would be well but would they reach him would not the silent forces of mr brown already be assembling against them even that last picture of tommy revolver in hand failed to comfort her by now he might be overpowered borne down by sheer force of numbers tuppence mapped out her plan of campaign  as the train at length drew slowly into charing cross jane finn sat up with a start  have we arrived i never thought we should  oh i thought wed get to london all right if theres going to be any fun now is when it will begin quick get out well nip into a taxi  in another minute they were passing the barrier had paid the necessary fares and were stepping into a taxi  kings cross directed tuppence then she gave a jump a man looked in at the window just as they started she was almost certain it was the same man who had got into the carriage next to them she had a horrible feeling of being slowly hemmed in on every side  you see she explained to jane if they think were going to sir james this will put them off the scent now theyll imagine were going to mr carter his country place is north of london somewhere  crossing holborn there was a block and the taxi was held up this was what tuppence had been waiting for  quick she whispered open the righthand door  the two girls stepped out into the traffic two minutes later they were seated in another taxi and were retracing their steps this time direct to carlton house terrace  there said tuppence with great satisfaction this ought to do them i cant help thinking that im really rather clever how that other taxi man will swear but i took his number and ill send him a postal order tomorrow so that he wont lose by it if he happens to be genuine whats this thing swervingoh  there was a grinding noise and a bump another taxi had collided with them  in a flash tuppence was out on the pavement a policeman was approaching before he arrived tuppence had handed the driver five shillings and she and jane had merged themselves in the crowd  its only a step or two now said tuppence breathlessly the accident had taken place in trafalgar square  do you think the collision was an accident or done deliberately  i dont know it might have been either  handinhand the two girls hurried along  it may be my fancy said tuppence suddenly but i feel as though there was some one behind us  hurry murmured the other oh hurry  they were now at the corner of carlton house terrace and their spirits lightened suddenly a large and apparently intoxicated man barred their way  good evening ladies he hiccupped whither away so fast  let us pass please said tuppence imperiously  just a word with your pretty friend here he stretched out an unsteady hand and clutched jane by the shoulder tuppence heard other footsteps behind she did not pause to ascertain whether they were friends or foes lowering her head she repeated a manoeuvre of childish days and butted their aggressor full in the capacious middle the success of these unsportsmanlike tactics was immediate the man sat down abruptly on the pavement tuppence and jane took to their heels the house they sought was some way down other footsteps echoed behind them their breath was coming in choking gasps as they reached sir jamess door tuppence seized the bell and jane the knocker  the man who had stopped them reached the foot of the steps for a moment he hesitated and as he did so the door opened they fell into the hall together sir james came forward from the library door  hullo whats this  he stepped forward and put his arm round jane as she swayed uncertainly he half carried her into the library and laid her on the leather couch from a tantalus on the table he poured out a few drops of brandy and forced her to drink them with a sigh she sat up her eyes still wild and frightened  its all right dont be afraid my child youre quite safe  her breath came more normally and the colour was returning to her cheeks sir james looked at tuppence quizzically  so youre not dead miss tuppence any more than that tommy boy of yours was  the young adventurers take a lot of killing boasted tuppence  so it seems said sir james dryly am i right in thinking that the joint venture has ended in success and that thishe turned to the girl on the couchis miss jane finn  jane sat up  yes she said quietly i am jane finn i have a lot to tell you  when you are stronger  nonow her voice rose a little i shall feel safer when i have told everything  as you please said the lawyer  he sat down in one of the big armchairs facing the couch in a low voice jane began her story  i came over on the lusitania to take up a post in paris i was fearfully keen about the war and just dying to help somehow or other i had been studying french and my teacher said they were wanting help in a hospital in paris so i wrote and offered my services and they were accepted i hadnt got any folk of my own so it made it easy to arrange things  when the lusitania was torpedoed a man came up to me id noticed him more than onceand id figured it out in my own mind that he was afraid of somebody or something he asked me if i was a patriotic american and told me he was carrying papers which were just life or death to the allies he asked me to take charge of them i was to watch for an advertisement in the times if it didnt appear i was to take them to the american ambassador  most of what followed seems like a nightmare still i see it in my dreams sometimes ill hurry over that part mr danvers had told me to watch out he might have been shadowed from new york but he didnt think so at first i had no suspicions but on the boat to holyhead i began to get uneasy there was one woman who had been very keen to look after me and chum up with me generallya mrs vandemeyer at first id been only grateful to her for being so kind to me but all the time i felt there was something about her i didnt like and on the irish boat i saw her talking to some queerlooking men and from the way they looked i saw that they were talking about me i remembered that shed been quite near me on the lusitania when mr danvers gave me the packet and before that shed tried to talk to him once or twice i began to get scared but i didnt quite see what to do  i had a wild idea of stopping at holyhead and not going on to london that day but i soon saw that that would be plumb foolishness the only thing was to act as though id noticed nothing and hope for the best i couldnt see how they could get me if i was on my guard one thing id done already as a precautionripped open the oilskin packet and substituted blank paper and then sewn it up again so if anyone did manage to rob me of it it wouldnt matter  what to do with the real thing worried me no end finally i opened it out flatthere were only two sheetsand laid it between two of the advertisement pages of a magazine i stuck the two pages together round the edge with some gum off an envelope i carried the magazine carelessly stuffed into the pocket of my ulster  at holyhead i tried to get into a carriage with people that looked all right but in a queer way there seemed always to be a crowd round me shoving and pushing me just the way i didnt want to go there was something uncanny and frightening about it in the end i found myself in a carriage with mrs vandemeyer after all i went out into the corridor but all the other carriages were full so i had to go back and sit down i consoled myself with the thought that there were other people in the carriagethere was quite a nicelooking man and his wife sitting just opposite so i felt almost happy about it until just outside london i had leaned back and closed my eyes i guess they thought i was asleep but my eyes werent quite shut and suddenly i saw the nicelooking man get something out of his bag and hand it to mrs vandemeyer and as he did so he winked  i cant tell you how that wink sort of froze me through and through my only thought was to get out in the corridor as quick as ever i could i got up trying to look natural and easy perhaps they saw somethingi dont knowbut suddenly mrs vandemeyer said now and flung something over my nose and mouth as i tried to scream at the same moment i felt a terrific blow on the back of my head  she shuddered sir james murmured something sympathetically in a minute she resumed  i dont know how long it was before i came back to consciousness i felt very ill and sick i was lying on a dirty bed there was a screen round it but i could hear two people talking in the room mrs vandemeyer was one of them i tried to listen but at first i couldnt take much in when at last i did begin to grasp what was going oni was just terrified i wonder i didnt scream right out there and then  they hadnt found the papers theyd got the oilskin packet with the blanks and they were just mad they didnt know whether id changed the papers or whether danvers had been carrying a dummy message while the real one was sent another way they spoke ofshe closed her eyestorturing me to find out  id never known what fearreally sickening fearwas before once they came to look at me i shut my eyes and pretended to be still unconscious but i was afraid theyd hear the beating of my heart however they went away again i began thinking madly what could i do i knew i wouldnt be able to stand up against torture very long  suddenly something put the thought of loss of memory into my head the subject had always interested me and id read an awful lot about it i had the whole thing at my fingertips if only i could succeed in carrying the bluff through it might save me i said a prayer and drew a long breath then i opened my eyes and started babbling in french  mrs vandemeyer came round the screen at once her face was so wicked i nearly died but i smiled up at her doubtfully and asked her in french where i was  it puzzled her i could see she called the man she had been talking to he stood by the screen with his face in shadow he spoke to me in french his voice was very ordinary and quiet but somehow i dont know why he scared me worse than the woman i felt hed seen right through me but i went on playing my part i asked again where i was and then went on that there was something i must remembermust rememberonly for the moment it was all gone i worked myself up to be more and more distressed he asked me my name i said i didnt knowthat i couldnt remember anything at all  suddenly he caught my wrist and began twisting it the pain was awful i screamed he went on i screamed and screamed but i managed to shriek out things in french i dont know how long i could have gone on but luckily i fainted the last thing i heard was his voice saying thats not bluff anyway a kid of her age wouldnt know enough i guess he forgot american girls are older for their age than english ones and take more interest in scientific subjects  when i came to mrs vandemeyer was sweet as honey to me shed had her orders i guess she spoke to me in frenchtold me id had a shock and been very ill i should be better soon i pretended to be rather dazedmurmured something about the doctor having hurt my wrist she looked relieved when i said that  by and by she went out of the room altogether i was suspicious still and lay quite quiet for some time in the end however i got up and walked round the room examining it i thought that even if anyone was watching me from somewhere it would seem natural enough under the circumstances it was a squalid dirty place there were no windows which seemed queer i guessed the door would be locked but i didnt try it there were some battered old pictures on the walls representing scenes from faust  janes two listeners gave a simultaneous ah the girl nodded  yesit was the place in soho where mr beresford was imprisoned of course at the time i didnt even know if i was in london one thing was worrying me dreadfully but my heart gave a great throb of relief when i saw my ulster lying carelessly over the back of a chair and the magazine was still rolled up in the pocket  if only i could be certain that i was not being overlooked i looked carefully round the walls there didnt seem to be a peephole of any kindnevertheless i felt kind of sure there must be all of a sudden i sat down on the edge of the table and put my face in my hands sobbing out a mon dieu mon dieu ive got very sharp ears i distinctly heard the rustle of a dress and slight creak that was enough for me i was being watched  i lay down on the bed again and by and by mrs vandemeyer brought me some supper she was still sweet as they make them i guess shed been told to win my confidence presently she produced the oilskin packet and asked me if i recognized it watching me like a lynx all the time  i took it and turned it over in a puzzled sort of way then i shook my head i said that i felt i ought to remember something about it that it was just as though it was all coming back and then before i could get hold of it it went again then she told me that i was her niece and that i was to call her aunt rita i did obediently and she told me not to worrymy memory would soon come back  that was an awful night id made my plan whilst i was waiting for her the papers were safe so far but i couldnt take the risk of leaving them there any longer they might throw that magazine away any minute i lay awake waiting until i judged it must be about two oclock in the morning then i got up as softly as i could and felt in the dark along the lefthand wall very gently i unhooked one of the pictures from its nailmarguerite with her casket of jewels i crept over to my coat and took out the magazine and an odd envelope or two that i had shoved in then i went to the washstand and damped the brown paper at the back of the picture all round presently i was able to pull it away i had already torn out the two stucktogether pages from the magazine and now i slipped them with their precious enclosure between the picture and its brown paper backing a little gum from the envelopes helped me to stick the latter up again no one would dream the picture had ever been tampered with i rehung it on the wall put the magazine back in my coat pocket and crept back to bed i was pleased with my hidingplace theyd never think of pulling to pieces one of their own pictures i hoped that theyd come to the conclusion that danvers had been carrying a dummy all along and that in the end theyd let me go  as a matter of fact i guess thats what they did think at first and in a way it was dangerous for me i learnt afterwards that they nearly did away with me then and therethere was never much chance of their letting me gobut the first man who was the boss preferred to keep me alive on the chance of my having hidden them and being able to tell where if i recovered my memory they watched me constantly for weeks sometimes theyd ask me questions by the houri guess there was nothing they didnt know about the third degreebut somehow i managed to hold my own the strain of it was awful though  they took me back to ireland and over every step of the journey again in case id hidden it somewhere en route mrs vandemeyer and another woman never left me for a moment they spoke of me as a young relative of mrs vandemeyers whose mind was affected by the shock of the lusitania there was no one i could appeal to for help without giving myself away to them and if i risked it and failedand mrs vandemeyer looked so rich and so beautifully dressed that i felt convinced theyd take her word against mine and think it was part of my mental trouble to think myself persecutedi felt that the horrors in store for me would be too awful once they knew id been only shamming  sir james nodded comprehendingly  mrs vandemeyer was a woman of great personality with that and her social position she would have had little difficulty in imposing her point of view in preference to yours your sensational accusations against her would not easily have found credence  thats what i thought it ended in my being sent to a sanatorium at bournemouth i couldnt make up my mind at first whether it was a sham affair or genuine a hospital nurse had charge of me i was a special patient she seemed so nice and normal that at last i determined to confide in her a merciful providence just saved me in time from falling into the trap my door happened to be ajar and i heard her talking to some one in the passage she was one of them they still fancied it might be a bluff on my part and she was put in charge of me to make sure after that my nerve went completely i dared trust nobody  i think i almost hypnotized myself after a while i almost forgot that i was really jane finn i was so bent on playing the part of janet vandemeyer that my nerves began to play me tricks i became really illfor months i sank into a sort of stupor i felt sure i should die soon and that nothing really mattered a sane person shut up in a lunatic asylum often ends by becoming insane they say i guess i was like that playing my part had become second nature to me i wasnt even unhappy in the endjust apathetic nothing seemed to matter and the years went on  and then suddenly things seemed to change mrs vandemeyer came down from london she and the doctor asked me questions experimented with various treatments there was some talk of sending me to a specialist in paris in the end they did not dare risk it i overheard something that seemed to show that other peoplefriendswere looking for me i learnt later that the nurse who had looked after me went to paris and consulted a specialist representing herself to be me he put her through some searching tests and exposed her loss of memory to be fraudulent but she had taken a note of his methods and reproduced them on me i dare say i couldnt have deceived the specialist for a minutea man who has made a lifelong study of a thing is uniquebut i managed once again to hold my own with them the fact that id not thought of myself as jane finn for so long made it easier  one night i was whisked off to london at a moments notice they took me back to the house in soho once i got away from the sanatorium i felt differentas though something in me that had been buried for a long time was waking up again  they sent me in to wait on mr beresford of course i didnt know his name then i was suspiciousi thought it was another trap but he looked so honest i could hardly believe it however i was careful in all i said for i knew we could be overheard theres a small hole high up in the wall  but on the sunday afternoon a message was brought to the house they were all very disturbed without their knowing i listened word had come that he was to be killed i neednt tell the next part because you know it i thought id have time to rush up and get the papers from their hidingplace but i was caught so i screamed out that he was escaping and i said i wanted to go back to marguerite i shouted the name three times very loud i knew the others would think i meant mrs vandemeyer but i hoped it might make mr beresford think of the picture hed unhooked one the first daythats what made me hesitate to trust him  she paused  then the papers said sir james slowly are still at the back of the picture in that room  yes the girl had sunk back on the sofa exhausted with the strain of the long story  sir james rose to his feet he looked at his watch  come he said we must go at once  tonight queried tuppence surprised  tomorrow may be too late said sir james gravely besides by going tonight we have the chance of capturing that great man and supercriminalmr brown  there was dead silence and sir james continued  you have been followed herenot a doubt of it when we leave the house we shall be followed again but not molested for it is mr browns plan that we are to lead him but the soho house is under police supervision night and day there are several men watching it when we enter that house mr brown will not draw backhe will risk all on the chance of obtaining the spark to fire his mine and he fancies the risk not greatsince he will enter in the guise of a friend  tuppence flushed then opened her mouth impulsively  but theres something you dont knowthat we havent told you her eyes dwelt on jane in perplexity  what is that asked the other sharply no hesitations miss tuppence we need to be sure of our going  but tuppence for once seemed tonguetied  its so difficultyou see if im wrongoh it would be dreadful she made a grimace at the unconscious jane never forgive me she observed cryptically  you want me to help you out eh  yes please you know who mr brown is dont you  yes said sir james gravely at last i do  at last queried tuppence doubtfully oh but i thought she paused  you thought correctly miss tuppence i have been morally certain of his identity for some timeever since the night of mrs vandemeyers mysterious death  ah breathed tuppence  for there we are up against the logic of facts there are only two solutions either the chloral was administered by her own hand which theory i reject utterly or else  yes  or else it was administered in the brandy you gave her only three people touched that brandyyou miss tuppence i myself and one othermr julius hersheimmer  jane finn stirred and sat up regarding the speaker with wide astonished eyes  at first the thing seemed utterly impossible mr hersheimmer as the son of a prominent millionaire was a wellknown figure in america it seemed utterly impossible that he and mr brown could be one and the same but you cannot escape from the logic of facts since the thing was soit must be accepted remember mrs vandemeyers sudden and inexplicable agitation another proof if proof was needed  i took an early opportunity of giving you a hint from some words of mr hersheimmers at manchester i gathered that you had understood and acted on that hint then i set to work to prove the impossible possible mr beresford rang me up and told me what i had already suspected that the photograph of miss jane finn had never really been out of mr hersheimmers possession  but the girl interrupted springing to her feet she cried out angrily  what do you mean what are you trying to suggest that mr brown is julius juliusmy own cousin  no miss finn said sir james unexpectedly not your cousin the man who calls himself julius hersheimmer is no relation to you whatsoever    chapter xxvi mr brown  sir jamess words came like a bombshell both girls looked equally puzzled the lawyer went across to his desk and returned with a small newspaper cutting which he handed to jane tuppence read it over her shoulder mr carter would have recognized it it referred to the mysterious man found dead in new york  as i was saying to miss tuppence resumed the lawyer i set to work to prove the impossible possible the great stumblingblock was the undeniable fact that julius hersheimmer was not an assumed name when i came across this paragraph my problem was solved julius hersheimmer set out to discover what had become of his cousin he went out west where he obtained news of her and her photograph to aid him in his search on the eve of his departure from new york he was set upon and murdered his body was dressed in shabby clothes and the face disfigured to prevent identification mr brown took his place he sailed immediately for england none of the real hersheimmers friends or intimates saw him before he sailedthough indeed it would hardly have mattered if they had the impersonation was so perfect since then he had been hand and glove with those sworn to hunt him down every secret of theirs has been known to him only once did he come near disaster mrs vandemeyer knew his secret it was no part of his plan that that huge bribe should ever be offered to her but for miss tuppences fortunate change of plan she would have been far away from the flat when we arrived there exposure stared him in the face he took a desperate step trusting in his assumed character to avert suspicion he nearly succeededbut not quite  i cant believe it murmured jane he seemed so splendid  the real julius hersheimmer was a splendid fellow and mr brown is a consummate actor but ask miss tuppence if she also has not had her suspicions  jane turned mutely to tuppence the latter nodded  i didnt want to say it janei knew it would hurt you and after all i couldnt be sure i still dont understand why if hes mr brown he rescued us  was it julius hersheimmer who helped you to escape  tuppence recounted to sir james the exciting events of the evening ending up but i cant see why  cant you i can so can young beresford by his actions as a last hope jane finn was to be allowed to escapeand the escape must be managed so that she harbours no suspicions of its being a putup job theyre not averse to young beresfords being in the neighbourhood and if necessary communicating with you theyll take care to get him out of the way at the right minute then julius hersheimmer dashes up and rescues you in true melodramatic style bullets flybut dont hit anybody what would have happened next you would have driven straight to the house in soho and secured the document which miss finn would probably have entrusted to her cousins keeping or if he conducted the search he would have pretended to find the hidingplace already rifled he would have had a dozen ways of dealing with the situation but the result would have been the same and i rather fancy some accident would have happened to both of you you see you know rather an inconvenient amount thats a rough outline i admit i was caught napping but somebody else wasnt  tommy said tuppence softly  yes evidently when the right moment came to get rid of himhe was too sharp for them all the same im not too easy in my mind about him  why  because julius hersheimmer is mr brown said sir james dryly and it takes more than one man and a revolver to hold up mr brown  tuppence paled a little  what can we do  nothing until weve been to the house in soho if beresford has still got the upper hand theres nothing to fear if otherwise our enemy will come to find us and he will not find us unprepared from a drawer in the desk he took a service revolver and placed it in his coat pocket  now were ready i know better than even to suggest going without you miss tuppence  i should think so indeed  but i do suggest that miss finn should remain here she will be perfectly safe and i am afraid she is absolutely worn out with all she has been through  but to tuppences surprise jane shook her head  no i guess im going too those papers were my trust i must go through with this business to the end im heaps better now anyway  sir jamess car was ordered round during the short drive tuppences heart beat tumultuously in spite of momentary qualms of uneasiness respecting tommy she could not but feel exultation they were going to win  the car drew up at the corner of the square and they got out sir james went up to a plainclothes man who was on duty with several others and spoke to him then he rejoined the girls  no one has gone into the house so far it is being watched at the back as well so they are quite sure of that anyone who attempts to enter after we have done so will be arrested immediately shall we go in  a policeman produced a key they all knew sir james well they had also had orders respecting tuppence only the third member of the party was unknown to them the three entered the house pulling the door to behind them slowly they mounted the rickety stairs at the top was the ragged curtain hiding the recess where tommy had hidden that day tuppence had heard the story from jane in her character of annette she looked at the tattered velvet with interest even now she could almost swear it movedas though some one was behind it so strong was the illusion that she almost fancied she could make out the outline of a form supposing mr brownjuliuswas there waiting  impossible of course yet she almost went back to put the curtain aside and make sure  now they were entering the prison room no place for anyone to hide here thought tuppence with a sigh of relief then chided herself indignantly she must not give way to this foolish fancyingthis curious insistent feeling that mr brown was in the house hark what was that a stealthy footstep on the stairs there was some one in the house absurd she was becoming hysterical  jane had gone straight to the picture of marguerite she unhooked it with a steady hand the dust lay thick upon it and festoons of cobwebs lay between it and the wall sir james handed her a pocketknife and she ripped away the brown paper from the back the advertisement page of a magazine fell out jane picked it up holding apart the frayed inner edges she extracted two thin sheets covered with writing  no dummy this time the real thing  weve got it said tuppence at last  the moment was almost breathless in its emotion forgotten the faint creakings the imagined noises of a minute ago none of them had eyes for anything but what jane held in her hand  sir james took it and scrutinized it attentively  yes he said quietly this is the illfated draft treaty  weve succeeded said tuppence there was awe and an almost wondering unbelief in her voice  sir james echoed her words as he folded the paper carefully and put it away in his pocketbook then he looked curiously round the dingy room  it was here that our young friend was confined for so long was it not he said a truly sinister room you notice the absence of windows and the thickness of the closefitting door whatever took place here would never be heard by the outside world  tuppence shivered his words woke a vague alarm in her what if there was some one concealed in the house some one who might bar that door on them and leave them to die like rats in a trap then she realized the absurdity of her thought the house was surrounded by police who if they failed to reappear would not hesitate to break in and make a thorough search she smiled at her own foolishnessthen looked up with a start to find sir james watching her he gave her an emphatic little nod  quite right miss tuppence you scent danger so do i so does miss finn  yes admitted jane its absurdbut i cant help it  sir james nodded again  you feelas we all feelthe presence of mr brown yesas tuppence made a movementnot a doubt of itmr brown is here  in this house  in this room you dont understand i am mr brown  stupefied unbelieving they stared at him the very lines of his face had changed it was a different man who stood before them he smiled a slow cruel smile  neither of you will leave this room alive you said just now we had succeeded i have succeeded the draft treaty is mine his smile grew wider as he looked at tuppence shall i tell you how it will be sooner or later the police will break in and they will find three victims of mr brownthree not two you understand but fortunately the third will not be dead only wounded and will be able to describe the attack with a wealth of detail the treaty it is in the hands of mr brown so no one will think of searching the pockets of sir james peel edgerton  he turned to jane  you outwitted me i make my acknowledgments but you will not do it again  there was a faint sound behind him but intoxicated with success he did not turn his head  he slipped his hand into his pocket  checkmate to the young adventurers he said and slowly raised the big automatic  but even as he did so he felt himself seized from behind in a grip of iron the revolver was wrenched from his hand and the voice of julius hersheimmer said drawlingly  i guess youre caught redhanded with the goods upon you  the blood rushed to the kcs face but his selfcontrol was marvellous as he looked from one to the other of his two captors he looked longest at tommy  you he said beneath his breath you i might have known  seeing that he was disposed to offer no resistance their grip slackened quick as a flash his left hand the hand which bore the big signet ring was raised to his lips  ave caesar te morituri salutant he said still looking at tommy  then his face changed and with a long convulsive shudder he fell forward in a crumpled heap whilst an odour of bitter almonds filled the air    chapter xxvii a supper party at the savoy  the supper party given by mr julius hersheimmer to a few friends on the evening of the 30th will long be remembered in catering circles it took place in a private room and mr hersheimmers orders were brief and forcible he gave carte blancheand when a millionaire gives carte blanche he usually gets it  every delicacy out of season was duly provided waiters carried bottles of ancient and royal vintage with loving care the floral decorations defied the seasons and fruits of the earth as far apart as may and november found themselves miraculously side by side the list of guests was small and select the american ambassador mr carter who had taken the liberty he said of bringing an old friend sir william beresford with him archdeacon cowley dr hall those two youthful adventurers miss prudence cowley and mr thomas beresford and last but not least as guest of honour miss jane finn  julius had spared no pains to make janes appearance a success a mysterious knock had brought tuppence to the door of the apartment she was sharing with the american girl it was julius in his hand he held a cheque  say tuppence he began will you do me a good turn take this and get jane regularly togged up for this evening youre all coming to supper with me at the savoy see spare no expense you get me  sure thing mimicked tuppence we shall enjoy ourselves it will be a pleasure dressing jane shes the loveliest thing ive ever seen  thats so agreed mr hersheimmer fervently  his fervour brought a momentary twinkle to tuppences eye  by the way julius she remarked demurely ihavent given you my answer yet  answer said julius his face paled  you knowwhen you asked me tomarry you faltered tuppence her eyes downcast in the true manner of the early victorian heroine and wouldnt take no for an answer ive thought it well over  yes said julius the perspiration stood on his forehead  tuppence relented suddenly  you great idiot she said what on earth induced you to do it i could see at the time you didnt care a twopenny dip for me  not at all i hadand still havethe highest sentiments of esteem and respectand admiration for you  hm said tuppence those are the kind of sentiments that very soon go to the wall when the other sentiment comes along dont they old thing  i dont know what you mean said julius stiffly but a large and burning blush overspread his countenance  shucks retorted tuppence she laughed and closed the door reopening it to add with dignity morally i shall always consider i have been jilted  what was it asked jane as tuppence rejoined her  julius  what did he want  really i think he wanted to see you but i wasnt going to let him not until tonight when youre going to burst upon every one like king solomon in his glory come on were going to shop  to most people the 29th the muchheralded labour day had passed much as any other day speeches were made in the park and trafalgar square straggling processions singing the red flag wandered through the streets in a more or less aimless manner newspapers which had hinted at a general strike and the inauguration of a reign of terror were forced to hide their diminished heads the bolder and more astute among them sought to prove that peace had been effected by following their counsels in the sunday papers a brief notice of the sudden death of sir james peel edgerton the famous kc had appeared mondays paper dealt appreciatively with the dead mans career the exact manner of his sudden death was never made public  tommy had been right in his forecast of the situation it had been a oneman show deprived of their chief the organization fell to pieces kramenin had made a precipitate return to russia leaving england early on sunday morning the gang had fled from astley priors in a panic leaving behind in their haste various damaging documents which compromised them hopelessly with these proofs of conspiracy in their hands aided further by a small brown diary taken from the pocket of the dead man which had contained a full and damning resume of the whole plot the government had called an eleventhhour conference the labour leaders were forced to recognize that they had been used as a cats paw certain concessions were made by the government and were eagerly accepted it was to be peace not war  but the cabinet knew by how narrow a margin they had escaped utter disaster and burnt in on mr carters brain was the strange scene which had taken place in the house in soho the night before  he had entered the squalid room to find that great man the friend of a lifetime deadbetrayed out of his own mouth from the dead mans pocketbook he had retrieved the illomened draft treaty and then and there in the presence of the other three it had been reduced to ashes england was saved  and now on the evening of the 30th in a private room at the savoy mr julius p hersheimmer was receiving his guests  mr carter was the first to arrive with him was a cholericlooking old gentleman at sight of whom tommy flushed up to the roots of his hair he came forward  ha said the old gentleman surveying him apoplectically so youre my nephew are you not much to look atbut youve done good work it seems your mother must have brought you up well after all shall we let bygones be bygones eh youre my heir you know and in future i propose to make you an allowanceand you can look upon chalmers park as your home  thank you sir its awfully decent of you  wheres this young lady ive been hearing such a lot about  tommy introduced tuppence  ha said sir william eyeing her girls arent what they used to be in my young days  yes they are said tuppence their clothes are different perhaps but they themselves are just the same  well perhaps youre right minxes thenminxes now  thats it said tuppence im a frightful minx myself  i believe you said the old gentleman chuckling and pinched her ear in high goodhumour most young women were terrified of the old bear as they termed him tuppences pertness delighted the old misogynist  then came the timid archdeacon a little bewildered by the company in which he found himself glad that his daughter was considered to have distinguished herself but unable to help glancing at her from time to time with nervous apprehension but tuppence behaved admirably she forbore to cross her legs set a guard upon her tongue and steadfastly refused to smoke  dr hall came next and he was followed by the american ambassador  we might as well sit down said julius when he had introduced all his guests to each other tuppence will you  he indicated the place of honour with a wave of his hand  but tuppence shook her head  nothats janes place when one thinks of how shes held out all these years she ought to be made the queen of the feast tonight  julius flung her a grateful glance and jane came forward shyly to the allotted seat beautiful as she had seemed before it was as nothing to the loveliness that now went fully adorned tuppence had performed her part faithfully the model gown supplied by a famous dressmaker had been entitled a tiger lily it was all golds and reds and browns and out of it rose the pure column of the girls white throat and the bronze masses of hair that crowned her lovely head there was admiration in every eye as she took her seat  soon the supper party was in full swing and with one accord tommy was called upon for a full and complete explanation  youve been too darned close about the whole business julius accused him you let on to me that you were off to the argentinethough i guess you had your reasons for that the idea of both you and tuppence casting me for the part of mr brown just tickles me to death  the idea was not original to them said mr carter gravely it was suggested and the poison very carefully instilled by a pastmaster in the art the paragraph in the new york paper suggested the plan to him and by means of it he wove a web that nearly enmeshed you fatally  i never liked him said julius i felt from the first that there was something wrong about him and i always suspected that it was he who silenced mrs vandemeyer so appositely but it wasnt till i heard that the order for tommys execution came right on the heels of our interview with him that sunday that i began to tumble to the fact that he was the big bug himself  i never suspected it at all lamented tuppence ive always thought i was so much cleverer than tommybut hes undoubtedly scored over me handsomely  julius agreed  tommys been the goods this trip and instead of sitting there as dumb as a fish let him banish his blushes and tell us all about it  hear hear  theres nothing to tell said tommy acutely uncomfortable i was an awful mugright up to the time i found that photograph of annette and realized that she was jane finn then i remembered how persistently she had shouted out that word margueriteand i thought of the pictures andwell thats that then of course i went over the whole thing to see where id made an ass of myself  go on said mr carter as tommy showed signs of taking refuge in silence once more  that business about mrs vandemeyer had worried me when julius told me about it on the face of it it seemed that he or sir james must have done the trick but i didnt know which finding that photograph in the drawer after that story of how it had been got from him by inspector brown made me suspect julius then i remembered that it was sir james who had discovered the false jane finn in the end i couldnt make up my mindand just decided to take no chances either way i left a note for julius in case he was mr brown saying i was off to the argentine and i dropped sir jamess letter with the offer of the job by the desk so that he would see it was a genuine stunt then i wrote my letter to mr carter and rang up sir james taking him into my confidence would be the best thing either way so i told him everything except where i believed the papers to be hidden the way he helped me to get on the track of tuppence and annette almost disarmed me but not quite i kept my mind open between the two of them and then i got a bogus note from tuppenceand i knew  but how  tommy took the note in question from his pocket and passed it round the table  its her handwriting all right but i knew it wasnt from her because of the signature shed never spell her name twopence but anyone whod never seen it written might quite easily do so julius had seen ithe showed me a note of hers to him oncebut sir james hadnt after that everything was plain sailing i sent off albert posthaste to mr carter i pretended to go away but doubled back again when julius came bursting up in his car i felt it wasnt part of mr browns planand that there would probably be trouble unless sir james was actually caught in the act so to speak i knew mr carter would never believe it of him on my bare word  i didnt interposed mr carter ruefully  thats why i sent the girls off to sir james i was sure theyd fetch up at the house in soho sooner or later i threatened julius with the revolver because i wanted tuppence to repeat that to sir james so that he wouldnt worry about us the moment the girls were out of sight i told julius to drive like hell for london and as we went along i told him the whole story we got to the soho house in plenty of time and met mr carter outside after arranging things with him we went in and hid behind the curtain in the recess the policemen had orders to say if they were asked that no one had gone into the house thats all  and tommy came to an abrupt halt  there was silence for a moment  by the way said julius suddenly youre all wrong about that photograph of jane it was taken from me but i found it again  where cried tuppence  in that little safe on the wall in mrs vandemeyers bedroom  i knew you found something said tuppence reproachfully to tell you the truth thats what started me off suspecting you why didnt you say  i guess i was a mite suspicious too it had been got away from me once and i determined i wouldnt let on id got it until a photographer had made a dozen copies of it  we all kept back something or other said tuppence thoughtfully i suppose secret service work makes you like that  in the pause that ensued mr carter took from his pocket a small shabby brown book  beresford has just said that i would not have believed sir james peel edgerton to be guilty unless so to speak he was caught in the act that is so indeed not until i read the entries in this little book could i bring myself fully to credit the amazing truth this book will pass into the possession of scotland yard but it will never be publicly exhibited sir jamess long association with the law would make it undesirable but to you who know the truth i propose to read certain passages which will throw some light on the extraordinary mentality of this great man  he opened the book and turned the thin pages    it is madness to keep this book i know that it is documentary evidence against me but i have never shrunk from taking risks and i feel an urgent need for selfexpression the book will only be taken from my dead body   from an early age i realized that i had exceptional abilities only a fool underestimates his capabilities my brain power was greatly above the average i know that i was born to succeed my appearance was the only thing against me i was quiet and insignificantutterly nondescript   when i was a boy i heard a famous murder trial i was deeply impressed by the power and eloquence of the counsel for the defence for the first time i entertained the idea of taking my talents to that particular market then i studied the criminal in the dock the man was a foolhe had been incredibly unbelievably stupid even the eloquence of his counsel was hardly likely to save him i felt an immeasurable contempt for him then it occurred to me that the criminal standard was a low one it was the wastrels the failures the general riffraff of civilization who drifted into crime strange that men of brains had never realized its extraordinary opportunities i played with the idea what a magnificent fieldwhat unlimited possibilities it made my brain reel   i read standard works on crime and criminals they all confirmed my opinion degeneracy diseasenever the deliberate embracing of a career by a farseeing man then i considered supposing my utmost ambitions were realizedthat i was called to the bar and rose to the height of my profession that i entered politicssay even that i became prime minister of england what then was that power hampered at every turn by my colleagues fettered by the democratic system of which i should be the mere figurehead nothe power i dreamed of was absolute an autocrat a dictator and such power could only be obtained by working outside the law to play on the weaknesses of human nature then on the weaknesses of nationsto get together and control a vast organization and finally to overthrow the existing order and rule the thought intoxicated me   i saw that i must lead two lives a man like myself is bound to attract notice i must have a successful career which would mask my true activities also i must cultivate a personality i modelled myself upon famous kcs i reproduced their mannerisms their magnetism if i had chosen to be an actor i should have been the greatest actor living no disguisesno grease paintno false beards personality i put it on like a glove when i shed it i was myself quiet unobtrusive a man like every other man i called myself mr brown there are hundreds of men called brownthere are hundreds of men looking just like me   i succeeded in my false career i was bound to succeed i shall succeed in the other a man like me cannot fail   i have been reading a life of napoleon he and i have much in common   i make a practice of defending criminals a man should look after his own people   once or twice i have felt afraid the first time was in italy there was a dinner given professor d the great alienist was present the talk fell on insanity he said a great many men are mad and no one knows it they do not know it themselves i do not understand why he looked at me when he said that his glance was strange i did not like it   the war has disturbed me i thought it would further my plans the germans are so efficient their spy system too was excellent the streets are full of these boys in khaki all emptyheaded young fools yet i do not know they won the war it disturbs me   my plans are going well a girl butted ini do not think she really knew anything but we must give up the esthonia no risks now   all goes well the loss of memory is vexing it cannot be a fake no girl could deceive me  the 29th that is very soon mr carter paused  i will not read the details of the coup that was planned but there are just two small entries that refer to the three of you in the light of what happened they are interesting   by inducing the girl to come to me of her own accord i have succeeded in disarming her but she has intuitive flashes that might be dangerous she must be got out of the way i can do nothing with the american he suspects and dislikes me but he cannot know i fancy my armour is impregnable sometimes i fear i have underestimated the other boy he is not clever but it is hard to blind his eyes to facts   mr carter shut the book  a great man he said genius or insanity who can say  there was silence  then mr carter rose to his feet  i will give you a toast the joint venture which has so amply justified itself by success  it was drunk with acclamation  theres something more we want to hear continued mr carter he looked at the american ambassador i speak for you also i know well ask miss jane finn to tell us the story that only miss tuppence has heard so farbut before we do so well drink her health the health of one of the bravest of americas daughters to whom is due the thanks and gratitude of two great countries    chapter xxviii and after  that was a mighty good toast jane said mr hersheimmer as he and his cousin were being driven back in the rollsroyce to the ritz  the one to the joint venture  nothe one to you there isnt another girl in the world who could have carried it through as you did you were just wonderful  jane shook her head  i dont feel wonderful at heart im just tired and lonesomeand longing for my own country  that brings me to something i wanted to say i heard the ambassador telling you his wife hoped you would come to them at the embassy right away thats good enough but ive got another plan janei want you to marry me dont get scared and say no at once you cant love me right away of course thats impossible but ive loved you from the very moment i set eyes on your photoand now ive seen you im simply crazy about you if youll only marry me i wont worry you anyyou shall take your own time maybe youll never come to love me and if thats the case ill manage to set you free but i want the right to look after you and take care of you  thats what i want said the girl wistfully some one wholl be good to me oh you dont know how lonesome i feel  sure thing i do then i guess thats all fixed up and ill see the archbishop about a special license tomorrow morning  oh julius  well i dont want to hustle you any jane but theres no sense in waiting about dont be scaredi shant expect you to love me all at once  but a small hand was slipped into his  i love you now julius said jane finn i loved you that first moment in the car when the bullet grazed your cheek  five minutes later jane murmured softly  i dont know london very well julius but is it such a very long way from the savoy to the ritz  it depends how you go explained julius unblushingly were going by way of regents park  oh juliuswhat will the chauffeur think  at the wages i pay him he knows better than to do any independent thinking why jane the only reason i had the supper at the savoy was so that i could drive you home i didnt see how i was ever going to get hold of you alone you and tuppence have been sticking together like siamese twins i guess another day of it would have driven me and beresford stark staring mad  oh is he  of course he is head over ears  i thought so said jane thoughtfully  why  from all the things tuppence didnt say  there you have me beat said mr hersheimmer but jane only laughed  in the meantime the young adventurers were sitting bolt upright very stiff and ill at ease in a taxi which with a singular lack of originality was also returning to the ritz via regents park  a terrible constraint seemed to have settled down between them without quite knowing what had happened everything seemed changed they were tonguetiedparalysed all the old camaraderie was gone  tuppence could think of nothing to say  tommy was equally afflicted  they sat very straight and forbore to look at each other  at last tuppence made a desperate effort  rather fun wasnt it  rather  another silence  i like julius essayed tuppence again  tommy was suddenly galvanized into life  youre not going to marry him do you hear he said dictatorially i forbid it  oh said tuppence meekly  absolutely you understand  he doesnt want to marry mehe really only asked me out of kindness  thats not very likely scoffed tommy  its quite true hes head over ears in love with jane i expect hes proposing to her now  shell do for him very nicely said tommy condescendingly  dont you think shes the most lovely creature youve ever seen  oh i dare say  but i suppose you prefer sterling worth said tuppence demurely  ioh dash it all tuppence you know  i like your uncle tommy said tuppence hastily creating a diversion by the way what are you going to do accept mr carters offer of a government job or accept juliuss invitation and take a richly remunerated post in america on his ranch  i shall stick to the old ship i think though its awfully good of hersheimmer but i feel youd be more at home in london  i dont see where i come in  i do said tommy positively  tuppence stole a glance at him sideways  theres the money too she observed thoughtfully  what money  were going to get a cheque each mr carter told me so  did you ask how much inquired tommy sarcastically  yes said tuppence triumphantly but i shant tell you  tuppence you are the limit  it has been fun hasnt it tommy i do hope we shall have lots more adventures  youre insatiable tuppence ive had quite enough adventures for the present  well shopping is almost as good said tuppence dreamily  think of buying old furniture and bright carpets and futurist silk curtains and a polished diningtable and a divan with lots of cushions  hold hard said tommy whats all this for  possibly a housebut i think a flat  whose flat  you think i mind saying it but i dont in the least ours so there  you darling cried tommy his arms tightly round her i was determined to make you say it i owe you something for the relentless way youve squashed me whenever ive tried to be sentimental  tuppence raised her face to his the taxi proceeded on its course round the north side of regents park  you havent really proposed now pointed out tuppence not what our grandmothers would call a proposal but after listening to a rotten one like juliuss im inclined to let you off  you wont be able to get out of marrying me so dont you think it  what fun it will be responded tuppence marriage is called all sorts of things a haven and a refuge and a crowning glory and a state of bondage and lots more but do you know what i think it is  what  a sport  and a damned good sport too said tommy
