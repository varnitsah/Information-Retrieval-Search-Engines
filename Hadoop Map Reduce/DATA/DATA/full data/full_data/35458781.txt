35458781	the christmas books  of  mr m a titmarsh  by william makepeace thackeray     contents   christmas stories  mrs perkinss ball  our street  dr birch and his young friends  the kickleburys on the rhine  the rose and the ring or the history of prince giglio and prince bulbo     mrs perkinss ball  the mulligan of ballymulligan and how we went to mrs perkinss ball   i do not know where ballymulligan is and never knew anybody who did once i asked the mulligan the question when that chieftain assumed a look of dignity so ferocious and spoke of saxon curiawsitee in a tone of such evident displeasure that as after all it can matter very little to me whereabouts lies the celtic principality in question i have never pressed the inquiry any farther  i dont know even the mulligans town residence one night as he bade us adieu in oxford streeti live there says he pointing down towards oxbridge with the big stick he carriesso his abode is in that direction at any rate he has his letters addressed to several of his friends houses and his parcels c are left for him at various taverns which he frequents that pair of checked trousers in which you see him attired he did me the favor of ordering from my own tailor who is quite as anxious as anybody to know the address of the wearer in like manner my hatter asked me oo was the hirish gent as ad ordered four ats and a sable boar to be sent to my lodgings as i did not know however i might guess the articles have never been sent and the mulligan has withdrawn his custom from the infernal fourandninepenny scoundthrel as he calls him the hatter has not shut up shop in consequence  i became acquainted with the mulligan through a distinguished countryman of his who strange to say did not know the chieftain himself but dining with my friend fred clancy of the irish bar at greenwich the mulligan came up inthrojuiced himself to clancy as he said claimed relationship with him on the side of brian boroo and drawing his chair to our table quickly became intimate with us he took a great liking to me was good enough to find out my address and pay me a visit since which period often and often on coming to breakfast in the morning i have found him in my sittingroom on the sofa engaged with the rolls and morning papers and many a time on returning home at night for an evenings quiet reading i have discovered this honest fellow in the armchair before the fire perfuming the apartment with my cigars and trying the quality of such liquors as might be found on the sideboard the way in which he pokes fun at betsy the maid of the lodgings is prodigious she begins to laugh whenever he comes if he calls her a duck a divvle a darlin it is all one he is just as much a master of the premises as the individual who rents them at fifteen shillings a week and as for handkerchiefs shirtcollars and the like articles of fugitive haberdashery the loss since i have known him is unaccountable i suspect he is like the cat in some houses for suppose the whiskey the cigars the sugar the teacaddy the pickles and other groceries disappear all is laid upon that edaxrerum of a mulligan  the greatest offence that can be offered to him is to call him mr mulligan would you deprive me sir says he of the title which was bawrun be me princelee ancestors in a hundred thousand battles in our own green valleys and fawrests in the american savannahs in the sierras of speen and the flats of flandthers the saxon has quailed before me warcry of mulligan aboo mr mulligan ill pitch anybody out of the window who calls me mr mulligan he said this and uttered the slogan of the mulligans with a shriek so terrific that my uncle the rev w gruels of the independent congregation bungay who had happened to address him in the above obnoxious manner while sitting at my apartments drinking tea after the may meetings instantly quitted the room and has never taken the least notice of me since except to state to the rest of the family that i am doomed irrevocably to perdition  well one day last season i had received from my kind and most estimable friend mrs perkins of pocklington square to whose amiable family i have had the honor of giving lessons in drawing french and the german flute an invitation couched in the usual terms on satin giltedged notepaper to her eveningparty or as i call it ball  besides the engraved note sent to all her friends my kind patroness had addressed me privately as follows   my dear mr titmarshif you know any very eligible young man we give you leave to bring him you gentlemen love your clubs so much now and care so little for dancing that it is really quite a scandal come early and before everybody and give us the benefit of all your taste and continental skill  your sincere  emily perkins   whom shall i bring mused i highly flattered by this mark of confidence and i thought of bob trippett and little fred spring of the navy pay office hulker who is rich and i knew took lessons in paris and a halfscore of other bachelor friends who might be considered as very eligiblewhen i was roused from my meditation by the slap of a hand on my shoulder and looking up there was the mulligan who began as usual reading the papers on my desk  hwhats this says he whos perkins is it a supperball or only a tayball  the perkinses of pocklington square mulligan are tiptop people says i with a tone of dignity mr perkinss sister is married to a baronet sir giles bacon of hogwash norfolk mr perkinss uncle was lord mayor of london and he was himself in parliament and may be again any day the family are my most particular friends a tayball indeed why gunter    here i stopped i felt i was committing myself  gunter says the mulligan with another confounded slap on the shoulder dont say another word ill go widg you my boy  you go mulligan says i why reallyiits not my party  your hwhawt hwhats this letter ant i an eligible young manis the descendant of a thousand kings unfit company for a miserable tallowchandthlering cockney are ye joking wid me for let me tell ye i dont like them jokes dye suppose im not as well bawrun and bred as yourself or any saxon friend ye ever had  i never said you werent mulligan says i  ye dont mean seriously that a mulligan is not fit company for a perkins  my dear fellow how could you think i could so far insult you says i well then says he thats a matter settled and we go  what the deuce was i to do i wrote to mrs perkins and that kind lady replied that she would receive the mulligan or any other of my friends with the greatest cordiality fancy a party all mulligans thought i with a secret terror   mr and mrs perkins their house and their young people   following mrs perkinss orders the present writer made his appearance very early at pocklington square where the tastiness of all the decorations elicited my warmest admiration supper of course was in the diningloom superbly arranged by messrs grigs and spooner the confectioners of the neighborhood i assisted my respected friend mr perkins and his butler in decanting the sherry and saw not without satisfaction a large bath for wine under the sideboard in which were already placed very many bottles of champagne  the back diningroom mr ps study where the venerable man goes to sleep after dinner was arranged on this occasion as a tearoom mrs flouncey miss fannys maid officiating in a cap and pink ribbons which became her exceedingly long long before the arrival of the company i remarked master thomas perkins and master giles bacon his cousin son of sir giles bacon bart in this apartment busy among the macaroons  mr gregory the butler besides john the footman and sir giless large man in the bacon livery and honest grundsell carpetbeater and greengrocer of little pocklington buildings had at least half a dozen of aidesdecamp in black with white neckcloths like doctors of divinity  the back drawingroom door on the landing being taken off the hinges and placed up stairs under mr perkinss bed the orifice was covered with muslin and festooned with elegant wreaths of flowers this was the dancing saloon a linen was spread over the carpet and a bandconsisting of mr clapperton piano mr pinch harp and herr spoff cornetapiston arrived at a pretty early hour and were accommodated with some comfortable negus in the tearoom previous to the commencement of their delightful labors the boudoir to the left was fitted up as a cardroom the drawingroom was of course for the reception of the companythe chandeliers and yellow damask being displayed this night in all their splendor and the charming conservatory over the landing was ornamented by a few moonlike lamps and the flowers arranged so that it had the appearance of a fairy bower and miss perkins as i took the liberty of stating to her mamma looked like the fairy of that bower it is this young creatures first year in public life she has been educated regardless of expense at hammersmith and a simple white muslin dress and blue ceinture set off charms of which i beg to speak with respectful admiration  my distinguished friend the mulligan of ballymulligan was good enough to come the very first of the party by the way how awkward it is to be the first of the party and yet you know somebody must but for my part being timid i always wait at the corner of the street in the cab and watch until some other carriage comes up  well as we were arranging the sherry in the decanters down the suppertables my friend arrived hwhares me friend mr titmarsh i heard him bawling out to gregory in the passage and presently he rushed into the supperroom where mr and mrs perkins and myself were and as the waiter was announcing mr mulligan the mulligan of ballymulligan ye blackguard roared he and stalked into the apartment apologoizing as he said for introducing himself  mr and mrs perkins did not perhaps wish to be seen in this room which was for the present only lighted by a couple of candles but he was not at all abashed by the circumstance and grasping them both warmly by the hands he instantly made himself at home as friends of my dear and talented friend mick so he is pleased to call me im deloighted madam to be made known to ye dont consider me in the light of a mere acquaintance as for you my dear madam you put me so much in moind of my own blessed mother now resoiding at ballymulligan castle that i begin to love ye at first soight at which speech mr perkins getting rather alarmed asked the mulligan whether he would take some wine or go up stairs  faix says mulligan its never too soon for good dhrink and although he smelt very much of whiskey already he drank a tumbler of wine to the improvement of an acqueentence which comminces in a manner so deloightful  lets go up stairs mulligan says i and led the noble irishman to the upper apartments which were in a profound gloom the candles not being yet illuminated and where we surprised miss fanny seated in the twilight at the piano timidly trying the tunes of the polka which she danced so exquisitely that evening she did not perceive the stranger at first but how she started when the mulligan loomed upon her  heavenlee enchanthress says mulligan dont floy at the approach of the humblest of your sleeves reshewm your pleece at that insthrument which weeps harmonious or smoils melojious as you charrum it are you acqueented with the oirish melodies can ye play who fears to talk of nointyeight the shan van voght or the dirge of ollam fodhlah  whos this mad chap that titmarsh has brought i heard master bacon exclaim to master perkins look how frightened fanny looks  o poo gals are always frightened fannys brother replied but giles bacon more violent said ill tell you what tom if this goes on we must pitch into him and so i have no doubt they would when another thundering knock coming gregory rushed into the room and began lighting all the candles so as to produce an amazing brilliancy miss fanny sprang up and ran to her mamma and the young gentlemen slid down the banisters to receive the company in the hall   everybody begins to come but especially mr minchin   its only me and my sisters master bacon said though only meant eight in this instance all the young ladies had fresh cheeks and purple elbows all had white frocks with hair more or less auburn and so a party was already made of this blooming and numerous family before the rest of the company began to arrive the three miss meggots next came in their fly mr blades and his niece from 19 in the square captain and mrs struther and miss struther doctor toddys two daughters and their mamma but where were the gentlemen the mulligan great and active as he was could not suffice among so many beauties at last came a brisk neat little knock and looking into the hall i saw a gentleman taking off his clogs there whilst sir giles bacons big footman was looking on with rather a contemptuous air  what name shall i enounce says he with a wink at gregory on the stair  the gentleman in clogs said with quiet dignity   mr frederick minchin   pump court temple is printed on his cards in very small type and he is a rising barrister of the western circuit he is to be found at home of mornings afterwards at westminster as you read on his back door binks and minchins reports are probably known to my legal friends this is the minchin in question  he is decidedly genteel and is rather in request at the balls of the judges and serjeants ladies for he dances irreproachably and goes out to dinner as much as ever he can  he mostly dines at the oxford and cambridge club of which you can easily see by his appearance that he is a member he takes the joint and his halfpint of wine for minchin does everything like a gentleman he is rather of a literary turn still makes latin verses with some neatness and before he was called was remarkably fond of the flute  when mr minchin goes out in the evening his clerk brings his bag to the club to dress and if it is at all muddy he turns up his trousers so that he may come in without a speck for such a party as this he will have new gloves otherwise frederick his clerk is chiefly employed in cleaning them with indiarubber  he has a number of pleasant stories about the circuit and the university which he tells with a simper to his neighbor at dinner and has always the last joke of mr baron maule he has a private fortune of five thousand pounds he is a dutiful son he has a sister married in harley street and lady jane ranville has the best opinion of him and says he is a most excellent and highly principled young man  her ladyship and daughter arrived just as mr minchin had popped his clogs into the umbrellastand and the rank of that respected person and the dignified manner in which he led her up stairs caused all sneering on the part of the domestics to disappear   the ballroom door   a hundred of knocks follow frederick minchins in half an hour messrs spoff pinch and clapperton have begun their music and mulligan with one of the miss bacons is dancing majestically in the first quadrille my young friends giles and tom prefer the landingplace to the drawingrooms where they stop all night robbing the refreshmenttrays as they come up or down giles has eaten fourteen ices he will have a dreadful stomachache tomorrow tom has eaten twelve but he has had four more glasses of negus than giles grundsell the occasional waiter from whom master tom buys quantities of gingerbeer can of course deny him nothing that is grundsell in the tights with the tray meanwhile direct your attention to the three gentlemen at the door they are conversing  1st gentwhos the man of the housethe bald man  2nd gentof course the man of the house is always bald hes a stockbroker i believe snooks brought me  1st genthave you been to the tearoom theres a pretty girl in the tearoom blue eyes pink ribbons that kind of thing  2nd gentwho the deuce is that girl

1st and 2nd gents   lady bacon the miss bacons mr flam   lady bleonora maria amelia here is the gentleman we met at sir john porkingtons  the misses bacon expecting to be asked to dance smile simultaneously and begin to smooth their tuckers  mr flamlady bacon i couldnt be mistaken in you wont you dance lady bacon  lady bgo away you droll creature  mr flamand these are your ladyships seven lovely sisters to judge from their likenesses to the charming lady bacon  lady bmy sisters he he my daughters mr flam and they dance dont you girls  the misses bacono yes  mr flamgad how i wish i was a dancing man  exit flam   mr larkins   i have not been able to do justice only a lawrence could do that to my respected friend mrs perkins in this picture but larkinss portrait is considered very like adolphus larkins has been long connected with mr perkinss city establishment and is asked to dine twice or thrice per annum eveningparties are the great enjoyment of this simple youth who after he has walked from kentish town to thames street and passed twelve hours in severe labor there and walked back again to kentish town finds no greater pleasure than to attire his lean person in that elegant evening costume which you see to walk into town again and to dance at anybodys house who will invite him islington pentonville somers town are the scenes of many of his exploits and i have seen this goodnatured fellow performing figuredances at nottinghill at a house where i am ashamed to say there was no supper no negus even to speak of nothing but the bare merits of the polka in which adolphus revels to describe this gentlemans infatuation for dancing let me say in a word that he will even frequent boardinghouse hops rather than not go  he has clogs too like minchin but nobody laughs at him he gives himself no airs but walks into a house with a knock and a demeanor so tremulous and humble that the servants rather patronize him he does not speak or have any particular opinions but when the time comes begins to dance he bleats out a word or two to his partner during this operation seems very weak and sad during the whole performance and of course is set to dance with the ugliest women everywhere  the gentle kind spirit when i think of him night after night hopping and jigging and trudging off to kentish town so gently through the fogs and mud and darkness i do not know whether i ought to admire him because his enjoyments are so simple and his dispositions so kindly or laugh at him because he draws his life so exquisitely mild well well we cant be all roaring lions in this world there must be some lambs and harmless kindly gregarious creatures for eating and shearing see even goodnatured mrs perkins is leading up the trembling larkins to the tremendous miss bunion   miss bunion   the poetess author of heartstrings the deadly nightshade passion flowers c though her poems breathe only of love miss b has never been married she is nearly six feet high she loves waltzing beyond even poesy and i think lobstersalad as much as either she confesses to twentyeight in which case her first volume the orphan of gozo cut up by mr rigby in the quarterly with his usual kindness must have been published when she was three years old  for a woman all soul she certainly eats as much as any woman i ever saw the sufferings she has had to endure are she says beyond compare the poems which she writes breathe a withering passion a smouldering despair an agony of spirit that would melt the soul of a drayman were he to read them well it is a comfort to see that she can dance of nights and to know for the habits of illustrious literary persons are always worth knowing that she eats a hot muttonchop for breakfast every morning of her blighted existence  she lives in a boardinghouse at brompton and comes to the party in a fly   mr hicks   it is worth twopence to see miss bunion and poseidon hicks the great poet conversing with one another and to talk of one to the other afterwards how they hate each other i in my wicked way have sent hicks almost raving mad by praising bunion to him in confidence and you can drive bunion out of the room by a few judicious panegyrics of hicks  hicks first burst upon the astonished world with poems in the byronic manner the deathshriek the bastard of lara the atabal the fireship of botzaris and other works his love lays in mr moores early style were pronounced to be wonderfully precocious for a young gentleman then only thirteen and in a commercial academy at tooting  subsequently this great bard became less passionate and more thoughtful and at the age of twenty wrote idiosyncracy in forty books 4to ararat a stupendous epic as the reviews said and the megatheria a magnificent contribution to our preadamite literature according to the same authorities not having read these works it would ill become me to judge them but i know that poor jingle the publisher always attributed his insolvency to the latter epic which was magnificently printed in elephant folio  hicks has now taken a classical turn and has brought out poseidon iacchus hephaestus and i dare say is going through the mythology but i should not like to try him at a passage of the greek delectus any more than twenty thousand others of us who have had a classical education  hicks was taken in an inspired attitude regarding the chandelier and pretending he didnt know that miss pettifer was looking at him  her name is anna maria daughter of higgs and pettifer solicitors bedford row but hicks calls her ianthe in his album verses and is himself an eminent drysalter in the city   miss meggot   poor miss meggot is not so lucky as miss bunion nobody comes to dance with her though she has a new frock on as she calls it and rather a pretty foot which she always manages to stick out  she is fortyseven the youngest of three sisters who live a mouldy old house near middlesex hospital where they have lived for i dont know how many score of years but this is certain the eldest miss meggot saw the gordon riots out of that same parlor window and tells the story how her father physician to george iii was robbed of his queue in the streets on that occasion the two old ladies have taken the brevet rank and are addressed as mrs jane and mrs betsy one of them is at whist in the back drawingroom but the youngest is still called miss nancy and is considered quite a baby by her sisters  she was going to be married once to a brave young officer ensign angus macquirk of the whistlebinkie fencibles but he fell at quatre bras by the side of the gallant snuffmull his commander deeply deeply did miss nancy deplore him  but time has cicatrized the wounded heart she is gay now and would sing or dance ay or marry if anybody asked her  do go my dear friendi dont mean to ask her to marry but to ask her to dancenever mind the looks of the thing it will make her happy and what does it cost you ah my dear fellow take this counsel always dance with the old ladiesalways dance with the governesses it is a comfort to the poor things when they get up in their garret that somebody has had mercy on them and such a handsome fellow as you too   miss ranville rev mr toop miss mullins mr winter   mr w miss mullins look at miss ranville what a picture of good humor  miss moh you satirical creature  mr wdo

of baker street pronounces her to be an exceedingly forward person captain dobbs likes a girl who has plenty of go in her and as for fred sparks he is over head and ears in love with her   mr ranville ranville and jack hubbard   this is miss ranville ranvilles brother mr ranville ranville of the foreign office faithfully designed as he was playing at whist in the cardroom talleyrand used to play at whist at the travellers that is why ranville ranville indulges in that diplomatic recreation it is not his fault if he be not the greatest man in the room  if you speak to him he smiles sternly and answers in monosyllables he would rather die than commit himself he never has committed himself in his life he was the first at school and distinguished at oxford he is growing prematurely bald now like canning and is quite proud of it he rides in st jamess park of a morning before breakfast he dockets his tailors bills and nicks off his dinnernotes in diplomatic paragraphs and keeps precis of them all if he ever makes a joke it is a quotation from horace like sir robert peel the only relaxation he permits himself is to read thucydides in the holidays  everybody asks him out to dinner on account of his brassbuttons with the queens cipher and to have the air of being well with the foreign office where i dine he says solemnly i think it is my duty to go to eveningparties that is why he is here he never dances never sups never drinks he has gruel when he goes home to bed i think it is in his brains  he is such an ass and so respectable that one wonders he has not succeeded in the world and yet somehow they laugh at him and you and i shall be ministers as soon as he will  yonder making believe to look over the printbooks is that merry rogue jack hubbard  see how jovial he looks he is the life and soul of every party and his impromptu singing after supper will make you die of laughing he is meditating an impromptu now and at the same time thinking about a bill that is coming due next thursday happy dog   mrs trotter miss trotter miss toady lord methuselah   dear emma trotter has been silent and rather illhumored all the evening until now her pretty face lights up with smiles cannot you guess why pity the simple and affectionate creature lord methuselah has not arrived until this moment and see how the artless girl steps forward to greet him  in the midst of all the selfishness and turmoil of the world how charming it is to find virgin hearts quite unsullied and to look on at little romantic pictures of mutual love lord methuselah though you know his age by the peeragethough he is old wigged gouty rouged wicked has lighted up a pure flame in that gentle bosom there was a talk about tom willoughby last year and then for a time young hawbuck sir john hawbucks youngest son seemed the favored man but emma never knew her mind until she met the dear creature before you in a rhine steamboat why are you so late edward says she dear artless child  her mother looks on with tender satisfaction one can appreciate the joys of such an admirable parent  look at them says miss toady i vow and protest theyre the handsomest couple in the room  methuselahs grandchildren are rather jealous and angry and mademoiselle ariane of the french theatre is furious but theres no accounting for the mercenary envy of some people and it is impossible to satisfy everybody   mr beaumoris mr grig mr flynders   those three young men are described in a twinkling captain grig of the heavies mr beaumoris the handsome young man tom flinders flynders flynders he now calls himself the fat gentleman who dresses after beaumoris  beaumoris is in the treasury he has a salary of eighty pounds a year on which he maintains the best cab and horses of the season and out of which he pays seventy guineas merely for his subscriptions to clubs he hunts in leicestershire where great men mount him he is a prodigious favorite behind the scenes at the theatres you may get glimpses of him at richmond with all sorts of pink bonnets and he is the sworn friend of half the most famous roues about town such as old methuselah lord billygoat lord tarquin and the rest a respectable race it is to oblige the former that the goodnatured young fellow is here tonight though it must not be imagined that he gives himself any airs of superiority dandy as he is he is quite affable and would borrow ten guineas from any man in the room in the most jovial way possible  it is neither beaus birth which is doubtful nor his money which is entirely negative nor his honesty which goes along with his moneyqualification nor his wit for he can barely spellwhich recommend him to the fashionable world but a sort of grand seigneur splendor and dandified je ne scais quoi which make the man he is of him the way in which his boots and gloves fit him is a wonder which no other man can achieve and though he has not an atom of principle it must be confessed that he invented the taglioni shirt  when i see these magnificent dandies yawning out of whites or caracoling in the park on shining chargers i like to think that brummell was the greatest of them all and that brummells father was a footman  flynders is beaumoriss toady lends him money buys horses through his recommendation dresses after him clings to him in pall mall and on the steps of the club and talks about bo in all societies it is his drag which carries down bos friends to the derby and his cheques pay for dinners to the pink bonnets i dont believe the perkinses know what a rogue it is but fancy him a decent reputable city man like his father before him  as for captain grig what is there to tell about him he performs the duties of his calling with perfect gravity he is faultless on parade excellent across country amiable when drunk rather slow when sober he has not two ideas and is a most goodnatured irreproachable gallant and stupid young officer   cavalier seul   this is my friend bob hely performing the cavalier seul in a quadrille remark the goodhumored pleasure depicted in his countenance has he any secret grief has he a pain anywhere no dear miss jones he is dancing like a true briton and with all the charming gayety and abandon of our race  when canaillard performs that cavalier seul operation does he flinch no he puts on his most vainqueur look he sticks his thumbs into the armholes of his waistcoat and advances retreats pirouettes and otherwise gambadoes as though to say regarde moi o monde venez o femmes venez voir danser canaillard  when de bobwitz executes the same measure he does it with smiling agility and graceful ease  but poor hely if he were advancing to a dentist his face would not be more cheerful all the eyes of the room are upon him he thinks and he thinks he looks like a fool  upon my word if you press the point with me dear miss jones i think he is not very far from right i think that while frenchmen and germans may dance as it is their nature to do there is a natural dignity about us britons which debars us from that enjoyment i am rather of the turkish opinion that this should be done for us i think     goodby you envious old foxandthegrapes says miss jones and the next moment i see her whirling by in a polka with tom tozer at a pace which makes me shrink back with terror into the little boudoir   m canaillard chevalier of the legion of honor  lieutenant baron de bobwitz   canaillard oh ces anglais quels hommes mon dieu comme ils sont habilles comme ils dansent  bobwitzce sont de beaux hommes bourtant point de tenue militaire mais de grands gaillards si je les avais dans ma compagnie de la garde jen ferai de bons soldats  canaillardestil bete cet allemand les grands hommes ne font pas toujours de bons soldats monsieur il me semble que les soldats de france qui sont de ma taille monsieur valent un peu mieux     bobwitzvous croyez  canaillardcomment je le crois monsieur jen suis sur il me semble monsieur que nous lavons prouve  bobwitz impatientlyje men vais danser la bolka serviteur monsieur  canaillardbutor he goes and looks at himself in the glass when he is seized by mrs perkins for the polka   the boudoir  mr smith mr brown miss bustleton   mr brownyou polk miss bustleton im so delaighted  miss bustletonsmiles and prepares to rise  mr smithd puppy  poor smith dont polk   grand polka   though a quadrille seems to me as dreary as a funeral yet to look at a polka i own is pleasant see brown and emily bustleton are whirling round as light as two pigeons over a dovecot tozer with that wicked whisking little jones spins along as merrily as a mayday sweep miss joy is the partner of the happy fred sparks and even miss ranville is pleased for the faultless captain grig is toe and heel with her beaumoris with rather a nonchalant air takes a turn with miss trotter at which lord methuselehs wrinkled chops quiver uneasily see how the big baron de bobwitz spins lightly and gravely and gracefully round and lo the frenchman staggering under the weight of miss bunion who tramps and kicks like a young carthorse  but the most awful sight which met my view in this dance was the unfortunate miss little to whom fate had assigned the mulligan as a partner like a pavid kid in the talons of an eagle that young creature trembled in his huge milesian grasp disdaining the recognized form of the dance the irish chieftain accommodated the music to the dance of his own green land and performed a double shuffle jig carrying miss little along with him miss ranville and her captain shrank back amazed miss trotter skirried out of his way into the protection of the astonished lord methuselah fred sparks could hardly move for laughing while on the contrary miss joy was quite in pain for poor sophy little as canaillard and the poetess came up the mulligan in the height of his enthusiasm lunged out a kick which sent miss bunion howling and concluded with a tremendous hurrooa warcry which caused every saxon heart to shudder and quail  oh that the earth would open and kindly take me in i exclaimed mentally and slunk off into the lower regions where by this time half the company were at supper   the supper   the supper is going on behind the screen there is no need to draw the supper we all know that sort of transaction the squabbling and gobbling and popping of champagne the smell of musk and lobstersalad the dowagers chumping away at plates of raised pie the young lassies nibbling at little titbits which the dexterous young gentlemen procure three large men like doctors of divinity wait behind the table and furnish everything that appetite can ask for i never for my part can eat any supper for wondering at those men i believe if you were to ask them for

with untold spoons with anything in fact but liquor and it was he who brought round the cards for mrs perkinss ball   after supper   i do not intend to say any more about it after the people had supped they went back and danced some supped again i gave miss bunion with my own hands four bumpers of champagne and such a quantity of gooseliver and truffles that i dont wonder she took a glass of cherrybrandy afterwards the gray morning was in pocklington square as she drove away in her fly so did the other people go away how green and sallow some of the girls looked and how awfully clear mrs colonel bludyers rouge was lady jane ranvilles great coach had roared away down the streets long before fred minchin pattered off in his clogs it was i who covered up miss meggot and conducted her with her two old sisters to the carriage good old souls they have shown their gratitude by asking me to tea next tuesday methuselah is gone to finish the night at the club mind tomorrow miss trotter

creatures with their smiles and their blushes and their pretty ways would you like to be the grand bashaw  mind and send me a large piece of cake i go up and whisper archly to old mr ward and we look on rather sentimentally at the couple almost the last in the rooms there i declare go the musicians and the clock is at fivewhen grundsell with an air effare rushes up to me and says for evn sake sir go into the supperroom theres that hirish gent apitchin into mr p   the mulligan and mr perkins   it was too true i had taken him away after supper he ran after miss littles carriage who was dying in love with him as he fancied but the brute had come back again the doctors of divinity were putting up their condiments everybody was gone but the abominable mulligan sat swinging his legs at the lonely suppertable  perkins was opposite gasping at him  the mulligani tell ye ye are the butler ye big fat man go get me some more champagne its good at this house  mr perkins with dignityit is good

confined him the doctors of divinity looked on with perfect indifference that mr perkins did not go off in a fit is a wonder he was led away heaving and snorting frightfully  somebody smashed mulligans hat over his eyes and i led him forth into the silent morning the chirrup of the birds the freshness of the rosy air and a pennorth of coffee that i got for him at a stall in the regent circus revived him somewhat when i quitted him he was not angry but sad he was desirous it is true of avenging the wrongs of erin in battle line he wished also to share the grave of sarsfield and hugh oneill but he was sure that miss perkins as well as miss little was desperately in love with him and i left him on a doorstep in tears   is it best to be laughingmad or cryingmad in the world says i moodily coming into my street betsy the maid was already up and at work on her knees scouring the steps and cheerfully beginning her honest daily labor     our street  by mr m a titmarsh   our street from the little nook which i occupy in it and whence i and a fellowlodger and friend of mine cynically observe it presents a strange motley scene we are in a state of transition we are not as yet in the town and we have left the country where we were when i came to lodge with mrs cammysole my excellent landlady i then took secondfloor apartments at no 17 waddilove street and since although i have never moved having various little comforts about me i find myself living at no 46a pocklington gardens  why is this why am i to pay eighteen shillings instead of fifteen i was quite as happy in waddilove street but the fact is a great portion of that venerable old district has passed away and we are being absorbed into the splendid new whitestuccoed doricporticoed genteel pocklington quarter sir thomas gibbs pocklington m p for the borough of lathanplaster is the founder of the district and his own fortune the pocklington estate office is in the square on a line with waddilwith pocklington gardens i mean the old inn the ram and magpie where the marketgardeners used to bait came out this year with a new white face and title the shield c of the pocklington arms such a shield it is such quarterings howard cavendish de ros de la zouche all mingled together  even our house 46a which mrs cammysole has had painted white in compliment to the gardens of which it now forms part is a sort of impostor and has no business to be called gardens at all mr gibbs sir thomass agent and nephew is furious at our daring to take the title which belongs to our betters the very next door no 46 the honorable mrs mountnoddy is a house of five stories shooting up proudly into the air thirty feet above our old highroofed lowroomed old tenement our house belongs to captain bragg not only the landlord but the soninlaw of mrs cammysole who lives a couple of hundred yards down the street at the bungalow he was the commander of the ram chunder east indiaman and has quarrelled with the pocklingtons ever since he bought houses in the parish  he it is who will not sell or alter his houses to suit the spirit of the times he it is who though he made the widow cammysole change the name of her street will not pull down the house next door nor the bakers next nor the ironbedstead and feather warehouse ensuing nor the little barbers with the pole nor i am ashamed to say the tripeshop still standing the barber powders the heads of the great footmen from pocklington gardens they are so big that they can scarcely sit in his little premises and the old tavern the east indiaman is kept by braggs shipsteward and protests against the pocklington arms  down the road is pocklington chapel rev oldham slocumin brick with arched windows and a wooden belfry sober dingy and hideous in the centre of pocklington gardens rises st waltheofs the rev cyril thuryfer and assistantsa splendid anglonorman edifice vast rich elaborate bran new and intensely old down avemary lane you may hear the clink of the little romish chapel bell and hard by is a large broadshouldered ebenezer rev jonas gronow out of the windows of which the hymns come booming all sunday long  going westward along the line we come presently to comandine house on a part of the gardens of which comandine gardens is about to be erected by his lordship farther on the pineries mr and lady mary mango and so we get into the country and out of our street altogether as i may say but in the halfmile over which it may be said to extend we find all sorts and conditions of peoplefrom the right honorable lord comandine down to the present topographer who being of no rank as it were has the fortune to be treated on almost friendly footing by all from his lordship down to the tradesman   our house in our street   we must begin our little descriptions where they say charity should beginat home mrs cammysole my landlady will be rather surprised when she reads this and finds that a goodnatured tenant who has never complained of her impositions for fifteen years understands every one of her tricks and treats them not with anger but with scornwith silent scorn  on the 18th of december 1837 for instance coming gently down stairs and before my usual wont i saw you seated in my armchair peeping into a letter that came from my aunt in the country just as if it had been addressed to you and not to m a titmarsh esq did i make any disturbance far from it i slunk back to my bedroom being enabled to walk silently in the beautiful pair of worsted slippers miss penelope js worked for me they are worn out now dear penelope and then rattling open the door with a great noise descending the stairs singing son vergin vezzosa at the top of my voice you were not in my sittingroom mrs cammysole when i entered that apartment  you have been reading all my letters papers manuscripts brouillons of verses inchoate articles for the morning post and morning chronicle invitations to dinner and teaall my family letters all eliza townleys letters from the first in which she declared that to be the bride of her beloved michelagnolo was the fondest wish of her maiden heart to the last in which she announced that her thomas was the best of husbands and signed herself eliza slogger all mary farmers letters all emily delameres all that poor foolish old miss macwhirters whom i would as soon marry as  in a word i know that you you hawkbeaked keeneyed sleepless indefatigable old mrs cammysole have read all my papers for these fifteen years  i know that you cast your curious old eyes over all the manuscripts which you find in my coatpockets and those of my pantaloons as they hang in a drapery over the doorhandle of my bedroom  i know that you count the money in my green and gold purse which lucy netterville gave me and speculate on the manner in which i have laid out the difference between today and yesterday  i know that you have an understanding with the laundress to whom you say that you are allpowerful with me threatening to take away my practice from her unless she gets up gratis some of your fine linen  i know that we both have a pennyworth of cream for breakfast which is brought in in the same little can and i know who has the most for her share  i know how many lumps of sugar you take from each pound as it arrives i have counted the lumps you old thief and for years have never said a word except to miss clapperclaw the firstfloor lodger once i put a bottle of pale brandy into that cupboard of which you and i only have keys and the liquor wasted and wasted away until it was all gone you drank the whole of it you wicked old woman you a lady indeed  i know your rage when they did me the honor to elect me a member of the poluphloisboiothalasses club and i ceased consequently to dine at home when i did dine at homeon a beefsteak let us sayi should like to know what you had for supper you first amputated portions of the meat when raw you abstracted more when cooked do you think i was taken in by your flimsy pretences i wonder how you could dare to do such things before your maids you a clergymans daughter and widow indeed whom you yourself were always charging with roguery  yes the insolence of the old woman is unbearable and i must break out at last if she goes off in a fit at reading this i am sure i shant mind she has two unhappy wenches against whom her old tongue is clacking from morning till night she pounces on them at all hours it was but this morning at eight when poor molly was brooming the steps and the baker paying her by no means unmerited compliments that my landlady came whirling out of the groundfloor front and sent the poor girl whimpering into the kitchen  were it but for her conduct to her maids i was determined publicly to denounce her these poor wretches she causes to lead the lives of demons and not content with bullying them all day she sleeps at night in the same room with them so that she may have them up before daybreak and scold them while they are dressing  certain it is that between her and miss clapperclaw on the first floor the poor wenches lead a dismal life  it is to you that i owe most of my knowledge of our neighbors from you it is that most of the facts and observations contained in these brief pages are taken many a night over our tea have we talked amiably about our neighbors and their little failings and as i know that you speak of mine pretty freely why let me say my dear bessy that if we have not built up our street between us at least we have pulled it to pieces   the bungalowcaptain and mrs bragg   long long ago when our street was the countrya stagecoach between us and london passing four times a dayi do not care to own that it was a sight of flora cammysoles face under the card of her mammas lodgings to let which first caused me to become a tenant of our street a fine goodhumored lass she was then and i gave her lessons part out of the rent in french and flowerpainting she has made a fine rich marriage since although her eyes have often seemed to me to say ah mr t why didnt you when there was yet time and we both of us were free proposeyou know what psha where was the money my dear madam  captain bragg then occupied in building bungalow lodgebragg i say living on the first floor and entertaining seacaptains merchants and east indian friends with his grand ships plate being disappointed in a project of marrying a directors daughter who was also a second cousin once removed of a peersent in a fury for mrs cammysole his landlady and proposed to marry flora offhand and settle four hundred a year upon her flora was ordered from the backparlor the groundfloor occupies the secondfloor bedroom and was on the spot made acquainted with the splendid offer which the firstfloor had made her she has been mrs captain bragg these twelve years  bragg to this day wears anchorbuttons and has a dresscoat with a gold strap for epaulets in case he should have a fancy to sport them his house is covered with portraits busts and miniatures of himself his wife is made to wear one of the latter on his sideboard are pieces of plate presented by the passengers of the ram chunder to captain bragg the ram chunder east indiaman in a gale off table bay the outwardbound fleet under convoy of her majestys frigate loblollyboy captain gutch beating off the french squadron under commodore leloup the ram chunder se by e is represented engaged with the mirliton corvette the ram chunder standing into the hooghly with captain bragg his telescope and speakingtrumpet on the poop captain bragg presenting the officers of the ram chunder to general bonaparte at st helenatitmarsh this fine piece was painted by me when i was in favor with bragg in a word bragg and the ram chunder are all over the house  although i have eaten scores of dinners at captain braggs charge yet his hospitality is so insolent that none of us who frequent his mahogany feel any obligation to our braggart entertainer  after he has given one of his great heavy dinners he always takes an opportunity to tell you in the most public way how many bottles of wine were drunk his pleasure is to make his guests tipsy and to tell everybody how and when the period of inebriation arose and miss clapperclaw tells me that he often comes over laughing and giggling to her and pretending that he has brought me into this conditiona calumny which i fling contemptuously in his face  he scarcely gives any but mens parties and invites the whole club home to dinner what is the compliment of being asked when the whole club is asked too i should like to know mens parties are only good for boys i hate a dinner where there are no women bragg sits at the head of his table and bullies the solitary mrs bragg  he entertains us with stories of storms which he bragg encounteredof dinners which he bragg has received from the governorgeneral of indiaof jokes which he bragg has heard and however stale or odious they may be poor mrs b is always expected to laugh  woe be to her if she doesnt or if she laughs at anybody elses jokes i have seen bragg go up to her and squeeze her arm with a savage grind of his teeth and say with an oath hang it madam how dare you laugh when any man but your husband speaks to you i forbid you to grin in that way i forbid you to look sulky i forbid you to look happy or to look up or to keep your eyes down to the ground i desire you will not be trapesing through the rooms i order you not to sit as still as a stone he curses her if the wine is corked or if the dinner is spoiled or if she comes a minute too soon to the club for him or arrives a minute too late he forbids her to walk except upon his arm and the consequence of his ill treatment is that mrs cammysole and mrs bragg respect him beyond measure and think him the first of human beings  i never knew a woman who was constantly bullied by her husband who did not like him the better for it miss clapperclaw says and though this speech has some of clapps usual sardonic humor in it i cant but think there is some truth in the remark   levant house chambers  mr rumbold ara and miss rumbold   when lord levant quitted the country and this neighborhood in which the tradesmen still deplore him no 56 known as levantine house was let to the pococurante club which was speedily bankrupt for we are too far from the centre of town to support a club of our own it was subsequently hired by the west diddlesex railroad and is now divided into sets of chambers superintended by an acrimonious housekeeper and by a porter in a sham livery whom if you dont find him at the door you may as well seek at the grapes publichouse in the little lane round the corner he varnishes the japanboots of the dandy lodgers reads mr pinkneys morning post before he lets him have it and neglects the letters of the inmates of the chambers generally  the great rooms which were occupied as the salons of the noble levant the coffeerooms of the pococurante a club where the play was furious as i am told and the boardroom and managersroom of the west diddlesex are tenanted now by a couple of artists young pinkney the miniaturist and george rumbold the historical painter miss rumbold his sister lives with him by the way but with that young lady of course we have nothing to do  i knew both these gentlemen at rome where george wore a velvet doublet and a beard down to his chest and used to talk about high art at the caffe greco how it smelled of smoke that velveteen doublet of his with which his stringy red beard was likewise perfumed it was in his studio that i had the honor to be introduced to his sister the fair miss clara she had a large casque with a red horsehair plume i thought it had been a wisp of her brothers beard at first and held a tinheaded spear in her hand representing a roman warrior in the great picture of caractacus george was paintinga piece sixtyfour feet by eighteen the roman warrior blushed to be discovered in that attitude the tinheaded spear trembled in the whitest arm in the world so she put it down and taking off the helmet also went and sat in a far corner of the studio mending georges stockings whilst we smoked a couple of pipes and talked about raphael being a good deal overrated  i think he is and have never disguised my opinion about the transfiguration and all the time we talked there were claras eyes looking lucidly out from the dark corner in which she was sitting working away at the stockings the lucky fellow they were in a dreadful state of bad repair when she came out to him at rome after the death of their father the reverend miles rumbold  george while at rome painted caractacus a picture of non angli sed angeli of course a picture of alfred in the neatherds cottage seventytwo feet by fortyeightan idea of the gigantic size and michelangelesque proportions of this picture may be formed when i state that the mere muffin of which the outcast king is spoiling the baking is two feet three in diameter and the deaths of socrates of remus and of the christians under nero respectively i shall never forget how lovely clara looked in white muslin with her hair down in this latter picture giving herself up to a ferocious carnifex for which bob gaunter the architect sat and refusing to listen to the mild suggestions of an insinuating flamen which character was a gross caricature of myself  none of georges pictures sold he has enough to tapestry trafalgar square he has painted since he came back to england the flaying of marsyas the smothering of the little boys in the tower a plague scene during the great pestilence ugolino on the seventh day after he was deprived of victuals c for although these pictures have great merit and the writhings of marsyas the convulsions of the little prince the look of agony of st lawrence on the gridiron c are quite true to nature yet the subjects somehow are not agreeable and if he hadnt a small patrimony my friend george would starve  fondness for art leads me a great deal to his studio george is a gentleman and has very good friends and good pluck too when we were at rome there was a great row between him and young heeltap lord boxmoors son who was uncivil to miss rumbold the young scoundrelhad i been a fighting man i should like to have shot him myself lady betty bulbul is very fond of clara and tom bulbul who took georges message to heeltap is always hanging about the studio at least i know that i find the young jackanapes there almost every day bringing a new novel or some poisonous french poetry or a basket of flowers or grapes with lady bettys love to her dear claraa young rascal with white kids and his hair curled every morning what business has he to be dangling about george rumbolds premises and sticking up his ugly pugface as a model for all georges pictures  miss clapperclaw says bulbul is evidently smitten and clara too what would she put up with such a little fribble as that when there is a man of intellect and taste whobut i wont believe it it is all the jealousy of women   some of the servants in our street   these gentlemen have two clubs in our quarterfor the butlers at the indiaman and for the gents in livery at the pocklington armsof either of which societies i should like to be a member i am sure they could not be so dull as our club at the poluphloisboio where one meets the same neat clean respectable old fogies every day  but with the best wishes it is impossible for the present writer to join either the plate club or the uniform club as these reunions are designated for one could not shake hands with a friend who was standing behind your chair or nod a howdyedo to the butler who was pouring you out a glass of wineso that what i know about the gents in our neighborhood is from mere casual observation for instance i have a slight acquaintance with 1 thomas spavin who commonly wears an air of injured innocence and is groom to mr joseph green of our street i tell why the brougham oss is out of condition and why desperation broke out all in a lather osses will this eavy weather and desperation was always the most mystest hoss i ever seei take him out with mr andersons oundsim above it i allis was too timid to ride to ounds by natur and colonel sprigs groom as says he saw me is a liar c c  such is the tenor of mr spavins remarks to his master whereas all the world in our street knows that mr spavin spends at least a hundred a year in beer that he keeps a bettingbook that he has lent mr greens black brougham horse to the omnibus driver and at a time when mr g supposed him at the veterinary surgeons has lent him to a livery stable which has let him out to that gentleman himself and actually driven him to dinner behind his own horse  this conduct i can understand but i cannot excusemr spavin may and i leave the matter to be settled betwixt himself and mr green  the second is monsieur sinbad mr clarence bulbuls man whom we all hate clarence for keeping  mr sinbad is a foreigner speaking no known language but a mixture of every european dialectso that he may be an italian brigand or a tyrolese minstrel or a spanish smuggler for what we know i have heard say that he is neither of these but an irish jew  he wears studs hairoil jewellery and linen shirtfronts very finely embroidered but not particular for whiteness he generally appears in faded velvet waistcoats of a morning and is always perfumed with stale tobacco he wears large rings on his hands which look as if he kept them up the chimney  he does not appear to do anything earthly for clarence bulbul except to smoke his cigars and to practise on his guitar he will not answer a bell nor fetch a glass of water nor go of an errand on which au reste clarence dares not send him being entirely afraid of his servant and not daring to use him or to abuse him or to send him away  3 adamsmr champignons mana good old man in an old livery coat with old worsted laceso very old deaf surly and faithful that you wonder how he should have got into the family at all who never kept a footman till last year when they came into the street  miss clapperclaw says she believes adams to be mrs champignons father and he certainly has a look of that lady as miss c pointed out to me at dinner one night whilst old adams was blundering about amongst the hired men from gunters and falling over the silver dishes  4 fipps the buttoniest page in all the street walks behind mrs grimsby with her prayerbook and protects her  if that woman wants a protector a female acquaintance remarks heaven be good to us she is as big as an ogress and has an upper lip which many a cornet of the lifeguards might envy her poor dear husband was a big man and she could beat him easily and did too mrs grimsby indeed why my dear mr titmarsh it is glumdalca walking with tom thumb  this observation of miss cs is very true and mrs grimsby might carry her prayerbook to church herself but miss clapperclaw who is pretty well able to take care of herself too was glad enough to have the protection of the page when she went out in the fly to pay visits and before mrs grimsby and she quarrelled at whist at lady pocklingtons  after this merely parenthetic observation we come to 5 one of her ladyships large men mr jeamesa gentleman of vast stature and proportions who is almost nose to nose with us as we pass her ladyships door on the outside of the omnibus i think jeames has a contempt for a man whom he witnesses in that position i have fancied something like that feeling showed itself as far as it may in a wellbred gentleman accustomed to society in his behavior while waiting behind my chair at dinner  but i take jeames to be like most giants goodnatured lazy stupid softhearted and extremely fond of drink one night his lady being engaged to dinner at nightingale house i saw mr jeames resting himself on a bench at the pocklington arms where as he had no liquor before him he had probably exhausted his credit  little spitfire mr clarence bulbuls boy the wickedest little varlet that ever hung on to a cab was chaffing mr jeames holding up to his face a pot of porter almost as big as the young potifer himself  vill you now bigun or vont you spitfire said if youre thirsty vy dont you say so and squench it old boy  dont ago on making fun of mei cant abear chaffin was the reply of mr jeames and tears actually stood in his fine eyes as he looked at the porter and the screeching little imp before him  spitfire real name unknown gave him some of the drink i am happy to say jeamess face wore quite a different look when it rose gasping out of the porter and i judge of his dispositions from the above trivial incident  the last boy in the sketch 6 need scarcely be particularized doctors boy was a charityboy stripes evidently added on to a pair of the doctors clothes of last yearmiss clapperclaw pointed this out to me with a giggle nothing escapes that old woman  as we were walking in kensington gardens she pointed me out mrs braggs nurserymaid who sings so loud at church engaged with a lifeguardsman whom she was trying to convert probably my virtuous friend rose indignant at the sight  thats why these minxes like kensington gardens she cried look at the woman she leaves the baby on the grass for the giant to trample upon and that little wretch of a hastings bragg is riding on the monsters cane  miss c flew up and seized the infant waking it out of its sleep and causing all the gardens to echo with its squalling ill teach you to be impudent to me she said to the nurserymaid with whom my vivacious old friend i suppose has had a difference and she would not release the infant until she had rung the bell of bungalow lodge where she gave it up to the footman  the giant in scarlet had slunk down towards knightsbridge meanwhile the big rogues are always crossing the park and the gardens and hankering about our street   what sometimes happens in our street   it was before old hunkingtons house that the mutes were standing as i passed and saw this group at the door the charityboy with the hoop is the son of the jollylooking mute he admires his father who admires himself too in those brannew sables the other infants are the spawn of the alleys about our street only the parson and the typhus fever visit those mysterious haunts which lie crouched about our splendid houses like lazarus at the threshold of dives  those little ones come crawling abroad in the sunshine to the annoyance of the beadles and the horror of a number of good people in the street they will bring up the rear of the procession anon when the grand omnibus with the feathers and the line coaches with the longtailed black horses and the gentlemans private carriages with the shutters up pass along to saint waltheofs  you can hear the slow bell tolling clear in the sunshine already mingling with the crowing of punch who is passing down the street with his show and the two musics make a queer medley  not near so many people i remark engage punch now as in the good old times i suppose our quarter is growing too genteel for him  miss bridget jones a poor curates daughter in wales comes into all hunkingtons property and will take his name as i am told nobody ever heard of her before i am sure captain hunkington and his brother barnwell hunkington must wish that the lucky young lady had never been heard of to the present day  but they will have the consolation of thinking that they did their duty by their uncle and consoled his declining years it was but last month that millwood hunkington the captain sent the old gentleman a service of plate and mrs barnwell got a reclining carriage at a great expense from hobbs and dobbss in which the old gentleman went out only once  it is a punishment on those hunkingtons miss clapperclaw remarks upon those people who have been always living beyond their little incomes and always speculating upon what the old man would leave them and always coaxing him with presents which they could not afford and he did not want it is a punishment upon those hunkingtons to be so disappointed  think of giving him plate miss c justly says who had chestsfull and sending him a carriage who could afford to buy all long acre and everything goes to miss jones hunkington i wonder will she give the things back miss clapperclaw asks i wouldnt  and indeed i dont think miss clapperclaw would   somebody whom nobody knows   that pretty little house the last in pocklington square was lately occupied by a young widow lady who wore a pink bonnet a short silk dress sustained by a crinoline and a light blue mantle or overjacket miss c is not here to tell me the name of the garment or else a black velvet pelisse a yellow shawl and a white bonnet or elsebut never mind the dress which seemed to be of the handsomest sort money could buyand who had very long glossy black ringlets and a peculiarly brilliant complexionno 96 pocklington square i say was lately occupied by a widow lady named mrs stafford molyneux  the very first day on which an intimate and valued female friend of mine saw mrs stafford molyneux stepping into a brougham with a splendid bay horse and without a footman mark if you please that delicate sign of respectability and after a moments examination of mrs s ms toilette her manners little dog carnationcolored parasol c miss elizabeth clapperclaw clapped to the operaglass with which she had been regarding the new inhabitant of our street came away from the window in a great flurry and began poking her fire in a fit of virtuous indignation  shes very pretty said i who had been looking over miss cs shoulder at the widow with the flashing eyes and drooping ringlets  hold your tongue sir said miss clapperclaw tossing up her virgin head with an indignant blush on her nose its a sin and a shame that such a creature should be riding in her carriage forsooth when honest people must go on foot  subsequent observations confirmed my revered fellowlodgers anger and opinion we have watched hansom cabs standing before that ladys house for hours we have seen broughams with great flaring eyes keeping watch there in the darkness we have seen the vans from the comestibleshops drive up and discharge loads of wines groceries french plums and other articles of luxurious horror we have seen count wowskis drag lord martingales carriage mr deuceaces cab drive up there time after time and having remarked previously the pastrycooks men arrive with the trays and entrees we have known that this widow was giving dinners at the little house in pocklington squaredinners such as decent people could not hope to enjoy  my excellent friend has been in a perfect fury when mrs stafford molyneux in a black velvet ridinghabit with a hat and feather has come out and mounted an odious gray horse and has cantered down the street followed by her groom upon a bay  it wont last longit must end in shame and humiliation my dear miss c has remarked disappointed that the tiles and chimneypots did not fall down upon mrs stafford molyneuxs head and crush that cantering audacious woman  but it was a consolation to see her when she walked out with a french maid a couple of children and a little dog hanging on to her by a blue ribbon she always held down her head thenher head with the drooping black ringlets the virtuous and welldisposed avoided her i have seen the squarekeeper himself look puzzled as she passed and lady kicklebury walking by with miss k her daughter turn away from mrs stafford molyneux and fling back at her a ruthless parthian glance that ought to have killed any woman of decent sensibility  that wretched woman meanwhile with her rouged cheeks for rouge it is miss clapperclaw swears and who is a better judge has walked on conscious and yet somehow braving out the street you could read pride of her beauty pride of her fine clothes shame of her position in her downcast black eyes  as for mademoiselle trampoline her french maid she would stare the sun itself out of countenance one day she tossed up her head as she passed under our windows with a look of scorn that drove miss clapperclaw back to the fireplace again  it was mrs stafford molyneuxs children however whom i pitied the most once her boy in a flaring tartan went up to speak to master roderick lacy whose maid was engaged ogling a policeman and the children were going to make friends being united with a hoop which master molyneux had when master rodericks maid rushing up clutched her charge to her arms and hurried away leaving little molyneux sad and wondering  why wont he play with me mamma master molyneux askedand his mothers face blushed purple as she walked away  ahheaven help us and forgive us said i but miss c can never forgive the mother or child and she clapped her hands for joy one day when we saw the shutters up bills in the windows a carpet hanging out over the balcony and a crowd of shabby jews about the stepsgiving token that the reign of mrs stafford molyneux was over the pastrycooks and their trays the bay and the gray the brougham and the groom the noblemen and their cabs were all gone and the tradesmen in the neighborhood were crying out that they were done  serve the odious minx right says miss c and she played at piquet that night with more vigor than i have known her manifest for these last ten years  what is it that makes certain old ladies so savage upon certain subjects miss c is a good woman pays her rent and her tradesmen gives plenty to the poor is brisk with her tonguekindhearted in the main but if mrs stafford molyneux and her children were plunged into a caldron of boiling vinegar i think my revered friend would not take them out   the man in possession   for another misfortune which occurred in our street we were much more compassionate we liked danby dixon and his wife fanny dixon still more miss c had a paper of biscuits and a box of preserved apricots always in the cupboard ready for dixons childrenprovisions by the way which she locked up under mrs cammysoles nose so that our landlady could by no possibility lay a hand on them  dixon and his wife had the neatest little house possible no 16 opposite 96 and were liked and respected by the whole street he was called dandy dixon when he was in the dragoons and was a light weight and rather famous as a gentleman rider on his marriage he sold out and got fat and was indeed a florid contented and jovial gentleman  his little wife was charmingto see her in pink with some miniature dixons in pink too round about her or in that beautiful gray dress with the deep black lace flounces which she wore at my lord comandines on the night of the private theatricals would have done any man good to hear her sing any of my little ballads knowest thou the willowtree for instance or the rose upon my balcony or the humming of the honeybee far superior in my judgment and in that of some good judges likewise to that humbug clarence bulbuls balladsto hear her i say sing these was to be in a sort of small elysium dear dear little fanny dixon she was like a little chirping bird of paradise it was a shame that storms should ever ruffle such a tender plumage  well never mind about sentiment danby dixon the owner of this little treasure an excaptain of dragoons and having nothing to do and a small income wisely thought he would employ his spare time and increase his revenue he became a director of the cornaro life insurance company of the tregulpho tinmines and of four or five railroad companies it was amusing to see him swaggering about the city in his clinking boots and with his high and mighty dragoon manners for a time his talk about shares after dinner was perfectly intolerable and i for one was always glad to leave him in the company of sundry very dubious capitalists who frequented his house and walk up to hear mrs fanny warbling at the piano with her little children about her knees  it was only last season that they set up a carriagethe modestest little vehicle conceivabledriven by kirby who had been in dixons troop in the regiment and had followed him into private life as coachman footman and page  one day lately i went into dixons house hearing that some calamities had befallen him the particulars of which miss clapperclaw was desirous to know the creditors of the tregulpho mines had got a verdict against him as one of the directors of that company the engineer of the little diddlesex junction had sued him for two thousand three hundred poundsthe charges of that scientific man for six weeks labor in surveying the line his brother directors were to be discovered nowhere windham dodgin mizzlington and the rest were all gone long ago  when i entered the door was open there was a smell of smoke in the diningroom where a gentleman at noonday was seated with a pipe and a pot of beer a man in possession indeed in that comfortable pretty parlor by that snug round table where i have so often seen fanny dixons smiling face  kirby the exdragoon was scowling at the fellow who lay upon a little settee reading the newspaper with an evident desire to kill him mrs kirby his wife held little danby poor dixons son and heir dixons portrait smiled over the sideboard still and his wife was up stairs in an agony of fear with the poor little daughters of this bankrupt broken family  this poor soul had actually come down and paid a visit to the man in possession she had sent wine and dinner to the gentleman down stairs as she called him in her terror she had tried to move his heart by representing to him how innocent captain dixon was and how he had always paid and always remained at home when everybody else had fled as if her tears and simple tales and entreaties could move that man in possession out of the house or induce him to pay the costs of the action which her husband had lost  danby meanwhile was at boulogne sickening after his wife and children they sold everything in his houseall his smart furniture and neat little stock of plate his wardrobe and his linen the property of a gentleman gone abroad his carriage by the best maker and his wine selected without regard to expense his house was shut up as completely as his opposite neighbors and a new tenant is just having it fresh painted inside and out as if poor dixon had left an infection behind  kirby and his wife went across the water with the children and mrs fannyshe has a small settlement and i am bound to say that our mutual friend miss elizabeth c went down with mrs dixon in the fly to the tower stairs and stopped in lombard street by the way  so it is that the world wags that honest men and knaves alike are always having ups and downs of fortune and that we are perpetually changing tenants in our street   the lion of the street   what people can find in clarence bulbul who has lately taken upon himself the rank and dignity of lion of our street i have always been at a loss to conjecture  he has written an eastern book of considerable merit miss clapperclaw says but hang it has not everybody written an eastern book i should like to meet anybody in society now who has not been up to the second cataract an eastern book forsooth my lord castleroyal has done onean honest one my lord youngent anotheran amusing one my lord woolsey anothera pious one there is the cutlet and the caboba sentimental one timbuctoothena humorous one all ludicrously overrated in my opinion not including my own little book of which a copy or two is still to be had by the way  well then clarence bulbul because he has made part of the little tour that all of us know comes back and gives himself airs forsooth and howls as if he were just out of the great libyan desert  when we go and see him that irish jew courier whom i have before had the honor to describe looks up from the novel which he is reading in the anteroom and says mon maitre est au divan or monsieur trouvera monsieur dans son serail and relapses into the comte de montecristo again  yes the impudent wretch has actually a room in his apartments on the groundfloor of his mothers house which he calls his harem when lady betty bulbul they are of the nightingale family or miss blanche comes down to visit him their slippers are placed at the door and he receives them on an ottoman and these infatuated women will actually light his pipe for him  little spitfire the groom hangs about the drawingroom outside the harem forsooth so that he may be ready when clarence bulbul claps hands for him to bring the pipes and coffee  he has coffee and pipes for everybody i should like you to have seen the face of old bowly his collegetutor called upon to sit crosslegged on a divan a little cup of bitter black mocha put into his hand and a large ambermuzzled pipe stuck into his mouth by spitfire before he could so much as say it was a fine day bowly almost thought he had compromised his principles by consenting so far to this turkish manner  bulbuls dinners are i own very good his pilaffs and curries excellent he tried to make us eat rice with our fingers it is true but he scalded his own hands in the business and invariably bedizened his shirt so he has left off the turkish practice for dinner at least and uses a fork like a christian  but it is in society that he is most remarkable and here he would i own be odious but he becomes delightful because all the men hate him so a perfect chorus of abuse is raised round about him confounded impostor says one impudent jackass says another miserable puppy cries a third id like to wring his neck says bruff scowling over his shoulder at him clarence meanwhile nods winks smiles and patronizes them all with the easiest goodhumor he is a fellow who would poke an archbishop in the apron or clap a duke on the shoulder as coolly as he would address you and me  i saw him the other night at mrs bumpshers grand letoff he flung himself down crosslegged on a pink satin sofa so that you could see mrs bumpsher quiver with rage in the distance bruff growl with fury from the further room and miss pim on whose frock bulbuls feet rested look up like a timid fawn  fan me miss pim said he of the cushion you look like a perfect peri tonight you remind me of a girl i once knew in circassiaameena the sister of schamyl bey do you know miss pim that you would fetch twenty thousand piastres in the market at constantinople  law mr bulbul is all miss pim can ejaculate and having talked over miss pim clarence goes off to another houri whom he fascinates in a similar manner he charmed mrs waddy by telling her that she was the exact figure of the pasha of egypts second wife he gave miss tokely a piece of the sack in which zuleika was drowned and he actually persuaded that poor little silly miss vain to turn mahometan and sent her up to the turkish ambassadors to look out for a mufti   the dove of our street   if bulbul is our lion young oriel may be described as the dove of our colony he is almost as great a pasha among the ladies as bulbul they crowd in flocks to see him at saint waltheofs where the immense height of his forehead the rigid asceticism of his surplice the twang with which he intones the service and the nambypamby mysticism of his sermons have turned all the dear girls heads for some time past while we were having a rubber at mrs chauntrys whose daughters are following the new mode i heard the following talk which made me revoke by the way going on in what was formerly called the young ladies room but is now styled the oratory   the oratory  miss chauntry miss isabel

totorooome miss de laisle bursts into tears  rev o slocummy lord i have the highest club which gives the trick and two by honors   thus you see we have a variety of clergymen in our street mr oriel is of the pointed gothic school while old slocum is of the good old tawny portwine school and it must be confessed that mr gronow at ebenezer has a hearty abhorrence for both  as for gronow i pity him if his future lot should fall where mr oriel supposes that it will  and as for oriel he has not even the benefit of purgatory which he would accord to his neighbor ebenezer while old slocum pronounces both to be a couple of humbugs and mr mole the demure little beetlebrowed chaplain of the little church of avemary lane keeps his sly eyes down to the ground when he passes any one of his blackcoated brethren  there is only one point on which my friends they seem agreed slocum likes port but who ever heard that he neglected his poor gronow if he comminates his neighbors congregation is the affectionate father of his own oriel if he loves pointed gothic and parched peas for breakfast has a prodigious soupkitchen for his poor and as for little father mole who never lifts his eyes from the ground ask our doctor at what bedsides he finds him and how he soothes poverty and braves misery and infection   the bumpshers   no 6 pocklington gardens the house with the quantity of flowers in the windows and the awning over the entrance george bumpsher esquire mp for humborough and the beanstalks kent  for some time after this gorgeous family came into our quarter i mistook a baldheaded stout person whom i used to see looking through the flowers on the upper windows for bumpsher himself or for the butler of the family whereas it was no other than mrs bumpsher without her chestnut wig and who is at least three times the size of her husband  the bumpshers and the house of mango at the pineries vie together in their desire to dominate over the neighborhood and each votes the other a vulgar and purseproud family the fact is both are city people bumpsher in his mercantile capacity is a wholesale stationer in thames street and his wife was the daughter of an eminent billbroking firm not a thousand miles from lombard street  he does not sport a coronet and supporters upon his london plate and carriages but his countryhouse is emblazoned all over with those heraldic decorations he puts on an order when he goes abroad and is count bumpsher of the roman stateswhich title he purchased from the late pope through prince polonia the banker for a couple of thousand scudi  it is as good as a coronation to see him and mrs bumpsher go to court i wonder the carriage can hold them both on those days mrs bumpsher holds her own drawingroom before her majestys and we are invited to come and see her sitting in state upon the largest sofa in her rooms she has need of a stout one i promise you her very feathers must weigh something considerable the diamonds on her stomacher would embroider a fullsized carpetbag she has rubies ribbons cameos emeralds gold serpents opals and valenciennes lace as if she were an immense sample out of howell and jamess shop  she took up with little pinkney at rome where he made a charming picture of her representing her as about eighteen with a cherub in her lap who has some liking to bryanstone bumpsher her enormous vulgar son now a cornet in the blues and anything but a cherub as those would say who saw him in his uniform jacket  i remember pinkney when he was painting the picture bryanstone being then a youth in what they call a skeleton suit as if such a pig of a child could ever have been dressed in anything resembling a skeletoni remember i say mrs b sitting to pinkney in a sort of egerian costume her boy by her side whose head the artist turned round and directed it towards a piece of gingerbread which he was to have at the end of the sitting  pinkney indeed a paintera contemptible little humbug a parasite of the great he has painted mrs bumpsher younger every year for these last ten yearsand you see in the advertisements of all her parties his odious little name stuck in at the end of the list im sure for my part id scorn to enter her doors or be the toady of any woman   jolly newboy esq mp   how different it is with the newboys now where i have an entree having indeed had the honor in former days to give lessons to both the ladiesand where such a quack as pinkney would never be allowed to enter a merrier house the whole quarter cannot furnish it is there you meet people of all ranks and degrees not only from our quarter but from the rest of the town it is there that our great man the right honorable lord comandine came up and spoke to me in so encouraging a manner that i hope to be invited to one of his lordships excellent dinners of which i shall not fail to give a very flattering description before the season is over it is there you find yourself talking to statesmen poets and artistsnot sham poets like bulbul or quack artists like that pinkneybut to the best members of all society it is there i made this sketch while miss chesterforth was singing a deeptoned tragic ballad and her mother scowling behind her what a buzz and clack and chatter there was in the room to be sure when miss chesterforth sings everybody begins to talk hicks and old fogy were on ireland bass was roaring into old pumps ears or into his horn rather about the navigation laws i was engaged talking to the charming mrs short while charley bonham a mere prig in whom i am surprised that the women can see anything was pouring out his fulsome rhapsodies in the ears of diana white lovely lovely diana white were it not for three or four other engagements i know a heart that would suit you to a t  newboys i pronounce to be the jolliest house in the street he has only of late had a rush of prosperity and turned parliament man for his distant cousin of the ancient house of newboy of shire dying fredthen making believe to practise at the bar and living with the utmost modesty in grays inn roadfound himself master of a fortune and a great house in the country of which getting tired as in the course of nature he should he came up to london and took that fine mansion in our gardens he represents mumborough in parliament a seat which has been time out of mind occupied by a newboy  though he does not speak being a great deal too rich sensible and lazy he somehow occupies himself with reading bluebooks and indeed talks a great deal too much good sense of late over his dinnertable where there is always a cover for the present writer  he falls asleep pretty assiduously too after that meala practice which i can well pardon in himfor between ourselves his wife maria newboy and his sister clarissa are the loveliest and kindest of their sex and i would rather hear their innocent prattle and lively talk about their neighbors than the best wisdom from the wisest man that ever wore a beard  like a wise and good man he leaves the question of his household entirely to the women they like going to the play they like going to greenwich they like coming to a party at bachelors hall they are up to all sorts of fun in a word in which taste the goodnatured newboy acquiesces provided he is left to follow his own  it was only on the 17th of the month that having had the honor to dine at the house when after dinner which took place at eight we left newboy to his bluebooks and went up stairs and sang a little to the guitar afterwardsit was only on the 17th december the night of lady sowerbys party that the following dialogue took place in the boudoir whither newboy bluebooks in hand had ascended  he was curled up with his house of commons boots on his wifes armchair reading his eternal bluebooks when mrs n entered from her apartment dressed for the evening  mrs nfrederick wont you come  mr nwhere  mrs nto lady sowerbys  mr nid rather go to the black hole in calcutta besides this sanitary report is really the most interestinghe begins to read  mrs npiquedwell mr titmarsh will go with us  mr nwill he i wish him joy  at this juncture miss clarissa newboy enters in a pink paletot trimmed with swansdownlooking like an angeland we exchange glances ofwhat shall i sayof sympathy on both parts and consummate rapture on mine but this is byplay  mrs ngood night frederick i think we shall be late  mr nyou wont wake me i dare say and you dont expect a public man to sit up  mrs nits not you its the servants cocker sleeps very heavily the maids are best in bed and are all ill with the influenza i say frederick dear dont you think you had better give me your chubb key  this astonishing proposal which violates every recognized law of societythis demand which alters all the existing state of thingsthis fact of a woman asking for a doorkey struck me with a terror which i cannot describe and impressed me with the fact of the vast progress of our street the doorkey what would our grandmothers who dwelt in this place when it was a rustic suburb think of its condition now when husbands stay at home and wives go abroad with the latchkey  the evening at lady sowerbys was the most delicious we have spent for long long days  thus it will be seen that everybody of any consideration in our street takes a line mrs minimy 34 takes the homoeopathic line and has soirees of doctors of that faith lady pocklington takes the capitalist line and those stupid and splendid dinners of hers are devoured by loancontractors and railroad princes mrs trimmer 38 comes out in the scientific line and indulges us in rational evenings where history is the lightest subject admitted and geology and the sanitary condition of the metropolis form the general themes of conversation mrs brumby plays finely on the bassoon and has evenings dedicated to sebastian bach and enlivened with handel at mrs maskleyns they are mad for charades and theatricals  they performed last christmas in a french piece by alexandre dumas i believela duchesse de montefiasco of which i forget the plot but everybody was in love with everybody elses wife except the hero don alonzo who was ardently attached to the duchess who turned out to be his grandmother the piece was translated by lord fiddlefaddle tom bulbul being the don alonzo and mrs roland calidore who never misses an opportunity of acting in a piece in which she can let down her hair was the duchess   alonzo  you know how well he loves you and you wonder to see alonzo suffer cunegundaask if the chamois suffer when they feel plunged in their panting sides the hunters steel or when the soaring heron or eagle proud pierced by my shaft comes tumbling from the cloud ask if the royal birds no anguish know the victims of alonzos twanging bow then ask him if he suffershim who dies pierced by the poisoned glance that glitters from your eyes  he staggers from the effect of the poison  the duchess  alonzo lovesalonzo loves and whom his grandmother oh hide me gracious tomb  her grace faints away   such acting as tom bulbuls i never saw tom lisps atrociously and uttered the passage you athk me if i thuffer in the most absurd way miss clapperclaw says he acted pretty well and that i only joke about him because i am envious and wanted to act a part myselfi envious indeed  but of all the assemblies feastings junketings dejeunes soirees conversaziones dinnerparties in our street i know of none pleasanter than the banquets at tom fairfaxs one of which this enormous provisionconsumer gives seven times a week he lives in one of the little houses of the old waddilove street quarter built long before pocklington square and pocklington gardens and the pocklington family itself had made their appearance in this world  tom though he has a small income and lives in a small house yet sits down one of a party of twelve to dinner every day of his life these twelve consisting of mrs fairfax the nine misses fairfax and master thomas fairfaxthe son and heir to twopence halfpenny a year  it is awkward just now to go and beg potluck from such a family as this because though a guest is always welcome we are thirteen at tablean unlucky number it is said this evil is only temporary and will be remedied presently when the family will be thirteen without the occasional guest to judge from all appearances  early in the morning mrs fairfax rises and cuts bread and butter from six oclock till eight during which time the nursery operations upon the nine little graces are going on if his wife has to rise early to cut the bread and butter i warrant fairfax must be up betimes to earn it he is a clerk in a government office to which duty he trudges daily refusing even twopenny omnibuses every time he goes to the shoemakers he has to order eleven pairs of shoes and so cant afford to spare his own he teaches the children latin every morning and is already thinking when tom shall be inducted into that language he works in his garden for an hour before breakfast his work over by three oclock he tramps home at four and exchanges his dapper coat for his dressinggowna ragged but honorable garment  which is the best his old coat or sir johns brannew one which is the most comfortable and becoming mrs fairfaxs black velvet gown which she has worn at the pocklington square parties these twelve years and in which i protest she looks like a queen or that new robe which the milliner has just brought home to mrs bumpshers and into which she will squeeze herself on christmasday  miss clapperclaw says that we are all so charmingly contented with ourselves that not one of us would change with his neighbor and so rich and poor high and low one person is about as happy as another in our street     doctor birch and his young friends  by mr m a titmarsh   the doctor and his staff   there is no need to say why i became assistantmaster and professor of the english and french languages flowerpainting and the german flute in doctor birchs academy at rodwell regis good folks may depend on this that it was not for choice that i left lodgings near london and a genteel society for an undermasters desk in that old school i promise you the fare at the ushers table the getting up at five oclock in the morning the walking out with little boys in the fields who used to play me tricks and never could be got to respect my awful and responsible character as teacher in the school miss birchs vulgar insolence jack birchs glum condescension and the poor old doctors patronage were not matters in themselves pleasurable and that that patronage and those dinners were sometimes cruel hard to swallow never mindmy connection with the place is over now and i hope they have got a more efficient undermaster  jack birch rev j birch of st neots hall oxford is partner with his father the doctor and takes some of the classes about his greek i cant say much but i will construe him in latin any day a more supercilious little prig giving himself airs too about his cousin miss raby who lives with the doctor a more empty pompous little coxcomb i never saw his white neckcloth looked as if it choked him he used to try and look over that starch upon me and prince the assistant as if he were a couple of footmen he didnt do much business in the school but occupied his time in writing sanctified letters to the boys parents and in composing dreary sermons to preach to them  the real master of the school is prince an oxford man too shy haughty and learned crammed with greek and a quantity of useless learning uncommonly kind to the small boys pitiless with the fools and the braggarts respected of all for his honesty his learning his bravery for he hit out once in a boatrow in a way which astonished the boys and the bargemen and for a latent power about him which all saw and confessed somehow jack birch could never look him in the face old miss z dared not put off any of her airs upon him miss rosa made him the lowest of curtsies miss raby said she was afraid of him good old prince we have sat many a night smoking in the doctors harnessroom whither we retired when our boys were gone to bed and our cares and canes put by  after jack birch had taken his degree at oxforda process which he effected with great difficultythis place which used to be called birchs dr birchs academy and what not became suddenly archbishop wigsbys college of rodwell regis they took down the old blue board with the gold letters which has been used to mend the pigsty since birch had a large schoolroom run up in the gothic taste with statuettes and a little belfry and a bust of archbishop wigsby in the middle of the school he put the six senior boys into caps and gowns which had rather a good effect as the lads sauntered down the street of the town but which certainly provoked the contempt and hostility of the bargemen and so great was his rage for academic costumes and ordinances that he would have put me myself into a lay gown with red knots and fringes but that i flatly resisted and said that a writingmaster had no business with such paraphernalia  by the way i have forgotten to mention the doctor himself and what shall i say of him well he has a very crisp gown and bands a solemn aspect a tremendous loud voice and a grand air with the boys parents whom he receives in a study covered round with the bestbound books which imposes upon manyupon the women especiallyand makes them fancy that this is a doctor indeed but law bless you he never reads the books or opens one of them except that in which he keeps his bandsa dugdales monasticon which looks like a book but is in reality a cupboard where he has his port almondcakes and decanter of wine he gets up his classics with translations or what the boys call cribs they pass wicked tricks upon him when he hears the forms the elder wags go to his study and ask him to help them in hard bits of herodotus or thucydides he says he will look over the passage and flies for refuge to mr prince or to the crib  he keeps the flogging department in his own hands finding that his son was too savage he has awful brows and a big voice but his roar frightens nobody it is only a lions skin or so to say a muff  little mordant made a picture of him with large ears like a wellknown domestic animal and had his own justly boxed for the caricature the doctor discovered him in the fact and was in a flaming rage and threatened whipping at first but in the course of the day an opportune basket of game arriving from mordants father the doctor became mollified and has burnt the picture with the ears however i have one wafered up in my desk by the hand of the same little rascal   the cock of the school   i am growing an old fellow and have seen many great folks in the course of my travels and time louis philippe coming out of the tuileries his majesty the king of prussia and the reichsverweser accolading each other at cologne at my elbow admiral sir charles napier in an omnibus once the duke of wellington the immortal goethe at weimar the late benevolent pope gregory xvi and a score more of the famous in this worldthe whom whenever one looks at one has a mild shock of awe and tremor i like this feeling and decent fear and trembling with which a modest spirit salutes a great man  well i have seen generals capering on horseback at the head of their crimson battalions bishops sailing down cathedral aisles with downcast eyes pressing their trencher caps to their hearts with their fat white hands college heads when her majesty is on a visit the doctor in all his glory at the head of his school on speechday a great sight and all great men these i have never met the late mr thomas cribb but i have no doubt should have regarded him with the same feeling of awe with which i look every day at george champion the cock of dr birchs school  when i say i reflect as i go up and set him a sum that he could whop me in two minutes double up prince and the other assistant and pitch the doctor out of window i cant but think how great how generous how magnanimous a creature this is that sits quite quiet and goodnatured and works his equation and ponders through his greek play he might take the schoolroom pillars and pull the house down if he liked he might close the door and demolish every one of us like antar the lover or ibla but he lets us live he never thrashes anybody without a cause when woe betide the tyrant or the sneak  i think that to be strong and able to whop everybodynot to do it mind you but to feel that you were able to do itwould be the greatest of all gifts there is a serene good humor which plays about george champions broad face which shows the consciousness of this power and lights up his honest blue eyes with a magnanimous calm  he is invictus even when a cub there was no beating this lion six years ago the undaunted little warrior actually stood up to frank davisonthe indian officer nowpoor little charleys brother whom miss raby nursed so affectionatelythen seventeen years old and the cock of birchs they were obliged to drag off the boy and frank with admiration and regard for him prophesied the great things he would do legends of combats are preserved fondly in schools they have stories of such at rodwell regis performed in the old doctors time forty years ago  champions affair with the young tutbury pet who was down here in trainingwith black the bargemanwith the three head boys of doctor wapshots academy whom he caught maltreating an outlying dayboy of ours care known to all the rodwell regis men he was always victorious he is modest and kind like all great men he has a good brave honest understanding he cannot make verses like young pinder or read greek like wells the prefect who is a perfect young abyss of learning and knows enough prince says to furnish any six firstclass men but he does his work in a sound downright way and he is made to be the bravest of soldiers the best of country parsons an honest english gentleman wherever he may go  old champions chief friend and attendant is young jack hall whom he saved when drowning out of the millers pool the attachment of the two is curious to witness the smaller lad gambolling playing tricks round the bigger one and perpetually making fun of his protector they are never far apart and of holidays you may meet them miles away from the schoolgeorge sauntering heavily down the lanes with his big stick and little jack larking with the pretty girls in the cottagewindows  george has a boat on the river in which however he commonly lies smoking whilst jack sculls him he does not play at cricket except when the school plays the county or at lords in the holidays the boys cant stand his bowling and when he hits it is like trying to catch a cannonball i have seen him at tennis it is a splendid sight to behold the young fellow bounding over the court with streaming yellow hair like young apollo in a flannel jacket  the other head boys are lawrence the captain bunce famous chiefly for his magnificent appetite and pitman surnamed roscius for his love of the drama add to these swanky called macassar from his partiality to that condiment and who has varnished boots wears white gloves on sundays and looks out for miss pinkertons school transferred from chiswick to rodwell regis and conducted by the nieces of the late miss barbara pinkerton the friend of our great lexicographer upon the principles approved by him and practised by that admirable woman as it passes into church  representations have been made concerning mr horace swankys behavior rumors have been uttered about notes in verse conveyed in threecornered puffs by mrs ruggles who serves miss pinkertons young ladies on fridaysand how miss didow to whom the tart and enclosure were addressed tried to make away with herself by swallowing a ball of cotton but i pass over these absurd reports as likely to affect the reputation of an admirable seminary conducted by irreproachable females as they go into church miss p driving in her flock of lambkins with the crook of her parasol how can it be helped if her forces and ours sometimes collide as the boys are on their way up to the organloft and i dont believe a word about the threecornered puff but rather that it was the invention of that jealous miss birch who is jealous of miss raby jealous of everybody who is good and handsome and who has her own ends in view or i am very much in error   the dear brothers  a melodrama in several rounds   the doctor  mr tipper uncle to the masters boxall  boxall major boxall minor brown jones smith robinson tiffin minimus   b go it old boxall  j give it him young boxall  r pitch into him old boxall  s two to one on young boxall  enter tiffin minimus running  tiffin minimusboxalls youre wanted the doctor to mr tipperevery boy in the school loves them my dear sir your nephews are a credit to my establishment they are orderly wellconducted gentlemanlike boys let us enter and find them at their studies  enter the doctor and mr tipper  grand tableau   the little schoolroom   what they call the little schoolroom is a small room at the other end of the great school through which you go to the doctors private house and where miss raby sits with her pupils she has a halfdozen very small ones over whom she presides and teaches them in her simple way until they are big or learned enough to face the great schoolroom many of them are in a hurry for promotion the graceless little simpletons and know no more than their elders when they are well off  she keeps the accounts writes out the bills superintends the linen and sews on the general shirtbuttons think of having such a woman at home to sew on ones shirtbuttons but peace peace thou foolish heart  miss raby is the doctors niece her mother was a beauty quite unlike old zoe therefore and she married a pupil in the old doctors time who was killed afterwards a captain in the east india service at the siege of bhurtpore hence a number of indian children come to the doctors for raby was very much liked and the uncles kind reception of the orphan has been a good speculation for the schoolkeeper  it is wonderful how brightly and gayly that little quick creature does her duty she is the first to rise and the last to sleep if any business is to be done she sees the other two women go off to parties in the town without even so much as wishing to join them it is cinderella only contented to stay at homecontent to bear zoes scorn and to admit rosas superior charmsand to do her utmost to repay her uncle for his great kindness in housing her  so you see she works as much as three maidservants for the wages of one she is as thankful when the doctor gives her a new gown as if he had presented her with a fortune laughs at his stories most goodhumoredly listens to zoes scolding most meekly admires rosa with all her heart and only goes out of the way when jack birch shows his sallow face for she cant bear him and always finds work when he comes near  how different she is when some folks approach her i wont be presumptuous but i think i think i have made a not unfavorable impression in some quarters however let us be mum on this subject i like to see her because she always looks goodhumored because she is always kind because she is always modest because she is fond of those poor little bratsorphans some of thembecause she is rather pretty i dare say or because i think so which comes to the same thing  though she is kind to all it must be owned she shows the most gross favoritism towards the amiable children she brings them cakes from dessert and regales them with zoes preserves spends many of her little shillings in presents for her favorites and will tell them stories by the hour she has one very sad story about a little boy who died long ago the younger children are never weary of hearing about him and miss raby has shown to one of them a lock of the little chaps hair which she keeps in her workbox to this day   a hopeless case   let us people who are so uncommonly clever and learned have a great tenderness and pity for the poor folks who are not endowed with the prodigious talents which we have i have always had a regard for duncesthose of my own schooldays were amongst the pleasantest of the fellows and have turned out by no means the dullest in life whereas many a youth who could turn off latin hexameters by the yard and construe greek quite glibly is no better than a feeble prig now with not a pennyworth more brains than were in his head before his beard grew  those poor dunces talk of being the last man ah what a pang it must be to be the last boyhuge misshapen fourteen years of age and taken up by a chap who is but six years old and cant speak quite plain yet  master hulker is in that condition at birchs he is the most honest kind active plucky generous creature he can do many things better than most boys he can go up a tree pump play at cricket dive and swim perfectlyhe can eat twice as much as almost any lady as miss birch well knows he has a pretty talent at carving figures with his hackknife he makes and paints little coaches he can take a watch to pieces and put it together again he can do everything but learn his lesson and then he sticks at the bottom of the school hopeless as the little boys are drafted in from miss rabys class it is true she is one of the best instructresses in the world they enter and hop over poor hulker he would be handed over to the governess only he is too big sometimes i used to think that this desperate stupidity was a stratagem of the poor rascals and that he shammed dulness so that he might be degraded into miss rabys classif she would teach me i know before george i would put on a pinafore and a little jacketbut no it is a natural incapacity for the latin grammar  if you could see his grammar it is a perfect curiosity of dogs ears the leaves and cover are all curled and ragged many of the pages are worn away with the rubbing of his elbows as he sits poring over the hopeless volume with the blows of his fists as he thumps it madly or with the poor fellows tears you see him wiping them away with the back of his hand as he tries and tries and cant do it  when i think of that latin grammar and that infernal as in praesenti and of other things which i was made to learn in my youth upon my conscience i am surprised that we ever survived it when one thinks of the boys who have been caned because they could not master that intolerable jargon good lord what a pitiful chorus these poor little creatures send up be gentle with them ye schoolmasters and only whop those who wont learn  the doctor has operated upon hulker between ourselves but the boy was so little affected you would have thought he had taken chloroform birch is weary of whipping now and leaves the boy to go his own gait prince when he hears the lesson and who cannot help making fun of a fool adopts the sarcastic manner with master hulker and says mr hulker may i take the liberty to inquire if your brilliant intellect has enabled you to perceive the difference between those words which grammarians have defined as substantive and adjective nounsif not perhaps mr ferdinand timmins will instruct you and timmins hops over hulkers head  i wish prince would leave off girding at the poor lad he is a boy and his mother is a widow woman who loves him with all her might there is a famous sneer about the suckling of fools and the chronicling of small beer but remember it was a rascal who uttered it   a word about miss birch   the gentlemen and especially the younger and more tender of these pupils will have the advantage of the constant superintendence and affectionate care of miss zoe birch sister of the principal whose clearest aim will be to supply as far as may be the absent maternal friendprospectus of rodwell regis school  this is all very well in the doctors prospectus and miss zoe bircha pretty blossom it is fiftyfive years old during two score of which she has dosed herself with pills with a nose as red and a face as sour as a crabapplethis is all mighty well in a prospectus but i should like to know who would take miss zoe for a mother or would have her for one  the only persons in the house who are not afraid of her are miss rosa and ino i am afraid of her though i do know the story about the french usher in 1830but all the rest tremble before the woman from the doctor down to poor francis the knifeboy whom she bullies into his miserable blackinghole  the doctor is a pompous and outwardly severe manbut inwardly weak and easy loving a joke and a glass of portwine i get on with him therefore much better than mr prince who scorns him for an ass and under whose keen eyes the worthy doctor writhes like a convicted impostor and many a sunshiny afternoon would he have said mr t sir shall we try another glass of that yellow sealed wine which you seem to like and which he likes even better than i do had not the old harridan of a zoe been down upon us and insisted on turning me out with her abominable weak coffee she a mother indeed a sourmilk generation she would have nursed she is always croaking scolding bullyingyowling at the housemaids snarling at miss raby bowwowing after the little boys barking after the big ones she knows how much every boy eats to an ounce and her delight is to ply with fat the little ones who cant bear it and with raw meat those who hate underdone it was she who caused the doctor to be eaten out three times and nearly created a rebellion in the school because she insisted on his flogging goliath longman  the only time that woman is happy is when she comes in of a morning to the little boys dormitories with a cup of hot epsom salts and a sippet of bread boothe very notion makes me quiver she stands over them i saw her do it to young byles only a few days since and her presence makes the abomination doubly abominable  as for attending them in real illness do you suppose that she would watch a single night for any one of them not she when poor little charley davison that child a lock of whose soft hair i have said how miss raby still keeps lay ill of scarlet fever in the holidaysfor the colonel the father of these boys was in indiait was anne raby who tended the child who watched him all through the fever who never left him while it lasted or until she had closed the little eyes that were never to brighten or moisten more anny watched and deplored him but it was miss birch who wrote the letter announcing his demise and got the gold chain and locket which the colonel ordered as a memento of his gratitude it was through a row with miss birch that frank davison ran away i promise you that after he joined his regiment in india the ahmednuggur irregulars which his gallant father commands there came over no more annual shawls and presents to dr and miss birch and that if she fancied the colonel was coming home to marry her on account of her tenderness to his motherless children which he was always writing about that notion was very soon given up but these affairs are of early date seven years back and i only heard of them in a very confused manner from miss raby who was a girl and had just come to rodwell regis she is always very much moved when she speaks about those boys which is but seldom i take it the death of the little one still grieves her tender heart  yes it is miss birch who has turned away seventeen ushers and secondmasters in eleven years and half as many french masters i suppose since the departure of her favorite m grinche with her gold watch c but this is only surmisethat is from hearsay and from miss rosa taunting her aunt as she does sometimes in her graceful way but besides this i have another way of keeping her in order  whenever she is particularly odious or insolent to miss raby i have but to introduce raspberry jam into the conversation and the woman holds her tongue she will understand me i need not say more  note 12th december i may speak now i have left the place and dont mind i say then at once and without caring twopence for the consequences that i saw this woman this mother of the boys eating jam with a spoon out of master wigginss trunk in the boxroom and of this i am ready to take an affidavit any day   a tragedy  the drama ought to be represented in about six acts   the school is hushed lawrence the prefect and custos of the rods is marching after the doctor into the operatingroom master backhouse is about to follow   master backhouseits all very well but you see if i dont pay you out after schoolyou sneak you  master lurcherif you do ill tell again  exit backhouse  the rod is heard from the adjoining apartment hwishhwishhwishhwishhwishhwishhwish  reenter backhouse   briggs in luck   enter the knifeboyhamper for briggses master brownhurray tom briggs ill lend you my knife   if this story does not carry its own moral what fable does i wonder before the arrival of that hamper master briggs was in no better repute than any other young gentleman of the lower school and in fact i had occasion myself only lately to correct master brown for kicking his friends shins during the writinglesson but how this basket directed by his mothers housekeeper and marked glass with care whence i conclude that it contains some jam and some bottles of wine probably as well as the usual cake and gamepie and half a sovereign for the elder master b and five new shillings for master decimus briggshow i say the arrival of this basket alters all master briggss circumstances in life and the estimation in which many persons regard him  if he is a goodhearted boy as i have reason to think the very first thing he will do before inspecting the contents of the hamper or cutting into them with the knife which master brown has so considerately lent him will be to read over the letter from home which lies on the top of the parcel he does so as i remark to miss raby for whom i happened to be mending pens when the little circumstance arose with a flushed face and winking eyes look how the other boys are peering into the basket as he readsi say to her isnt it a pretty picture part of the letter is in a very large hand this is from his little sister and i would wager that she netted the little purse which he has just taken out of it and which master lynx is eying  you are a droll man and remark all sorts of queer things miss raby says smiling and plying her swift needle and fingers as quick as possible  i am glad we are both on the spot and that the little fellow lies under our guns as it were and so is protected from some such brutal schoolpirate as young duval for instance who would rob him probably of some of those good things good in themselves and better because fresh from home see there is a pie as i said and which i dare say is better than those which are served at our table but you never take any notice of such kind of things miss raby a cake of course a bottle of currantwine jampots and no end of pears in the straw with their money little briggs will be able to pay the tick which that imprudent child has run up with mrs ruggles and i shall let briggs major pay for the pencilcase which bullock sold to himit will be a lesson to the young prodigal for the future but i say what a change there will be in his life for some time to come and at least until his present wealth is spent the boys who bully him will mollify towards him and accept his pie and sweetmeats they will have feasts in the bedroom and that wine will taste more delicious to them than the best out of the doctors cellar the cronies will be invited young master wagg will tell his most dreadful story and sing his best song for a slice of that pie what a jolly night they will have when we go the rounds at night mr prince and i will take care to make a noise before we come to briggss room so that the boys may have time to put the light out to push the things away and to scud into bed doctor spry may be put in requisition the next morning  nonsense you absurd creature cries out miss raby laughing and i lay down the twelfth pen very nicely mended  yes after luxury comes the doctor i say after extravagance a hole in the breeches pocket to judge from his disposition briggs major will not be much better off a couple of days hence than he is now and if i am not mistaken will end life a poor man brown will be kicking his shins before a week is over depend upon it there are boys and men of all sorts miss rthere are selfish sneaks who hoard until the store they darent use grows mouldythere are spendthrifts who fling away parasites who flatter and lick its shoes and snarling curs who hate and envy good fortune  i put down the last of the pens brushing away with it the quillchips from her desk first and she looked at me with a kind wondering face i brushed them away clicked the penknife into my pocket made her a bow and walked offfor the bell was ringing for school   a young fellow who is pretty sure to succeed   if master briggs is destined in all probability to be a poor man the chances are that mr bullock will have a very different lot he is a son of a partner of the eminent banking firm of bullock and hulker lombard street and very high in the upper schoolquite out of my jurisdiction consequently  he writes the most beautiful currenthand ever seen and the way in which he mastered arithmetic going away into recondite and wonderful rules in the tutors assistant which some masters even dare not approach is described by the doctor in terms of admiration he is mr princes best algebra pupil and a very fair classic too doing everything well for which he has a mind  he does not busy himself with the sports of his comrades and holds a cricketbat no better than miss raby would he employs the playhours in improving his mind and reading the newspaper he is a profound politician and it must be owned on the liberal side the elder boys despise him rather and when champion major passes he turns his head and looks down i dont like the expression of bullocks narrow green eyes as they follow the elder champion who does not seem to know or care how much the other hates him  no mr bullock though perhaps the cleverest and most accomplished boy in the school associates with the quite little boys when he is minded for society to these he is quite affable courteous and winning he never fagged or thrashed one of them he has done the verses and corrected the exercises of many and many is the little lad to whom he has lent a little money  it is true he charges at the rate of a penny a week for every sixpence lent out but many a fellow to whom tarts are a present necessity is happy to pay this interest for the loan these transactions are kept secret mr bullock in rather a whining tone when he takes master green aside and does the requisite business for him says you know youll go and talk about it everywhere i dont want to lend you the money i want to buy something with it its only to oblige you and yet i am sure you will go and make fun of me whereon of course green eager for the money vows solemnly that the transaction shall be confidential and only speaks when the payment of the interest becomes oppressive  thus it is that mr bullocks practices are at all known at a very early period indeed his commercial genius manifested itself and by happy speculations in toffey by composing a sweet drink made of stickliquorice and brown sugar and selling it at a profit to the younger children by purchasing a series of novels which he let out at an adequate remuneration by doing boys exercises for a penny and other processes he showed the bent of his mind at the end of the halfyear he always went home richer than when he arrived at school with his purse full of money  nobody knows how much he brought but the accounts are fabulous twenty thirty fiftyit is impossible to say how many sovereigns when joked about his money he turns pale and swears he has not a shilling whereas he has had a bankers account ever since he was thirteen  at the present moment he is employed in negotiating the sale of a knife with master green and is pointing out to the latter the beauty of the six blades and that he need not pay until after the holidays  champion major has sworn that he will break every bone in his skin the next time that he cheats a little boy and is bearing down upon him let us come away it is frightful to see that big peaceful clever coward moaning under welldeserved blows and whining for mercy   duval the pirate   jones minimus passes laden with tarts  duvalhullo you small boy with the tarts come here sir jones minimusplease duval they aint mine duvaloh you abominable young storyteller  he confiscates the goods   i think i like young duvals mode of levying contributions better than bullocks the formers at least has the merit of more candor duval is the pirate of birchs and lies in wait for small boys laden with money or provender he scents plunder from afar off and pounces out on it woe betide the little fellow when duval boards him  there was a youth here whose money i used to keep as he was of an extravagant and weak taste and i doled it out to him in weekly shillings sufficient for the purchase of the necessary tarts this boy came to me one day for half a sovereign for a very particular purpose he said i afterwards found he wanted to lend the money to duval  the young ogre burst out laughing when in a great wrath and fury i ordered him to refund to the little boy and proposed a bill of exchange at three months it is true duvals father does not pay the doctor and the lad never has a shilling save that which he levies and though he is always bragging about the splendor of freenystown co cork and the foxhounds his father keeps and the claret they drink therethere comes no remittance from castle freeny in these bad times to the honest doctor who is a kindly man enough and never yet turned an insolvent boy out of doors   the dormitories   master hewlett and master nightingale  rather a cold winter night  hewlett flinging a shoe at master nightingales bed with which he hits that young gentlemanhullo you get up and bring me that shoe  nightingaleyes hewlett he gets up  hewlettdont drop it and be very careful of it sir  nightingaleyes hewlett  hewlettsilence in the

my trousers please  hewlettno sir go on or ill  nightingale   through pleasures and palaces   though we may roam   be it ever so humble   theres no place like home   a capture and a rescue   my young friend patrick champion georges younger brother is a late arrival among us has much of the family quality and good nature is not in the least a tyrant to the small boys but is as eager as amadis to fight he is boxing his way up the school emulating his great brother he fixes his eye on a boy above him in strength or size and you hear somehow that a difference has arisen between them at football and they have their coats off presently he has thrashed himself over the heads of many youths in this manner for instance if champion can lick dobson who can thrash hobson how much more then can he thrash hobson thus he works up and establishes his position in the school nor does mr prince think it advisable that we ushers should walk much in the way when these little differences are being settled unless there is some gross disparity or danger is apprehended  for instance i own to having seen this row as i was shaving at my bedroom window i did not hasten down to prevent its consequences fogle had confiscated a top the property of snivins the which as the little wretch was always pegging it at my toes i did not regret snivins whimpered and young champion came up lusting for battle directly he made out fogle he steered for him pulling up his coatsleeves and clearing for action  who spoke to you young champion fogle said and he flung down the top to master snivins i knew there would be no fight and perhaps champion too was disappointed   the garden  where the parlorboarders go   noblemen have been rather scarce at birchsbut the heir of a great prince has been living with the doctor for some yearshe is lord george gaunts eldest son the noble plantagenet gaunt gaunt and nephew of the most honorable the marquis of steyne  they are very proud of him at the doctorsand the two misses and papa whenever a stranger comes down whom they want to dazzle are pretty sure to bring lord steyne into the conversation mention the last party at gaunt house and cursorily to remark that they have with them a young friend who will be in all human probability marquis of steyne and earl of gaunt c  plantagenet does not care much about these future honors provided he can get some brown sugar on his breadandbutter or sit with three chairs and play at coachandhorses quite quietly by himself he is tolerably happy he saunters in and out of school when he likes and looks at the masters and other boys with a listless grin he used to be taken to church but he laughed and talked in odd places so they are forced to leave him at home now he will sit with a bit of string and play catscradle for many hours he likes to go and join the very small children at their games some are frightened at him but they soon cease to fear and order him about i have seen him go and fetch tarts from mrs ruggles for a boy of eight years old and cry bitterly if he did not get a piece he cannot speak quite plain but very nearly and is not more i suppose than threeandtwenty  of course at home they know his age though they never come and see him but they forget that miss rosa birch is no longer a young chit as she was ten years ago when gaunt was brought to the school on the contrary she has had no small experience in the tender passion and is at this moment smitten with a disinterested affection for plantagenet gaunt  next to a little doll with a burnt nose which he hides away in cunning places mr gaunt is very fond of miss rosa too what a pretty match it would make and how pleased they would be at gaunt house if the grandson and heir of the great marquis of steyne the descendant of a hundred gaunts and tudors should marry miss birch the schoolmasters daughter it is true she has the sense on her side and poor plantagenet is only an idiot but there he is a zany with such expectations and such a pedigree  if miss rosa would run away with mr gaunt she would leave off bullying her cousin miss anny raby shall i put her up to the notion and offer to lend her the money to run away mr gaunt is not allowed money he had some once but bullock took him into a corner and got it from him he has a moderate tick opened at a tartwomans he stops at rodwell regis through the year schooltime and holidaytime it is all the same to him nobody asks about him or thinks about him save twice a year when the doctor goes to gaunt house and gets the amount of his bills and a glass of wine in the stewards room  and yet you see somehow that he is a gentleman his manner is different to that of the owners of that coarse table and parlor at which he is a boarder i do not speak of miss r of course for her manners are as good as those of a duchess when he caught miss rosa boxing little fiddess ears his face grew red and he broke into a fierce inarticulate rage after that and for some days he used to shrink from her but they are reconciled now i saw them this afternoon in the garden where only the parlorboarders walk he was playful and touched her with his stick she raised her handsome eyes in surprise and smiled on him very kindly  the thing was so clear that i thought it my duty to speak to old zoe about it the wicked old catamaran told me she wished that some people would mind their own business and hold their tonguesthat some persons were paid to teach writing and not to tell tales and make mischief and i have since been thinking whether i ought to communicate with the doctor   the old pupil   as i came into the playgrounds this morning i saw a dashing young fellow with a tanned face and a blond moustache who was walking up and down the green arminarm with champion major and followed by a little crowd of boys  they were talking of old times evidently what had become of irvine and smithwhere was bill harris and jones not squinny jones but cocky jonesand so forth the gentleman was no stranger he was an old pupil evidently come to see if any of his old comrades remained and revisit the cari luoghi of his youth  champion was evidently proud of his armfellow he espied his brother young champion and introduced him come here sir he called the young un wasnt here in your time davison pat sir said he this is captain davison one of birchs boys ask him who was among the first in the lines at sobraon  pats face kindled up as he looked davison full in the face and held out his hand old champion and davison both blushed the infantry set up a hurray hurray hurray champion leading and waving his wideawake i protest that the scene did one good to witness here was the hero and cock of the school come back to see his old haunts and cronies he had always remembered them since he had seen them last he had faced death and achieved honor but for my dignity i would have shied up my hat too  with a resolute step and his arm still linked in champions captain davison now advanced followed by a wake of little boys to that corner of the green where mrs ruggles has her tart stand  hullo mother ruggles dont you remember me he said and shook her by the hand  lor if it aint davison major she said well davison major you owe me fourpence for two sausagerolls from when you went away  davison laughed and all the little crew of boys set up a similar chorus  i buy the whole shop he said now young unseat away  then there was such a hurray hurray as surpassed the former cheer in loudness everybody engaged in it except piggy duff who made an instant dash at the threecornered puffs but was stopped by champion who said there should be a fair distribution and so there was and no one lacked neither of raspberry open tarts nor of mellifluous bullseyes nor of polonies beautiful to the sight and taste  the hurraying brought out the old doctor himself who put his hand up to his spectacles and started when he saw the old pupil each blushed when he recognized the other for seven years ago they had parted not good friends  whatdavison the doctor said with a tremulous voice god bless you my dear fellowand they shook hands a half holiday of course boys he added and there was another hurray there was to be no end to the cheering that day  howshows the family sir captain davison asked  come in and see rosas grown quite a lady dine with us of course champion major come to dinner at five mr titmarsh the pleasure of your company the doctor swung open the garden gate the old master and pupil entered the house reconciled  i thought i would first peep into miss rabys room and tell her of this event she was working away at her linen there as usual quiet and cheerful  you should put up i said with a smile the doctor has given us a halfholiday  i never have holidays miss raby replied  then i told her of the scene i had just witnessed of the arrival of the old pupil the purchase of the tarts the proclamation of the holiday and the shouts of the boys of hurray davison  who is it cried out miss raby starting and turning as white as a sheet  i told her it was captain davison from india and described the appearance and behavior of the captain when i had finished speaking she asked me to go and get her a glass of water she felt unwell but she was gone when i came back with the water   i know all now after sitting for a quarter of an hour with the doctor who attributed his guests uneasiness no doubt to his desire to see miss rosa birch davison started up and said he wanted to see miss raby you remember sir how kind she was to my little brother sir he said whereupon the doctor with a look of surprise that anybody should want to see miss raby said she was in the little schoolroom whither the captain went knowing the way from old times  a few minutes afterwards miss b and miss z returned from a drive with plantagenet gaunt in their onehorse fly and being informed of davisons arrival and that he was closeted with miss raby in the little schoolroom of course made for that apartment at once i was coming into it from the other door i wanted to know whether she had drunk the water  this is what both parties saw the two were in this very attitude well upon my word cries out miss zoe but davison did not let go his hold and miss rabys head only sank down on his hand  you must get another governess sir for the little boys frank davison said to the doctor anny raby has promised to come with me  you may suppose i shut to the door on my side and when i returned to the little schoolroom it was black and empty everybody was gone i could hear the boys shouting at play in the green outside the glass of water was on the table where i had placed it i took it and drank it myself to the health of anny raby and her husband it was rather a choker  but of course i wasnt going to stop on at birchs when his young friends reassemble on the 1st of february next they will have two new masters prince resigned too and is at present living with me at my old lodgings at mrs cammysoles if any nobleman or gentleman wants a private tutor for his son a note to the rev f prince will find him there  miss clapperclaw says we are both a couple of old fools and that she knew when i set off last year to rodwell regis after meeting the two young ladies at a party at general champions house in our street that i was going on a gooses errand i shall dine there on christmasday and so i wish a merry christmas to all young and old boys       epilogue        the play is done the curtain drops      slow falling to the prompters bell      a moment yet the actor stops      and looks around to say farewell      it is an irksome word and task      and when hes laughed and said his say      he shows as he removes the mask      a face thats anything but gay       one word ere yet the evening ends      lets close it with a parting rhyme      and pledge a hand to all young friends      as

1843 aet 42     the kickleburys on the rhine  by mr m a titmarsh   preface to the second edition  being an essay on thunder and small beer   any reader who may have a fancy to purchase a copy of this present edition of the history of the kickleburys abroad had best be warned in time that the times newspaper does not approve of the work and has but a bad opinion both of the author and his readers nothing can be fairer than this statement if you happen to take up the poor little volume at a railroad station and read this sentence lay the book down and buy something else you are warned what more can the author say if after this you will buyamen pay your money take your book and fall to between ourselves honest reader it is no very strong potation which the present purveyor offers to you it will not trouble your head much in the drinking it was intended for that sort of negus which is offered at christmas parties and of which ladies and children may partake with refreshment and cheerfulness last year i tried a brew which was old bitter and strong and scarce any one would drink it this year we send round a milder tap and it is liked by customers though the critics who like strong ale the rogues turn up their noses in heavens name mr smith serve round the liquor to the gentlefolks pray dear madam another glass it is christmas time it will do you no harm it is not intended to keep long this sort of drink come froth up mr publisher and pass quickly round and as for the professional gentlemen we must get a stronger sort for them some day  the times gentleman a very difficult gent to please is the loudest and noisiest of all and has made more hideous faces over the refreshment offered to him than any other critic there is no use shirking this statement when a man has been abused in the times he cant hide it any more than he could hide the knowledge of his having been committed to prison by mr henry or publicly caned in pall mall you see it in your friends eyes when they meet you they know it they have chuckled over it to a man they whisper about it at the club and look over the paper at you my nextdoor neighbor came to see me this morning and i saw by his face that he had the whole story pat hem says he well i have heard of it and the fact is they were talking about you at dinner last night and mentioning that the times hadahemwalked into you  my good m i sayand m will corroborate if need be the statement i make herehere is the times article dated january 4th which states so and so and here is a letter from the publisher likewise dated january 4th and which says   my dear sirhaving this day sold the last copy of the first edition of x thousand of the kickleburys abroad and having orders for more had we not better proceed to a second edition and will you permit me to enclose an order on c c   singular coincidence and if every author who was so abused by a critic had a similar note from a publisher good lord how easily would we take the critics censure  yes yes you say it is all very well for a writer to affect to be indifferent to a critique from the times you bear it as a boy bears a flogging at school without crying out but dont swagger and brag as if you liked it  let us have truth before all i would rather have a good word than a bad one from any person but if a critic abuses me from a high place and it is worth my while i will appeal if i can show that the judge who is delivering sentence against me and laying down the law and making a pretence of learning has no learning and no law and is neither more nor less than a pompous noodle who ought not to be heard in any respectable court i will do so and then dear friends perhaps you will have something to laugh at in this book   the kickleburys abroad  it has been customary of late years for the purveyors of amusing literaturethe popular authors of the dayto put forth certain opuscules denominated christmas books with the ostensible intention of swelling the tide of exhilaration or other expansive emotions incident upon the exodus of the old and the inauguration of the new year we have said that their ostensible intention was such because there is another motive for these productions locked up as the popular author deems in his own breast but which betrays itself in the quality of the work as his principal incentive oh that any muse should be set upon a high stool to cast up accounts and balance a ledger yet so it is and the popular author finds it convenient to fill up the declared deficit and place himself in a position the more effectually to encounter those liabilities which sternly assert themselves contemporaneously and in contrast with the careless and freehanded tendencies of the season by the emission of christmas booksa kind of literary assignats representing to the emitter expunged debts to the receiver an investment of enigmatical value for the most part bearing the stamp of their origin in the vacuity of the writers exchequer rather than in the fulness of his genius they suggest by their feeble flavor the rinsings of a void brain after the more important concoctions of the expired year indeed we should as little think of taking these compositions as examples of the merits of their authors as we should think of measuring the valuable services of mr walker the postman or mr bell the dustcollector by the copy of verses they leave at our doors as a provocative of the expected annual gratuityeffusions with which they may fairly be classed for their intrinsic worth no less than their ultimate purport  in the christmas book presently under notice the author appears under the thin disguise of mr michael angelo titmarsh in propria persona as the popular author the contributor to punch the remorseless pursuer of unconscious vulgarity and feeblemindedness launched upon a tour of relaxation to the rhine but though exercising as is the wont of popular authors in their moments of leisure a plentiful reserve of those higher qualities to which they are indebted for their fame his professional instincts are not altogether in abeyance from the moment his eye lights upon a luckless family group embarked on the same steamer with himself the sight of his accustomed quarryvulgarity imbecility and affectationreanimates his relaxed sinews and playfully fastening his satiric fangs upon the familiar prey he dallies with it in mimic ferocity like a satiated mouser  though faintly and carelessly indicated the characters are those with which the author loves to surround himself a tufthunting county baronets widow an inane captain of dragoons a graceless young baronet a lady with groundless pretensions to feeble health and poesy an obsequious nonentity her husband and a flimsy and artificial young lady are the personages in whom we are expected to find amusement two individuals alone form an exception to the above category and are offered to the respectful admiration of the readerthe one a shadowy serjeantatlaw mr titmarshs travelling companion who escapes with a few side puffs of flattery which the author struggles not to render ironical and a mysterious countess spoken of in a tone of religious reverence and apparently introduced that we may learn by what delicate discriminations our adoration of rank should be regulated  to those who love to hug themselves in a sense of superiority by admeasurement with the most worthless of their species in their most worthless aspects the kickleburys on the rhine will afford an agreeable treat especially as the purveyor of the feast offers his own moments of human weakness as a modest entree in this banquet of erring mortality to our own perhaps unphilosophical taste the aspirations towards sentimental perfection of another popular author are infinitely preferable to these sardonic divings after the pearl of truth whose lustre is eclipsed in the display of the diseased oyster much in the present instance perhaps all the disagreeable effect of his subject is no doubt attributable to the absence of mr thackerays usual brilliancy of style a few flashes however occur such as the description of m lenoirs gaming establishment with the momentous crisis to which it was subjected and the quaint and imaginative sallies evoked by the whole town of rougetnoirbourg and its lawful prince these with the illustrations which are spirited enough redeem the book from an absolute ban mr thackerays pencil is more congenial than his pen he cannot draw his men and women with their skins off and therefore the effigies of his characters are pleasanter to contemplate than the flayed anatomies of the letterpress   there is the whole article and the reader will see in the paragraph preceding that memorable one which winds up with the diseased oyster that he must be a worthless creature for daring to like the book as he could only do so from a desire to hug himself in a sense of superiority by admeasurement with the most worthless of his fellowcreatures  the reader is worthless for liking a book of which all the characters are worthless except two which are offered to his respectful admiration and of these two the author does not respect one but struggles not to laugh in his face whilst he apparently speaks of another in a tone of religious reverence because the lady is a countess and because he the author is a sneak so reader author characters are rogues all be there any honest men left hal about printinghouse square mayhap you may light on an honest man a squeamish man a proper moral man a man that shall talk you latin by the halfcolumn if you will but hear him  and what a style it is that great mans what hoighth of foine language entoirely how he can discoorse you in english for all the world as if it was latin for instance suppose you and i had to announce the important news that some writers published what are called christmas books that christmas books are so called because they are published at christmas and that the purpose of the authors is to try and amuse people suppose i say we had by the sheer force of intellect or by other means of observation or information discovered these great truths we should have announced them in so many words and there it is that the difference lies between a great writer and a poor one and we may see how an inferior man may fling a chance away how does my friend of the times put these propositions it has been customary says he of late years for the purveyors of amusing literature to put forth certain opuscules denominated christmas books with the ostensible intention of swelling the tide of exhilaration or other expansive emotions incident upon the exodus of the old or the inauguration of the new year that is something like a sentence not a word scarcely buts in latin and the longest and handsomest out of the whole dictionary that is proper economyas you see a buck from holywell street put every pinchbeck pin ring and chain which he possesses about his shirt hands and waistcoat and then go and cut a dash in the park or swagger with his order to the theatre it costs him no more to wear all his ornaments about his distinguished person than to leave them at home if you can be a swell at a cheap rate why not and i protest for my part i had no idea what i was really about in writing and submitting my little book for sale until my friend the critic looking at the article and examining it with the eyes of a connoisseur pronounced that what i had fancied simply to be a book was in fact an opuscule denominated soandso and ostensibly intended to swell the tide of expansive emotion incident upon the inauguration of the new year i can hardly believe as much even nowso little do we know what we really are after until men of genius come and interpret  and besides the ostensible intention the reader will perceive that my judge has discovered another latent motive which i had locked up in my own breast the sly rogue if we may so speak of the court there is no keeping anything from him and this truth like the rest has come out and is all over england by this time oh that all england which has bought the judges charge would purchase the prisoners plea in mitigation oh that any muse should be set on a high stool says the bench to cast up accounts and balance a ledger yet so it is and the popular author finds it convenient to fill up the declared deficit by the emission of christmas booksa kind of assignats that bear the stamp of their origin in the vacuity of the writers exchequer there is a trope for you you rascal you wrote because you wanted money his lordship has found out what you were at and that there is a deficit in your till but he goes on to say that we poor devils are to be pitied in our necessity and that these compositions are no more to be taken as examples of our merits than the verses which the dustman leaves at his lordships door as a provocative of the expected annual gratuity are to be considered as measuring his the scavengers valuable servicesnevertheless the authors and the scavengers effusions may fairly be classed for their intrinsic worth no less than their ultimate purport  heaven bless his lordship on the benchwhat a gentle manlike badinage he has and what a charming and playful wit always at hand what a sense he has for a simile or what mrs malaprop calls an odorous comparison and how gracefully he conducts it to its ultimate purport a gentleman writing a poor little book is a scavenger asking for a christmasbox   as i try this small beer which has called down such a deal of thunder i cant help thinking that it is not jove who has interfered the case was scarce worthy of his divine vindictiveness but the thunderers man jupiter jeames taking his masters place adopting his manner and trying to dazzle and roar like his awful employer that figure of the dustman has hardly been flung from heaven that ultimate purport is a subject which the immortal would hardly handle well well let us allow that the book is not worthy of such a polite criticthat the beer is not strong enough for a gentleman who has taste and experience in beer  that opinion no man can ask his honor to alter but the beer being the question why make unpleasant allusions to the gazette and hint at the probable bankruptcy of the brewer why twit me with my poverty and what can the times critic know about the vacuity of my exchequer did he ever lend me any money does he not himself write for money and who would grudge it to such a polite and generous and learned author if he finds no disgrace in being paid why should i if he has ever been poor why should he joke at my empty exchequer of course such a genius is paid for his work with such neat logic such a pure style such a charming poetical turn of phrase of course a critic gets money why a man who can say of a christmas book that it is an opuscule denominated soandso and ostensibly intended to swell the tide of expansive emotion incident upon the exodus of the old year must evidently have had immense sums and care expended on his early education and deserves a splendid return you cant go into the market and get scholarship like that without paying for it even the flogging that such a writer must have had in early youth if he was at a public school where the rods were paid for must have cost his parents a good sum where would you find any but an accomplished classical scholar to compare the books of the present or indeed any other writer to sardonic divings after the pearl of truth whose lustre is eclipsed in the display of the diseased oyster mere billingsgate doesnt turn out oysters like these they are of the lucrine lakethis satirist has pickled his rods in latin brine fancy not merely a diver but a sardonic diver and the expression of his confounded countenance on discovering not only a pearl but an eclipsed pearl which was in a diseased oyster i say it is only by an uncommon and happy combination of taste genius and industry that a man can arrive at uttering such sentiments in such fine languagethat such a man ought to be well paid as i have no doubt he is and that he is worthily employed to write literary articles in large type in the leading journal of europe dont we want men of eminence and polite learning to sit on the literary bench and to direct the public opinion  but when this profound scholar compares me to a scavenger who leaves a copy of verses at his door and begs for a christmasbox i must again cry out and say my dear sir it is true your simile is offensive but can you make it out are you not hasty in your figures and illusions if i might give a hint to so consummate a rhetorician you should be more careful in making your figures figures and your similes like for instance when you talk of a book swelling the tide of exhilaration incident to the inauguration of the new year or of a book bearing the stamp of its origin in vacuity cor of a man diving sardonically or of a pearl eclipsed in the display of a diseased oysterthere are some people who will not apprehend your meaning some will doubt whether you had a meaning some even will question your great powers and say is this man to be a critic in a newspaper which knows what english and latin too and what sense and scholarship are i dont quarrel with youi take for granted your wit and learning your modesty and benevolencebut why scavengerjupiter jeameswhy scavenger a gentleman whose biography the examiner was fond of quoting before it took its present serious and orthodox turn was pursued by an outraged wife to the very last stage of his existence with an appeal almost as patheticah sir why scavenger  how can i be like a dustman that rings for a christmasbox at your halldoor i never was there in my life i never left at your door a copy of verses provocative of an annual gratuity as your noble honor styles it who are you if you are the man i take you to be it must have been you who asked the publisher for my book and not i who sent it in and begged a gratuity of your worship you abused me out of the times window but if ever your noble honor sent me a gratuity out of your own door may i never drive another dustcart provocative of a gratuity o splendid swell how much was it your worship sent out to me by the footman every farthing you have paid i will restore to your lordship and i swear i shall not be a halfpenny the poorer  as before and on similar seasons and occasions i have compared myself to a person following a not dissimilar calling let me suppose now for a minute that i am a writer of a christmas farce who sits in the pit and sees the performance of his own piece there comes applause hissing yawning laughter as may be but the loudest critic of all is our friend the cheap buck who sits yonder and makes his remarks so that all the audience may hear this a farce says beau tibbs demmy its the work of a poor devil who writes for moneyconfound his vulgarity this a farce why isnt it a tragedy or a comedy or an epic poem stap my vitals this a farce indeed its a feller as sends round his at and appeals to charity lets ave our money back again i say and he swaggers offand you find the fellow came with an authors order  but if in spite of tibbs our kyind friends c c cif the little farce which was meant to amuse christmas or what my classical friend calls exodus is asked for even up to twelfth nightshall the publisher stop because tibbs is dissatisfied whenever that capitalist calls to get his money back he may see the letter from the respected publisher informing the author that all the copies are sold and that there are demands for a new edition up with the curtain then vivat regina and no money returned except the times gratuity  m a titmarsh  january 5 1851    the kickleburys on the rhine   the cabman when he brought us to the wharf and made his usual charge of six times his legal fare before the settlement of which he pretended to refuse the privilege of an exeat regno to our luggage glared like a disappointed fiend when lankin calling up the faithful hutchison his clerk who was in attendance said to him hutchison you will pay this man my name is serjeant lankin my chambers are in pump court my clerk will settle with you sir the cabman trembled we stepped on board our lightsome luggage was speedily whisked away by the crew our berths had been secured by the previous agency of hutchison and a couple of tickets on which were written mr serjeant lankin mr titmarsh lankins by the way incomparably the best and comfortablest sleeping place were pinned on to two of the curtains of the beds in a side cabin when we descended  who was on board there were jews with sunday papers and fruit there were couriers and servants straggling about there were those bearded foreign visitors of england who always seem to decline to shave or wash themselves on the day of a voyage and on the eve of quitting our country appear inclined to carry away as much as possible of its soil on their hands and linen there were parties already cozily established on deck under the awning and steadygoing travellers forard smoking already the pleasant morning cigar and watching the phenomena of departure  the bell rings they leave off bawling anybody else for the shore the last grape and bells life merchant has scuffled over the plank the johns of the departing nobility and gentry line the brink of the quay and touch their hats hutchison touches his hat to meto me heaven bless him i turn round inexpressibly affected and delighted and whom do i see but captain hicks  hallo you here says hicks in a tone which seems to mean confound you you are everywhere  hicks is one of those young men who seem to be everywhere a great deal too often  how are they always getting leave from their regiments if they are not wanted in this country as wanted they cannot be for you see them sprawling over the railing in rotten row all day and shaking their heels at every ball in townif they are not wanted in this country i say why the deuce are they not sent off to india or to demerara or to sierra leone by jovethe farther the better and i should wish a good unwholesome climate to try em and make em hardy here is this hicks thencaptain launcelot hicks if you pleasewhose life is nothing but breakfast smoking ridingschool billiards mess polking billiards and smoking again and da capopulling down his moustaches and going to take a tour after the immense labors of the season  how do you do captain hicks i say where are you going  oh i am going to the whine says hicks evewybody goes to the whine the whine indeed i dare say he can no more spell properly than he can speak  who is on boardanybody i ask with the air of a man of fashion to whom does that immense pile of luggage belongunder charge of the ladysmaid the courier and the british footman a large white k is painted on all the boxes  how the deuce should i know says hicks looking as i fancy both red and angry and strutting off with his great cavalry lurch and swagger whilst my friend the serjeant looks at him lost in admiration and surveys his shining little boots his chains and breloques his whiskers and ambrosial moustaches his gloves and other dandifications with a pleased wonder as the ladies of the sultans harem surveyed the great lady from park lane who paid them a visit or the simple subjects of montezuma looked at one of cortess heavy dragoons  that must be a marquis at least whispers lankin who consults me on points of society and is pleased to have a great opinion of my experience  i burst out in a scornful laugh that i say he is a captain of dragoons and his father an attorney in bedford row the whiskers of a roturier my good lankin grow as long as the beard of a plantagenet it dont require much noble blood to learn the polka if you were younger lankin we might go for a shilling a night and dance every evening at m laurents casino and skip about in a little time as well as that fellow only we despise the kind of thing you knowonly were too grave and too steady  and too fat whispers lankin with a laugh  speak for yourself you maypole says i if you cant dance yourself people can dance round youput a wreath of flowers upon your old poll stick you up in a village green and so make use of you  i should gladly be turned into anything so pleasant lankin answers and so at least get a chance of seeing a pretty girl now and then they dont show in pump court or at the university club where i dine you are a lucky fellow titmarsh and go about in the world as for me i never  and the judges wives you rogue i say well no man is satisfied and the only reason i have to be angry with the captain yonder is that the other night at mrs perkinss being in conversation with a charming young creaturewho knows all my favorite passages in tennyson and takes a most delightful little line of opposition in the church controversyjust as we were in the very closest dearest pleasantest part of the talk comes up young hotspur yonder and whisks her away in a polka what have you and i to do with polkas lankin he took her down to supperwhat have you and i to do with suppers  our duty is to leave them alone said the philosophical serjeant and now about breakfastshall we have some and as he spoke a savory little procession of stewards and stewards boys with drab tin dishcovers passed from the caboose and descended the stairs to the cabin the vessel had passed greenwich by this time and had worked its way out of the mastforest which guards the approaches of our city   the owners of those innumerable boxes bags oilskins guitarcases whereon the letter k was engraven appeared to be three ladies with a slim gentleman of two or three and thirty who was probably the husband of one of them he had numberless shawls under his arm and guardianship he had a strap full of murrays handbooks and continental guides in his keeping and a little collection of parasols and umbrellas bound together and to be carried in state before the chief of the party like the lictors fasces before the consul  the chief of the party was evidently the stout lady one parasol being left free she waved it about and commanded the luggage and the menials to and fro horace we will sit there she exclaimed pointing to a comfortable place on the deck horace went and placed the shawls and the guidebooks hirsch avy vou conty les bagages tront sett morso ong too the german courier said oui miladi and bowed a rather sulky assent bowman you will see that finch is comfortable and send her to me the gigantic bowman a gentleman in an undress uniform with very large and splendid armorial buttons and with traces of the powder of the season still lingering in his hair bows and speeds upon my ladys errand  i recognize hirsch a wellknown face upon the european highroad where he has travelled with many acquaintances with whom is he making the tour nowmr hirsch is acting as courier to mr and mrs horace milliken they have not been married many months and they are travelling hirsch says with a contraction of his bushy eyebrows with miladi mrs millikens mamma and who is her ladyship hirschs brow contracts into deeper furrows it is miladi gigglebury he says mr didmarsh berhabs you know her he scowls round at her as she calls out loudly hirsch hirsch and obeys that summons   it is the great lady kicklebury of pocklington square about whom i remember mrs perkins made so much ado at her last ball and whom old perkins conducted to supper when sir thomas kicklebury died he was one of the first tenants of the square who does not remember the scutcheon with the coronet with two balls that flamed over no 36 her son was at eton then and has subsequently taken an honorary degree at oxford and been an ornament of platts and the oswestry club he fled into st jamess from the great house in pocklington square and from st jamess to italy and the mediterranean where he has been for some time in a wholesome exile her eldest daughters marriage with lord roughhead was talked about last year but lord roughhead it is known married miss brent and horace milliken very much to his surprise found himself the affianced husband of miss lavinia kicklebury after an agitating evening at lady polkimores when miss lavinia feeling herself faint went out on to the leads the terrace lady polkimore will call it on the arm of mr milliken they were married in january its not a bad match for miss k lady kicklebury goes and stops for six months of the year at pigeoncot with her daughter and soninlaw and now that they are come abroad she comes too she must be with lavinia under the present circumstances  when i am arminarm i tell this story glibly off to lankin who is astonished at my knowledge of the world and says why titmarsh you know everything  i do know a few things lankin my boy is my answer a man dont live in society and pretty good society let me tell you for nothing  the fact is that all the above details are known to almost any man in our neighborhood lady kicklebury does not meet with us much and has greater folks than we can pretend to be at her parties but we know about them shell condescend to come to perkinss with whose firm she banks and she may overdraw her account but of that of course i know nothing  when lankin and i go down stairs to breakfast we find if not the best at least the most conspicuous places in occupation of lady kickleburys party and the hulking london footman making a darkness in the cabin as he stoops through it bearing cups and plates to his employers   why do they always put mud into coffee on board steamers why does the tea generally taste of boiled boots why is the milk scarce and thin and why do they have those bleeding legs of boiled mutton for dinner i ask why in the steamers of other nations you are well fed is it impossible that britannia who confessedly rules the waves should attend to the victuals a little and that meat should be well cooked under a union jack i just put in this question this most interesting question in a momentous parenthesis and resume the tale   when lankin and i descend to the cabin then the tables are full of gobbling people and though there do seem to be a couple of places near lady kicklebury immediately she sees our eyes directed to the inviting gap she slides out and with her ample robe covers even more than that large space to which by art and nature she is entitled and calling out horace horace and nodding and winking and pointing she causes her soninlaw to extend the wing on his side we are cut of that chance of a breakfast we shall have the tea at its third water and those two damp black muttonchops which nobody else will take will fall to our cold share  at this minute a voice clear and sweet from a tall lady in a black veil says mr titmarsh and i start and murmur an ejaculation of respectful surprise as i recognize no less a person than the right honorable the countess of knightsbridge taking her tea breaking up little bits of toast with her slim fingers and sitting between a belgian horsedealer and a german violoncelloplayer who has a conge after the operalike any other mortal  i whisper her ladyships name to lankin the serjeant looks towards her with curiosity and awe even he in his pump court solitudes has heard of that star of fashionthat admired amongst men and even womenthat diana severe yet simple the accomplished aurelia of knightsbridge her husband has but a small share of her qualities how should he the turf and the foxchase are his delightsthe smokingroom at the travellersnay shall we say itthe illuminated arcades of vauxhall and the gambols of the dishevelled terpsichore knightsbridge has his faultsah even the peerage of england is not exempt from them with diana for his wife he flies the halls where she sits severe and serene and is to be found shrouded in smoke tis true in those caves where the contrite chimneysweep sings his terrible death chant or the bacchanalian judge administers a satiric law lord knightsbridge has his faults then but he has the gout at rougetnoirbourg near the rhine and thither his wife is hastening to minister to him  i have done says lady knightsbridge with a gentle bow as she rises you may have this place mr titmarsh and i am sorry my breakfast is over i should have prolonged it had i thought that you were coming to sit by me thank youmy glove such an absurd little glove by the way we shall meet on the deck when you have done  and she moves away with an august curtsy i cant tell how it is or what it is in that lady but she says how do you do as nobody else knows how to say it in all her actions motions thoughts i would wager there is the same calm grace and harmony she is not very handsome being very thin and rather sadlooking she is not very witty being only up to the conversation whatever it may be and yet if she were in black serge i think one could not help seeing that she was a princess and serene highness and if she were a hundred years old she could not be but beautiful i saw her performing her devotions in antwerp cathedral and forgot to look at anything else thereso calm and pure such a sainted figure hers seemed  when this great lady did the present writer the honor to shake his hand i had the honor to teach writing and the rudiments of latin to the young and intelligent lord viscount pimlico there seemed to be a commotion in the kicklebury partyheads were nodded together and turned towards lady knightsbridge in whose honor when lady kicklebury had sufficiently reconnoitred her with her eyeglass the baronets lady rose and swept a reverential curtsy backing until she fell up against the cushions at the stern of the boat lady knightsbridge did not see this salute for she did not acknowledge it but walked away slimly she seems to glide in and out of the room and disappeared up the stair to the deck  lankin and i took our places the horsedealer making room for us and i could not help looking with a little air of triumph over to the kicklebury faction as much as to say you fine folks with your large footman and supercilious airs see what we can do  as i lookedsmiling and nodding and laughing at me in a knowing pretty way and then leaning to mamma as if in explanation what face should i see but that of the young lady at mrs perkinss with whom i had had that pleasant conversation which had been interrupted by the demand of captain hicks for a dance so then that was miss kicklebury about whom miss perkins my young friend has so often spoken to me the young ladies were in conversation when i had the happiness of joining them and miss p went away presently to look to her gueststhat is miss fanny kicklebury  a sudden pang shot athwart my bosomlankin might have perceived it but the honest serjeant was so awestricken by his late interview with the countess of knightsbridge that his mind was unfit to grapple with other subjectsa pang of feeling which i concealed under the grin and graceful bow wherewith miss fannys salutations were acknowledged tore my heartstringsas i thought ofi need not sayof hicks  he had danced with her he had supped with herhe was here on board the boat where was that dragoon i looked round for him in quite a far cornerbut so that he could command the kicklebury party i thoughthe was eating his breakfast the great healthy oaf and consuming one broiled egg after another  in the course of the afternoon all parties as it may be supposed emerged upon deck again and miss fanny and her mamma began walking the quarterdeck with a quick pace like a couple of postcaptains when miss fanny saw me she stopped and smiled and recognized the gentleman who had amused her so at mrs perkinss what a dear sweet creature eliza perkins was they had been at school together she was going to write to eliza everything that happened on the voyage  everything i said in my particularly sarcastic manner  well everything that was worth telling there was a great number of things that were very stupid and of people that were very stupid everything that you say mr titmarsh i am sure i may put down you have seen mr titmarshs funny books mamma  mamma said she had heardshe had no doubt they were very amusing was not thatahemlady knightsbridge to whom i saw you speaking sir  yes she is going to nurse lord knightsbridge who has the gout at rougetnoirbourg  indeed how very fortunate what an extraordinary coincidence we are going too said lady kicklebury  i remarked that everybody was going to rougetnoirbourg this year and i heard of two gentlemencount carambole and colonel cannonwho had been obliged to sleep there on a billiardtable for want of a bed  my son kickleburyare you acquainted with sir thomas kicklebury her ladyship said with great statelinessis at noirbourg and will take lodgings for us the springs are particularly recommended for my daughter mrs milliken and at great personal sacrifice i am going thither myself but what will not a mother do mr titmarsh did i understand you to say that you have thethe entree at knightsbridge house the parties are not what they used to be i am told not that i have any knowledge i am but a poor country baronets widow mr titmarsh though the kickleburys date from henry iii and my family is not of the most modern in the country you have heard of general guff my father perhaps aidedecamp to the duke of york and wounded by his royal highnesss side at the bombardment of valenciennes we move in our own sphere  mrs perkins is a very kind creature i said and it was a very pleasant ball did you not think so miss kicklebury  i thought it odious said miss fanny i mean it was pleasant until thatthat stupid manwhat was his namecame and took me away to dance with him  what dont you care for a red coat and moustaches i asked  i adore genius mr titmarsh said the young lady with a most killing look of her beautiful blue eyes and i have every one of your works by heartall except the last which i cant endure i think its wicked positively wickedmy darling scotthow can you and are you going to make a christmasbook this year  shall i tell you about it  oh do tell us about it said the lively charming creature clapping her hands and we began to talk being near lavinia mrs milliken and her husband who was ceaselessly occupied in fetching and carrying books biscuits pillows and cloaks scentbottles the italian greyhound and the thousand and one necessities of the pale and interesting bride oh how she did fidget how she did grumble how she altered and twisted her position and how she did make poor milliken trot  after miss fanny and i had talked and i had told her my plan which she pronounced to be delightful she continuedi never was so provoked in my life mr titmarsh as when that odious man came and interrupted that dear delightful conversation  on your word the odious man is on board the boat i see him smoking just by the funnel yonder look and looking at us  he is very stupid said fanny and all that i adore is intellect dear mr titmarsh  but why is he on board said i with a fin sourire  why is he on board why is everybody on board how do we meet and oh how glad i am to meet you again you dont suppose that i know how the horrid man came here  eh he may be fascinated by a pair of blue eyes miss fanny others have been so i said  dont be cruel to a poor girl you wicked satirical creature she said i think captain hicks odiousthere and i was quite angry when i saw him on the boat mamma does not know him and she was so angry with me for dancing with him that night though there was nobody of any particular mark at poor dear mrs perkinssthat is except you mr titmarsh  and i am not a dancing man i said with a sigh  i hate dancing men they can do nothing but dance  o yes they can some of them can smoke and some can ride and some of them can even spell very well  you wicked satirical person im quite afraid of you  and some of them call the rhine the whine i said giving an admirable imitation of poor hickss drawling manner  fanny looked hard at me with a peculiar expression on her face at last she laughed oh you wicked wicked man she said what a capital mimic you are and so full of cleverness do bring up captain hicksisnt that his nameand trot him out for us bring him up and introduce him to mamma do now go  mamma in the meanwhile had waited her time and was just going to step down the cabin stairs as lady knightsbridge ascended from them to draw back to make a most profound curtsy to exclaim lady knightsbridge i have had the honor of seeing your ladyship athumhumhum this word i could not catchhouseall these feats were performed by lady kicklebury in one instant and acknowledged with the usual calmness by the younger lady  and may i hope continues lady kicklebury that that most beautiful of all childrena mother may say sothat lord pimlico has recovered his hoopingcough we were so anxious about him our medical attendant is mr topham and he used to come from knightsbridge house to pocklington square often and often i am interested about the hoopingcough my own dear boy had it most severely that dear girl my eldest daughter whom you see stretched on the benchshe is in a very delicate state and only lately marriednot such a match as i could have wished but mr milliken is of a good family distantly related to your ladyships a milliken in george the thirds reign married a boltimore and the boltimores i think are your firstcousins they married this year and lavinia is so fond of me that she cant part with me and i have come abroad just to please her we are going to noirbourg i think i heard from my son that lord knightsbridge was at noirbourg  i believe i have had the pleasure of seeing sir thomas kicklebury at knightsbridge house lady knightsbridge said with something of sadness  indeed and kicklebury had never told her he laughed at her when she talked about great people he told her all sorts of ridiculous stories when upon this theme but at any rate the acquaintance was made lady kicklebury would not leave lady knightsbridge and even in the throes of seasickness and the secret recesses of the cabin would talk to her about the world lord pimlico and her father general guff late aidedecamp to the duke of york  that those throes of sickness ensued i need not say a short time after passing ramsgate serjeant lankin who had been exceedingly gay and satiricalin his calm way he quotes horace my favorite bits as an author to myself and has a quiet snigger and so to speak amontillado flavor exceedingly pleasantlankin with a rueful and livid countenance descended into his berth in the which that six foot of serjeant packed himself i dont know how  when lady knightsbridge went down down went kicklebury milliken and his wife stayed and were ill together on deck a palm of glory ought to be awarded to that man for his angelic patience energy and suffering it was he who went for mrs millikens maid who wouldnt come to her mistress it was he the shyest of men who stormed the ladies cabinthat maritime haremin order to get her mothers bottle of salts it was he who went for the brandyandwater and begged and prayed and besought his adored lavinia to taste a leetle drop lavinias reply was dontgo awaydont tease horace and so forth and when not wanted the gentle creature subsided on the bench by his wifes feet and was sick in silence  memin married life it seems to me that it is almost always milliken and wife or just the contrary the angels minister to the tyrants or the gentle henpecked husband cowers before the superior partlet if ever i marry i know the sort of woman i will choose and i wont try her temper by overindulgence and destroy her fine qualities by a ruinous subserviency to her wishes  little miss fanny stayed on deck as well as her sister and looked at the stars of heaven as they began to shine there and at the foreland lights as we passed them i would have talked with her i would have suggested images of poesy and thoughts of beauty i would have whispered the word of sentimentthe delicate allusionthe breathing of the soul that longs to find a congenial heartthe sorrows and aspirations of the wounded spirit stricken and sad yet not quite despairing still knowing that the hopeplant lurked in its crushed ruinsstill able to gaze on the stars and the ocean and love their blazing sheen their boundless azure i would i say have taken the opportunity of that stilly night to lay bare to her the treasures of a heart that i am happy to say is young still but circumstances forbade the frank outpouring of my poet soul in a word i was obliged to go and lie down on the flat of my back and endeavor to control other emotions which struggled in my breast  once in the nightwatches i arose and came on deck the vessel was not methought pitching much and yetand yet neptune was inexorable the placid stars looked down but they gave me no peace lavinia milliken seemed asleep and her horace in a deathlike torpor was huddled at her feet miss fanny had quitted the larboard side of the ship and had gone to starboard and i thought that there was a gentleman beside her but i could not see very clearly and returned to the horrid crib where lankin was asleep and the german fiddler underneath him was snoring like his own violoncello  in the morning we were all as brisk as bees we were in the smooth waters of the lazy scheldt the stewards began preparing breakfast with that matutinal eagerness which they always show the sleepers in the cabin were roused from their horsehair couches by the stewards boys nudging and pushing and flapping tablecloths over them i shaved and made a neat toilette and came upon deck just as we lay off that little dutch fort which is i dare say described in murrays guidebook and about which i had some rare banter with poor hicks and lady kicklebury whose sense of humor is certainly not very keen he had somehow joined her ladyships party and they were looking at the fort and its tricolored flagthat floats familiar in vandeveldes picturesand at the lazy shipping and the tall roofs and dumpy church towers and flat pastures lying before us in a cuyplike haze  i am sorry to say i told them the most awful fibs about that fort how it had been defended by the dutch patriot van swammerdam against the united forces of the duke of alva and marshal turenne whose leg was shot off as he was leading the last unsuccessful assault and who turned round to his aidedecamp and said allez dire an premier consul que je meurs avec regret de ne pas avoir assez fait pour la france which gave lady kicklebury an opportunity to placer her story of the duke of york and the bombardment of valenciennes and caused young hicks to look at me in a puzzled and appealing manner and hint that i was chaffing  chaffing indeed says i with a particularly arch eyetwinkle at miss fanny i wouldnt make fun of you captain hicks if you doubt my historical accuracy look at the biographie universelle i saylook at the biographie universelle  he said oahthe biogwaphie universelle may be all vewy well and that but i never can make out whether you are joking or not somehow and i always fancy you are going to cawickachaw me ha ha and he laughed the goodnatured dragoon laughed and fancied he had made a joke  i entreated him not to be so severe upon me and again he said haw haw and told me i mustnt expect to have it all my own way and if i gave a hit i must expect a punch in return haw haw oh you honest young hicks  everybody indeed was in high spirits the fog cleared off the sun shone the ladies chatted and laughed even mrs milliken was in good humor my wife is all intellect milliken says looking at her with admiration and talked with us freely and gayly she was kind enough to say that it was a great pleasure to meet with a literary and wellinformed personthat one often lived with people that did not comprehend one she asked if my companion that tall gentlemanmr serjeant lankin was hewas literary and when i said that lankin knew more greek and more latin and more law and more history and more everything than all the passengers put together she vouchsafed to look at him with interest and enter into a conversation with my modest friend the serjeant then it was that her adoring husband said his lavinia was all intellectlady kicklebury saying that she was not a literary woman that in her day few acquirements were requisite for the british female but that she knew the spirit of the age and her duty as a mother and that lavinia and fanny had had the best masters and the best education which money and constant maternal solicitude could impart if our matrons are virtuous as they are and it is britains boast permit me to say that they certainly know it  the conversation growing powerfully intellectual under mrs milliken poor hicks naturally became uneasy and put an end to literature by admiring the ladies headdresses cabheads hoods what do you call em he asked of miss kicklebury indeed she and her sister wore a couple of those blue silk overbonnets which have lately become the fashion and which i never should have mentioned but for the young ladys reply  those hoods she saidwe call those hoods uglies captain hicks  oh how pretty she looked as she said it the blue eyes looked up under the blue hood so archly and gayly ever so many dimples began playing about her face her little voice rang so fresh and sweet that a heart which has never loved a tree or flower but the vegetable in question was sure to perisha heart worn down and sickened by repeated disappointment mockery faithlessnessa heart whereof despair is an accustomed tenant and in whose desolate and lonely depths dwells an abiding gloom began to throb once morebegan to beckon hope from the windowbegan to admit sunshinebegan too folly folly o fanny o miss k how lovely you looked as you said we call those hoods uglies ugly indeed   this is a chronicle of feelings and characters not of events and places so much all this time our vessel was making rapid way up the river and we saw before us the slim towers of the noble cathedral of antwerp soaring in the rosy sunshine lankin and i had agreed to go to the grand laboureur or the place de meir they give you a particular kind of jamtarts therecalled nuns tarts i thinkthat i remember these twenty years as the very best tartsas good as the tarts which we ate when we were boys the laboureur is a dear old quiet comfortable hotel and there is no man in england who likes a good dinner better than lankin  what hotel do you go to i asked of lady kicklebury  we go to the saint antoine of course everybody goes to the saint antoine her ladyship said we propose to rest here to do the rubenss and to proceed to cologne tomorrow horace call finch and bowman and your courier if he will have the condescension to wait upon me will perhaps look to the baggage  i think lankin said i as everybody seems going to the saint antoine we may as well go and not spoil the party  i think ill go too says hicks as if he belonged to the party  and oh it was a great sight when we landed and at every place at which we paused afterwards to see hirsch over the kicklebury baggage and hear his polyglot maledictions at the porters if a man sometimes feels sad and lonely at his bachelor condition if some feelings of envy pervade his heart at seeing beauty on anothers arm and kind eyes directed towards a happier mug than his ownat least there are some consolations in travelling when a fellow has but one little portmanteau or bag which he can easily shoulder and thinks of the innumerable bags and trunks which the married man and the father drags after him the married briton on a tour is but a luggage overseer his luggage is his morning thought and his nightly terror when he floats along the rhine he has one eye on a ruin and the other on his luggage when he is in the railroad he is always thinking or ordered by his wife to think is the luggage safe it clings round him it never leaves him except when it does leave him as a trunk or two will and make him doubly miserable his carpetbags lie on his chest at night and his wifes forgotten bandbox haunts his turbid dreams  i think it was after she found that lady kicklebury proposed to go to the grand saint antoine that lady knightsbridge put herself with her maid into a carriage and went to the other inn we saw her at the cathedral where she kept aloof from our party milliken went up the tower and so did miss fanny i am too old a traveller to mount up those immeasurable stairs for the purpose of making myself dizzy by gazing upon a vast map of low countries stretched beneath me and waited with mrs milliken and her mother below  when the towerclimbers descended we asked miss fanny and her brother what they had seen  we saw captain hicks up there remarked milliken and i am very glad you didnt come lavinia my love the excitement would have been too much for you quite too much  all this while lady kicklebury was looking at fanny and fanny was holding her eyes down and i knew that between her and this poor hicks there could be nothing serious for she had laughed at him and mimicked him to me half a dozen times in the course of the day  we do the rubenss as lady kicklebury says we trudge from cathedral to picturegallery from church to church we see the calm old city with its towers and gables the bourse and the vast townhall and i have the honor to give lady kicklebury my arm during these peregrinations and to hear a hundred particulars regarding her ladyships life and family how milliken has been recently building at pigeoncot how he will have two thousand a year more when his uncle dies how she had peremptorily to put a stop to the assiduities of that unprincipled young man lord roughhead whom lavinia always detested and who married miss brent out of sheer pique it was a great escape for her darling lavinia roughhead is a most wild and dissipated young man one of kickleburys christchurch friends of whom her son has too many alas and she enters into many particulars respecting the conduct of kickleburythe unhappy boys smoking his love of billiards his fondness for the turf she fears he has already injured his income she fears he is even now playing at noirbourg she is going thither to wean him if possible from his companions and his gayetieswhat may not a mother effect she only wrote to him the day before they left london to announce that she was marching on him with her family he is in many respects like his poor fatherthe same openness and frankness the same easy disposition alas the same love of pleasure but she had reformed the father and will do her utmost to call back her dear misguided boy she had an advantageous match for him in viewa lady not beautiful in person it is true but possessed of every good principle and a very very handsome fortune it was under pretence of flying from this lady that kicklebury left town but she knew better  i say young men will be young men and sow their wild oats and think to myself that the invasion of his mamma will be perhaps more surprising than pleasant to young sir thomas kicklebury and that she possibly talks about herself and her family and her virtues and her daughters a little too much but she will make a confidant of me and all the time we are doing the rubenss she is talking of the pictures at kicklebury of her portrait by lawrence pronounced to be his finest work of lavinias talent for drawing and the expense of fannys musicmasters of her house in town where she hopes to see me of her parties which were stopped by the illness of her butler she talks kicklebury until i am sick and oh miss fanny all of this i endure like an old fool for an occasional sight of your bright eyes and rosy face   another parenthesiswe hope to see you in town mr titmarsh foolish mockery if all the people whom one has met abroad and who have said we hope to meet you often in town had but made any the slightest efforts to realize their hopes by sending a simple line of invitation through the penny post what an enormous dinner acquaintance one would have had but i mistrust people who say we hope to see you in town   lankin comes in at the end of the day just before dinnertime he has paced the whole town by himselfchurch tower and fortifications and rubens and all he is full of egmont and alva he is up to all the history of the siege when chassee defended and the french attacked the place after dinner we stroll along the quays and over the quiet cigar in the hotel court monsieur lankin discourses about the rubens pictures in a way which shows that the learned serjeant has an eye for pictorial beauty as well as other beauties in this world and can rightly admire the vast energy the prodigal genius the royal splendor of the king of antwerp in the most modest way in the world he has remarked a student making clever sketches at the museum and has ordered a couple of copies from him of the famous vandyke and the wondrous adoration of the magi a greater picture says he than even the cathedral picture in which opinion those may agree who like he says he thinks miss kicklebury is a pretty little thing that all my swans are geese and that as for that old woman with her airs and graces she is the most intolerable old nuisance in the world there is much good judgment but there is too much sardonic humor about lankin he cannot appreciate women properly he is spoiled by being an old bachelor and living in that dingy old pump court where by the way he has a cellar fit for a pontiff we go to rest they have given us humble lodgings high up in the building which we accept like philosophers who travel with but a portmanteau apiece the kickleburys have the grand suite as becomes their dignity which which of those twinkling lights illumines the chamber of miss fanny  hicks is sitting in the court too smoking his cigar he and lankin met in the fortifications lankin says he is a sensible fellow and seems to know his profession every man can talk well about something the serjeant says and one man can about everything says i at which lankin blushes and we take our flaring tallow candles and go to bed he has us up an hour before the starting time and we have that period to admire herr oberkellner who swaggers as becomes the oberkellner of a house frequented by ambassadors who contradicts us to our faces and whose own countenance is ornamented with yesterdays beard of which or of any part of his clothing the graceful youth does not appear to have divested himself since last we left him we recognize somewhat dingy and faded the elaborate shirtfront which appeared at yesterdays banquet farewell herr oberkellner may we never see your handsome countenance washed or unwashed shaven or unshorn again  here come the ladies good morning miss fanny i hope you slept well lady kicklebury a tremendous bill no wonder how can you expect otherwise when you have such a bad dinner hearken to hirschs comminations over the luggage look at the honest belgian soldiers and that fat freyschutz on guard his rifle in one hand and the other hand in his pocket captain hicks bursts into a laugh at the sight of the fat freyschutz and says by jove titmarsh you must cawickachaw him and we take our seats at length and at leisure and the railway trumpets blow and save for a brief halt we never stop till night trumpeting by green flats and pastures by broad canals and old towns through liege and verviers through aix and cologne till we are landed at bonn at nightfall  we all have supper or teawe have become pretty intimatewe look at the strangers book as a matter of course in the great room of the star hotel why everybody is on the rhine here are the names of half ones acquaintance  i see lord and lady exborough are gone on says lady kicklebury whose eye fastens naturally on her kindred aristocracy lord and lady wyebridge and suite lady zedland and her family  hallo heres cutler of the onetyoneth and macmull of the greens en route to noirbourg says hicks confidentially know macmull devilish good fellowsuch a fellow to smoke  lankin too reads and grins why are they going the rhenish circuit he says and reads  sir thomas minos lady minos nebst begleitung aus england  sir john aeacus mit familie und dienerschaft aus england  sir roger raadamanthus  thomas smith serjeant  serjeant brown and mrs brown aus england  serjeant tomkins anglais madame tomkins mesdemoiselles tomkins  monsieur kewsy conseiller de s m la reine dangleterre mrs kewsy three miss kewsys  and to this list lankin laughing had put down his own name and that of the readers obedient servant under the august autograph of lady kicklebury who signed for herself her soninlaw and her suite  yes we all flock the one after the other we faithful english folks we can buy harvey sauce and cayenne pepper and morisons pills in every city in the world we carry our nation everywhere with us and are in our island wherever we go toto divisos orbealways separated from the people in the midst of whom we are   when we came to the steamer next morning the castled crag of drachenfels rose up in the sunrise before and looked as pink as the cheeks of master jacky when they have been just washed in the morning how that rosy light too did become miss fannys pretty dimples to be sure how good a cigar is at the early dawn i maintain that it has a flavor which it does not possess at later hours and that it partakes of the freshness of all nature and wine too wine is never so good as at breakfast only one cant drink it for tipsinesss sake  see there is a young fellow drinking sodawater and brandy already he puts down his glass with a gasp of satisfaction it is evident that he had need of that fortifier and refresher he puts down the beaker and says how are you titmarsh i was so cut last night my eyes wasnt i not in the least thats all  it is the youthful descendant and heir of an ancient line the noble earl of grimsbys son viscount talboys he is travelling with the rev baring leader his tutor who having a great natural turn and liking towards the aristocracy and having inspected lady kickleburys cards on her trunks has introduced himself to her ladyship already and has inquired after sir thomas kicklebury whom he remembers perfectly and whom he had often the happiness of meeting when sir thomas was an undergraduate at oxford there are few characters more amiable and delightful to watch and contemplate than some of those middleaged oxford bucks who hang about the university and live with the young tufts leader can talk racing and boating with the fastest young christchurch gentleman leader occasionally rides to cover with lord talboys is a good shot and seldom walks out without a setter or a spaniel at his heels leader knows the peerage and the racing calendar as well as the oxford crambooks leader comes up to town and dines with lord grimsby leader goes to court every two years he is the greatest swell in his commonroom he drinks claret and cant stand portwine any longer and the old fellows of his college admire him and pet him and get all their knowledge of the world and the aristocracy from him i admire those kind old dons when they appear affable and jaunty men of the world members of the camford and oxbridge club upon the london pavement i like to see them over the morning post in the commonroom with a ha i see lady rackstraw has another daughter poppleton there has been at another party at x house and you werent asked my boylord coverdale has got a large party staying at coverdale did you know him at christchurch he was a very handsome man before he broke his nose fighting the bargeman at iffly a light weight but a beautiful sparrer c let me add that leader although he does love a tuft has a kind heart as his mother and sisters in yorkshire know as all the village knows toowhich is proud of his position in the great world and welcomes him very kindly when he comes down and takes the duty at christmas and preaches to them one or two of the very sermons which lord grimsby was good enough to like when i delivered them at talboys  you are not acquainted with lord talboys leader asks with a degage air i shall have much pleasure in introducing you to him talboys let me introduce you to lady kicklebury sir thomas kicklebury was not at christchurch in your time but you have heard of him i dare say your son has left a reputation at oxford  i should think i have too he walked a hundred miles in a hundred hours they said he bet that hed drink a hundred pints of beer in a hundred hours but i dont think he could do itnot strong beer dont think any man could the beer here isnt worth a  my dear talboys says leader with a winning smile i suppose lady kicklebury is not a judge of beerand what an unromantic subject of conversation here under the castled crag immortalized by byron  what the deuce does it mean about peasantgirls with dark blue eyes and hands that offer corn and wine asks talboys ive never seen any peasantgirls except theugliest set of women i ever looked at  the poets license i see miliken you are making a charming sketch you used to draw when you were at brasenose milliken and playyes you played the violoncello  mr milliken still possessed these accomplishments he was taken up that very evening by a soldier at coblentz for making a sketch of ehrenbreitstein mrs milliken sketches immensely too and writes poetry such dreary pictures such dreary poems but professional people are proverbially jealous and i doubt whether our fellowpassenger the german would even allow that milliken could play the violoncello  lady kicklebury gives miss fanny a nudge when lord talboys appears and orders her to exert all her fascinations how the old lady coaxes and she wheedles she pours out the talboys pedigree upon him and asks after his aunt and his mothers family is he going to noirbourg how delightful there is nothing like british spirits and to see an english matron well set upon a young man of large fortune and high rank is a great and curious sight  and yet somehow the british doggedness does not always answer do you know that old woman in the drab jacket titmarsh my hereditary legislator asks of me what the devil is she bothering me for about my aunts and setting her daughter at me i aint such a fool as that i aint clever titmarsh i never said i was i never pretend to be clever and thatbut why does that old fool bother me hay heigho im devilish thirsty i was devilish cut last night i think i must have another gooff hallo you kellner garsong ody soda oter petty vare do dyvee de conac thats your sort isnt it leader  you will speak french well enough if you practise says leader with a tender voice practice is everything shall we dine at the tabledhote waiter put down the name of viscount talboys and mr leader if you please  the boat is full of all sorts and conditions of men forard there are peasants and soldiers stumpy placidlooking little warriors for the most part smoking feeble cigars and looking quite harmless under their enormous helmets a poor stunted dulllooking boy of sixteen staggering before a blackstriped sentrybox with an enormous musket on his shoulder does not seem to me a martial or aweinspiring object has it not been said that we carry our prejudices everywhere and only admire what we are accustomed to admire in our own country  yonder walks a handsome young soldier who has just been marrying a wife how happy they seem and how pleased that everybody should remark their happiness it is a fact that in the full sunshine and before a couple of hundred people on board the joseph miller steamer the soldier absolutely kissed mrs soldier at which the sweet fanny kicklebury was made to blush  we were standing together looking at the various groups the pretty peasantwoman really pretty for once with the red headdress and fluttering ribbons and the child in her arms the jolly fat old gentleman who was drinking rhinewine before noon and turning his back upon all the castles towers and ruins which reflected their crumbling peaks in the water upon the handsome young students who came with us from bonn with their national colors in their caps with their picturesque looks their yellow ringlets their budding moustaches and with cuts upon almost every one of their noses obtained in duels at the university most picturesque are these young fellows indeedbut ah why need they have such black hands  near us is a type too a man who adorns his own tale and points his own moral yonder in his carriage sits the count de reineck who wont travel without that dismal old chariot though it is shabby costly and clumsy and though the wicked red republicans come and smoke under his very nose yes miss fanny it is the lusty young germany pulling the nose of the wornout old world  law what do you mean mr titmarsh cries the dear fanny  and here comes mademoiselle de reineck with her companion you see she is wearing out one of the faded silk gowns which she has spoiled at the residenz during the season for the reinecks are economical though they are proud and forced like many other insolvent grandees to do and to wear shabby things  it is very kind of the young countess to call her companion louise and to let louise call her laure but if faces may be trustedand we can read in one countenance conceit and tyranny deceit and slyness in anotherdear louise has to suffer some hard raps from dear laure and to judge from her dress i dont think poor louise has her salary paid very regularly  what a comfort it is to live in a country where there is neither insolence nor bankruptcy among the great folks nor cringing nor flattery among the small isnt it miss fanny  miss fanny says that she cant understand whether i am joking or serious and her mamma calls her away to look at the ruins of wigginstein everybody looks at wigginstein you are told in murray to look at wigginstein   lankin who has been standing by with a grin every now and then upon his sardonic countenance comes up and says titmarsh how can you be so impertinent  impertinent as how  the girl must understand what you mean and you shouldnt laugh at her own mother to her did you ever see anything like the way in which that horrible woman is following the young lord about  see you see it every day my dear fellow only the trick is better done and lady kicklebury is rather a clumsy practitioner see why nobody is better aware of the springes which are set to catch him than that young fellow himself who is as knowing as any veteran in may fair and you dont suppose that lady kicklebury fancies that she is doing anything mean or anything wrong heaven bless you she never did anything wrong in her life she has no idea but that everything she says and thinks and does is right and no doubt she never did rob a church and was a faithful wife to sir thomas and pays her tradesmen confound her virtue it is that which makes her so wonderfulthat brass armor in which she walks impenetrablenot knowing what pity is or charity crying sometimes when she is vexed or thwarted but laughing never cringing and domineering by the same natural instinctnever doubting about herself above all let us rise and revolt against those people lankin let us war with them and smite them utterly it is to use against these especially that scorn and satire were invented  and the animal you attack says lankin is provided with a hide to defend himit is a common ordinance of nature   and so we pass by tower and town and float up the rhine we dont describe the river who does not know it how you see people asleep in the cabins at the most picturesque parts and angry to be awakened when they fire off those stupid guns for the echoes it is as familiar to numbers of people as greenwich and we know the merits of the inns along the road as if they were the trafalgar or the star and garter how stale everything grows if we were to live in a garden of eden now and the gate were open we should go out and tramp forward and push on and get up early in the morning and push on againanything to keep moving anything to get a change anything but quiet for the restless children of cain   so many thousands of english folks have been at rougetnoirbourg in this and last seasons that it is scarcely needful to alter the name of that pretty little gay wicked place there were so many british barristers there this year that they called the hotel des quatre saisons the hotel of quarter sessions there were judges and their wives serjeants and their ladies queens counsel learned in the law the northern circuit and the western circuit there were officers of halfpay and fullpay military officers naval officers and sheriffs officers there were people of high fashion and rank and people of no rank at all there were men and women of reputation and of the two kinds of reputation there were english boys playing cricket english pointers putting up the german partridges and english guns knocking them down there were women whose husbands and men whose wives were at home there were high church and low churchengland turned out for a holiday in a word how much farther shall we extend our holiday ground and where shall we camp next a winter at cairo is nothing now perhaps ere long we shall be going to saratoga springs and the americans coming to margate for the summer  apartments befitting her dignity and the number of her family had been secured for lady kicklebury by her dutiful son in the same house in which one of lankins friends had secured for us much humbler lodgings kicklebury received his mothers advent with a great deal of good humor and a wonderful figure the goodnatured little baronet was when he presented himself to his astonished friends scarcely recognizable by his own parent and sisters and the staring retainers of their house  mercy kicklebury have you become a red republican his mother asked  i cant find a place to kiss you said miss fanny laughing to her brother and he gave her pretty cheek such a scrub with his red beard as made some folks think it would be very pleasant to be miss fannys brother  in the course of his travels one of sir thomas kickleburys chief amusements and cares had been to cultivate this bushy auburn ornament he said that no man could pronounce german properly without a beard to his jaws but he did not appear to have got much beyond this preliminary step to learning and in spite of his beard his honest english accent came out as his jolly english face looked forth from behind that fierce and bristly decoration perfectly goodhumored and unmistakable we try our best to look like foreigners but we cant every italian mendicant or pont neuf beggar knows his englishman in spite of blouse and beard and slouched hat there is a peculiar highbred grace about us i whisper to lady kicklebury an aristocratic je ne scais quoi which is not to be found in any but englishmen and it is that which makes us so immensely liked and admired all over the continent well this may be truth or jokethis may be a sneer or a simple assertion our vulgarities and our insolences may perhaps make us as remarkable as that high breeding which we assume to possess it may be that the continental society ridicules and detests us as we walk domineering over europe but after all which of us would denationalize himself who wouldnt be an englishman come sir cosmopolite as you are passing all your winters at rome or at paris exiled by choice or poverty from your own country preferring easier manners cheaper pleasures a simpler life are you not still proud of your british citizenship and would you like to be a frenchman  kicklebury has a great acquaintance at noirbourg and as he walks into the great concertroom at night introducing his mother and sisters there he seemed to look about with a little anxiety lest all of his acquaintance should recognize him there are some in that most strange and motley company with whom he had rather not exchange salutations under present circumstances pleasureseekers from every nation in the world are here sharpers of both sexes wearers of the stars and cordons of every court in europe russian princesses spanish grandees belgian french and english nobles every degree of briton from the ambassador who has his conge to the london apprentice who has come out for his fortnights lark kicklebury knows them all and has a goodnatured nod for each  who is that lady with the three daughters who saluted you kicklebury asks his mother  that is our ambassadress at x maam i saw her yesterday buying a penny toy for one of her little children in frankfort fair  lady kicklebury looks towards lady x she makes her excellency an undeveloped curtsy as it were she waves her plumed head lady k is got up in great style in a rich dejeuner toilette perfectly regardless of expense she salutes the ambassadress with a sweeping gesture from her chair and backs before her as before royalty and turns to her daughters large eyes full of meaning and spreads out her silks in state  and who is that distinguishedlooking man who just passed and who gave you a reserved nod asks her ladyship is that lord x  kicklebury burst out laughing that maam is mr higmore of conduit street tailor draper and habitmaker and i owe him a hundred pound  the insolence of that sort of people is really intolerable says lady kicklebury there must be some distinction of classes they ought not to be allowed to go everywhere and who is yonder that lady with the two boys and thethe very high complexion lady kicklebury asks  that is a russian princess and one of those little boys the one who is sucking a piece of barleysugar plays and wins five hundred louis in a night  kicklebury you do not play promise your mother you do not swear to me at this moment you do not where are the horrid gamblingrooms there at that door where the crowd is of course i shall never enter them  of course not maam says the affectionate son on duty and if you come to the balls here please dont let fanny dance with anybody until you ask me first you understand fanny you will take care  yes tom says fanny  what hicks how are you old fellow how is platts who would have thought of you being here when did you come  i had the pleasure of travelling with lady kicklebury and her daughters in the london boat to antwerp says captain hicks making the ladies a bow kicklebury introduces hicks to his mother as his most particular friendand he whispers fanny that hes as good a fellow as ever lived hicks is fanny says he seems very kind and goodnatured andand captain hicks waltzes very well says miss fanny with a blush and i hope i may have him for one of my partners  what a babel of tongues it is in this splendid hall with gleaming marble pillars a ceaseless rushing whisper as if the band were playing its music by a waterfall the british lawyers are all got together and my friend lankin on his arrival has been carried off by his brother serjeants and becomes once more a lawyer well brother lankin says old sir thomas minos with his venerable kind face you have got your rule i see and they fall into talk about their law matters as they always do wherever they areat a club in a ballroom at a dinnertable at the top of chimborazo some of the young barristers appear as bucks with uncommon splendor and dance and hang about the ladies but they have not the easy languid deucemaycare air of the young bucks of the hicks and kicklebury schoolthey cant put on their clothes with that happy negligence their neckcloths sit quite differently on them somehow they become very hot when they dance and yet do not spin round near so quickly as those london youths who have acquired experience in corpore vili and learned to dance easily by the practice of a thousand casinos  above the babel tongues and the clang of the music as you listen in the great saloon you hear from a neighboring room a certain sharp ringing clatter and a hard clear voice cries out zero rouge or trentecinq noir impair et passe and then there is a pause of a couple of minutes and then the voice says faites le jeu messieurs le jeu est fait rien ne va plusand the sharp ringing clatter recommences you know what that room is that is hades that is where the spirited proprietor of the establishment takes his toll and thither the people go who pay the money which supports the spirited proprietor of this fine palace and gardens let us enter hades and see what is going on there  hades is not an unpleasant place most of the people look rather cheerful you dont see any frantic gamblers gnashing their teeth or dashing down their last stakes the winners have the most anxious faces or the poor shabby fellows who have got systems and are pricking down the alternations of red and black on cards and dont seem to be playing at all on fete days the country people come in men and women to gamble and they seem to be excited as they put down their hardearned florins with trembling rough hands and watch the turn of the wheel but what you call the good company is very quiet and easy a man loses his mass of gold and gets up and walks off without any particular mark of despair the only gentleman whom i saw at noirbourg who seemed really affected was a certain count de mustacheff a russian of enormous wealth who clenched his fists beat his breast cursed his stars and absolutely cried with grief not for losing money but for neglecting to win and play upon a coup de vingt a series in which the red was turned up twenty times running which series had he but played it is clear that he might have broken m lenoirs bank and shut up the gamblinghouse and doubled his own fortunewhen he would have been no happier and all the balls and music all the newspaperrooms and parks all the feasting and pleasure of this delightful rougetnoirbourg would have been at an end  for though he is a wicked gambling prince lenoir he is beloved in all these regions his establishment gives life to the town to the lodginghouse and hotelkeepers to the milliners and hackneycoachmen to the letters of horseflesh to the huntsmen and gardesdechasse to all these honest fiddlers and trumpeters who play so delectably were lenoirs bank to break the whole little city would shut up and all the noirbourgers wish him prosperity and benefit by his good fortune  three years since the noirbourgers underwent a mighty panic there came at a time when the chief lenoir was at paris and the reins of government were in the hands of his younger brother a company of adventurers from belgium with a capital of three hundred thousand francs and an infallible system for playing rouge et noir and they boldly challenged the bank of lenoir and sat down before his croupiers and defied him they called themselves in their pride the contrebanque de noirbourg they had their croupiers and punters even as lenoir had his they had their rouleaux of napoleons stamped with their contrebanquish sealand they began to play  as when two mighty giants step out of a host and engage the armies stand still in expectation and the puny privates and commonalty remain quiet to witness the combat of the tremendous champions of the war so it is said that when the contrebanque arrived and ranged itself before the officers of lenoirrouleau to rouleau banknote to banknote war for war controlment for controlmentall the minor punters and gamblers ceased their peddling play and looked on in silence round the verdant plain where the great combat was to be decided  not used to the vast operations of war like his elder brother lenoir junior the lieutenant telegraphed to his absent chief the news of the mighty enemy who had come down upon him asked for instructions and in the meanwhile met the foeman like a man the contrebanque of noirbourg gallantly opened its campaign  the lenoir bank was defeated day after day in numerous savage encounters the tactics of the contrebanquist generals were irresistible their infernal system bore down everything before it and they marched onwards terrible and victorious as the macedonian phalanx tuesday a loss of eighteen thousand florins wednesday a loss of twelve thousand florins thursday a loss of forty thousand florins night after night the young lenoir had to chronicle these disasters in melancholy despatches to his chief what was to be done night after night the noirbourgers retired home doubtful and disconsolate the horrid contrebanquists gathered up their spoils and retired to a victorious supper how was it to end  far away at paris the elder lenoir answered these appeals of his brother by sending reinforcements of money chests of gold arrived for the bank the prince of noirbourg bade his beleaguered lieutenant not to lose heart he himself never for a moment blenched in this trying hour of danger  the contrebanquists still went on victorious rouleau after rouleau fell into their possession at last the news came the emperor has joined the grand army lenoir himself had arrived from paris and was once more among his children his people the daily combats continued and still still though napoleon was with the eagles the abominable contrebanquists fought and conquered and far greater than napoleon as great as ney himself under disaster the bold lenoir never lost courage never lost goodhumor was affable was gentle was careful of his subjects pleasures and comforts and met an adverse fortune with a dauntless smile  with a devilish forbearance and coolness the atrocious contrebanquelike polyphemus who only took one of his prisoners out of the cave at a time and so ate them off at leisurethe horrid contrebanquists i say contented themselves with winning so much before dinner and so much before suppersay five thousand florins for each meal they played and won at noon they played and won at eventide they of noirbourg went home sadly every night the invader was carrying all before him what must have been the feelings of the great lenoir what were those of washington before trenton when it seemed all up with the cause of american independence what those of the virgin elizabeth when the armada was signalled what those of miltiades when the multitudinous persian bore down on marathon the people looked on at the combat and saw their chieftain stricken bleeding fallen fighting still  at last there came one day when the contrebanquists had won their allotted sum and were about to leave the tables which they had swept so often but pride and lust of gold had seized upon the heart of one of their vainglorious chieftains and he said do not let us go yetlet us win a thousand florins more so they stayed and set the bank yet a thousand florins the noirbourgers looked on and trembled for their prince  some three hours afterwardsa shout a mighty shout was heard around the windows of that palace the town the gardens the hills the fountains took up and echoed the jubilant acclaim hip hip hip hurrah hurrah hurrah people rushed into each others arms men women and children cried and kissed each other croupiers who never feel who never tremble who never care whether black wins or red loses took snuff from each others boxes and laughed for joy and lenoir the dauntless the invincible lenoir wiped the drops of perspiration from his calm forehead as he drew the enemys last rouleau into his till he had conquered the persians were beaten horse and footthe armada had gone down since wellington shut up his telescope at waterloo when the prussians came charging on to the field and the guard broke and fled there had been no such heroic endurance such utter defeat such signal and crowning victory vive lenoir i am a lenoirite i have read his newspapers strolled in his gardens listened to his music and rejoice in his victory i am glad he beat those contrebanquists dissipati sunt the game is up with them   the instances of this mans magnanimity are numerous and worthy of alexander the great or harry the fifth or robin hood most gentle is he and thoughtful to the poor and merciful to the vanquished when jeremy diddler who had lost twenty pounds at his table lay in inglorious pawn at his innwhen otoole could not leave noirbourg until he had received his remittances from irelandthe noble lenoir paid diddlers inn bill advanced otoole money upon his wellknown signature franked both of them back to their native country again and has never wonderful to state been paid from that day to this if you will go play at his table you may but nobody forces you if you lose pay with a cheerful heart dulce est desipere in loco this is not a treatise of morals friar tuck was not an exemplary ecclesiastic nor robin hood a model man but he was a jolly outlaw and i dare say the sheriff of nottingham whose money he took rather relished his feast at robins green table  and if you lose worthy friend as possibly you will at lenoirs pretty games console yourself by thinking that it is much better for you in the end that you should lose than that you should win let me for my part make a clean breast of it and own that your humble servant did on one occasion win a score of napoleons and beginning with a sum of no less than five shillings but until i had lost them again i was so feverish excited and uneasy that i had neither delectation in reading the most exciting french novels nor pleasure in seeing pretty landscapes nor appetite for dinner the moment however that graceless money was gone equanimity was restored paul feval and eugene sue began to be terrifically interesting again and the dinners at noirbourg though by no means good culinary specimens were perfectly sufficient for my easy and tranquil mind lankin who played only a lawyers rubber at whist marked the salutary change in his friends condition and for my part i hope and pray that every honest reader of this volume who plays at m lenoirs table will lose every shilling of his winnings before he goes away where are the gamblers whom we have read of where are the cardplayers whom we can remember in our early days at one time almost every gentleman played and there were whisttables in every ladys drawingroom but trumps are going out along with numbers of oldworld institutions and before very long a blackleg will be as rare an animal as a knight in armor  there was a little dwarfish abortive counter bank set up at noirbourg this year but the gentlemen soon disagreed among themselves and let us hope were cut off in detail by the great lenoir and there was a frenchman at our inn who had won two napoleons per day for the last six weeks and who had an infallible system whereof he kindly offered to communicate the secret for the consideration of a hundred louis but there came one fatal night when the poor frenchmans system could not make head against fortune and her wheel went over him and he disappeared utterly   with the early morning everybody rises and makes his or her appearance at the springs where they partake of water with a wonderful energy and perseverance they say that people get to be fond of this water at last as to what tastes cannot men accustom themselves i drank a couple of glasses of an abominable sort of feeble salts in a state of very gentle effervescence but though there was a very pretty girl who served it the drink was abominable and it was a marvel to see the various topers who tossed off glass after glass which the fairhaired little hebe delivered sparkling from the well  seeing my wry faces old captain carver expostulated with a jolly twinkle of his eye as he absorbed the contents of a sparkling crystal beaker pooh take another glass sir youll like it better and better every day it refreshes you sir it fortifies you and as for liking itgad i remember the time when i didnt like claret times are altered now ha ha mrs fantail madam i wish you a very good morning how is fantail he dont come to drink the water so much the worse for him  to see mrs fantail of an evening is to behold a magnificent sight she ought to be shown in a room by herself and indeed would occupy a moderatesized one with her person and adornments marie antoinettes hoop is not bigger than mrs fantails flounces twenty men taking hands and indeed she likes to have at least that number about her would scarcely encompass her her chestnut ringlets spread out in a halo round her face she must want two or three coiffeurs to arrange that prodigious headdress and then when it is done how can she endure that extraordinary gown her travelling bandboxes must be as large as omnibuses  but see mrs fantail in the morning having taken in all sail the chestnut curls have disappeared and two limp bands of brown hair border her lean sallow face you see before you an ascetic a nun a woman worn by mortifications of a sad yellow aspect drinking salts at the well a vision quite different from that rapturous one of the previous nights ballroom no wonder fantail does not come out of a morning he had rather not see such a rebecca at the well  lady kicklebury came for some mornings pretty regularly and was very civil to mr leader and made miss fanny drink when his lordship took a cup and asked lord talboys and his tutor to dinner but the tutor came and blushing brought an excuse from talboys and poor milliken had not a very pleasant evening after mr baring leader rose to go away  but though the water was not good the sun was bright the music cheery the landscape fresh and pleasant and it was always amusing to see the vast varieties of our human species that congregated at the springs and trudged up and down the green allees one of the gambling conspirators of the roulettetable it was good to see here in his private character drinking down pints of salts like any other sinner having a homely wife on his arm and between them a poodle on which they lavished their tenderest affection you see these people care for other things besides trumps and are not always thinking about black and redas even ogres are represented in their histories as of cruel natures and licentious appetites and to be sure fond of eating men and women but yet it appears that their wives often respected them and they had a sincere liking for their own hideous children and besides the cardplayers there are bandplayers every now and then a fiddle from the neighboring orchestra or a disorganized bassoon will step down and drink a glass of the water and jump back into his rank again  then come the burly troops of english the honest lawyers merchants and gentlemen with their wives and buxom daughters and stout sons that almost grown to the height of manhood are boys still with rough wideawake hats and shootingjackets full of lark and laughter a french boy of sixteen has had des passions ere that time very likely and is already particular in his dress an ogler of the women and preparing to kill adolphe says to alphonsela voila cette charmante miss fanni la belle kickleburi je te donne ma parole elle est fraiche comme une rose la croistu riche alphonse je me range mon ami voistu la vie de garcon me pese ma parole dhonneur je me range  and he gives miss fanny a killing bow and a glance which seems to say sweet anglaise i know that i have won your heart  then besides the young french buck whom we will willingly suppose harmless you see specimens of the french raff who goes aux eaux gambler speculator sentimentalist duellist travelling with madame his wife at whom other raffs nod and wink familiarly this rogue is much more picturesque and civilized than the similar person in our own country whose manners betray the stable who never reads anything but bells life and who is much more at ease in conversing with a groom than with his employer here come mr boucher and mr fowler better to gamble for a score of nights with honest monsieur lenoir than to sit down in private once with those gentlemen but we have said that their profession is going down and the number of greeks daily diminishes they are travelling with mr bloundell who was a gentleman once and still retains about him some faint odor of that time of bloom and bloundell has put himself on young lord talboys and is trying to get some money out of that young nobleman but the english youth of the present day is a wideawake youth and male or female artifices are expended pretty much in vain on our young travelling companion  who come yonder those two fellows whom we met at the tabledhote at the hotel de russie the other day gentlemen of splendid costume and yet questionable appearances the eldest of whom called for the list of wines and cried out loud enough for all the company to hear lafite six florins arry shall we have some lafite you dont mind no more do i then i say waiter lets ave a pint of ordinaire truth is stranger than fiction you good fellow wherever you are why did you ask arry to ave that pint of ordinaire in the presence of your obedient servant how could he do otherwise than chronicle the speech  and see here is a lady who is doubly desirous to be put into print who encourages it and invites it it appears that on lankins first arrival at noirbourg with his travelling companion a certain sensation was created in the little society by the rumor that an emissary of the famous mr punch had arrived in the place and as we were smoking the cigar of peace on the lawn after dinner looking on at the benevolent pretty scene mrs hopkins miss hopkins and the excellent head of the family walked many times up and down before us eyed us severely face to face and then walking away shot back fierce glances at us in the parthian manner and at length at the third or fourth turn and when we could not but overhear so fine a voice mrs hopkins looks at us steadily and says im sure he may put me in if he likes i dont mind  oh maam oh mrs hopkins how should a gentleman who had never seen your face or heard of you before want to put you in what interest can the british public have in you but as you wish it and court publicity here you are good luck go with you madam i have forgotten your real name and should not know you again if i saw you but why could not you leave a man to take his coffee and smoke his pipe in quiet  we could never have time to make a catalogue of all the portraits that figure in this motley gallery among the travellers in europe who are daily multiplying in numbers and increasing in splendor the united states dandies must not be omitted they seem as rich as the milor of old days they crowd in european capitals they have elbowed out people of the old country from many hotels which we used to frequent they adopt the french fashion of dressing rather than ours and they grow handsomer beards than english beards as some plants are found to flourish and shoot up prodigiously when introduced into a new soil the ladies seem to be as well dressed as parisians and as handsome though somewhat more delicate perhaps than the native english roses they drive the finest carriages they keep the grandest houses they frequent the grandest companyand in a word the broadway swell has now taken his station and asserted his dignity amongst the grandees of europe he is fond of asking count reineck to dinner and grafinn laura will condescend to look kindly upon a gentleman who has millions of dollars here comes a pair of new yorkers behold their elegant curling beards their velvet coats their delicate primrose gloves and cambric handkerchiefs and the aristocratic beauty of their boots why if you had sixteen quarterings you could not have smaller feet than those and if you were descended from a line of kings you could not smoke better or bigger cigars  lady kicklebury deigns to think very well of these young men since she has seen them in the company of grandees and heard how rich they are who is that very stylishlooking woman to whom mr washington walker spoke just now she asks of kicklebury  kicklebury gives a twinkle of his eye oh that mother that is madame la princesse de mogadorits a french title  she danced last night and danced exceedingly well i remarked her theres a very highbred grace about the princess  yes exceedingly wed better come on says kicklebury blushing rather as he returns the princesss nod  it is wonderful how large kickleburys acquaintance is he has a word and a joke in the best german he can muster for everybodyfor the high wellborn lady as for the german peasant maiden or the pretty little washerwoman who comes full sail down the streets a basket on her head and one of mrs fantails wonderful gowns swelling on each arm as we were going to the schlossgarten i caught a sight of the rogues grinning face yesterday close at little gretels ear under her basket but spying out his mother advancing he dashed down a bystreet and when we came up with her gretel was alone  one but seldom sees the english and the holiday visitors in the ancient parts of noirbourg they keep to the streets of new buildings and garden villas which have sprung up under the magic influence of m lenoir under the white towers and gables of the old german town the prince of trente et quarante has quite overcome the old serene sovereign of noirbourg whom one cannot help fancying a prince like a prince in a christmas pantomimea burlesque prince with twopencehalfpenny for a revenue jolly and irascible a primeministerkicking prince fed upon fabulous plumpuddings and enormous pasteboard joints by cooks and valets with large heads which never alter their grin not that this portrait is from the life perhaps he has no life perhaps there is no prince in the great white tower that we see for miles before we enter the little town perhaps he has been mediatized and sold his kingdom to monsieur lenoir before the palace of lenoir there is a grove of orangetrees in tubs which lenoir bought from another german prince who went straightway and lost the money which he had been paid for his wonderful orangetrees over lenoirs green tables at his roulette and trenteetquarante a great prince is lenoir in his way a generous and magnanimous prince you may come to his feast and pay nothing unless you please you may walk in his gardens sit in his palace and read his thousand newspapers you may go and play at whist in his small drawingrooms or dance and hear concerts in his grand saloonand there is not a penny to pay his fiddlers and trumpeters begin trumpeting and fiddling for you at the early dawnthey twang and blow for you in the afternoon they pipe for you at night that you may danceand there is nothing to paylenoir pays for all give him but the chances of the table and he will do all this and more it is better to live under prince lenoir than a fabulous old german durchlaucht whose cavalry ride wicker horses with petticoats and whose prime minister has a great pasteboard head vive le prince lenoir  there is a grotesque old carved gate to the palace of the durchlaucht from which you could expect none but a pantomime procession to pass the place looks asleep the courts are grassgrown and deserted is the sleeping beauty lying yonder in the great white tower what is the little army about it seems a sham army a sort of grotesque military the only charge of infantry was this one day when passing through the old town looking for sketches perhaps they become croupiers at night what can such a fabulous prince want with anything but a sham army my favorite walk was in the ancient quarter of the townthe dear old fabulous quarter away from the noisy actualities of life and prince lenoirs new palaceout of eye and earshot of the dandies and the ladies in their grand best clothes at the promenadesand the rattling whirl of the roulette wheeland i liked to wander in the glum old gardens under the palace wall and imagine the sleeping beauty within there  some one persuaded us one day to break the charm and see the interior of the palace i am sorry we did there was no sleeping beauty in any chamber that we saw nor any fairies good or malevolent there was a shabby set of clean old rooms which looked as if they had belonged to a prince hard put to it for money and whose tin crown jewels would not fetch more than king stephens pantaloons a fugitive prince a brave prince struggling with the storms of fate a prince in exile may be poor but a prince looking out of his own palace windows with a dressinggown out at elbows and dunned by his subject washerwomani say this is a painful object when they get shabby they ought not to be seen dont you think so lady kicklebury lady kicklebury evidently had calculated the price of the carpets and hangings and set them justly down at a low figure these german princes she said are not to be put on a level with english noblemen indeed we answer there is nothing so perfect as england nothing so good as our aristocracy nothing so perfect as our institutions nothing nothing says lady k  an english princess was once brought to reign here and almost the whole of the little court was kept upon her dowry the people still regard her name fondly and they show at the schloss the rooms which she inhabited her old books are still thereher old furniture brought from home the presents and keepsakes sent by her family are as they were in the princesss lifetime the very clock has the name of a windsor maker on its face and portraits of all her numerous race decorate the homely walls of the now empty chambers there is the benighted old king his beard hanging down to the star on his breast and the first gentleman of europeso lavish of his portrait everywhere and so chary of showing his royal personall the stalwart brothers of the now all but extinct generation are there their quarrels and their pleasures their glories and disgraces enemies flatterers detractors admirersall now buried is it not curious to think that the king of trumps now virtually reigns in this place and has deposed the other dynasty  very early one morning wishing to have a sketch of the white tower in which our english princess had been imprisoned i repaired to the gardens and set about a work which when completed will no doubt have the honor of a place on the line at the exhibition and returning homewards to breakfast musing upon the strange fortunes and inhabitants of the queer fantastic melancholy place behold i came suddenly upon a couple of persons a male and a female the latter of whom wore a blue hood or ugly and blushed very much on seeing me the man began to laugh behind his moustaches the which cachinnation was checked by an appealing look from the young lady and he held out his hand and said how dye do titmarsh been out making some cawickachaws hay  i need not say that the youth before me was the heavy dragoon and that the maiden was miss fanny kicklebury or need i repeat that in the course of my blighted being i never loved a young gazelle to glad me with its dark blue eye but when it came to c the usual disappointment was sure to ensue there is no necessity why i should allude to my feelings at this most manifest and outrageous case i gave a withering glance of scorn at the pair and with a stately salutation passed on  miss fanny came tripping after me she held out her little hand with such a pretty look of deprecation that i could not but take it and she said mr titmarsh if you please i want to speak to you if you please and choking with emotion i bade her speak on  my brother knows all about it and highly approves of captain hicks she said with her head hanging down and oh hes very good and kind and i know him much better now than i did when we were on board the steamer  i thought how i had mimicked him and what an ass i had been  and you know she continued that you have quite deserted me for the last ten days for your great acquaintances  i have been to play chess with lord knightsbridge who has the gout  and to drink tea constantly with that american lady and you have written verses in her album and in lavinias album and as i saw that you had quite thrown me off why imy brother approves of it highly andand captain hicks likes you very much and says you amuse him very muchindeed he does says the arch little wretch and then she added a postscript as it were to her letter which contained as usual the point which she wished to urge  youwont break it to mammawill you be so kind my brother will do thatand i promised her and she ran away kissing her hand to me and i did not say a word to lady kicklebury and not above a thousand people at noirbourg knew that miss kicklebury and captain hicks were engaged   and now let those who are too confident of their virtue listen to the truthful and melancholy story which i have to relate and humble themselves and bear in mind that the most perfect among us are occasionally liable to fall kicklebury was not perfecti do not defend his practice he spent a great deal more time and money than was good for him at m lenoirs gamingtable and the only thing which the young fellow never lost was his good humor if fortune shook her swift wings and fled away from him he laughed at the retreating pinions and you saw him dancing and laughing as gayly after losing a rouleau as if he was made of money and really had the five thousand a year which his mother said was the amount of the kicklebury property but when her ladyships jointure and the young ladies allowances and the interest of mortgages were paid out of the five thousand a year i grieve to say that the gallant kickleburys income was to be counted by hundreds and not by thousands so that for any young lady who wants a carriage and who can live without one our friend the baronet is not a desirable specimen of bachelors now whether it was that the presence of his mamma interrupted his pleasures or certain of her ways did not please him or that he had lost all his money at roulette and could afford no more certain it is that after about a fortnights stay at noirbourg he went off to shoot with count einhorn in westphalia he and hicks parting the dearest of friends and the baronet going off on a pony which the captain lent to him between him and millikin his brotherinlaw there was not much sympathy for he pronounced mr milliken to be what is called a muff and had never been familiar with his elder sister lavinia of whose poems he had a mean opinion and who used to tease and worry him by teaching him french and telling tales of him to his mamma when he was a schoolboy home for the holidays whereas between the baronet and miss fanny there seemed to be the closest affection they walked together every morning to the waters they joked and laughed with each other as happily as possible fanny was almost ready to tell fibs to screen her brothers malpractices from her mamma she cried when she heard of his mishaps and that he had lost too much money at the green table and when sir thomas went away the good little soul brought him five louis which was all the money she had for you see she paid her mother handsomely for her board and when her little gloves and milliners bills were settled how much was there left out of two hundred a year and she cried when she heard that hicks had lent sir thomas money and went up and said thank you captain hicks and shook hands with the captain so eagerly that i thought he was a lucky fellow who had a father a wealthy attorney in bedford row heighho i saw how matters were going the birds must sing in the springtime and the flowers bud  mrs milliken in her character of invalid took the advantage of her situation to have her husband constantly about her reading to her or fetching the doctor to her or watching her whilst she was dozing and so forth and lady kicklebury found the life which this pair led rather more monotonous than that sort of existence which she liked and would leave them alone with fanny captain hicks not uncommonly coming in to take tea with the three whilst her ladyship went to the redoute to hear the music or read the papers or play a game of whist there  the newspaperroom at noirbourg is next to the rouletteroom into which the doors are always open and lady k would come with newspaper in hand into this playroom sometimes and look on at the gamesters i have mentioned a little russian boy a little imp with the most mischievous intelligence and good humor in his face who was suffered by his parents to play as much as he chose and who pulled bonbons out of one pocket and napoleons out of the other and seemed to have quite a diabolical luck at the table  lady kickleburys terror and interest at seeing this boy were extreme she watched him and watched him and he seemed always to win and at last her ladyship put down just a florinonly just one florinon one of the numbers at roulette which the little russian imp was backing number twentyseven came up and the croupiers flung over three gold pieces and five florins to lady kicklebury which she raked up with a trembling hand  she did not play any more that night but sat in the playroom pretending to read the times newspaper but you could see her eye peering over the sheet and always fixed on the little imp of a russian he had very good luck that night and his winning made her very savage as he retired rolling his gold pieces into his pocket and sucking his barleysugar she glared after him with angry eyes and went home and scolded everybody and had no sleep i could hear her scolding our apartments in the tissisch house overlooked lady kickleburys suite of rooms the great windows were open in the autumn yes i could hear her scolding and see some other people sitting whispering in the embrasure or looking out on the harvest moon  the next evening lady kicklebury shirked away from the concert and i saw her in the playroom again going round and round the table and lying in ambush behind the journal des debats i marked how after looking stealthily round my lady whipped a piece of money under the croupiers elbow and there having been no coin there previously i saw a florin on the zero  she lost that and walked away then she came back and put down two florins on a number and lost again and became very red and angry then she retreated and came back a third time and a seat being vacated by a player lady kicklebury sat down at the verdant board ah me she had a pretty good evening and carried off a little money again that night the next day was sunday she gave two florins at the collection at church to fannys surprise at mammas liberality on this night of course there was no play her ladyship wrote letters and read a sermon  but the next night she was back at the table and won very plentifully until the little russian sprite made his appearance when it seemed that her luck changed she began to bet upon him and the young calmuck lost too her ladyships temper went along with her money first she backed the calmuck and then she played against him when she played against him his luck turned and he began straightway to win she put on more and more money as she lost her winnings went gold came out of secret pockets she had but a florin left at last and tried it on a number and failed she got up to go away i watched her and i watched mr justice aeacus too who put down a napoleon when he thought nobody was looking  the next day my lady kicklebury walked over to the moneychangers where she changed a couple of circular notes she was at the table that night again and the next night and the next night and the next  by about the fifth day she was like a wild woman she scolded so that hirsch the courier said he should retire from monsieurs service as he was not hired by lady kicklebury that bowman gave warning and told another footman in the building that he wouldnt stand the old cat no longer blow him if he would that the maid who was a kicklebury girl and fanny cried and that mrs millikens maid finch complained to her mistress who ordered her husband to remonstrate with her mother milliken remonstrated with his usual mildness and of course was routed by her ladyship mrs milliken said give me the daggers and came to her husbands rescue a battle royal ensued the scared milliken hanging about his blessed lavinia and entreating and imploring her to be calm mrs milliken was calm she asserted her dignity as mistress of her own family as controller of her own household as wife of her adored husband and she told her mamma that with her or here she must not interfere that she knew her duty as a child but that she also knew it as a wife as a the rest of the sentence was drowned as milliken rushing to her called her his souls angel his adored blessing  lady kicklebury remarked that shakspeare was very right in stating how much sharper than a thankless tooth it is to have a serpent child  mrs milliken said the conversation could not be carried on in this manner that it was best her mamma should now know once for all that the way in which she assumed the command at pigeoncot was intolerable that all the servants had given warning and it was with the greatest difficulty they could be soothed and that as their living together only led to quarrels and painful recriminations the calling her after her forbearance a serpent child was an expression which she would hope to forgive and forget they had better part  lady kicklebury wears a front and i make no doubt a complete jasey or she certainly would have let down her back hair at this minute so overpowering were her feelings and so bitter her indignation at her daughters black ingratitude she intimated some of her sentiments by ejaculatory conjurations of evil she hoped her daughter might not feel what ingratitude was that she might never have children to turn on her and bring her to the grave with grief  bring me to the grave with fiddlestick mrs milliken said with some asperity and as we are going to part mamma and as horace has paid everything on the journey as yet and we have only brought a very few circular notes with us perhaps you will have the kindness to give him your share of the travelling expensesfor you for fanny and your two servants whom you would bring with you and the man has only been a perfect hindrance and great useless log and our courier has had to do everything your share is now eightytwo pounds  lady kicklebury at this gave three screams so loud that even the resolute lavinia stopped in her speech her ladyship looked wildly lavinia horace fanny my child she said come here and listen to your mothers shame  what cried horace aghast  i am ruined i am a beggar yes a beggar i have lost allall at yonder dreadful table  how do you mean all how much is all asked horace  all the money i brought with me horace i intended to have paid the whole expenses of the journey yours this ungrateful childseverything but a week ago having seen a lovely babys lace dress at the laceshop andandwon enough at whwhwhooist to pay for it all but twotwo florinsin an evil moment i went to the roulettetableand lostevery shilling and now on may knees before you i confess my shame  i am not a tragic painter and certainly wont attempt to depict this harrowing scene but what could she mean by saying she wished to pay everything she had but two twentypound notes and how she was to have paid all the expenses of the tour with that small sum i cannot conjecture  the confession however had the effect of mollifying poor milliken and his wife after the latter had learned that her mamma had no money at all at her london bankers and had overdrawn her account there lavinia consented that horace should advance her fifty pounds upon her ladyships solemn promise of repayment  and now it was agreed that this highly respectable lady should return to england quick as she might somewhat sooner than all the rest of the public did and leave mr and mrs horace milliken behind her as the waters were still considered highly salutary to that most interesting invalid and to england lady kicklebury went taking advantage of lord talboys return thither to place herself under his lordships protection as if the enormous bowman was not protector sufficient for her ladyship and as if captain hicks would have allowed any mortal man any german student any french tourist any prussian whiskerando to do a harm to miss fanny for though hicks is not a brilliant or poetical genius i am bound to say that the fellow has good sense good manners and a good heart and with these qualities a competent sum of money and a pair of exceedingly handsome moustaches perhaps the poor little mrs launcelot hicks may be happy   no accident befell lady kicklebury on her voyage homewards but she got one more lesson at aixlachapelle which may serve to make her ladyship more cautious for the future for seeing madame la princesse de mogador enter into a carriage on the railway into which lord talboys followed nothing would content lady kicklebury but to rush into the carriage after this noble pair and the vehicle turned out to be what is called on the german lines and what i wish were established in england the rauch coupe having seated himself in this vehicle and looked rather sulkily at my lady lord talboys began to smoke which as the son of an english earl heir to many thousands per annum lady kicklebury permitted him to do and she introduced herself to madame la princesse de mogador mentioning to her highness that she had the pleasure of meeting madame la princesse at rougetnoirbourg that she lady k was the mother of the chevalier de kicklebury who had the advantage of the acquaintance of madame la princesse and that she hoped madame la princesse had enjoyed her stay at the waters to these advances the princess of mogador returned a gracious and affable salutation exchanging glances of peculiar meaning with two highly respectable bearded gentlemen who travelled in her suite and when asked by milady whereabouts her highnesss residence was at paris said that her hotel was in the rue notre dame de lorette where lady kicklebury hoped to have the honor of waiting upon madame la princesse de mogador  but when one of the bearded gentlemen called the princess by the familiar name of fifine and the other said veuxtu fumer mogador and the princess actually took a cigar and began to smoke lady kicklebury was aghast and trembled and presently lord talboys burst into a loud fit of laughter  what is the cause of your lordships amusement asked the dowager looking very much frightened and blushing like a maiden of sixteen  excuse me lady kicklebury but i cant help it he said youve been talking to your opposite neighborshe dont understand a word of englishand calling her princess and highness and shes no more a princess than you or i she is a little milliner in the street she mentioned and she dances at mabille and chateau rouge  hearing these two familiar names the princess looked hard at lord talboys but he never lost countenance and at the next station lady kicklebury rushed out of the smokingcarriage and returned to her own place where i dare say captain hicks and miss fanny were delighted once more to have the advantage of her company and conversation and so they went back to england and the kickleburys were no longer seen on the rhine if her ladyship is not cured of hunting after great people it will not be for want of warning but which of us in life has not had many warnings and is it for lack of them that we stick to our little failings still   when the kickleburys were gone that merry little rougetnoirbourg did not seem the same place to me somehow the sun shone still but the wind came down cold from the purple hills the band played but their tunes were stale the promenaders paced the alleys but i knew all their faces as i looked out of my windows in the tissisch house upon the great blank casements lately occupied by the kickleburys and remembered what a pretty face i had seen looking thence but a few days back i cared not to look any longer and though mrs milliken did invite me to tea and talked fine arts and poetry over the meal both the beverage and the conversation seemed very weak and insipid to me and i fell asleep once in my chair opposite that highly cultivated being let us go back lankin said i to the serjeant and he was nothing loth for most of the other serjeants barristers and queens counsel were turning homewards by this time the period of term time summoning them all to the temple   so we went straight one day to biberich on the rhine and found the little town full of britons all trooping home like ourselves everybody comes and everybody goes away again at about the same time the rhine innkeepers say that their customers cease with a single day almostthat in three days they shall have ninety eighty a hundred guests on the fourth ten or eight we do as our neighbors do though we dont speak to each other much when we are out apleasuring we take our holiday in common and go back to our work in gangs little biberich was so full that lankin and i could not get rooms at the large inns frequented by other persons of fashion and could only procure a room between us at the german house where you find english comfort says the advertisement with german prices  but oh the english comfort of those beds how did lankin manage in his with his great long legs how did i toss and tumble in mine which small as it was i was not destined to enjoy alone but to pass the night in company with anthropophagous wretched reptiles who took their horrid meal off an english christian i thought the morning would never come and when the tardy dawn at length arrived and as i was in my first sleep dreaming of miss fanny behold i was wakened up by the serjeant already dressed and shaven and who said rise titmarsh the steamer will be here in threequarters of an hour and the modest gentleman retired and left me to dress   the next morning we had passed by the rocks and towers the old familiar landscapes the gleaming towns by the riverside and the green vineyards combed along the hills and when i woke up it was at a great hotel at cologne and it was not sunrise yet  deutz lay opposite and over deutz the dusky sky was reddened the hills were veiled in the mist and the gray the gray river flowed underneath us the steamers were roosting along the quays a light keeping watch in the cabins here and there and its reflections quivering in the water as i look the skyline towards the east grows redder and redder a long troop of gray horsemen winds down the river road and passes over the bridge of boats you might take them for ghosts those gray horsemen so shadowy do they look but you hear the trample of their hoofs as they pass over the planks every minute the dawn twinkles up into the twilight and over deutz the heaven blushes brighter the quays begin to fill with men the carts begin to creak and rattle and wake the sleeping echoes ding ding ding the steamers bells begin to ring the people on board to stir and wake the lights may be extinguished and take their turn of sleep the active boats shake themselves and push out into the river the great bridge opens and gives them passage the church bells of the city begin to clink the cavalry trumpets blow from the opposite bank the sailor is at the wheel the porter at his burden the soldier at his musket and the priest at his prayers     and lo in a flash of crimson splendor with blazing scarlet clouds running before his chariot and heralding his majestic approach gods sun rises upon the world and all nature wakens and brightens  o glorious spectacle of light and life o beatific symbol of power love joy beauty let us look at thee with humble wonder and thankfully acknowledge and adore what gracious forethought is itwhat generous and loving provision that deigns to prepare for our eyes and to soothe our hearts with such a splendid morning festival for these magnificent bounties of heaven to us let us be thankful even that we can feel thankfulfor thanks surely is the noblest effort as it is the greatest delight of the gentle souland so a grace for this feast let all say who partake of it  see the mist clears off drachenfels and it looks out from the distance and bids us a friendly farewell farewell to holiday and sunshine farewell to kindly sport and pleasant leisure let us say goodby to the rhine friend fogs and cares and labor are awaiting us by the thames and a kind face or two looking out for us to cheer and bid us welcome     the rose and the ring  a fireside pantomime for great and small children   by mr m a titmarsh    prelude   it happened that the undersigned spent the last christmas season in a foreign city where there were many english children  in that city if you wanted to give a childs party you could not even get a magiclantern or buy twelfthnight charactersthose funny painted pictures of the king the queen the lover the lady the dandy the captain and so onwith which our young ones are wont to recreate themselves at this festive time  my friend miss bunch who was governess of a large family that lived in the piano nobile of the house inhabited by myself and my young charges it was the palazzo poniatowski at rome and messrs spillmann two of the best pastrycooks in christendom have their shop on the ground floor miss bunch i say begged me to draw a set of twelfthnight characters for the amusement of our young people  she is a lady of great fancy and droll imagination and having looked at the characters she and i composed a history about them which was recited to the little folks at night and served as our fireside pantomime  our juvenile audience was amused by the adventures of giglio and bulbo rosalba and angelica i am bound to say the fate of the hall porter created a considerable sensation and the wrath of countess gruffanuff was received with extreme pleasure  if these children are pleased thought i why should not others be amused also in a few days dr birchs young friends will be expected to reassemble at rodwell regis where they will learn everything that is useful and under the eyes of careful ushers continue the business of their little lives  but in the meanwhile and for a brief holiday let us laugh and be as pleasant as we can and you elder folka little joking and dancing and fooling will do even you no harm the author wishes you a merry christmas and welcomes you to the fireside pantomime  m a titmarsh  december 1854    the rose and the ring   i shows how the royal family sat down to breakfast   this is valoroso xxiv king of paflagonia seated with his queen and only child at their royal breakfasttable and receiving the letter which announces to his majesty a proposed visit from prince bulbo heir of padella reigning king of crim tartary remark the delight upon the monarchs royal features he is so absorbed in the perusal of the king of crim tartarys letter that he allows his eggs to get cold and leaves his august muffins untasted  what that wicked brave delightful prince bulbo cries princess angelica so handsome so accomplished so wittythe conqueror of rimbombamento where he slew ten thousand giants  who told you of him my dear asks his majesty  a little bird says angelica  poor giglio says mamma pouring out the tea  bother giglio cries angelica tossing up her head which rustled with a thousand curlpapers  i wish growls the kingi wish giglio was    was better yes dear he is better says the queen angelicas little maid betsinda told me so when she came to my room this morning with my early tea  you are always drinking tea said the monarch with a scowl  it is better than drinking port or brandyandwater replies her majesty  well well my dear i only said you were fond of drinking tea said the king of paflagonia with an effort as if to command his temper angelica i hope you have plenty of new dresses your milliners bills are long enough my dear queen you must see and have some parties i prefer dinners but of course you will be for balls your everlasting blue velvet quite tires me and my love i should like you to have a new necklace order one not more than a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand pounds  and giglio dear says the queen  giglio may go to the   oh sir screams her majesty your own nephew our late kings only son  giglio may go to the tailors and order the bills to be sent in to glumboso to pay confound him i mean bless his dear heart he need want for nothing give him a couple of guineas for pocketmoney my dear and you may as well order yourself bracelets while you are about the necklace mrs v  her majesty or mrs v as the monarch facetiously called her for even royalty will have its sport and this august family were very much attached embraced her husband and twining her arm round her daughters waist they quitted the breakfastroom in order to make all things ready for the princely stranger  when they were gone the smile that had lighted up the eyes of the husband and father fledthe pride of the king fledthe man was alone had i the pen of a g p r james i would describe valorosos torments in the choicest language in which i would also depict his flashing eye his distended nostrilhis dressinggown pockethandkerchief and boots but i need not say i have not the pen of that novelist suffice it to say valoroso was alone  he rushed to the cupboard seizing from the table one of the many eggcups with which his princely board was served for the matin meal drew out a bottle of right nantz or cognac filled and emptied the cup several times and laid it down with a hoarse ha ha ha now valoroso is a man again  but oh he went on still sipping i am sorry to say ere i was a king i needed not this intoxicating draught once i detested the hot brandy wine and quaffed no other fount but natures rill it dashes not more quickly oer the rocks than i did as with blunderbuss in hand i brushed away the early morning dew and shot the partridge snipe or antlered deer ah well may englands dramatist remark uneasy lies the head that wears a crown why did i steal my nephews my young giglios steal said i no no no not steal not steal let me withdraw that odious expression i took and on my manly head i set the royal crown of paflagonia i took and with my royal arm i wield the sceptral rod of paflagonia i took and in my outstretched hand i hold the royal orb of paflagonia could a poor boy a snivelling drivelling boywas in his nurses arms but yesterday and cried for sugarplums and puled for papbear up the awful weight of crown orb sceptre gird on the sword my royal fathers wore and meet in fight the tough crimean foe  and then the monarch went on to argue in his own mind though we need not say that blank verse is not argument that what he had got it was his duty to keep and that if at one time he had entertained ideas of a certain restitution which shall be nameless the prospect by a certain marriage of uniting two crowns and two nations which had been engaged in bloody and expensive wars as the paflagonians and the crimeans had been put the idea of giglios restoration to the throne out of the question nay were his own brother king savio alive he would certainly will the crown from his own son in order to bring about such a desirable union  thus easily do we deceive ourselves thus do we fancy what we wish is right the king took courage read the papers finished his muffins and eggs and rang the bell for his prime minister the queen after thinking whether she should go up and see giglio who had been sick thought not now business first pleasure afterwards i will go and see dear giglio this afternoon and now i will drive to the jewellers to look for the necklace and bracelets the princess went up into her own room and made betsinda her maid bring out all her dresses and as for giglio they forgot him as much as i forget what i had for dinner last tuesday twelvemonth   ii how king valoroso got the crown and prince giglio went without   paflagonia ten or twenty thousand years ago appears to have been one of those kingdoms where the laws of succession were not settled for when king savio died leaving his brother regent of the kingdom and guardian of savios orphan infant this unfaithful regent took no sort of regard of the late monarchs will had himself proclaimed sovereign of paflagonia under the title of king valoroso xxiv had a most splendid coronation and ordered all the nobles of the kingdom to pay him homage so long as valoroso gave them plenty of balls at court plenty of money and lucrative places the paflagonian nobility did not care who was king and as for the people in those early times they were equally indifferent the prince giglio by reason of his tender age at his royal fathers death did not feel the loss of his crown and empire as long as he had plenty of toys and sweetmeats a holiday five times a week and a horse and gun to go out shooting when he grew a little older and above all the company of his darling cousin the kings only child poor giglio was perfectly contented nor did he envy his uncle the royal robes and sceptre the great hot uncomfortable throne of state and the enormous cumbersome crown in which that monarch appeared from morning till night king valorosos portrait has been left to us and i think you will agree with me that he must have been sometimes rather tired of his velvet and his diamonds and his ermine and his grandeur i shouldnt like to sit in that stifling robe with such a thing as that on my head  no doubt the queen must have been lovely in her youth for though she grew rather stout in after life yet her features as shown in her portrait are certainly pleasing if she was fond of flattery scandal cards and fine clothes let us deal gently with her infirmities which after all may be no greater than our own she was kind to her nephew and if she had any scruples of conscience about her husbands taking the young princes crown consoled herself by thinking that the king though a usurper was a most respectable man and that at his death prince giglio would be restored to his throne and share it with his cousin whom he loved so fondly  the prime minister was glumboso an old statesman who most cheerfully swore fidelity to king valoroso and in whose hands the monarch left all the affairs of his kingdom all valoroso wanted was plenty of money plenty of hunting plenty of flattery and as little trouble as possible as long as he had his sport this monarch cared little how his people paid for it he engaged in some wars and of course the paflagonian newspapers announced that he had gained prodigious victories he had statues erected to himself in every city of the empire and of course his pictures placed everywhere and in all the printshops he was valoroso the magnanimous valoroso the victorious valoroso the great and so forthfor even in these early times courtiers and people knew how to flatter  this royal pair had one only child the princess angelica who you may be sure was a paragon in the courtiers eyes in her parents and in her own it was said she had the longest hair the largest eyes the slimmest waist the smallest foot and the most lovely complexion of any young lady in the paflagonian dominions her accomplishments were announced to be even superior to her beauty and governesses used to shame their idle pupils by telling them what princess angelica could do she could play the most difficult pieces of music at sight she could answer any one of mangnalls questions she knew every date in the history of paflagonia and every other country she knew french english italian german spanish hebrew greek latin cappadocian samothracian aegean and crim tartar in a word she was a most accomplished young creature and her governess and ladyinwaiting was the severe countess gruffanuff  would you not fancy from this picture that gruffanuff must have been a person of highest birth she looks so haughty that i should have thought her a princess at the very least with a pedigree reaching as far back as the deluge but this lady was no better born than many other ladies who give themselves airs and all sensible people laughed at her absurd pretensions the fact is she had been maidservant to the queen when her majesty was only princess and her husband had been head footman but after his death or disappearance of which you shall hear presently this mrs gruffanuff by flattering toadying and wheedling her royal mistress became a favorite with the queen who was rather a weak woman and her majesty gave her a title and made her nursery governess to the princess  and now i must tell you about the princesss learning and accomplishments for which she had such a wonderful character clever angelica certainly was but as idle as possible play at sight indeed she could play one or two pieces and pretend that she had never seen them before she could answer half a dozen mangnalls questions but then you must take care to ask the right ones as for her languages she had masters in plenty but i doubt whether she knew more than a few phrases in each for all her presence and as for her embroidery and her drawing she showed beautiful specimens it is true but who did them  this obliges me to tell the truth and to do so i must go back ever so far and tell you about the fairy blackstick   iii tells who the fairy blackstick was and who were ever so many grand personages besides   between the kingdoms of paflagonia and crim tartary there lived a mysterious personage who was known in those countries as the fairy blackstick from the ebony wand or crutch which she carried on which she rode to the moon sometimes or upon other excursions of business or pleasure and with which she performed her wonders when she was young and had been first taught the art of conjuring by the necromancer her father she was always practicing her skill whizzing about from one kingdom to another upon her black stick and conferring her fairy favors upon this prince or that she had scores of royal godchildren turned numberless wicked people into beasts birds millstones clocks pumps boot jacks umbrellas or other absurd shapes and in a word was one of the most active and officious of the whole college of fairies  but after two or three thousand years of this sport i suppose blackstick grew tired of it or perhaps she thought what good am i doing by sending this princess to sleep for a hundred years by fixing a black pudding on to that boobys nose by causing diamonds and pearls to drop from one little girls mouth and vipers and toads from anothers i begin to think i do as much harm as good by my performances i might as well shut my incantations up and allow things to take their natural course  there were my two young goddaughters king savios wife and duke padellas wife i gave them each a present which was to render them charming in the eyes of their husbands and secure the affection of those gentlemen as long as they lived what good did my rose and my ring do these two women none on earth from having all their whims indulged by their husbands they became capricious lazy illhumored absurdly vain and leered and languished and fancied themselves irresistibly beautiful when they were really quite old and hideous the ridiculous creatures they used actually to patronise me when i went to pay them a visitme the fairy blackstick who knows all the wisdom of the necromancers and could have turned them into baboons and all their diamonds into strings of onions by a single wave of my rod so she locked up her books in her cupboard declined further magical performances and scarcely used her wand at all except as a cane to walk about with  so when duke padellas lady had a little son the duke was at that time only one of the principal noblemen in crim tartary blackstick although invited to the christening would not so much as attend but merely sent her compliments and a silver papboat for the baby which was really not worth a couple of guineas about the same time the queen of paflagonia presented his majesty with a son and heir and guns were fired the capital illuminated and no end of feasts ordained to celebrate the young princes birth it was thought the fairy who was asked to be his godmother would at least have presented him with an invisible jacket a flying horse a fortunatuss purse or some other valuable token of her favor but instead blackstick went up to the cradle of the child giglio when everybody was admiring him and complimenting his royal papa and mamma and said my poor child the best thing i can send you is a little misfortune and this was all she would utter to the disgust of giglios parents who died very soon after when giglios uncle took the throne as we read in chapter i  in like manner when cavolfiore king of crim tartary had a christening of his only child rosalba the fairy blackstick who had been invited was not more gracious than in prince giglios case whilst everybody was expatiating over the beauty of the darling child and congratulating its parents the fairy blackstick looked very sadly at the baby and its mother and said my good woman for the fairy was very familiar and no more minded a queen than a washerwomanmy good woman these people who are following you will be the first to turn against you and as for this little lady the best thing i can wish her is a little misfortune so she touched rosalba with her black wand looked severely at the courtiers motioned the queen an adieu with her hand and sailed slowly up into the air out of the window  when she was gone the court people who had been awed and silent in her presence began to speak what an odious fairy she is they saida pretty fairy indeed why she went to the king of paflagonias christening and pretended to do all sorts of things for that family and what has happenedthe prince her godson has been turned off his throne by his uncle would we allow our sweet princess to be deprived of her rights by any enemy never never never never  and they all shouted in a chorus never never never never  now i should like to know and how did these fine courtiers show their fidelity one of king cavolfiores vassals the duke padella just mentioned rebelled against the king who went out to chastise his rebellious subject any one rebel against our beloved and august monarch cried the courtiers any one resist him pooh he is invincible irresistible he will bring home padella a prisoner and tie him to a donkeys tail and drive him round the town saying this is the way the great cavolfiore treats rebels  the king went forth to vanquish padella and the poor queen who was a very timid anxious creature grew so frightened and ill that i am sorry to say she died leaving injunctions with her ladies to take care of the dear little rosalba of course they said they would of course they vowed they would die rather than any harm should happen to the princess at first the crim tartar court journal stated that the king was obtaining great victories over the audacious rebel then it was announced that the troops of the infamous padella were in flight then it was said that the royal army would soon come up with the enemy and thenthen the news came that king cavolfiore was vanquished and slain by his majesty king padella the first  at this news half the courtiers ran off to pay their duty to the conquering chief and the other half ran away laying hands on all the best articles in the palace and poor little rosalba was left there quite alonequite alone she toddled from one room to another crying countess duchess only she said tountess duttess not being able to speak plain bring me my muttonsop my royal highness hungy tountess duttess and she went from the private apartments into the throneroom and nobody was thereand thence into the ballroom and nobody was thereand thence into the pages room and nobody was thereand she toddled down the great staircase into the hall and nobody was thereand the door was open and she went into the court and into the garden and thence into the wilderness and thence into the forest where the wild beasts live and was never heard of any more  a piece of her torn mantle and one of her shoes were found in the wood in the mouths of two lionesses cubs whom king padella and a royal hunting party shotfor he was king now and reigned over crim tartary so the poor little princess is done for said he well whats done cant be helped gentlemen let us go to luncheon and one of the courtiers took up the shoe and put it in his pocket and there was an end of rosalba   iv how blackstick was not asked to the princess angelicas christening   when the princess angelica was born her parents not only did not ask the fairy blackstick to the christening party but gave orders to their porter absolutely to refuse her if she called this porters name was gruffanuff and he had been selected for the post by their royal highnesses because he was a very tall fierce man who could say not at home to a tradesman or an unwelcome visitor with a rudeness which frightened most such persons away he was the husband of that countess whose picture we have just seen and as long as they were together they quarrelled from morning till night now this fellow tried his rudeness once too often as you shall hear for the fairy blackstick coming to call upon the prince and princess who were actually sitting at the open drawingroom window gruffanuff not only denied them but made the most odious vulgar sign as he was going to slam the door in the fairys face git away hold blackstick said he i tell you master and missis aint at home to you and he was as we have said going to slam the door  but the fairy with her wand prevented the door being shut and gruffanuff came out again in a fury swearing in the most abominable way and asking the fairy whether she thought he was agoing to stay at that there door hall day  you are going to stay at that door all day and all night and for many a long year the fairy said very majestically and gruffanuff coming out of the door straddling before it with his great calves burst out laughing and cried ha ha ha this is a good un haahwhats this let me downohohm and then he was dumb  for as the fairy waved her wand over him he felt himself rising off the ground and fluttering up against the door and then as if a screw ran into his stomach he felt a dreadful pain there and was pinned to the door and then his arms flew up over his head and his legs after writhing about wildly twisted under his body and he felt cold cold growing over him as if he was turning into metal and he said ohohm and could say no more because he was dumb  he was turned into metal he was from being brazen brass he was neither more nor less than a knocker and there he was nailed to the door in the blazing summer day till he burned almost redhot and there he was nailed to the door all the bitter winter nights till his brass nose was dropping with icicles and the postman came and rapped at him and the vulgarest boy with a letter came and hit him up against the door and the king and queen princess and prince they were then coming home from a walk that evening the king said hullo my dear you have had a new knocker put on the door why its rather like our porter in the face what has become of that boozy vagabond and the housemaid came and scrubbed his nose with sandpaper and once when the princess angelicas little sister was born he was tied up in an old kidglove and another night some larking young men tried to wrench him off and put him to the most excruciating agony with a turn screw and then the queen had a fancy to have the color of the door altered and the painters dabbed him over the mouth and eyes and nearly choked him as they painted him peagreen i warrant he had leisure to repent of having been rude to the fairy blackstick   as for his wife she did not miss him and as he was always guzzling beer at the publichouse and notoriously quarrelling with his wife and in debt to the tradesmen it was supposed he had run away from all these evils and emigrated to australia or america and when the prince and princess chose to become king and queen they left their old house and nobody thought of the porter any more   v how princess angelica took a little maid   one day when the princess angelica was quite a little girl she was walking in the garden of the palace with mrs gruffanuff the governess holding a parasol over her head to keep her sweet complexion from the freckles and angelica was carrying a bun to feed the swans and ducks in the royal pond  they had not reached the duckpond when there came toddling up to them such a funny little girl she had a great quantity of hair blowing about her chubby little cheeks and looked as if she had not been washed or combed for ever so long she wore a ragged bit of a cloak and had only one shoe on  you little wretch who let you in here asked mrs gruffanuff  div me dat bun said the little girl me vely hungy  hungry what is that asked princess angelica and gave the child the bun  oh princess says mrs gruffanuff how good how kind how truly angelical you are see your majesties she said to the king and queen who now came up along with their nephew prince giglio how kind the princess is she met this little dirty wretch in the gardeni cant tell how she came in here or why the guards did not shoot her dead at the gateand the dear darling of a princess has given her the whole of her bun  i didnt want it said angelica  but you are a darling little angel all the same says the governess  yes i know i am said angelica dirty little girl dont you think i am very pretty indeed she had on the finest of little dresses and hats and as her hair was carefully curled she really looked very well  oh pooty pooty says the little girl capering about laughing and dancing and munching her bun and as she ate it she began to sing o what fun to have a plum bun how i wis it never was done at which and her funny accent angelica giglio and the king and queen began to laugh very merrily  i can dance as well as sing says the little girl i can dance and i can sing and i can do all sorts of ting and she ran to a flowerbed and pulling a few polyanthuses rhododendrons and other flowers made herself a little wreath and danced before the king and queen so drolly and prettily that everybody was delighted  who was your motherwho were your relations little girl said the queen  the little girl said little lion was my brudder great big lioness my mudder neber heard of any udder and she capered away on her one shoe and everybody was exceedingly diverted  so angelica said to the queen mamma my parrot flew away yesterday out of its cage and i dont care any more for any of my toys and i think this funny little dirty child will amuse me i will take her home and give her some of my old frocks  oh the generous darling says mrs gruffanuff  which i have worn ever so many times and am quite tired of angelica went on and she shall be my little maid will you come home with me little dirty girl  the child clapped her hands and said go home with youyes you pooty princess have a nice dinner and wear a new dress  and they all laughed again and took home the child to the palace where when she was washed and combed and had one of the princesss frocks given to her she looked as handsome as angelica almost not that angelica ever thought so for this little lady never imagined that anybody in the world could be as pretty as good or as clever as herself in order that the little girl should not become too proud and conceited mrs gruffanuff took her old ragged mantle and one shoe and put them into a glass box with a card laid upon them upon which was written these were the old clothes in which little betsinda was found when the great goodness and admirable kindness of her royal highness the princess angelica received this little outcast and the date was added and the box locked up  for a while little betsinda was a great favorite with the princess and she danced and sang and made her little rhymes to amuse her mistress but then the princess got a monkey and afterwards a little dog and afterwards a doll and did not care for betsinda any more who became very melancholy and quiet and sang no more funny songs because nobody cared to hear her and then as she grew older she was made a little ladysmaid to the princess and though she had no wages she worked and mended and put angelicas hair in papers and was never cross when scolded and was always eager to please her mistress and was always up early and to bed late and at hand when wanted and in fact became a perfect little maid so the two girls grew up and when the princess came out betsinda was never tired of waiting on her and made her dresses better than the best milliner and was useful in a hundred ways whilst the princess was having her masters betsinda would sit and watch them and in this way she picked up a great deal of learning for she was always awake though her mistress was not and listened to the wise professors when angelica was yawning or thinking of the next ball and when the dancingmaster came betsinda learned along with angelica and when the musicmaster came she watched him and practiced the princesss pieces when angelica was away at balls and parties and when the drawingmaster came she took note of all he said and did and the same with french italian and all other languagesshe learned them from the teacher who came to angelica when the princess was going out of an evening she would say my good betsinda you may as well finish what i have begun yes miss betsinda would say and sit down very cheerful not to finish what angelica began but to do it  for instance the princess would begin a head of a warrior let us say and when it was begun it was something like this  but when it was done the warrior was like thisonly handsomer still if possible and the princess put her name to the drawing and the court and king and queen and above all poor giglio admired the picture of all things and said was there ever a genius like angelica so i am sorry to say was it with the princesss embroidery and other accomplishments and angelica actually believed that she did these things herself and received all the flattery of the court as if every word of it was true thus she began to think that there was no young woman in all the world equal to herself and that no young man was good enough for her as for betsinda as she heard none of these praises she was not puffed up by them and being a most grateful goodnatured girl she was only too anxious to do everything which might give her mistress pleasure now you begin to perceive that angelica had faults of her own and was by no means such a wonder of wonders as people represented her royal highness to be   vi how prince giglio behaved himself   and now let us speak about prince giglio the nephew of the reigning monarch of paflagonia it has already been stated in page seven that as long as he had a smart coat to wear a good horse to ride and money in his pocket or rather to take out of his pocket for he was very goodnatured my young prince did not care for the loss of his crown and sceptre being a thoughtless youth not much inclined to politics or any kind of learning so his tutor had a sinecure giglio would not learn classics or mathematics and the lord chancellor of paflagonia squaretoso pulled a very long face because the prince could not be got to study the paflagonian laws and constitution but on the other hand the kings gamekeepers and huntsmen found the prince an apt pupil the dancingmaster pronounced that he was a most elegant and assiduous scholar the first lord of the billiard table gave the most flattering reports of the princes skill so did the groom of the tennis court and as for the captain of the guard and fencingmaster the valiant and veteran count kutasoff hedzoff he avowed that since he ran the general of crim tartary the dreadful grumbuskin through the body he never had encountered so expert a swordsman as prince giglio  i hope you do not imagine that there was any impropriety in the prince and princess walking together in the palace garden and because giglio kissed angelicas hand in a polite manner in the first place they are cousins next the queen is walking in the garden too you cannot see her for she happens to be behind that tree and her majesty always wished that angelica and giglio should marry so did giglio so did angelica sometimes for she thought her cousin very handsome brave and goodnatured but then you know she was so clever and knew so many things and poor giglio knew nothing and had no conversation when they looked at the stars what did giglio know of the heavenly bodies once when on a sweet night in a balcony where they were standing angelica said there is the bear where says giglio dont be afraid angelica if a dozen bears come i will kill them rather than they shall hurt you oh you silly creature says she you are very good but you are not very wise when they looked at the flowers giglio was utterly unacquainted with botany and had never heard of linnaeus when the butterflies passed giglio knew nothing about them being as ignorant of entomology as i am of algebra so you see angelica though she liked giglio pretty well despised him on account of his ignorance i think she probably valued her own learning rather too much but to think too well of ones self is the fault of people of all ages and both sexes finally when nobody else was there angelica liked her cousin well enough  king valoroso was very delicate in health and withal so fond of good dinners which were prepared for him by his french cook marmitonio that it was supposed he could not live long now the idea of anything happening to the king struck the artful prime minister and the designing old ladyinwaiting with terror for thought glumboso and the countess when prince giglio marries his cousin and comes to the throne what a pretty position we shall be in whom he dislikes and who have always been unkind to him we shall lose our places in a trice mrs gruffanuff will have to give up all the jewels laces snuffboxes rings and watches which belonged to the queen giglios mother and glumboso will be forced to refund two hundred and seventeen thousand millions nine hundred and eightyseven thousand four hundred and thirtynine pounds thirteen shillings and sixpence halfpenny money left to prince giglio by his poor dear father  so the lady of honor and the prime minister hated giglio because they had done him a wrong and these unprincipled people invented a hundred cruel stories about poor giglio in order to influence the king queen and princess against him how he was so ignorant that he could not spell the commonest words and actually wrote valoroso valloroso and spelt angelica with two ls how he drank a great deal too much wine at dinner and was always idling in the stables with the grooms how he owed ever so much money at the pastrycooks and the haberdashers how he used to go to sleep at church how he was fond of playing cards with the pages so did the queen like playing cards so did the king go to sleep at church and eat and drink too much and if giglio owed a trifle for tarts who owed him two hundred and seventeen thousand millions nine hundred and eightyseven thousand four hundred and thirtynine pounds thirteen shillings and sixpence halfpenny i should like to know detractors and talebearers in my humble opinion had much better look at home all this backbiting and slandering had effect upon princess angelica who began to look coldly on her cousin then to laugh at him and scorn him for being so stupid then to sneer at him for having vulgar associates and at court balls dinners and so forth to treat him so unkindly that poor giglio became quite ill took to his bed and sent for the doctor  his majesty king valoroso as we have seen had his own reasons for disliking his nephew and as for those innocent readers who ask whyi beg with the permission of their dear parents to refer them to shakespeares pages where they will read why king john disliked prince arthur with the queen his royal but weakminded aunt when giglio was out of sight he was out of mind while she had her whist and her evening parties she cared for little else  i dare say two villains who shall be nameless wished doctor pildrafto the court physician had killed giglio right out but he only bled and physicked him so severely that the prince was kept to his room for several months and grew as thin as a post  whilst he was lying sick in this way there came to the court of paflagonia a famous painter whose name was tomaso lorenzo and who was painter in ordinary to the king of crim tartary paflagonias neighbor tomaso lorenzo painted all the court who were delighted with his works for even countess gruffanuff looked young and glumboso goodhumored in his pictures he flatters very much some people said nay says princess angelica i am above flattery and i think he did not make my picture handsome enough i cant bear to hear a man of genius unjustly cried down and i hope my dear papa will make lorenzo a knight of his order of the cucumber  the princess angelica although the courtiers vowed her royal highness could draw so beautifully that the idea of her taking lessons was absurd yet chose to have lorenzo for a teacher and it was wonderful as long as she painted in his studio what beautiful pictures she made some of the performances were engraved for the book of beauty others were sold for enormous sums at charity bazaars she wrote the signatures under the drawings no doubt but i think i know who did the picturesthis artful painter who had come with other designs on angelica than merely to teach her to draw  one day lorenzo showed the princess a portrait of a young man in armor with fair hair and the loveliest blue eyes and an expression at once melancholy and interesting  dear signor lorenzo who is this asked the princess i never saw anyone so handsome says countess gruffanuff the old humbug  that said the painter that madam is the portrait of my august young master his royal highness bulbo crown prince of crim tartary duke of acroceraunia marquis of poluphloisboio and knight grand cross of the order of the pumpkin that is the order of the pumpkin glittering on his manly breast and received by his royal highness from his august father his majesty king padella i for his gallantry at the battle of rimbombamento when he slew with his own princely hand the king of ograria and two hundred and eleven giants of the two hundred and eighteen who formed the kings bodyguard the remainder were destroyed by the brave crim tartar army after an obstinate combat in which the crim tartars suffered severely  what a prince thought angelica so braveso calmlookingso youngwhat a hero  he is as accomplished as he is brave continued the court painter he knows all languages perfectly sings deliciously plays every instrument composes operas which have been acted a thousand nights running at the imperial theatre of crim tartary and danced in a ballet there before the king and queen in which he looked so beautiful that his cousin the lovely daughter of the king of circassia died for love of him  why did he not marry the poor princess asked angelica with a sigh  because they were first cousins madam and the clergy forbid these unions said the painter and besides the young prince had given his royal heart elsewhere  and to whom asked her royal highness  i am not at liberty to mention the princesss name answered the painter  but you may tell me the first letter of it gasped out the princess  that your royal highness is at liberty to guess said lorenzo  does it begin with a z asked angelica  the painter said it wasnt a z then she tried a y then an x then a w and went so backwards through almost the whole alphabet  when she came to d and it wasnt d she grew very excited when she came to c and it wasnt c she was still more nervous when she came to b and it wasnt b oh dearest gruffanuff she said lend me your smellingbottle and hiding her head in the countesss shoulder she faintly whispered ah signor can it be a  it was a and though i may not by my royal masters orders tell your royal highness the princesss name whom he fondly madly devotedly rapturously loves i may show you her portrait says this slyboots and leading the princess up to a gilt frame he drew a curtain which was before it  o goodness the frame contained a lookingglass and angelica saw her own face   vii how giglio and angelica had a quarrel   the court painter of his majesty the king of crim tartary returned to that monarchs dominions carrying away a number of sketches which he had made in the paflagonian capital you know of course my dears that the name of that capital is blombodinga but the most charming of all his pieces was a portrait of the princess angelica which all the crim tartar nobles came to see with this work the king was so delighted that he decorated the painter with his order of the pumpkin sixth class and the artist became sir tomaso lorenzo kp thenceforth  king valoroso also sent sir tomaso his order of the cucumber besides a handsome order for money for he painted the king queen and principal nobility while at blombodinga and became all the fashion to the perfect rage of all the artists in paflagonia where the king used to point to the portrait of prince bulbo which sir tomaso had left behind him and say which among you can paint a picture like that  it hung in the royal parlor over the royal sideboard and princess angelica could always look at it as she sat making the tea each day it seemed to grow handsomer and handsomer and the princess grew so fond of looking at it that she would often spill the tea over the cloth at which her father and mother would wink and wag their heads and say to each other aha we see how things are going  in the meantime poor giglio lay upstairs very sick in his chamber though he took all the doctors horrible medicines like a good young lad as i hope you do my dears when you are ill and mamma sends for the medical man and the only person who visited giglio besides his friend the captain of the guard who was almost always busy or on parade was little betsinda the housemaid who used to do his bedroom and sittingroom out bring him his gruel and warm his bed  when the little housemaid came to him in the morning and evening prince giglio used to say betsinda betsinda how is the princess angelica  and betsinda used to answer the princess is very well thank you my lord and giglio would heave a sigh and think if angelica were sick i am sure i should not be very well  then giglio would say betsinda has the princess angelica asked for me today and betsinda would answer no my lord not today or she was very busy practicing the piano when i saw her or she was writing invitations for an evening party and did not speak to me or make some excuse or other not strictly consonant with truth for betsinda was such a goodnatured creature that she strove to do everything to prevent annoyance to prince giglio and even brought him up roast chicken and jellies from the kitchen when the doctor allowed them and giglio was getting better saying that the princess had made the jelly or the breadsauce with her own hands on purpose for giglio  when giglio heard this he took heart and began to mend immediately and gobbled up all the jelly and picked the last bone of the chickendrumsticks merrythought sidesbones back popes nose and allthanking his dear angelica and he felt so much better the next day that he dressed and went downstairswhere whom should he meet but angelica going into the drawingroom all the covers were off the chairs the chandeliers taken out of the bags the damask curtains uncovered the work and things carried away and the handsomest albums on the tables angelica had her hair in papers in a word it was evident there was going to be a party  heavens giglio cries angelica you here in such a dress what a figure you are  yes dear angelica i am come downstairs and feel so well today thanks to the fowl and the jelly  what do i know about fowls and jellies that you allude to them in that rude way says angelica  why didntdidnt you send them angelica dear says giglio  i send them indeed angelica dear no giglio dear says she mocking him i was engaged in getting the rooms ready for his royal highness the prince of crim tartary who is coming to pay my papas court a visit  theprinceofcrimtartary giglio said aghast  yes the prince of crim tartary says angelica mocking him i dare say you never heard of such a country what did you ever hear of you dont know whether crim tartary is on the red sea or on the black sea i dare say  yes i do its on the red sea says giglio at which the princess burst out laughing at him and said oh you ninny you are so ignorant you are really not fit for society you know nothing but about horses and dogs and are only fit to dine in a messroom with my royal fathers heaviest dragoons dont look so surprised at me sir go and put your best clothes on to receive the prince and let me get the drawingroom ready  giglio said oh angelica angelica i didnt think this of you this wasnt your language to me when you gave me this ring and i gave you mine in the garden and you gave me that k  but what k was we never shall know for angelica in a rage cried get out you saucy rude creature how dare you to remind me of your rudeness as for your little trumpery twopenny ring there sirthere and she flung it out of the window  it was my mothers marriagering cried giglio  i dont care whose marriagering it was cries angelica marry the person who picks it up if shes a woman you shant marry me and give me back my ring ive no patience with people who boast about the things they give away i know wholl give me much finer things than you ever gave me a beggarly ring indeed not worth five shillings  now angelica little knew that the ring which giglio had given her was a fairy ring if a man wore it it made all the women in love with him if a woman all the gentlemen the queen giglios mother quite an ordinarylooking person was admired immensely whilst she wore this ring and her husband was frantic when she was ill but when she called her little giglio to her and put the ring on his finger king savio did not seem to care for his wife so much any more but transferred all his love to little giglio so did everybody love him as long as he had the ring but when as quite a child he gave it to angelica people began to love and admire her and giglio as the saying is played only second fiddle  yes says angelica going on in her foolish ungrateful way i know wholl give me much finer things than your beggarly little pearl nonsense  very good miss you may take back your ring too says giglio his eyes flashing fire at her and then as his eyes had been suddenly opened he cried out ha what does this mean is this the woman i have been in love with all my life have i been such a ninny as to throw away my regard upon you whyactuallyyesyou are a little crooked  oh you wretch cries angelica  and upon my conscience youyou squint a little  eh cries angelica  and your hair is redand you are marked with the smallpoxand what you have three false teethand one leg shorter than the other  you brute you brute you angelica screamed out and as she seized the ring with one hand she dealt giglio one two three smacks on the face and would have pulled the hair off his head had he not started laughing and crying  oh dear me angelica dont pull out my hair it hurts you might remove a great deal of your own as i perceive without scissors or pulling at all oh ho ho ha ha ha he he he  and he nearly choked himself with laughing and she with rage when with a low bow and dressed in his court habit count gambabella the first lordinwaiting entered and said royal highnesses their majesties expect you in the pink throneroom where they await the arrival of the prince of crim tartary   viii how gruffanuff picked the fairy ring up and prince bulbo came to court   prince bulbos arrival had set all the court in a flutter everybody was ordered to put his or her best clothes on the footmen had their gala liveries the lord chancellor his new wig the guards their last new tunics and countess gruffanuff you may be sure was glad of an opportunity of decorating her old person with her finest things she was walking through the court of the palace on her way to wait upon their majesties when she espied something glittering on the pavement and bade the boy in buttons who was holding up her train to go and pick up the article shining yonder he was an ugly little wretch in some of the late groomporters old clothes cut down and much too tight for him and yet when he had taken up the ring as it turned out to be and was carrying it to his mistress she thought he looked like a little cupid he gave the ring to her it was a trumpery little thing enough but too small for any of her old knuckles so she put it into her pocket  oh mum says the boy looking at her howhow beyoutiful you do look mum today mum  and you too jacky she was going to say but looking down at himno he was no longer goodlooking at allbut only the carrotyhaired little jacky of the morning however praise is welcome from the ugliest of men or boys and gruffanuff bidding the boy hold up her train walked on in high goodhumor the guards saluted her with peculiar respect captain hedzoff in the anteroom said my dear madam you look like an angel today and so bowing and smirking gruffanuff went in and took her place behind her royal master and mistress who were in the throneroom awaiting the prince of crim tartary princess angelica sat at their feet and behind the kings chair stood prince giglio looking very savage  the prince of crim tartary made his appearance attended by baron sleibootz his chamberlain and followed by a black page carrying the most beautiful crown you ever saw he was dressed in his travelling costume and his hair as you see was a little in disorder i have ridden three hundred miles since breakfast said he so eager was i to behold the printhe court and august family of paflagonia and i could not wait one minute before appearing in your majesties presences  giglio from behind the throne burst out into a roar of contemptuous laughter but all the royal party in fact were so flurried that they did not hear this little outbreak your r h is welcome in any dress says the king glumboso a chair for his royal highness  any dress his royal highness wears is a courtdress says princess angelica smiling graciously  ah but you should see my other clothes said the prince i should have had them on but that stupid carrier has not brought them whos that laughing  it was giglio laughing i was laughing he said because you said just now that you were in such a hurry to see the princess that you could not wait to change your dress and now you say you come in those clothes because you have no others  and who are you says prince bulbo very fiercely  my father was king of this country and i am his only son prince replies giglio with equal haughtiness  ha said the king and glumboso looking very flurried but the former collecting himself said dear prince bulbo i forgot to introduce to your royal highness my dear nephew his royal highness prince giglio know each other embrace each other giglio give his royal highness your hand and giglio giving his hand squeezed poor bulbos until the tears ran out of his eyes glumboso now brought a chair for the royal visitor and placed it on the platform on which the king queen and prince were seated but the chair was on the edge of the platform and as bulbo sat down it toppled over and he with it rolling over and over and bellowing like a bull giglio roared still louder at this disaster but it was with laughter so did all the court when prince bulbo got up for though when he entered the room he appeared not very ridiculous as he stood up from his fall for a moment he looked so exceedingly plain and foolish that nobody could help laughing at him when he had entered the room he was observed to carry a rose in his hand which fell out of it as he tumbled  my rose my rose cried bulbo and his chamberlain dashed forwards and picked it up and gave it to the prince who put it in his waistcoat then people wondered why they had laughed there was nothing particularly ridiculous in him he was rather short rather stout rather redhaired but in fine for a prince not so bad  so they sat and talked the royal personages together the crim tartar officers with those of paflagoniagiglio very comfortable with gruffanuff behind the throne he looked at her with such tender eyes that her heart was all in a flutter oh dear prince she said how could you speak so haughtily in presence of their majesties i protest i thought i should have fainted  i should have caught you in my arms said giglio looking raptures  why were you so cruel to prince bulbo dear prince says gruff  because i hate him says gil  you are jealous of him and still love poor angelica cries gruffanuff putting her handkerchief to her eyes  i did but i love her no more giglio cried i despise her were she heiress to twenty thousand thrones i would despise her and scorn her but why speak of thrones i have lost mine i am too weak to recover iti am alone and have no friend  oh say not so dear prince says gruffanuff  besides says he i am so happy here behind the throne that i would not change my place no not for the throne of the world  what are you two people chattering about there says the queen who was rather goodnatured though not overburthened with wisdom it is time to dress for dinner giglio show prince bulbo to his room prince if your clothes have not come we shall be very happy to see you as you are but when prince bulbo got to his bedroom his luggage was there and unpacked and the hairdresser coming in cut and curled him entirely to his own satisfaction and when the dinnerbell rang the royal company had not to wait above fiveandtwenty minutes until bulbo appeared during which time the king who could not bear to wait grew as sulky as possible as for giglio he never left madam gruffanuff all this time but stood with her in the embrasure of a window paying her compliments at length the groom of the chambers announced his royal highness the prince of crim tartary and the noble company went into the royal diningroom it was quite a small party only the king and queen the princess whom bulbo took out the two princes countess gruffanuff glumboso the prime minister and prince bulbos chamberlain you may be sure they had a very good dinnerlet every boy or girl think of what he or she likes best and fancy it on the table    here a very pretty game may be played by all the children saying what they like best for dinner   the princess talked incessantly all dinnertime to the prince of crimea who ate an immense deal too much and never took his eyes off his plate except when giglio who was carving a goose sent a quantity of stuffing and onion sauce into one of them giglio only burst out alaughing as the crimean prince wiped his shirtfront and face with his scented pockethandkerchief he did not make prince bulbo any apology when the prince looked at him giglio would not look that way when prince bulbo said prince giglio may i have the honor of taking a glass of wine with you giglio wouldnt answer all his talk and his eyes were for countess gruffanuff who you may be sure was pleased with giglios attentionsthe vain old creature when he was not complimenting her he was making fun of prince bulbo so loud that gruffanuff was always tapping him with her fan and saying oh you satirical prince oh fie the prince will hear well i dont mind says giglio louder still the king and queen luckily did not hear for her majesty was a little deaf and the king thought so much about his own dinner and besides made such a dreadful noise hobgobbling in eating it that he heard nothing else after dinner his majesty and the queen went to sleep in their armchairs  this was the time when giglio began his tricks with prince bulbo plying that young gentleman with port sherry madeira champagne marsala cherrybrandy and pale ale of all of which master bulbo drank without stint but in plying his guest giglio was obliged to drink himself and i am sorry to say took more than was good for him so that the young men were very noisy rude and foolish when they joined the ladies after dinner and dearly did they pay for that imprudence as now my darlings you shall hear  bulbo went and sat by the piano where angelica was playing and singing and he sang out of tune and he upset the coffee when the footman brought it and he laughed out of place and talked absurdly and fell asleep and snored horridly booh the nasty pig but as he lay there stretched on the pink satin sofa angelica still persisted in thinking him the most beautiful of human beings no doubt the magic rose which bulbo wore caused this infatuation on angelicas part but is she the first young woman who has thought a silly fellow charming  giglio must go and sit by gruffanuff whose old face he too every moment began to find more lovely he paid the most outrageous compliments to herthere never was such a darling older than he wasfiddlededee he would marry herhe would have nothing but her  to marry the heir to the throne here was a chance the artful hussy actually got a sheet of paper and wrote upon it this is to give notice that i giglio only son of savio king of paflagonia hereby promise to marry the charming and virtuous barbara griselda countess gruffanuff and widow of the late jenkins gruffanuff esq  what is it you are writing you charming gruffy says giglio who was lolling on the sofa by the writingtable  only an order for you to sign dear prince for giving coals and blankets to the poor this cold weather look the king and queen are both asleep and your royal highnesss order will do  so giglio who was very goodnatured as gruffy well knew signed the order immediately and when she had it in her pocket you may fancy what airs she gave herself she was ready to flounce out of the room before the queen herself as now she was the wife of the rightful king of paflagonia she would not speak to glumboso whom she thought a brute for depriving her dear husband of the crown and when candles came and she had helped to undress the queen and princess she went into her own room and actually practiced on a sheet of paper griselda paflagonia barbara regina griselda barbara paf reg and i dont know what signatures besides against the day when she should be queen forsooth   ix how betsinda got the warming pan   little betsinda came in to put gruffanuffs hair in papers and the countess was so pleased that for a wonder she complimented betsinda betsinda she said you dressed my hair very nicely today i promised you a little present here are five shno here is a pretty little ring that i pickedthat i have had some time and she gave betsinda the ring she had picked up in the court it fitted betsinda exactly  its like the ring the princess used to wear says the maid  no such thing says gruffanuff i have had it this ever so long there tuck me up quite comfortable and now as its a very cold night the snow was beating in at the window you may go and warm dear prince giglios bed like a good girl and then you may unrip my green silk and then you can just do me up a little cap for the morning and then you can mend that hole in my silk stocking and then you can go to bed betsinda mind i shall want my cup of tea at five oclock in the morning  i suppose i had best warm both the young gentlemens beds maam says betsinda  gruffanuff for reply said hauauhograuhawhoohonghrho in fact she was snoring sound asleep  her room you know is next to the king and queen and the princess is next to them so pretty betsinda went away for the coals to the kitchen and filled the royal warmingpan  now she was a very kind merry civil pretty girl but there must have been something very captivating about her this evening for all the women in the servants hall began to scold and abuse her the housekeeper said she was a pert stuckup thing the upperhousemaid asked how dare she wear such ringlets and ribbons it was quite improper the cook for there was a womancook as well as a mancook said to the kitchenmaid that she never could see anything in that creetur but as for the men every one of them coachman john buttons the page and monsieur the prince of crim tartarys valet started up and said  my eyes   o mussey  what a pretty girl betsinda is  o jemmany   o ciel   hands off none of your impertinence you vulgar low people says betsinda walking off with her pan of coals she heard the young gentlemen playing at billiards as she went upstairs first to prince giglios bed which she warmed and then to prince bulbos room  he came in just as she had done and as soon as he saw her o o o o o o what a beyouooootiful creature you are you angelyou periyou rosebud let me be thy bulbulthy bulbo too fly to the desert fly with me i never saw a young gazelle to glad me with its dark blue eye that had eyes like thine thou nymph of beauty take take this young heart a truer never did itself sustain within a soldiers waistcoat be mine be mine be princess of crim tartary my royal father will approve our union and as for that little carrotyhaired angelica i do not care a fig for her any more  go away your royal highness and go to bed please said betsinda with the warmingpan  but bulbo said no never till thou swearest to be mine thou lovely blushing chambermaid divine here at thy feet the royal bulbo lies the trembling captive of betsindas eyes  and he went on making himself so absurd and ridiculous that betsinda who was full of fun gave him a touch with the warmingpan which i promise you made him cry oooo in a very different manner  prince bulbo made such a noise that prince giglio who heard him from the next room came in to see what was the matter as soon as he saw what was taking place giglio in a fury rushed on bulbo kicked him in the rudest manner up to the ceiling and went on kicking him till his hair was quite out of curl  poor betsinda did not know whether to laugh or to cry the kicking certainly must hurt the prince but then he looked so droll when giglio had done knocking him up and down to the ground and whilst he went into a corner rubbing himself what do you think giglio does he goes down on his own knees to betsinda takes her hand begs her to accept his heart and offers to marry her that moment fancy betsindas condition who had been in love with the prince ever since she first saw him in the palace garden when she was quite a little child  oh divine betsinda says the prince how have i lived fifteen years in thy company without seeing thy perfections what woman in all europe asia africa and america nay in australia only it is not yet discovered can presume to be thy equal angelica pish gruffanuff phoo the queen ha ha thou art my queen thou art the real angelica because thou art really angelic  oh prince i am but a poor chambermaid says betsinda looking however very much pleased  didst thou not tend me in my sickness when all forsook me continues giglio did not thy gentle hand smooth my pillow and bring me jelly and roast chicken  yes dear prince i did says betsinda and i sewed your royal highnesss shirtbuttons on too if you please your royal highness cries this artless maiden  when poor prince bulbo who was now madly in love with betsinda heard this declaration when he saw the unmistakable glances which she flung upon giglio bulbo began to cry bitterly and tore quantities of hair out of his head till it all covered the room like so much tow  betsinda had left the warmingpan on the floor while the princes were going on with their conversation and as they began now to quarrel and be very fierce with one another she thought proper to run away  you great big blubbering booby tearing your hair in the corner there of course you will give me satisfaction for insulting betsinda you dare to kneel down at princess giglios knees and kiss her hand  shes not princess giglio roars out bulbo she shall be princess bulbo no other shall be princess bulbo  you are engaged to my cousin bellows out giglio  i hate your cousin says bulbo  you shall give me satisfaction for insulting her cries giglio in a fury  ill have your life  ill run you through  ill cut your throat  ill blow your brains out  ill knock your head off  ill send a friend to you in the morning  ill send a bullet into you in the afternoon  well meet again says giglio shaking his fist in bulbos face and seizing up the warmingpan he kissed it because forsooth betsinda had carried it and rushed downstairs what should he see on the landing but his majesty talking to betsinda whom he called by all sorts of fond names his majesty had heard a row in the building so he stated and smelling something burning had come out to see what the matter was  its the young gentlemen smoking perhaps sir says betsinda  charming chambermaid says the king like all the rest of them never mind the young men turn thy eyes on a middleaged autocrat who has been considered not illlooking in his time  oh sir what will her majesty say cries betsinda  her majesty laughs the monarch her majesty be hanged am i not autocrat of paflagonia have i not blocks ropes axes hangmenha runs not a river by my palace wall have i not sacks to sew up wives withal say but the word that thou wilt be mine ownyour mistress straightway in a sack is sewn and thou the sharer of my heart and throne  when giglio heard these atrocious sentiments he forgot the respect usually paid to royalty lifted up the warmingpan and knocked down the king as flat as a pancake after which master giglio took to his heels and ran away and betsinda went off screaming and the queen gruffanuff and the princess all came out of their rooms fancy their feelings on beholding their husband father sovereign in this posture   x how king valoroso was in a dreadful passion   as soon as the coals began to burn him the king came to himself and stood up ho my captain of the guards his majesty exclaimed stamping his royal feet with rage o piteous spectacle the kings nose was bent quite crooked by the blow of prince giglio his majesty ground his teeth with rage hedzoff he said taking a deathwarrant out of his dressinggown pocket hedzoff good hedzoff seize upon the prince thoult find him in his chamber two pair up but now he dared with sacrilegious hand to strike the sacred nightcap of a kinghedzoff and floor me with a warmingpan away no more demur the villain dies see it be done or elsehmhahm mind thine own eyes and followed by the ladies and lifting up the tails of his dressinggown the king entered his own apartment  captain hedzoff was very much affected having a sincere love for giglio poor poor giglio he said the tears rolling over his manly face and dripping down his moustachios my noble young prince is it my hand must lead thee to death  lead him to fiddlestick hedzoff said a female voice it was gruffanuff who had come out in her dressinggown when she heard the noise the king said you were to hang the prince well hang the prince  i dont understand you says hedzoff who was not a very clever man  you gaby he didnt say which prince says gruffanuff  no he didnt say which certainly said hedzoff  well then take bulbo and hang him  when captain hedzoff heard this he began to dance about for joy obedience is a soldiers honor says he prince bulbos head will do capitally and he went to arrest the prince the very first thing next morning  he knocked at the door whos there says bulbo captain hedzoff step in pray my good captain im delighted to see you i have been expecting you  have you says hedzoff  sleibootz my chamberlain will act for me says the prince  i beg your royal highnesss pardon but you will have to act for yourself and its a pity to wake baron sleibootz  the prince bulbo still seemed to take the matter very coolly of course captain says he you are come about that affair with prince giglio  precisely says hedzoff that affair of prince giglio  is it to be pistols or swords captain asks bulbo im a pretty good hand with both and ill do for prince giglio as sure as my name is my royal highness prince bulbo  theres some mistake my lord says the captain the business is done with axes among us  axes thats sharp work says bulbo call my chamberlain hell be my second and in ten minutes i flatter myself youll see master giglios head off his impertinent shoulders im hungry for his blood hooooaw and he looked as savage as an ogre  i beg your pardon sir but by this warrant i am to take you prisoner and hand you over toto the executioner  pooh pooh my good manstop i sayhohulloa was all that this luckless prince was enabled to say for hedzoffs guards seizing him tied a handkerchief over his mouth and face and carried him to the place of execution  the king who happened to be talking to glumboso saw him pass and took a pinch of snuff and said so much for giglio now lets go to breakfast  the captain of the guard handed over his prisoner to the sheriff with the fatal order   at sight cut off the bearers head  valoroso xxiv   its a mistake says bulbo who did not seem to understand the business in the least  poopoopooh says the sheriff fetch jack ketch instantly jack ketch  and poor bulbo was led to the scaffold where an executioner with a block and a tremendous axe was always ready in case he should be wanted  but we must now revert to giglio and betsinda   xi what gruffanuff did to giglio and betsinda   gruffanuff who had seen what had happened with the king and knew that giglio must come to grief got up very early the next morning and went to devise some plans for rescuing her darling husband as the silly old thing insisted on calling him she found him walking up and down the garden thinking of a rhyme for betsinda tinder and winda were all he could find and indeed having forgotten all about the past evening except that betsinda was the most lovely of beings  well dear giglio says gruff  well dear gruffy says giglio only he was quite satirical  i have been thinking darling what you must do in this scrape you must fly the country for a while  what scrapefly the country never without her i love countess says giglio  no she will accompany you dear prince she says in her most coaxing accents first we must get the jewels belonging to our royal parents and those of her and his present majesty here is the key duck they are all yours you know by right for you are the rightful king of paflagonia and your wife will be the rightful queen  will she says giglio  yes and having got the jewels go to glumbosos apartment where under his bed you will find sacks containing money to the amount of l217000000987439 13s 612d all belonging to you for he took it out of your royal fathers room on the day of his death with this we will fly  we will fly says giglio  yes you and your brideyour affianced loveyour gruffy says the countess with a languishing leer  you my bride says giglio you you hideous old woman  oh youyou wretch didnt you give me this paper promising marriage cries gruff  get away you old goose i love betsinda and betsinda only and in a fit of terror he ran from her as quickly as he could  he he he shrieks out gruff a promise is a promise if there are laws in paflagonia and as for that monster that wretch that fiend that ugly little vixenas for that upstart that ingrate that beast betsinda master giglio will have no little difficulty in discovering her whereabouts he may look very long before finding her i warrant he little knows that miss betsinda is   iswhat now you shall hear poor betsinda got up at five in winters morning to bring her cruel mistress her tea and instead of finding her in a good humor found gruffy as cross as two sticks the countess boxed betsindas ears half a dozen times whilst she was dressing but as poor little betsinda was used to this kind of treatment she did not feel any special alarm and now says she when her majesty rings her bell twice ill trouble you miss to attend  so when the queens bell rang twice betsinda came to her majesty and made a pretty little curtsey the queen the princess and gruffanuff were all three in the room as soon as they saw her they began  you wretch says the queen  you little vulgar thing says the princess  you beast says gruffanuff  get out of my sight says the queen  go away with you do says the princess  quit the premises says gruffanuff  alas and woe is me very lamentable events had occurred to betsinda that morning and all in consequence of that fatal warmingpan business of the previous night the king had offered to marry her of course her majesty the queen was jealous bulbo had fallen in love with her of course angelica was furious giglio was in love with her and oh what a fury gruffy was in    cap   take off that petticoat i gave you they said all at once    gown   and began tearing the clothes off poor betsinda    the king   how dare you flirt with prince bulbo  cried the queen the   prince giglio princess and countess  give her the rags she wore when she came into the house and turn her out of it cries the queen  mind she does not go with my shoes on which i lent her so kindly says the princess and indeed the princesss shoes were a great deal too big for betsinda  come with me you filthy hussy and taking up the queens poker the cruel gruffanuff drove betsinda into her room  the countess went to the glass box in which she had kept betsindas old cloak and shoe this ever so long and said take those rags you little beggar creature and strip off everything belonging to honest people and go about your business and she actually tore off the poor little delicate things back almost all her things and told her to be off out of the house  poor betsinda huddled the cloak round her back on which were embroidered the letters prin    rosal   and then came a great rent  as for the shoe what was she to do with one poor little tootsey sandal the string was still to it so she hung it round her neck  wont you give me a pair of shoes to go out in the snow mum if you please mum cried the poor child  no you wicked beast says gruffanuff driving her along with the pokerdriving her down the cold stairsdriving her through the cold hallflinging her out into the cold street so that the knocker itself shed tears to see her  but a kind fairy made the soft snow warm for her little feet and she wrapped herself up in the ermine of her mantle and was gone   and now let us think about breakfast says the greedy queen  what dress shall i put on mamma the pink or the peagreen says angelica which do you think the dear prince will like best  mrs v sings out the king from his dressingroom let us have sausages for breakfast remember we have prince bulbo staying with us  and they all went to get ready  nine oclock came and they were all in the breakfastroom and no prince bulbo as yet the urn was hissing and humming the muffins were smokingsuch a heap of muffins the eggs were done there was a pot of raspberry jam and coffee and a beautiful chicken and tongue on the sidetable marmitonio the cook brought in the sausages oh how nice they smelt  where is bulbo said the king john where is his royal highness  john said he had a took hup his roilighnessesses shavingwater and his clothes and things and he wasnt in his room which he sposed his royliness was just stepped hout  stepped out before breakfast in the snow impossible says the king sticking his fork into a sausage my dear take one angelica wont you have a saveloy the princess took one being very fond of them and at this moment glumboso entered with captain hedzoff both looking very much disturbed  i am afraid your majesty cries glumboso  no business before breakfast glum says the king breakfast first business next mrs v some more sugar  sire i am afraid if we wait till after breakfast it will be too late says glumboso hehehell be hanged at halfpast nine  dont talk about hanging and spoil my breakfast you unkind vulgar man you cries the princess john some mustard pray who is to be hanged  sire it is the prince whispers glumboso to the king  talk about business after breakfast i tell you says his majesty quite sulky  we shall have a war sire depend on it says the minister his father king padella     his father king who says the king king padella is not giglios father my brother king savio was giglios father  its prince bulbo they are hanging sire not prince giglio says the prime minister  you told me to hang the prince and i took the ugly one says hedzoff i didnt of course think your majesty intended to murder your own flesh and blood  the king for all reply flung the plate of sausages at hedzoffs head the princess cried out heekareekaree and fell down in a fainting fit  turn the cock of the urn upon her royal highness said the king and the boiling water gradually revived her his majesty looked at his watch compared it by the clock in the parlor and by that of the church in the square opposite then he wound it up then he looked at it again the great question is says he am i fast or am i slow if im slow we may as well go on with breakfast if im fast why there is just the possibility of saving prince bulbo its a doosid awkward mistake and upon my word hedzoff i have the greatest mind to have you hanged too  sire i did but my duty a soldier has but his orders i didnt expect after fortyseven years of faithful service that my sovereign would think of putting me to a felons death  a hundred thousand plagues upon you cant you see that while you are talking my bulbo is being hung screamed the princess  by jove shes always right that girl and im so absent says the king looking at his watch again ha there go the drums what a doosid awkward thing though  o papa you goose write the reprieve and let me run with it cries the princessand she got a sheet of paper and pen and ink and laid them before the king  confound it where are my spectacles the monarch exclaimed angelica go up into my bedroom look under my pillow not your mammas there youll see my keys bring them down to me andwell well what impetuous things these girls are angelica was gone and had run up panting to the bedroom and found the keys and was back again before the king had finished a muffin now love says he you must go all the way back for my desk in which my spectacles are if you would but have heard me out    be hanged to her there she is off again angelica angelica when his majesty called in his loud voice she knew she must obey and came back  my dear when you go out of a room how often have i told you shut the door thats a darling thats all at last the keys and the desk and the spectacles were got and the king mended his pen and signed his name to a reprieve and angelica ran with it as swift as the wind youd better stay my love and finish the muffins theres no use going be sure its too late hand me over that raspberry jam please said the monarch bong bawong there goes the halfhour i knew it was  angelica ran and ran and ran and ran she ran up fore street and down high street and through the marketplace and down to the left and over the bridge and up the blind alley and back again and round by the castle and so along by the haberdashers on the right opposite the lamppost and round the square and she cameshe came to the execution place where she saw bulbo laying his head on the block the executioner raised his axe but at that moment the princess came panting up and cried reprieve reprieve screamed the princess reprieve shouted all the people up the scaffold stairs she sprang with the agility of a lighter of lamps and flinging herself in bulbos arms regardless of all ceremony she cried out oh my prince my lord my love my bulbo thine angelica has been in time to save thy precious existence sweet rosebud to prevent thy being nipped in thy young bloom had aught befallen thee angelica too had died and welcomed death that joined her to her bulbo  hm theres no accounting for tastes said bulbo looking so very much puzzled and uncomfortable that the princess in tones of tenderest strain asked the cause of his disquiet  i tell you what it is angelica said he since i came here yesterday there has been such a row and disturbance and quarrelling and fighting and chopping of heads off and the deuce to pay that i am inclined to go back to crim tartary  but with me as thy bride my bulbo though wherever thou art is crim tartary to me my bold my beautiful my bulbo  well well i suppose we must be married says bulbo doctor you came to read the funeral serviceread the marriage service will you what must be must that will satisfy angelica and then in the name of peace and quietness do let us go back to breakfast  bulbo had carried a rose in his mouth all the time of the dismal ceremony it was a fairy rose and he was told by his mother that he ought never to part with it so he had kept it between his teeth even when he laid his poor head upon the block hoping vaguely that some chance would turn up in his favor as he began to speak to angelica he forgot about the rose and of course it dropped out of his mouth the romantic princess instantly stooped and seized it sweet rose she exclaimed that bloomed upon my bulbos lip never never will i part from thee and she placed it in her bosom and you know bulbo couldnt ask her to give the rose back again and they went to breakfast and as they walked it appeared to bulbo that angelica became more exquisitely lovely every moment  he was frantic until they were married and now strange to say it was angelica who didnt care about him he knelt down he kissed her hand he prayed and begged he cried with admiration while she for her part said she really thought they might wait it seemed to her he was not handsome any moreno not at all quite the reverse and not clever no very stupid and not well bred like giglio no on the contrary dreadfully vul  what i cannot say for king valoroso roared out pooh stuff in a terrible voice we will have no more of this shillyshallying call the archbishop and let the prince and princess be married offhand  so married they were and i am sure for my part i trust they will be happy   xii how betsinda fled and what became of her   betsinda wandered on and on till she passed through the town gates and so on the great crim tartary road the very way on which giglio too was going ah thought she as the diligence passed her of which the conductor was blowing a delightful tune on his horn how i should like to be on that coach but the coach and the jingling horses were very soon gone she little knew who was in it though very likely she was thinking of him all the time  then came an empty cart returning from market and the driver being a kind man and seeing such a very pretty girl trudging along the road with bare feet most goodnaturedly gave her a seat he said he lived on the confines of the forest where his old father was a woodman and if she liked he would take her so far on her road all roads were the same to little betsinda so she very thankfully took this one  and the carter put a cloth round her bare feet and gave her some bread and cold bacon and was very kind to her for all that she was very cold and melancholy when after travelling on and on evening came and all the black pines were bending with snow and there at last was the comfortable light beaming in the woodmans windows and so they arrived and went into his cottage he was an old man and had a number of children who were just at supper with nice hot breadandmilk when their elder brother arrived with the cart and they jumped and clapped their hands for they were good children and he had brought them toys from the town and when they saw the pretty stranger they ran to her and brought her to the fire and rubbed her poor little feet and brought her bread and milk  look father they said to the old woodman look at this poor girl and see what pretty cold feet she has they are as white as our milk and look and see what an odd cloak she has just like the bit of velvet that hangs up in our cupboard and which you found that day the little cubs were killed by king padella in the forest and look why bless us all she has got round her neck just such another little shoe as that you brought home and have shown us so oftena little blue velvet shoe  what said the old woodman what is all this about a shoe and a cloak  and betsinda explained that she had been left when quite a little child at the town with this cloak and this shoe and the persons who had taken care of her hadhad been angry with her for no fault she hoped of her own and they had sent her away with her old clothesand here in fact she was she remembered having been in a forestand perhaps it was a dreamit was so very odd and strangehaving lived in a cave with lions there and before that having lived in a very very fine house as fine as the kings in the town  when the woodman heard this he was so astonished it was quite curious to see how astonished he was he went to his cupboard and took out of a stocking a fiveshilling piece of king cavolfiore and vowed it was exactly like the young woman and then he produced the shoe and piece of velvet which he had kept so long and compared them with the things which betsinda wore in betsindas little shoe was written hopkins maker to the royal family so in the other shoe was written hopkins maker to the royal family in the inside of betsindas piece of cloak was embroidered prin rosal in the other piece of cloak was embroidered cess ba no 246 so that when put together you read princess rosalba no 246  on seeing this the dear old woodman fell down on his knee saying o my princess o my gracious royal lady o my rightful queen of crim tartaryi hail theei acknowledge theei do thee homage and in token of his fealty he rubbed his venerable nose three times on the ground and put the princesss foot on his head  why said she my good woodman you must be a nobleman of my royal fathers court for in her lowly retreat and under the name of betsinda her majesty rosalba queen of crim tartary had read of the customs of all foreign courts and nations  marry indeed am i my gracious liegethe poor lord spinachi oncethe humble woodman these fifteen years syneever since the tyrant padella may ruin overtake the treacherous knave dismissed me from my post of first lord  first lord of the toothpick and joint keeper of the snuffbox i mind me thou heldest these posts under our royal sire they are restored to thee lord spinachi i make thee knight of the second class of our order of the pumpkin the first class being reserved for crowned heads alone rise marquis of spinachi and with indescribable majesty the queen who had no sword handy waved the pewter spoon with which she had been taking her breadandmilk over the bald head of the old nobleman whose tears absolutely made a puddle on the ground and whose dear children went to bed that night lords and ladies bartolomeo ubaldo catarina and ottavia degli spinachi  the acquaintance her majesty showed with the history and noble families of her empire was wonderful the house of broccoli should remain faithful to us she said they were ever welcome at our court have the articiocchi as was their wont turned to the rising sun the family of sauerkraut must sure be with usthey were ever welcome in the halls of king cavolfiore and so she went on enumerating quite a list of the nobility and gentry of crim tartary so admirably had her majesty profited by her studies while in exile  the old marquis of spinachi said he could answer for them all that the whole country groaned under padellas tyranny and longed to return to its rightful sovereign and late as it was he sent his children who knew the forest well to summon this nobleman and that and when his eldest son who had been rubbing the horse down and giving him his supper came into the house for his own the marquis told him to put his boots on and a saddle on the mare and ride hither and thither to such and such people  when the young man heard who his companion in the cart had been he too knelt down and put her royal foot on his head he too bedewed the ground with his tears he was frantically in love with her as everybody now was who saw her so were the young lords bartolomeo and ubaldo who punched each others little heads out of jealousy and so when they came from east and west at the summons of the marquis degli spinachi were the crim tartar lords who still remained faithful to the house of cavolfiore they were such very old gentlemen for the most part that her majesty never suspected their absurd passion and went among them quite unaware of the havoc her beauty was causing until an old blind lord who had joined her party told her what the truth was after which for fear of making the people too much in love with her she always wore a veil she went about privately from one noblemans castle to another and they visited among themselves again and had meetings and composed proclamations and counterproclamations and distributed all the best places of the kingdom amongst one another and selected who of the opposition party should be executed when the queen came to her own and so in about a year they were ready to move  the party of fidelity was in truth composed of very feeble old fogies for the most part they went about the country waving their old swords and flags and calling god save the queen and king padella happening to be absent upon an invasion they had their own way for a little and to be sure the people were very enthusiastic whenever they saw the queen otherwise the vulgar took matters very quietly for they said as far as they could recollect they were pretty well as much taxed in cavolfiores time as now in padellas   xiii how queen rosalba came to the castle of the bold count hogginarmo   her majesty having indeed nothing else to give made all her followers knights of the pumpkin and marquises earls and baronets and they had a little court for her and made her a little crown of gilt paper and a robe of cotton velvet and they quarrelled about the places to be given away in her court and about rank and precedence and dignitiesyou cant think how they quarrelled the poor queen was very tired of her honors before she had had them a month and i dare say sighed sometimes even to be a ladysmaid again but we must all do our duty in our respective stations so the queen resigned herself to perform hers  we have said how it happened that none of the usurpers troops came out to oppose this army of fidelity it pottered along as nimbly as the gout of the principal commanders allowed it consisted of twice as many officers as soldiers and at length passed near the estates of one of the most powerful noblemen of the country who had not declared for the queen but of whom her party had hopes as he was always quarrelling with king padella  when they came close to his park gates this nobleman sent to say he would wait upon her majesty he was a most powerful warrior and his name was count hogginarmo whose helmet it took two strong negroes to carry he knelt down before her and said madam and liege lady it becomes the great nobles of the crimean realm to show every outward sign of respect to the wearer of the crown whoever that may be we testify to our own nobility in acknowledging yours the bold hogginarmo bends the knee to the first of the aristocracy of his country  rosalba said the bold count of hogginarmo was uncommonly kind but she felt afraid of him even while he was kneeling and his eyes scowled at her from between his whiskers which grew up to them  the first count of the empire madam he went on salutes the sovereign the prince addresses himself to the not more noble lady madam my hand is free and i offer it and my heart and my sword to your service my three wives lie buried in my ancestral vaults the third perished but a year since and this heart pines for a consort deign to be mine and i swear to bring to your bridal table the head of king padella the eyes and nose of his son prince bulbo the right hand and ears of the usurping sovereign of paflagonia which country shall thenceforth be an appanage to yourto our crown say yes hogginarmo is not accustomed to be denied indeed i cannot contemplate the possibility of a refusal for frightful will be the result dreadful the murders furious the devastations horrible the tyranny tremendous the tortures misery taxation which the people of this realm will endure if hogginarmos wrath be aroused i see consent in your majestys lovely eyestheir glances fill my soul with rapture  oh sir rosalba said withdrawing her hand in great fright your lordship is exceedingly kind but i am sorry to tell you that i have a prior attachment to a young gentleman by the name ofprince giglioand nevernever can marry any one but him  who can describe hogginarmos wrath at this remark rising up from the ground he ground his teeth so that fire flashed out of his mouth from which at the same time issued remarks and language so loud violent and improper that this pen shall never repeat them rrrrrrrejected fiends and perdition the bold hogginarmo rejected all the world shall hear of my rage and you madam you above all shall rue it and kicking the two negroes before him he rushed away his whiskers streaming in the wind  her majestys privy council was in a dreadful panic when they saw hogginarmo issue from the royal presence in such a towering rage making footballs of the poor negroesa panic which the events justified they marched off from hogginarmos park very crestfallen and in another halfhour they were met by that rapacious chieftain with a few of his followers who cut slashed charged whacked banged and pommelled amongst them took the queen prisoner and drove the army of fidelity to i dont know where  poor queen hogginarmo her conqueror would not condescend to see her get a horsevan he said to his grooms clap the hussy into it and send her with my compliments to his majesty king padella  along with his lovely prisoner hogginarmo sent a letter full of servile compliments and loathsome flatteries to king padella for whose life and that of his royal family the hypocritical humbug pretended to offer the most fulsome prayers and hogginarmo promised speedily to pay his humble homage at his august masters throne of which he begged leave to be counted the most loyal and constant defender such a wary old bird as king padella was not to be caught by master hogginarmos chaff and we shall hear presently how the tyrant treated his upstart vassal no no depend ont two such rogues do not trust one another  so this poor queen was laid in the straw like margery daw and driven along in the dark ever so many miles to the court where king padella had now arrived having vanquished all his enemies murdered most of them and brought some of the richest into captivity with him for the purpose of torturing them and finding out where they had hidden their money  rosalba heard their shrieks and groans in the dungeon in which she was thrust a most awful black hole full of bats rats mice toads frogs mosquitoes bugs fleas serpents and every kind of horror no light was let into it otherwise the gaolers might have seen her and fallen in love with her as an owl that lived up in the roof of the tower did and a cat you know who can see in the dark and having set its green eyes on rosalba never would be got to go back to the turnkeys wife to whom it belonged and the toads in the dungeon came and kissed her feet and the vipers wound round her neck and arms and never hurt her so charming was this poor princess in the midst of her misfortunes  at last after she had been kept in this place ever so long the door of the dungeon opened and the terrible king padella came in  but what he said and did must be reserved for another chapter as we must now back to prince giglio   xiv what became of giglio   the idea of marrying such an old creature as gruffanuff frightened prince giglio so that he ran up to his room packed his trunks fetched in a couple of porters and was off to the diligence office in a twinkling  it was well that he was so quick in his operations did not dawdle over his luggage and took the early coach for as soon as the mistake about prince bulbo was found out that cruel glumboso sent up a couple of policemen to prince giglios room with orders that he should be carried to newgate and his head taken off before twelve oclock but the coach was out of the paflagonian dominions before two oclock and i dare say the express that was sent after prince giglio did not ride very quick for many people in paflagonia had a regard for giglio as the son of their old sovereign a prince who with all his weaknesses was very much better than his brother the usurping lazy careless passionate tyrannical reigning monarch that prince busied himself with the balls fetes masquerades huntingparties and so forth which he thought proper to give on occasion of his daughters marriage to prince bulbo and let us trust was not sorry in his own heart that his brothers son had escaped the scaffold  it was very cold weather and the snow was on the ground and giglio who gave his name as simple mr giles was very glad to get a comfortable place in the coupe of the diligence where he sat with the conductor and another gentleman at the first stage from blombodinga as they stopped to change horses there came up to the diligence a very ordinary vulgarlooking woman with a bag under her arm who asked for a place all the inside places were taken and the young woman was informed that if she wished to travel she must go upon the roof and the passenger inside with giglio a rude person i should think put his head out of the window and said nice weather for travelling outside i wish you a pleasant journey my dear the poor woman coughed very much and giglio pitied her i will give up my place to her says he rather than she should travel in the cold air with that horrid cough on which the vulgar traveller said youd keep her warm i am sure if its a muff she wants on which giglio pulled his nose boxed his ears hit him in the eye and gave this vulgar person a warning never to call him muff again  then he sprang up gaily on to the roof of the diligence and made himself very comfortable in the straw the vulgar traveller got down only at the next station and giglio took his place again and talked to the person next to him she appeared to be a most agreeable wellinformed and entertaining female they travelled together till night and she gave giglio all sorts of things out of the bag which she carried and which indeed seemed to contain the most wonderful collection of articles he was thirstyout there came a pint bottle of basss pale ale and a silver mug hungryshe took out a cold fowl some slices of ham bread salt and a most delicious piece of cold plumpudding and a little glass of brandy afterwards  as they travelled this plainlooking queer woman talked to giglio on a variety of subjects in which the poor prince showed his ignorance as much as she did her capacity he owned with many blushes how ignorant he was on which the lady said my dear giglmy good mr giles you are a young man and have plenty of time before you you have nothing to do but to improve yourself who knows but that you may find use for your knowledge some day whenwhen you may be wanted at home as some people may be  good heavens madam says he do you know me  i know a number of funny things says the lady i have been at some peoples christenings and turned away from other folks doors i have seen some people spoilt by good fortune and others as i hope improved by hardship i advise you to stay at the town where the coach stops for the night stay there and study and remember your old friend to whom you were kind  and who is my old friend asked giglio  when you want anything says the lady look in this bag which i leave to you as a present and be grateful to  to whom madam says he  to the fairy blackstick says the lady flying out of the window and then giglio asked the conductor if he knew where the lady was  what lady says the man there has been no lady in this coach except the old woman who got out at the last stage and giglio thought he had been dreaming but there was the bag which blackstick had given him lying on his lap and when he came to the town he took it in his hand and went into the inn  they gave him a very bad bedroom and giglio when he woke in the morning fancying himself in the royal palace at home called john charles thomas my chocolatemy dressinggownmy slippers but nobody came there was no bell so he went and bawled out for water on the top of the stairs  the landlady came up lookinglooking like this  what are you ahollering and abellaring for here young man says she  theres no warm waterno servants my boots are not even cleaned  he he clean em yourself says the landlady you young students give yourselves pretty airs i never heard such impudence  ill quit the house this instant says giglio  the sooner the better young man pay your bill and be off all my rooms is wanted for gentlefolks and not for such as you  you may well keep the bear inn said giglio you should have yourself painted as the sign  the landlady of the bear went away growling and giglio returned to his room where the first thing he saw was the fairy bag lying on the table which seemed to give a little hop as he came in i hope it has some breakfast in it says giglio for i have only a very little money left but on opening the bag what do you think was there a blacking brush and a pot of warrens jet and on the pot was written       poor young men their boots must black      use me and cork me and put me back  so giglio laughed and blacked his boots and put back the brush and the bottle into the bag  when he had done dressing himself the bag gave another little hop and he went to it and took out  1 a tablecloth and a napkin  2 a sugarbasin full of the best loafsugar  4 6 8 10 two forks two teaspoons two knives and a pair of sugartongs and a butterknife all marked g  11 12 13 a teacup saucer and slopbasin  14 a jug full of delicious cream  15 a canister with black tea and green  16 a large teaurn and boiling water  17 a saucepan containing three eggs nicely done  18 a quarter of a pound of best epping butter  19 a brown loaf  and if he hadnt enough now for a good breakfast i should like to know who ever had one  giglio having had his breakfast popped all the things back into the bag and went out looking for lodgings i forgot to say that this celebrated university town was called bosforo  he took a modest lodging opposite the schools paid his bill at the inn and went to his apartment with his trunk carpetbag and not forgetting we may be sure his other bag  when he opened his trunk which the day before he had filled with his best clothes he found it contained only books and in the first of them which he opened there was written       clothes for the back books for the head      read and remember them when they are read  and in his bag when giglio looked in it he found a students cap and gown a writingbook full of paper an inkstand pens and a johnsons dictionary which was very useful to him as his spelling had been sadly neglected  so he sat down and worked away very very hard for a whole year during which mr giles was quite an example to all the students in the university of bosforo he never got into any riots or disturbances the professors all spoke well of him and the students liked him too so that when at examination he took all the prizes viz       the spelling prize      the french prize      the writing prize       the arithmetic prize      the history prize       the latin prize      the catechism prize     the good conduct prize  all his fellowstudents said hurrah hurray for giles giles is the boythe students joy hurray for giles and he brought quite a quantity of medals crowns books and tokens of distinction home to his lodgings  one day after the examinations as he was diverting himself at a coffeehouse with two friendsdid i tell you that in his bag every saturday night he found just enough to pay his bills with a guinea over for pocketmoney didnt i tell you well he did as sure as twice twenty makes fortyfivehe chanced to look in the bosforo chronicle and read off quite easily for he could spell read and write the longest words now the following  romantic circumstanceone of the most extraordinary adventures that we have ever heard has set the neighboring country of crim tartary in a state of great excitement  it will be remembered that when the present revered sovereign of crim tartary his majesty king padella took possession of the throne after having vanquished in the terrific battle of blunderbusco the late king cavolfiore that princes only child the princess rosalba was not found in the royal palace of which king padella took possession and it was said had strayed into the forest being abandoned by all her attendants where she had been eaten up by those ferocious lions the last pair of which were captured some time since and brought to the tower after killing several hundred persons  his majesty king padella who has the kindest heart in the world was grieved at the accident which had occurred to the harmless little princess for whom his majestys known benevolence would certainly have provided a fitting establishment but her death seemed to be certain the mangled remains of a cloak and a little shoe were found in the forest during a huntingparty in which the intrepid sovereign of crim tartary slew two of the lions cubs with his own spear and these interesting relics of an innocent little creature were carried home and kept by their finder the baron spinachi formerly an officer in cavolfiores household the baron was disgraced in consequence of his known legitimist opinions and has lived for some time in the humble capacity of a woodcutter in a forest on the outskirts of the kingdom of crim tartary  last tuesday week baron spinachi and a number of gentlemen attached to the former dynasty appeared in arms crying god save rosalba the first queen of crim tartary and surrounding a lady whom report describes as beautiful exceedingly her history may be authentic is certainly most romantic  the personage calling herself rosalba states that she was brought out of the forest fifteen years since by a lady in a car drawn by dragons this account is certainly improbable that she was left in the palace garden of blombodinga where her royal highness the princess angelica now married to his royal highness bulbo crown prince of crim tartary found the child and with that elegant benevolence which has always distinguished the heiress of the throne of paflagonia gave the little outcast a shelter and a home her parentage not being known and her garb very humble the foundling was educated in the palace in a menial capacity under the name of betsinda  she did not give satisfaction and was dismissed carrying with her certainly part of a mantle and a shoe which she had on when first found according to her statement she quitted blombodinga about a year ago since which time she has been with the spinachi family on the very same morning the prince giglio nephew to the king of paflagonia a young prince whose character for talent and order were to say truth none of the highest also quitted blombodinga and has not been since heard of  what an extraordinary story said smith and jones two young students giglios especial friends  ha what is this giglio went on reading  second edition expresswe hear that the troop under baron spinachi has been surrounded and utterly routed by general count hogginarmo and the soidisant princess is sent a prisoner to the capital  university newsyesterday at the schools the distinguished young student mr giles read a latin oration and was complimented by the chancellor of bosforo dr prugnaro with the highest university honorthe wooden spoon  never mind that stuff says giles greatly disturbed come home with me my friends gallant smith intrepid jones friends of my studiespartakers of my academic toilsi have that to tell which shall astonish your honest minds  go it old boy cries the impetuous smith  talk away my buck says jones a lively fellow  with an air of indescribable dignity giglio checked their natural but no more seemly familiarity jones smith my good friends said the prince disguise is henceforth useless i am no more the humble student giles i am the descendant of a royal line  atavis edite regibus i know old co cried jones he was going to say old cock but a flash from the royal eye again awed him  friends continued the prince i am that giglio i am in fact paflagonia rise smith and kneel not in the public street jones thou true heart my faithless uncle when i was a baby filched from me that brave crown my father left me bred me all young and careless of my rights like unto hapless hamlet prince of denmark and had i any thoughts about my wrongs soothed me with promises of near redress i should espouse his daughter young angelica we two indeed should reign in paflagonia his words were falsefalse as angelicas heartfalse as angelicas hair color front teeth she looked with her skew eyes upon young bulbo crim tartarys stupid heir and she preferred him twas then i turned my eyes upon betsindarosalba as she now is and i saw in her the blushing sum of all perfection the pink of maiden modesty the nymph that my fond heart had ever wood in dreams c c  i dont give this speech which was very fine but very long and though smith and jones knew nothing about the circumstances my dear reader does so i go on  the prince and his young friends hastened home to his apartment highly excited by the intelligence as no doubt by the royal narrators admirable manner of recounting it and they ran up to his room where he had worked so hard at his books  on his writingtable was his bag grown so long that the prince could not help remarking it he went to it opened it and what do you think he found in it  a splendid long goldhandled redvelvetscabbarded cutandthrust sword and on the sheath was embroidered rosalba for ever  he drew out the sword which flashed and illuminated the whole room and called out rosalba for ever smith and jones following him but quite respectfully this time and taking the time from his royal highness  and now his trunk opened with a sudden pong and out there came three ostrich feathers in a gold crown surrounding a beautiful shining steel helmet a cuirass a pair of spurs finally a complete suit of armor  the books on giglios shelves were all gone where there had been some great dictionaries giglios friends found two pairs of jackboots labelled lieutenant smith  jones esq which fitted them to a nicety besides there were helmets back and breast plates swords c just like in mr g p r jamess novels and that evening three cavaliers might have been seen issuing from the gates of bosforo in whom the porters proctors c never thought of recognising the young prince and his friends  they got horses at a livery stablekeepers and never drew bridle until they reached the last town on the frontier before you come to crim tartary here as their animals were tired and the cavaliers hungry they stopped and refreshed at an hostel i could make a chapter of this if i were like some writers but i like to cram my measure tight down you see and give you a great deal for your money and in a word they had some bread and cheese and ale upstairs on the balcony of the inn as they were drinking drums and trumpets sounded nearer and nearer the marketplace was filled with soldiers and his royal highness looking forth recognised the paflagonian banners and the paflagonian national air which the bands were playing  the troops all made for the tavern at once and as they came up giglio exclaimed on beholding their leader whom do i see yesno it is it isphoono it cant be yes it is my friend my gallant faithful veteran captain hedzoff ho hedzoff knowest thou not thy prince thy giglio good corporal methinks we once were friends ha sergeant an my memory serves me right we have had many a bout at singlestick  i faith we have a many good my lord says the sergeant  tell me what means this mighty armament continued his royal highness from the balcony and whither march my paflagonians  hedzoffs head fell my lord he said we march as the allies of great padella crim tartarys monarch  crim tartarys usurper gallant hedzoff crim tartarys grim tyrant honest hedzoff said the prince on the balcony quite sarcastically  a soldier prince must needs obey his orders mine are to help his majesty padella and also though alack that i should say it to seize wherever i should light upon him  first catch your hare ha hedzoff exclaimed his royal highness  on the body of giglio whilome prince of paflagonia hedzoff went on with indescribable emotion my prince give up your sword without ado look we are thirty thousand men to one  give up my sword giglio give up his sword cried the prince and stepping well forward on to the balcony the royal youth without preparation delivered a speech so magnificent that no report can do justice to it it was all in blank verse in which from this time he invariably spoke as more becoming his majestic station it lasted for three days and three nights during which not a single person who heard him was tired or remarked the difference between daylight and dark the soldiers only cheering tremendously when occasionally once in nine hours the prince paused to suck an orange which jones took out of the bag he explained in terms which we say we shall not attempt to convey the whole history of the previous transaction and his determination not only not to give up his sword but to assume his rightful crown and at the end of this extraordinary this truly gigantic effort captain hedzoff flung up his helmet and cried hurray hurray long live king giglio  such were the consequences of having employed his time well at college  when the excitement had ceased beer was ordered out for the army and their sovereign himself did not disdain a little and now it was with some alarm that captain hedzoff told him his division was only the advanced guard of the paflagonian contingent hastening to king padellas aid the main force being a days march in the rear under his royal highness prince bulbo  we will wait here good friend to beat the prince his majesty said and then will make his royal father wince   xv we return to rosalba   king padella made very similar proposals to rosalba to those which she had received from the various princes who as we have seen had fallen in love with her his majesty was a widower and offered to marry his fair captive that instant but she declined his invitation in her usual polite gentle manner stating that prince giglio was her love and that any other union was out of the question having tried tears and supplications in vain this violenttempered monarch menaced her with threats and tortures but she declared she would rather suffer all these than accept the hand of her fathers murderer who left her finally uttering the most awful imprecations and bidding her prepare for death on the following morning  all night long the king spent in advising how he should get rid of this obdurate young creature cutting off her head was much too easy a death for her hanging was so common in his majestys dominions that it no longer afforded him any sport finally he bethought himself of a pair of fierce lions which had lately been sent to him as presents and he determined with these ferocious brutes to hunt poor rosalba down adjoining his castle was an amphitheatre where the prince indulged in bullbaiting rathunting and other ferocious sports the two lions were kept in a cage under this place their roaring might be heard over the whole city the inhabitants of which i am sorry to say thronged in numbers to see a poor young lady gobbled up by two wild beasts  the king took his place in the royal box having the officers of his court around and the count hogginarmo by his side upon whom his majesty was observed to look very fiercely the fact is royal spies had told the monarch of hogginarmos behavior his proposals to rosalba and his offer to fight for the crown black as thunder looked king padella at this proud noble as they sat in the front seats of the theatre waiting to see the tragedy whereof poor rosalba was to be the heroine  at length that princess was brought out in her nightgown with all her beautiful hair falling down her back and looking so pretty that even the beefeaters and keepers of the wild animals wept plentifully at seeing her and she walked with her poor little feet only luckily the arena was covered with sawdust and went and leaned up against a great stone in the centre of the amphitheatre round which the court and the people were seated in boxes with bars before them for fear of the great fierce redmaned blackthroated longtailed roaring bellowing rushing lions  and now the gates were opened and with a wurrawarrurawarar two great lean hungry roaring lions rushed out of their den where they had been kept for three weeks on nothing but a little toastandwater and dashed straight up to the stone where poor rosalba was waiting commend her to your patron saints all you kind people for she is in a dreadful state  there was a hum and a buzz all through the circus and the fierce king padella even felt a little compassion but count hogginarmo seated by his majesty roared out hurray now for it soosoosoo that nobleman being uncommonly angry still at rosalbas refusal of him  but o strange event o remarkable circumstance o extraordinary coincidence which i am sure none of you could by any possibility have divined when the lions came to rosalba instead of devouring her with their great teeth it was with kisses they gobbled her up they licked her pretty feet they nuzzled their noses in her lap they mood they seemed to say dear dear sister dont you recollect your brothers in the forest and she put her pretty white arms round their tawny necks and kissed them  king padella was immensely astonished the count hogginarmo was extremely disgusted pooh the count cried gammon exclaimed his lordship these lions are tame beasts come from wombwells or astleys it is a shame to put people off in this way i believe they are little boys dressed up in doormats they are no lions at all  ha said the king you dare to say gammon to your sovereign do you these lions are no lions at all arent they ho my beefeaters ho my bodyguard take this count hogginarmo and fling him into the circus give him a sword and buckler let him keep his armor on and his weathereye out and fight these lions  the haughty hogginarmo laid down his operaglass and looked scowling round at the king and his attendants touch me not dogs he said or by st nicholas the elder i will gore you your majesty thinks hogginarmo is afraid no not of a hundred thousand lions follow me down into the circus king padella and match thyself against one of yon brutes thou darest not let them both come on then and opening a grating of the box he jumped lightly down into the circus                  wurra wurra wurra wurawawaw                      in about two minutes                    the count hogginarmo was                           gobbled up                               by                          those lions                      bones boots and all                              and                          there was an                           end of him  at this the king said serve him right the rebellious ruffian and now as those lions wont eat that young woman  let her offlet her off cried the crowd  no roared the king let the beefeaters go down and chop her into small pieces if the lions defend her let the archers shoot them to death that hussy shall die in tortures  aaah cried the crowd shame shame  who dares cry out shame cried the furious potentate so little can tyrants command their passions fling any scoundrel who says a word down among the lions i warrant you there was a dead silence then which was broken by a pang arang pang pangkarangpang and a knight and a herald rode in at the further end of the circus the knight in full armor with his vizor up and bearing a letter on the point of his lance  ha exclaimed the king by my fay tis elephant and castle pursuivant of my brother of paflagonia and the knight an my memory serves me is the gallant captain hedzoff what news from paflagonia gallant hedzoff elephant and castle beshrew me thy trumpeting must have made thee thirsty what will my trusty herald like to drink  bespeaking first safe conduct from your lordship said captain hedzoff before we take a drink of anything permit us to deliver our kings message  my lordship ha said crim tartary frowning terrifically that title soundeth strange in the anointed ears of a crowned king straightway speak out your message knight and herald  reining up his charger in a most elegant manner close under the kings balcony hedzoff turned to the herald and bade him begin  elephant and castle dropping his trumpet over his shoulder took a large sheet of paper out of his hat and began to read  o yes o yes o yes know all men by these presents that we giglio king of paflagonia grand duke of cappadocia sovereign prince of turkey and the sausage islands having assumed our rightful throne and title long time falsely borne by our usurping uncle styling himself king of paflagonia  ha growled padella  hereby summon the false traitor padella calling himself king of crim tartary  the kings curses were dreadful go on elephant and castle said the intrepid hedzoff  to release from cowardly imprisonment his liege lady and rightful sovereign rosalba queen of crim tartary and restore her to her royal throne in default of which i giglio proclaim the said padella sneak traitor humbug usurper and coward i challenge him to meet me with fists or with pistols with battleaxe or sword with blunderbuss or singlestick alone or at the head of his army on foot or on horseback and will prove my words upon his wicked ugly body  god save the king said captain hedzoff executing a demivolte two semilunes and three caracols  is that all said padella with the terrific calm of concentrated fury  that sir is all my royal masters message here is his majestys letter in autograph and here is his glove and if any gentleman of crim tartary chooses to find fault with his majestys expressions i kustasoff hedzoff captain of the guard am very much at his service and he waved his lance and looked at the assembly all round  and what says my good brother of paflagonia my dear sons fatherinlaw to this rubbish asked the king  the kings uncle hath been deprived of the crown he unjustly wore said hedzoff gravely he and his exminister glumboso are now in prison waiting the sentence of my royal master after the battle of bombardaro  of what asked the surprised padella  of bombardaro where my liege his present majesty would have performed prodigies of valor but that the whole of his uncles army came over to our side with the exception of prince bulbo  ah my boy my boy my bulbo was no traitor cried padella  prince bulbo far from coming over to us ran away sir but i caught him the prince is a prisoner in our army and the most terrific tortures await him if a hair of the princess rosalbas head is injured  do they exclaimed the furious padella who was now perfectly livid with rage do they indeed so much the worse for bulbo ive twenty sons as lovely each as bulbo not one but is as fit to reign as bulbo whip whack flog starve rack punish torture bulbobreak all his bonesroast him or flay him alivepull all his pretty teeth out one by one but justly dear as bulbo is to mejoy of my eyes fond treasure of my soulha ha ha ha revenge is dearer still ho tortures rackmen executionerslight up the fires and make the pincers hot get lots of boiling leadbring out rosalba   xvi how hedzoff rode back again to king giglio   captain hedzoff rode away when king padella uttered this cruel command having done his duty in delivering the message with which his royal master had entrusted him of course he was very sorry for rosalba but what could he do  so he returned to king giglios camp and found the young monarch in a disturbed state of mind smoking cigars in the royal tent his majestys agitation was not appeased by the news that was brought by his ambassador the brutal ruthless ruffian royal wretch giglio exclaimed as englands poesy has well remarked the man that lays his hand upon a woman save in the way of kindness is a villain ha hedzoff  that he is your majesty said the attendant  and didst thou see her flung into the oil and didnt the soothing oilthe emollient oil refuse to boil good hedzoffand to spoil the fairest lady ever eyes did look on  faith good my liege i had no heart to look and see a beauteous lady boiling down i took your royal message to padella and bore his back to you i told him you would hold prince bulbo answerable he only said that he had twenty sons as good as bulbo and forthwith he bade the ruthless executioners proceed  o cruel fathero unhappy son cried the king go some of you and bring prince bulbo hither  bulbo was brought in chains looking very uncomfortable though a prisoner he had been tolerably happy perhaps because his mind was at rest and all the fighting was over and he was playing at marbles with his guards when the king sent for him  oh my poor bulbo said his majesty with looks of infinite compassion hast thou heard the news for you see giglio wanted to break the thing gently to the prince thy brutal father has condemned rosalbappput her to death pppprince bulbo  what killed betsinda boohoohoo cried out bulbo betsinda pretty betsinda dear betsinda she was the dearest little girl in the world i love her better twenty thousand times even than angelica and he went on expressing his grief in so hearty and unaffected a manner that the king was quite touched by it and said shaking bulbos hand that he wished he had known bulbo sooner  bulbo quite unconsciously and meaning for the best offered to come and sit with his majesty and smoke a cigar with him and console him the royal kindness supplied bulbo with a cigar he had not had one he said since he was taken prisoner  and now think what must have been the feelings of the most merciful of monarchs when he informed his prisoner that in consequence of king padellas cruel and dastardly behavior to rosalba prince bulbo must instantly be executed the noble giglio could not restrain his tears nor could the grenadiers nor the officers nor could bulbo himself when the matter was explained to him and he was brought to understand that his majestys promise of course was above everything and bulbo must submit so poor bulbo was led out hedzoff trying to console him by pointing out that if he had won the battle of bombardaro he might have hanged prince giglio yes but that is no comfort to me now said poor bulbo nor indeed was it poor fellow  he was told the business would be done the next morning at eight and was taken back to his dungeon where every attention was paid to him the gaolers wife sent him tea and the turnkeys daughter begged him to write his name in her album where a many gentlemen had written it on like occasions bother your album says bulbo the undertaker came and measured him for the handsomest coffin which money could buy even this didnt console bulbo the cook brought him dishes which he once used to like but he wouldnt touch them he sat down and began writing an adieu to angelica as the clock kept always ticking and the hands drawing nearer to next morning the barber came in at night and offered to shave him for the next day prince bulbo kicked him away and went on writing a few words to princess angelica as the clock kept always ticking and the hands hopping nearer and nearer to next morning he got up on the top of a hatbox on the top of a chair on the top of his bed on the top of his table and looked out to see whether he might escape as the clock kept always ticking and the hands drawing nearer and nearer and nearer  but looking out of the window was one thing and jumping another and the town clock struck seven so he got into bed for a little sleep but the gaoler came and woke him and said git up your royal ighness if you please its ten minutes to eight  so poor bulbo got up he had gone to bed in his clothes the lazy boy and he shook himself and said he didnt mind about dressing or having any breakfast thank you and he saw the soldiers who had come for him lead on he said and they led the way deeply affected and they came into the courtyard and out into the square and there was king giglio come to take leave of him and his majesty most kindly shook hands with him and the gloomy procession marched onwhen hark  hawwurrawwurrawaworr  a roar of wild beasts was heard and who should come riding into the town frightening away the boys and even the beadle and policeman but rosalba  the fact is that when captain hedzoff entered into the court of snapdragon castle and was discoursing with king padella the lions made a dash at the open gate gobbled up the six beefeaters in a jiffy and away they went with rosalba on the back of one of them and they carried her turn and turn about till they came to the city where prince giglios army was encamped  when the king heard of the queens arrival you may think how he rushed out of his breakfastroom to hand her majesty off her lion the lions were grown as fat as pigs now having had hogginarmo and all those beefeaters and were so tame anybody might pat them  while giglio knelt most gracefully and helped the princess bulbo for his part rushed up and kissed the lion he flung his arms round the forest monarch he hugged him and laughed and cried for joy oh you darling old beastoh how glad i am to see you and the dear dear betsthat is rosalba  what is it you poor bulbo said the queen oh how glad i am to see you and she gave him her hand to kiss king giglio slapped him most kindly on the back and said bulbo my boy i am delighted for your sake that her majesty has arrived  so am i said bulbo and you know why captain hedzoff here came up sire it is halfpast eight shall we proceed with the execution  execution what for asked bulbo  an officer only knows his orders replied captain hedzoff showing his warrant on which his majesty king giglio smilingly said prince bulbo was reprieved this time and most graciously invited him to breakfast   xvii how a tremendous battle took place and who won it   as soon as king padella heardwhat we know alreadythat his victim the lovely rosalba had escaped him his majestys fury knew no bounds and he pitched the lord chancellor lord chamberlain and every officer of the crown whom he could set eyes on into the cauldron of boiling oil prepared for the princess then he ordered out his whole army horse foot and artillery and set forth at the head of an innumerable host and i should think twenty thousand drummers trumpeters and fifers  king giglios advance guard you may be sure kept that monarch acquainted with the enemys dealings and he was in nowise disconcerted he was much too polite to alarm the princess his lovely guest with any unnecessary rumors of battles impending on the contrary he did everything to amuse and divert her gave her a most elegant breakfast dinner lunch and got up a ball for her that evening when he danced with her every single dance  poor bulbo was taken into favor again and allowed to go quite free now he had new clothes given him was called my good cousin by his majesty and was treated with the greatest distinction by everybody but it was easy to see he was very melancholy the fact is the sight of betsinda who looked perfectly lovely in an elegant new dress set poor bulbo frantic in love with her again and he never thought about angelica now princess bulbo whom he had left at home and who as we know did not care much about him  the king dancing the twentyfifth polka with rosalba remarked with wonder the ring she wore and then rosalba told him how she had got it from gruffanuff who no doubt had picked it up when angelica flung it away  yes says the fairy blackstick who had come to see the young people and who had very likely certain plans regarding themthat ring i gave the queen giglios mother who was not saving your presence a very wise woman it is enchanted and whoever wears it looks beautiful in the eyes of the world i made poor prince bulbo when he was christened the present of a rose which made him look handsome while he had it but he gave it to angelica who instantly looked beautiful again whilst bulbo relapsed into his natural plainness  rosalba needs no ring i am sure says giglio with a low bow she is beautiful enough in my eyes without any enchanted aid  oh sir said rosalba  take off the ring and try said the king and resolutely drew the ring off her finger in his eyes she looked just as handsome as before  the king was thinking of throwing the ring away as it was so dangerous and made all the people so mad about rosalba but being a prince of great humor and good humor too he cast eyes upon a poor youth who happened to be looking on very disconsolately and said  bulbo my poor lad come and try on this ring the princess rosalba makes it a present to you the magic properties of this ring were uncommonly strong for no sooner had bulbo put it on but lo and behold he appeared a personable agreeable young prince enoughwith a fine complexion fair hair rather stout and with bandy legs but these were encased in such a beautiful pair of yellow morocco boots that nobody remarked them and bulbos spirits rose up almost immediately after he had looked in the glass and he talked to their majesties in the most lively agreeable manner and danced opposite the queen with one of the prettiest maids of honor and after looking at her majesty could not help saying how very odd she is very pretty but not so extraordinarily handsome oh no by no means says the maid of honor  but what care i dear sir says the queen who overheard them if you think i am goodlooking enough  his majestys glance in reply to this affectionate speech was such that no painter could draw it and the fairy blackstick said bless you my darling children now you are united and happy and now you see what i said from the first that a little misfortune has done you both good you giglio had you been bred in prosperity would scarcely have learned to read or writeyou would have been idle and extravagant and could not have been a good king as now you will be you rosalba would have been so flattered that your little head might have been turned like angelicas who thought herself too good for giglio  as if anybody could be good enough for him cried rosalba  oh you you darling says giglio and so she was and he was just holding out his arms in order to give her a hug before the whole company when a messenger came rushing in and said my lord the enemy  to arms cries giglio  oh mercy says rosalba and fainted of course he snatched one kiss from her lips and rushed forth to the field of battle   the fairy had provided king giglio with a suit of armor which was not only embroidered all over with jewels and blinding to your eyes to look at but was waterproof gunproof and swordproof so that in the midst of the very hottest battles his majesty rode about as calmly as if he had been a british grenadier at alma were i engaged in fighting for my country i should like such a suit of armor as prince giglio wore but you know he was a prince of a fairy tale and they always have these wonderful things  besides the fairy armor the prince had a fairy horse which would gallop at any pace you pleased and a fairy sword which would lengthen and run through a whole regiment of enemies at once with such a weapon at command i wonder for my part he thought of ordering his army out but forth they all came in magnificent new uniforms hedzoff and the princes two college friends each commanding a division and his majesty prancing in person at the head of them all  ah if i had the pen of a sir archibald alison my dear friends would i not now entertain you with the account of a most tremendous shindy should not fine blows be struck dreadful wounds be delivered arrows darken the air cannon balls crash through the battalions cavalry charge infantry infantry pitch into cavalry bugles blow drums beat horses neigh fifes sing soldiers roar swear hurray officers shout out forward my men this way lads give it em boys fight for king giglio and the cause of right king padella for ever would i not describe all this i say and in the very finest language too but this humble pen does not possess the skill necessary for the description of combats in a word the overthrow of king padellas army was so complete that if they had been russians you could not have wished them to be more utterly smashed and confounded  as for that usurping monarch having performed acts of valor much more considerable than could be expected of a royal ruffian and usurper who had such a bad cause and who was so cruel to womenas for king padella i say when his army ran away the king ran away too kicking his first general prince punchikoff from his saddle and galloping away on the princes horse having indeed had twentyfive or twentysix of his own shot under him hedzoff coming up and finding punchikoff down as you may imagine very speedily disposed of him meanwhile king padella was scampering off as hard as his horse could lay legs to ground fast as he scampered i promise you somebody else galloped faster and that individual as no doubt you are aware was the royal giglio who kept bawling out stay traitor turn miscreant and defend thyself stand tyrant coward ruffian royal wretch till i cut thy ugly head from thy usurping shoulders and with his fairy sword which elongated itself at will his majesty kept poking and prodding padella in the back until that wicked monarch roared with anguish  when he was fairly brought to bay padella turned and dealt prince giglio a prodigious crack over the sconce with his battleaxe a most enormous weapon which had cut down i dont know how many regiments in the course of the afternoon but law bless you though the blow fell right down on his majestys helmet it made no more impression than if padella had struck him with a pat of butter his battleaxe crumpled up in padellas hand and the royal giglio laughed for very scorn at the impotent efforts of that atrocious usurper  at the ill success of his blow the crim tartar monarch was justly irritated if says he to giglio you ride a fairy horse and wear fairy armor what on earth is the use of my hitting you i may as well give myself up a prisoner at once your majesty wont i suppose be so mean as to strike a poor fellow who cant strike again  the justice of padellas remark struck the magnanimous giglio do you yield yourself a prisoner padella says he  of course i do says padella  do you acknowledge rosalba as your rightful queen and give up the crown and all your treasures to your rightful mistress  if i must i must says padella who was naturally very sulky  by this time king giglios aidesdecamp had come up whom his majesty ordered to bind the prisoner and they tied his hands behind him and bound his legs tight under his horse having set him with his face to the tail and in this fashion he was led back to king giglios quarters and thrust into the very dungeon where young bulbo had been confined  padella who was a very different person in the depth of his distress to padella the proud wearer of the crim tartar crown now most affectionately and earnestly asked to see his sonhis dear eldest boyhis darling bulbo and that goodnatured young man never once reproached his haughty parent for his unkind conduct the day before when he would have left bulbo to be shot without any pity but came to see his father and spoke to him through the grating of the door beyond which he was not allowed to go and brought him some sandwiches from the grand supper which his majesty was giving above stairs in honor of the brilliant victory which had just been achieved  i cannot stay with you long sir says bulbo who was in his best ball dress as he handed his father in the prog i am engaged to dance the next quadrille with her majesty queen rosalba and i hear the fiddles playing at this very moment  so bulbo went back to the ballroom and the wretched padella ate his solitary supper in silence and tears   all was now joy in king giglios circle dancing feasting fun illuminations and jollifications of all sorts ensued the people through whose villages they passed were ordered to illuminate their cottages at night and scatter flowers on the roads during the day they were requestedand i promise you they did not like to refuseto serve the troops liberally with eatables and wine besides the army was enriched by the immense quantity of plunder which was found in king padellas camp and taken from his soldiers who after they had given up everything were allowed to fraternize with the conquerors and the united forces marched back by easy stages towards king giglios capital his royal banner and that of queen rosalba being carried in front of the troops hedzoff was made a duke and a field marshal smith and jones were promoted to be earls the crim tartar order of the pumpkin and the paflagonian decoration of the cucumber were freely distributed by their majesties to the army queen rosalba wore the paflagonian ribbon of the cucumber across her ridinghabit whilst king giglio never appeared without the grand cordon of the pumpkin how the people cheered them as they rode along side by side they were pronounced to be the handsomest couple ever seen that was a matter of course but they really were very handsome and had they been otherwise would have looked so they were so happy their majesties were never separated during the whole day but breakfasted dined and supped together always and rode side by side interchanging elegant compliments and indulging in the most delightful conversation at night her majestys ladies of honor who had all rallied round her the day after king padellas defeat came and conducted her to the apartments prepared for her whilst king giglio surrounded by his gentlemen withdrew to his own royal quarters it was agreed they should be married as soon as they reached the capital and orders were dispatched to the archbishop of blombodinga to hold himself in readiness to perform the interesting ceremony duke hedzoff carried the message and gave instructions to have the royal castle splendidly refurnished and painted afresh the duke seized glumboso the exprime minister and made him refund that considerable sum of money which the old scoundrel had secreted out of the late kings treasure he also clapped valoroso into prison who by the way had been dethroned for some considerable period past and when the exmonarch weakly remonstrated hedzoff said a soldier sir knows but his duty my orders are to lock you up along with the exking padella whom i have brought hither a prisoner under guard so these two exroyal personages were sent for a year to the house of correction and thereafter were obliged to become monks of the severest order of flagellants in which state by fasting by vigils by flogging which they administered to one another humbly but resolutely no doubt they exhibited a repentance for their past misdeeds usurpations and private and public crimes  as for glumboso that rogue was sent to the galleys and never had an opportunity to steal any more   xviii how they all journeyed back to the capital   the fairy blackstick by whose means this young king and queen had certainly won their respective crowns back would come not unfrequently to pay them a little visitas they were riding in their triumphal progress towards giglios capitalchange her wand into a pony and travel by their majesties side giving them the very best advice i am not sure that king giglio did not think the fairy and her advice rather a bore fancying it was his own valor and merits which had put him on his throne and conquered padella and in fine i fear he rather gave himself airs towards his best friend and patroness she exhorted him to deal justly by his subjects to draw mildly on the taxes never to break his promise when he had once given itand in all respects to be a good king  a good king my dear fairy cries rosalba of course he will break his promise can you fancy my giglio would ever do anything so improper so unlike him no never and she looked fondly towards giglio whom she thought a pattern of perfection  why is fairy blackstick always advising me and telling me how to manage my government and warning me to keep my word does she suppose that i am not a man of sense and a man of honor asks giglio testily methinks she rather presumes upon her position  hush dear giglio says rosalba you know blackstick has been very kind to us and we must not offend her but the fairy was not listening to giglios testy observations she had fallen back and was trotting on her pony now by master bulbos side who rode a donkey and made himself generally beloved in the army by his cheerfulness kindness and goodhumor to everybody he was eager to see his darling angelica he thought there never was such a charming being blackstick did not tell him it was the possession of the magic rose that made angelica so lovely in his eyes she brought him the very best accounts of his little wife whose misfortunes and humiliations had indeed very greatly improved her and you see she could whisk off on her wand a hundred miles in a minute and be back in no time and so carry polite messages from bulbo to angelica and from angelica to bulbo and comfort that young man upon his journey  when the royal party arrived at the last stage before you reach blombodinga who should be in waiting in her carriage there with her lady of honor by her side but the princess angelica she rushed into her husbands arms scarcely stopping to make a passing curtsey to the king and queen she had no eyes but for bulbo who appeared perfectly lovely to her on account of the fairy ring which he wore whilst she herself wearing the magic rose in her bonnet seemed entirely beautiful to the enraptured bulbo  a splendid luncheon was served to the royal party of which the archbishop the chancellor duke hedzoff countess gruffanuff and all our friends partook the fairy blackstick being seated on the left of king giglio with bulbo and angelica beside her you could hear the joybells ringing in the capital and the guns which the citizens were firing off in honor of their majesties  what can have induced that hideous old gruffanuff to dress herself up in such an absurd way did you ask her to be your bridesmaid my dear says giglio to rosalba what a figure of fun gruffy is  gruffy was seated opposite their majesties between the archbishop and the lord chancellor and a figure of fun she certainly was for she was dressed in a low white silk dress with lace over a wreath of white roses on her wig a splendid lace veil and her yellow old neck was covered with diamonds she ogled the king in such a manner that his majesty burst out laughing  eleven oclock cries giglio as the great cathedral bell of blombodinga tolled that hour gentlemen and ladies we must be starting archbishop you must be at church i think before twelve  we must be at church before twelve sighs out gruffanuff in a languishing voice hiding her old face behind her fan  and then i shall be the happiest man in my dominions cries giglio with an elegant bow to the blushing rosalba  oh my giglio oh my dear majesty exclaims gruffanuff and can it be that this happy moment at length has arrived  of course it has arrived says the king  and that i am about to become the enraptured bride of my adored giglio continues gruffanuff lend me a smellingbottle somebody i certainly shall faint with joy  you my bride roars out giglio  you marry my prince cried poor little rosalba  pooh nonsense the womans mad exclaims the king and all the courtiers exhibited by their countenances and expressions marks of surprise or ridicule or incredulity or wonder  i should like to know who else is going to be married if i am not shrieks out gruffanuff i should like to know if king giglio is a gentleman and if there is such a thing as justice in paflagonia lord chancellor my lord archbishop will your lordships sit by and see a poor fond confiding tender creature put upon has not prince giglio promised to marry his barbara is not this giglios signature does not this paper declare that he is mine and only mine and she handed to his grace the archbishop the document which the prince signed that evening when she wore the magic ring and giglio drank so much champagne and the old archbishop taking out his eyeglasses readthis is to give notice that i giglio only son of savio king of paflagonia hereby promise to marry the charming barbara griselda countess gruffanuff and widow of the late jenkins gruffanuff esq  hm says the archbishop the document is certainly aa document  phoo says the lord chancellor the signature is not in his majestys handwriting indeed since his studies at bosforo giglio had made an immense improvement in caligraphy  is it your handwriting giglio cries the fairy blackstick with an awful severity of countenance  yyyes poor giglio gasps out i had quite forgotten the confounded paper she cant mean to hold me by it you old wretch what will you take to let me off help the queen some oneher majesty has fainted  chop her head off  exclaim the impetuous hedzoff  smother the old witch  the ardent smith and the  pitch her into the river faithful jones  but gruffanuff flung her arms round the archbishops neck and bellowed out justice justice my lord chancellor so loudly that her piercing shrieks caused everybody to pause as for rosalba she was borne away lifeless by her ladies and you may imagine the look of agony which giglio cast towards that lovely being as his hope his joy his darling his all in all was thus removed and in her place the horrid old gruffanuff rushed up to his side and once more shrieked out justice justice  wont you take that sum of money which glumboso hid says giglio two hundred and eighteen thousand millions or thereabouts its a handsome sum  i will have that and you too says gruffanuff  let us throw the crown jewels into the bargain gasps out giglio  i will wear them by my giglios side says gruffanuff  will half threequarters fivesixths nineteentwentieths of my kingdom do countess asks the trembling monarch  what were all europe to me without you my giglio cries gruff kissing his hand  i wont i cant i shantill resign the crown first shouts giglio tearing away his hand but gruff clung to it  i have a competency my love she says and with thee and a cottage thy barbara will be happy  giglio was half mad with rage by this time i will not marry her says he oh fairy fairy give me counsel and as he spoke he looked wildly round at the severe face of the fairy blackstick  why is fairy blackstick always advising me and warning me to keep my word does she suppose that i am not a man of honor said the fairy quoting giglios own haughty words he quailed under the brightness of her eyes he felt that there was no escape for him from that awful inquisition  well archbishop said he in a dreadful voice that made his grace start since this fairy has led me to the height of happiness but to dash me down into the depths of despair since i am to lose rosalba let me at least keep my honor get up countess and let us be married i can keep my word but i can die afterwards  oh dear giglio cries gruffanuff skipping up i knew i knew i could trust theei knew that my prince was the soul of honor jump into your carriages ladies and gentlemen and let us go to church at once and as for dying dear giglio no nothou wilt forget that insignificant little chambermaid of a queenthou wilt live to be consoled by thy barbara she wishes to be a queen and not a queen dowager my gracious lord and hanging upon poor giglios arm and leering and grinning in his face in the most disgusting manner this old wretch tripped off in her white satin shoes and jumped into the very carriage which had been got ready to convey giglio and rosalba to church the cannons roared again the bells pealed triplebobmajors the people came out flinging flowers upon the path of the royal bride and bridegroom and gruff looked out of the gilt coach window and bowed and grinned to them phoo the horrid old wretch   xix and now we come to the last scene in the pantomime   the many ups and downs of her life had given the princess rosalba prodigious strength of mind and that highly principled young woman presently recovered from her faintingfit out of which fairy blackstick by a precious essence which the fairy always carried in her pocket awakened her instead of tearing her hair crying and bemoaning herself and fainting again as many young women would have done rosalba remembered that she owed an example of firmness to her subjects and though she loved giglio more than her life was determined as she told the fairy not to interfere between him and justice or to cause him to break his royal word  i cannot marry him but i shall love him always says she to blackstick i will go and be present at his marriage with the countess and sign the book and wish them happy with all my heart i will see when i get home whether i cannot make the new queen some handsome presents the crim tartary crown diamonds are uncommonly fine and i shall never have any use for them i will live and die unmarried like queen elizabeth and of course i shall leave my crown to giglio when i quit this world let us go and see them married my dear fairy let me say one last farewell to him and then if you please i will return to my own dominions  so the fairy kissed rosalba with peculiar tenderness and at once changed her wand into a very comfortable coachandfour with a steady coachman and two respectable footmen behind and the fairy and rosalba got into the coach which angelica and bulbo entered after them as for honest bulbo he was blubbering in the most pathetic manner quite overcome by rosalbas misfortune she was touched by the honest fellows sympathy promised to restore to him the confiscated estates of duke padella his father and created him as he sat there in the coach prince highness and first grandee of the crim tartar empire the coach moved on and being a fairy coach soon came up with the bridal procession  before the ceremony at church it was the custom in paflagonia as it is in other countries for the bride and bridegroom to sign the contract of marriage which was to be witnessed by the chancellor minister lord mayor and principal officers of state now as the royal palace was being painted and furnished anew it was not ready for the reception of the king and his bride who proposed at first to take up their residence at the princes palace that one which valoroso occupied when angelica was born and before he usurped the throne  so the marriage party drove up to the palace the dignitaries got out of their carriages and stood aside poor rosalba stepped out of her coach supported by bulbo and stood almost fainting up against the railings so as to have a last look of her dear giglio as for blackstick she according to her custom had flown out of the coach window in some inscrutable manner and was now standing at the palace door  giglio came up the steps with his horrible bride on his arm looking as pale as if he was going to execution he only frowned at the fairy blackstickhe was angry with her and thought she came to insult his misery  get out of the way pray says gruffanuff haughtily i wonder why you are always poking your nose into other peoples affairs  are you determined to make this poor young man unhappy says blackstick  to marry him yes what business is it of yours pray madam dont say you to a queen cries gruffanuff  you wont take the money he offered you  no  you wont let him off his bargain though you know you cheated him when you made him sign the paper  impudence policemen remove this woman cries gruffanuff and the policemen were rushing forward but with a wave of her wand the fairy struck them all like so many statues in their places  you wont take anything in exchange for your bond mrs gruffanuff cries the fairy with awful severity i speak for the last time  no shrieks gruffanuff stamping with her foot ill have my husband my husband my husband  you shall have your husband the fairy blackstick cried and advancing a step laid her hand upon the nose of the knocker   as she touched it the brass nose seemed to elongate the open mouth opened still wider and uttered a roar which made everybody start the eyes rolled wildly the arms and legs uncurled themselves writhed about and seemed to lengthen with each twist the knocker expanded into a figure in yellow livery six feet high the screws by which it was fixed to the door unloosed themselves and jenkins gruffanuff once more trod the threshold off which he had been lifted more than twenty years ago  masters not at home says jenkins just in his old voice and mrs jenkins giving a dreadful youp fell down in a fit in which nobody minded her  for everybody was shouting huzzay huzzay hip hip hurray long live the king and queen were such things ever seen no never never never the fairy blackstick for ever  the bells were ringing double peals the guns roaring and banging most prodigiously bulbo was embracing everybody the lord chancellor was flinging up his wig and shouting like a madman hedzoff had got the archbishop round the waist and they were dancing a jig for joy and as for giglio i leave you to imagine what he was doing and if he kissed rosalba once twicetwenty thousand times im sure i dont think he was wrong  so gruffanuff opened the hall door with a low bow just as he had been accustomed to do and they all went in and signed the book and then they went to church and were married and the fairy blackstick sailed away on her cane and was never more heard of in paflagonia
