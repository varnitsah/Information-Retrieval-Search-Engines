15482281	the life of cesare borgia  of france duke of valentinois and romagna prince of andria and venafri count of dyois lord of piombino camerino and urbino gonfalonier and captaingeneral of holy church  a history and some criticisms   by raphael sabatini     preface  this is no chronicle of saints nor yet is it a history of devils it is a record of certain very human strenuous men in a very human strenuous age a lustful flamboyant age an age red with blood and pale with passion at whiteheat an age of steel and velvet of vivid colour dazzling light and impenetrable shadow an age of swift movement pitiless violence and high endeavour of sharp antitheses and amazing contrasts  to judge it from the standpoint of this calm deliberate and correct centuryas we conceive our own to beis for sedate middleage to judge from its own standpoint the reckless hot passionate lustful humours of youth of youth that errs grievously and achieves greatly  so to judge that epoch collectively is manifestly wrong a hopeless procedure if it be our aim to understand it and to be in sympathy with it as it becomes broadminded age to be tolerantly in sympathy with the youth whose follies it perceives life is an ephemeral business and we waste too much of it in judging where it would beseem us better to accept that we ourselves may come to be accepted by such future ages as may pursue the study of us  but if it be wrong to judge a past epoch collectively by the standards of our own time how much more is it not wrong to single out individuals for judgement by those same standards after detaching them for the purpose from the environment in which they had their being how false must be the conception of them thus obtained we view the individuals so selected through a microscope of modern focus they appear monstrous and abnormal and we straightway assume them to be monsters and abnormalities never considering that the fault is in the adjustment of the instrument through which we inspect them and that until that is corrected others of that same past age if similarly viewed must appear similarly distorted  hence it follows that some study of an age must ever prelude and accompany the study of its individuals if comprehension is to wait upon our labours to proceed otherwise is to judge an individual hottentot or south sea islander by the code of manners that obtains in belgravia or mayfair  mind being the seat of the soul and literature being the expression of the mind literature it follows is the soul of an age the surviving and immortal part of it and in the literature of the cinquecento you shall behold for the looking the ardent unmoral naïve soul of this renaissance that was sprawling in its lusty naked infancy and bellowing hungrily for the pap of knowledge and for other things you shall infer something of the passionate mettle of this infant his tempestuous mirth his fierce rages his simplicity his naïveté his inquisitiveness his cunning his deceit his cruelty his love of sunshine and bright gewgaws  to realize him as he was you need but to bethink you that this was the age in which the decamerone of giovanni boccaccio the facetiae of poggio the satires of filelfo and the hermaphroditus of panormitano afforded readingmatter to both sexes this was the age in which the learned and erudite lorenzo vallaof whom more anonwrote his famous indictment of virginity condemning it as against nature with arguments of a most insidious logic this was the age in which casa archbishop of benevento wrote a most singular work of erotic philosophy which coming from a churchmans pen will leave you cold with horror should you chance to turn its pages this was the age of the discovery of man the pagan age which stripped christ of his divinity to bestow it upon plato so that marsilio ficino actually burnt an altarlamp before an image of the greek by whose teachingsin common with so many scholars of his dayhe sought to inform himself  it was an age that had become unable to discriminate between the merits of the saints of the church and the harlots of the town therefore it honoured both alike extolled the carnal merits of the one in much the same terms as were employed to extol the spiritual merits of the other thus when a famous roman courtesan departed this life in the year 1511 at the early age of twentysix she was accorded a splendid funeral and an imposing tomb in the chapel santa gregoria with a tablet bearing the following inscription  imperia cortisana romana quae digna tanto nomine rarae inter mortales formae specimen dedit  it was in short an age so universally immoral as scarcely to be termed immoral since immorality may be defined as a departure from the morals that obtain a given time and in a given place so that whilst from our own standpoint the cinquecento taken collectively is an age of grossest licence and immorality from the standpoint of the cinquecento itself few of its individuals might with justice be branded immoral  for the rest it was an epoch of reaction from the age of chivalry an epoch of unbounded luxury of the cult and worship of the beautiful externally an epoch that set no store by any inward virtue by truth or honour an epoch that laid it down as a maxim that no inconvenient engagement should be kept if opportunity offered to evade it  the history of the cinquecento is a history developed in broken pledges trusts dishonoured and basest treacheries as you shall come to conclude before you have read far in the story that is here to be set down  in a profligate age what can you look for but profligates is it just is it reasonable or is it even honest to take a man or a family from such an environment for judgement by the canons of a later epoch yet is it not the method that has been most frequently adopted in dealing with the vast subject of the borgias  to avoid the dangers that must wait upon that error the history of that house shall here be taken up with the elevation of calixtus iii to the papal throne and the reign of the four popes immediately preceding roderigo borgiawho reigned as alexander vishall briefly be surveyed that a standard may be set by which to judge the man and the family that form the real subject of this work  the history of this amazing pope alexander is yet to be written no attempt has been made to exhaust it here yet of necessity he bulks large in these pages for the history of his dazzling meteoric son is so closely interwoven with his own that it is impossible to present the one without dealing at considerable length with the other  the sources from which the history of the house of borgia has been culled are not to be examined in a preface they are too numerous and they require too minute and individual a consideration that their precise value and degree of credibility may be ascertained abundantly shall such examination be made in the course of this history and in a measure as the need arises to cite evidence for one side or for the other shall that evidence be sifted  never perhaps has anything more true been written of the borgias and their history than the matter contained in the following lines of rawdon brown in his ragguagli sulla vita e sulle opere di marino sanuto it seems to me that history has made use of the house of borgia as of a canvas upon which to depict the turpitudes of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries  materials for the work were very ready to the hand and although they do not signally differ from the materials out of which the histories of half a dozen popes of the same epoch might be compiled they are far more abundant in the case of the borgia pope for the excellent reason that the borgia pope detaches from the background of the renaissance far more than any of his compeers by virtue of his importance as a political force  in this was reason to spare for his being libelled and lampooned even beyond the usual extravagant wont slanders concerning him and his son cesare were readily circulated and they will generally be found to spring from those states which had most cause for jealousy and resentment of the borgia mightvenice florence and milan amongst others  no rancour is so bitter as political rancoursave perhaps religious rancour which we shall also trace no warfare more unscrupulous or more prone to use the insidious weapons of slander than political warfare of this such striking instances abound in our own time that there can scarce be the need to labour the point and from the form taken by such slanders as are circulated in our own sedate and moderate epoch may be conceived what might be said by political opponents in a fierce age that knew no pudency and no restraint all this in its proper place shall be more closely examined  for many of the charges brought against the house of borgia some testimony exists for many othersand these are the more lurid sensational and appalling covering as they do rape and murder adultery incest and the sin of the cities of the plainno single grain of real evidence is forthcoming indeed at this time of day evidence is no longer called for where the sins of the borgias are concerned oftreiterated assertion has usurped the place of evidencefor a lie sufficiently repeated comes to be credited by its very utterer and meanwhile the calumny has sped from tongue to tongue from pen to pen gathering matter as it goes the world absorbs the stories it devours them greedily so they be sensational and writers well aware of this have been pandering to that morbid appetite for some centuries now with this subject of the borgias a salted piquant tale of vice a ghastly story of moral turpitude and physical corruption a hairraising narrative of horrors and abominationsthese are the stockintrade of the sensationmonger with the authenticity of the matters he retails such a one has no concern se non é vero é ben trovato is his motto and in his heart the sensationmongerof whatsoever agerather hopes the thing be true he will certainly make his public so believe it for to discredit it would be to lose ninetenths of its sensational value so he trims and adjusts his wares adds a touch or two of colour and what else he accounts necessary to heighten their air of authenticity to dissemble any peeping spuriousness  a form of hypnosis accompanies your study of the subjecta suggestion that what is so positively and repeatedly stated must of necessity be true must of necessity have been proved by irrefutable evidence at some time or other so much you take for grantedfor matters which began their existence perhaps as tentative hypotheses have imperceptibly developed into established facts  occasionally it happens that we find some such sentence as the following summing up this deed or that one in the borgia histories a deal of mystery remains to be cleared up but the verdict of history assigns the guilt to cesare borgia  behold how easy it is to dispense with evidence so that your tale be wellsalted and wellspiced a fico for evidence if it hangs not overwell together in places if there be contradictions lacunae or openings for doubt fling the verdict of history into the gap and so strike any questioner into silence  so far have matters gone in this connection that who undertakes to set down today the history of cesare borgia with intent to do just and honest work must find it impossible to tell a plain and straightforward taleto present him not as a villain of melodrama not a monster ludicrous grotesque impossible but as human being a cold relentless egotist it is true using men for his own ends terrible and even treacherous in his reprisals swift as a panther and as cruel where his anger was aroused yet with certain elements of greatness a splendid soldier an unrivalled administrator a man preeminently just if merciless in that same justice  to present cesare borgia thus in a plain straightforward tale at this time of day would be to provoke the scorn and derision of those who have made his acquaintance in the pages of that eminent german scholar ferdinand gregorovius and of some other writers not quite so eminent yet eminent enough to serve serious consideration hence has it been necessary to examine at close quarters the findings of these great ones and to present certain criticisms of those same findings the author is overwhelmingly conscious of the invidious quality of that task but he is no less conscious of its inevitability if this tale is to be told at all  whilst the actual sources of historical evidence shall be examined in the course of this narrative it may be well to examine at this stage the sources of the popular conceptions of the borgias since there will be no occasion later to allude to them  without entering here into a dissertation upon the historical romance it may be said that in proper hands it has been and should continue to be one of the most valued and valuable expressions of the literary art to render and maintain it so however it is necessary that certain welldefined limits should be set upon the licence which its writers are to enjoy it is necessary that the work should be honest work that preparation for it should be made by a sound painstaking study of the period to be represented to the end that a true impression may first be formed and then conveyed thus considering how much more farreaching is the novel than any other form of literature the good results that must wait upon such endeavours are beyond question the neglect of themthe distortion of character to suit the romancers ends the like distortion of historical facts the gross anachronisms arising out of a lack of study have done much to bring the historical romance into disrepute many writers frankly make no pretenceleastways none that can be discernedof aiming at historical precision others however invest their work with a spurious scholarliness go the length of citing authorities to support the point of view which they have taken and which they lay before you as the fruit of strenuous lucubrations  these are the dangerous ones and of this type is victor hugos famous tragedy lucrezia borgia a work to which perhaps more than to any other not excepting les borgias in crimes célèbres of alexandre dumas is due the popular conception that prevails today of cesare borgias sister  it is questionable whether anything has ever flowed from a distinguished pen in which so many licences have been taken with the history of individuals and of an epoch in which there is so rich a crop of crude transpontine absurdities and flagrant impossible anachronisms victor hugo was a writer of rare gifts a fertile romancer and a great poet and it may be unjust to censure him for having taken the fullest advantages of the licences conceded to both but it would be difficult to censure him too harshly for havingin his lucrezia borgiastruck a pose of scholarliness for having pretended and maintained that his work was honest work founded upon the study of historical evidences with that piece of charlatanism he deceived the great mass of the unlettered of france and of all europe into believing that in his tragedy he presented the true lucrezia borgia  if you do not believe me he declared read tommaso tommasi read the diary of burchard  read then that diary extending over a period of twentythree years from 1483 to 1506 of the master of ceremonies of the vatican which largely contributes the groundwork of the present history and the one conclusion to which you will be forced is that victor hugo himself had never read it else he would have hesitated to bid you refer to a work which does not support a single line that he has written  as for tommaso tommasioh the danger of a little learning into what quagmires does it not lead those who flaunt it to impress you  tommasis place among historians is on precisely the same plane as alexandre dumass his vita di cesare borgia is on the same historical level as les borgias much of which it supplied like crimes célèbres tommasis book is invested with a certain air of being a narrative of sober fact but like crimes célèbres it is none the less a work of fiction  this tommaso tommasi whose real name was gregorio letiand it is under this that such works of his as are reprinted are published nowadayswas a most prolific author of the seventeenth century who having turned calvinist vented in his writings a mordacious hatred of the papacy and of the religion from which he had seceded his life of cesare borgia was published in 1670 it enjoyed a considerable vogue was translated into french and has been the chief source from which many writers of fiction and some writers of fact have drawn for subsequent work to carry forward the ceaseless defamation of the borgias  history should be as inexorable as divine justice before we admit facts not only should we call for evidence and analyse it when it is forthcoming but the very sources of such evidence should be examined that as far as possible we may ascertain what degree of credit they deserve in the study of the history of the borgias we repeat there has been too much acceptance without question too much taking for granted of matters whose incredibility frequently touches and occasionally oversteps the confines of the impossible  one man knew cesare borgia better perhaps than did any other contemporary of the many who have left more or less valuable records for the mind of that man was the acutest of its age one of the acutest italy and the world have ever known that man was niccolô macchiavelli secretary of state to the signory of florence he owed no benefits to cesare he was the ambassador of a power that was ever inimical to the borgias so that it is not to be dreamt that his judgement suffered from any bias in cesares favour yet he accounted cesare borgiaas we shall seethe incarnation of an ideal conqueror and ruler he took cesare borgia as the model for his famous work the prince written as a grammar of statecraft for the instruction in the art of government of that weakling giuliano demedici  macchiavelli pronounces upon cesare borgia the following verdict  if all the actions of the duke are taken into consideration it will be seen how great were the foundations he had laid to future power upon these i do not think it superfluous to discourse because i should not know what better precept to lay before a new prince than the example of his actions and if success did not wait upon what dispositions he had made that was through no fault of his own but the result of an extraordinary and extreme malignity of fortune  in its proper place shall be considered what else macchiavelli had to say of cesare borgia and what to report of events that he witnessed connected with cesare borgias career  meanwhile the above summary of macchiavellis judgement is put forward as a justification for the writing of this book which has for scope to present to you the cesare borgia who served as the model for the prince  before doing so however there is the rise of the house of borgia to be traced and in the first two of the four books into which this history will be divided it is alexander vi rather than his son who will hold the centre of the stage  if the author has a mercy to crave of his critics it is that they will not impute it to him that he has set out with the express aim of whitewashingas the term goesthe family of borgia to whitewash is to overlay to mask the original fabric under a superadded surface too much superadding has there been here already by your leave all shall be stripped away the grime shall be removed and the foulness of inference of surmise of deliberate and coldblooded malice with which centuries of scribblers idle fantastic sensational or venal have coated the substance of known facts  but the grime shall be preserved and analysed side by side with the actual substance that you may judge if out of zeal to remove the former any of the latter shall have been included in the scraping  the author expresses his indebtedness

borgia which gave to the church of rome two popes and at least one saint1 is to be traced back to the eleventh century claiming as it does to have its source in the kings of aragon we shall take up its history for our purposes with the birth at the city of xativa in the kingdom of valencia on december 30 1378 of alonso de borja the son of don juan domingo de borja and his wife doña francisca       1  st francisco borgia sjgreatgrandson of pope      alexander vi born at gandia in spain in 1510   to this don alonso de borja is due the rise of his family to its stupendous eminence an able upright vigorousminded man he became a professor and doctor of jurisprudence at the university of lerida and afterwards served alfonso i of aragon king of naples and the two sicilies in the capacity of secretary this office he filled with the distinction that was to be expected from one so peculiarly fitted for it by the character of the studies he had pursued  he was made bishop of valencia created cardinal in 1444 and finallyin 1455ascended the throne of st peter as calixtus iii an old man enfeebled in body but with his extraordinary vigour of mind all unimpaired  calixtus proved himself as much a nepotist as many another pope before and since this needs not to be dilated upon here suffice it that in february of 1456 he gave the scarlet hat of cardinaldeacon of san niccoló in carcere tulliano to his nephew don roderigo de lanzol y borja  born in 1431 at xativa the son of juana de borja sister of calixtus and her husband don jofrè de lanzol roderigo was in his twentyfifth year at the time of his being raised to the purple and in the following year he was further created vicechancellor of holy church with an annual stipend of eight thousand florins like his uncle he had studied jurisprudenceat the university of bolognaand mentally and physically he was extraordinarily endowed  from the penportraits left of him by gasparino of verona and girolamo porzio we know him for a tall handsome man with black eyes and full lips elegant courtly joyous and choicely eloquent of such health and vigour and endurance that he was insensible to any fatigue giasone maino of milan refers to his elegant appearance serene brow royal glance a countenance that at once expresses generosity and majesty and the genial and heroic air with which his whole personality is invested to a similar description of him gasparino adds that all women upon whom he so much as casts his eyes he moves to love him attracting them as the lodestone attracts iron which is it must be admitted a most undesirable reputation in a churchman  a modern historian1 who uses little restraint when writing of roderigo borgia says of him that he was a man of neither much energy nor determined will and further that the firmness and energy wanting to his character were however often replaced by the constancy of his evil passions by which he was almost blinded how the constancy of evil passions can replace firmness and energy as factors of worldly success is not readily discernible particularly if their possessor is blinded by them the historical worth of the stricture may safely be left to be measured by its logical value for the rest to say that roderigo borgia was wanting in energy and in will is to say something to which his whole career gives the loud and derisive lie as willto some extent at leastbe seen in the course of this work       1  pasquale villari in his machiavelli i suoi tempi   his honours as cardinaldeacon and vicechancellor of the holy see he owed to his uncle but that he maintained and constantly improved his positionand he a foreigner be it rememberedunder the reigns of the four succeeding popespius ii paul ii sixtus iv and innocent viiiuntil finally sixandtwenty years after the death of calixtus iii he ascended himself the papal throne can be due only to the unconquerable energy and stupendous talents which have placed him where he stands in historyone of the greatest forces for good or ill that ever occupied st peters chair  say of him that he was ambitious worldly greedy of power and a prey to carnal lusts all these he was but for very sanitys sake do not let it be said that he was wanting either in energy or in will for he was energy and will incarnate  consider that with calixtus iiis assumption of the tiara rome became the spaniards happy huntingground and that into the eternal city streamed in their hundreds the catalan adventurerspriests clerks captains of fortune and otherswho came to seek advancement at the hands of a catalan pope this spanish invasion rome resented she grew restive under it  roderigos elder brother don pedro luis de lanzol y borja was made gonfalonier of the church castellan of all pontifical fortresses and governor of the patrimony of st peter with the title of duke of spoleto and later prefect of rome to the displacement of an orsini from that office calixtus invested this nephew with all temporal power that it was in the churchs privilege to bestow to the end that he might use it as a basis to overset the petty tyrannies of romagna and to establish a feudal claim on the kingdom of naples  here already we see more than a hint of that borgia ambition which was to become a byword and the first attempt of this family to found a dynasty for itself and a state that should endure beyond the transient tenure of the pontificate an aim that was later to be carried into actualif ephemeralfulfilment by cesare borgia  the italians watched this growth of spanish power with jealous angry eyes the mighty house of orsini angered by the supplanting of one of its members in the prefecture of rome kept its resentment warm and waited when in august of 1458 calixtus iii lay dying the orsini seized the chance they incited the city to ready insurgence and with fire and sword they drove the spaniards out  don pedro luis made haste to depart contrived to avoid the orsini who had made him their special quarry and getting a boat slipped down the tiber to civita vecchia where he died suddenly some six weeks later thereby considerably increasing the wealth of roderigo his brother and his heir  roderigos cousin don luis juan cardinalpresbyter of santi quattro coronati another member of the family who owed his advancement to his uncle calixtus thought it also expedient to withdraw from that zone of danger to men of his nationality and name  roderigo de lanzol y borja alone remainedleastways the only prominent member of his houseboldly to face the enmity of the majority of the sacred college which had looked with grim disfavour upon his uncles nepotism unintimidated he entered the conclave for the election of a successor to calixtus and there the chance which so often prefers to bestow its favours upon him who knows how to profit by them gave him the opportunity to establish himself as firmly as ever at the vatican and further to advance his interests  it fell out that when the scrutiny was taken two cardinals stood well in votesthe brilliant cultured enea silvio bartolomeo de piccolomini cardinal of siena and the french cardinal destoutevillethough neither had attained the minimum majority demanded of these two the lead in number of votes lay with the cardinal of siena and his election therefore might be completed by accessionthat is by the voices of such cardinals as had not originally voted for himuntil the minimum majority which must exceed twothirds should be made up  the cardinal vicechancellor roderigo de lanzol y borja led this accession with the result that the cardinal of siena became pontiffas pius iiand was naturally enough disposed to advance the interests of the man who had been instrumental in helping him to that eminence thus his position at the vatican in the very face of all hostility became stronger and more prominent than ever  a letter written two years later from the baths at petriolo by pius ii to roderigo when the latter was in sienawhither he had been sent by his holiness to superintend the building of the cathedral and the episcopal and piccolomini palacesis frequently cited by way of establishing the young prelates dissolute ways it is a letter at once stern and affectionate and it certainly leaves no doubt as to what manner of man was the cardinal vicechancellor in his private life and to what manner of unecciesiastical pursuits he inclined it is difficult to discover in it any grounds upon which an apologist may build   beloved son  when four days ago in the gardens of giovanni de bichis were assembled several women of siena addicted to worldly vanity your worthiness as we have learnt little remembering the office which you fill was entertained by them from the seventeenth to the twentysecond hour for companion you had one of your colleagues one whom his years if not the honour of the holy see should have reminded of his duty from what we have heard dancing was unrestrainedly indulged and not one of loves attractions was absent whilst your behaviour was no different from that which might have been looked for in any worldly youth touching what happened there modesty imposes silence not only the circumstance itself but the very name of it is unworthy in one of your rank the husbands parents brothers and relations of these young women were excluded in order that your amusements should be the more unbridled you with a few servants undertook to direct and lead those dances it is said that nothing is now talked of in siena but your frivolity certain it is that here at the baths where the concourse of ecclesiastics and laity is great you are the topic of the day our displeasure is unutterable since all this reflects dishonourably upon the sacerdotal estate and office it will be said of us that we are enriched and promoted not to the end that we may lead blameless lives but that we may procure the means to indulge our pleasures hence the contempt of us entertained by temporal princes and powers and the daily sarcasms of the laity hence also the reproof of our own mode of life when we attempt to reprove others the very vicar of christ is involved in this contempt since he appears to countenance such things you beloved son have charge of the bishopric of valencia the first of spain you are also vicechancellor of the church and what renders your conduct still more blameworthy is that you are among the cardinals with the pope one of the counsellors of the holy see we submit it to your own judgement whether it becomes your dignity to court young women to send fruit and wine to her you love and to have no thought for anything but pleasure we are censured on your account the blessed memory of your uncle calixtus is vituperated since in the judgement of many he was wrong to have conferred so many honours upon you if you seek excuses in your youth you are no longer so young that you cannot understand what duties are imposed upon you by your dignity a cardinal should be irreproachable a model of moral conduct to all and what just cause have we for resentment when temporal princes bestow upon us titles that are little honourable dispute with us our possessions and attempt to bend us to their will in truth it is we who inflict these wounds upon ourselves and it is we who occasion ourselves these troubles undermining more and more each day by our deeds the authority of the church our guerdon is shame in this world and condign punishment in the next may your prudence therefore set a restraint upon these vanities and keep you mindful of your dignity and prevent that you be known for a gallant among married and unmarried women but should similar facts recur we shall be compelled to signify that they have happened against our will and to our sorrow and our censure must be attended by your shame we have always loved you and we have held you worthy of our favour as a man of upright and honest nature act therefore in such a manner that we may maintain such an opinion of you and nothing can better conduce to this than that you should lead a wellordered life your age which is such as still to promise improvement admits that we should admonish you paternally  petriolo june 11 1460   such a letter is calculated to shock us in our modern notions of a churchman to us this conduct on the part of a prelate is scandalous beyond words that it was scandalous even then is obvious from the pontiffs letter but that it was scandalous in an infinitely lesser degree is no less obvious from the very fact that the pontiff wrote that letter and in such terms instead of incontinently unfrocking the offender  in considering roderigos conduct you are to consideras has been urged alreadythe age in which he lived you are to remember that it was an age in which the passions and the emotions wore no such masks as they wear today but went naked and knew no shame of their nudity an age in which personal modesty was as little studied as hypocrisy and in which men wore their vices as openly as their virtues  no amount of simple statement can convey an adequate notion of the corrupt state of the clergy at the time to form any just appreciation of this it is necessary to take a peep at some of the documents that have survivedsuch a document for instance as that bull of this pope pius ii which forbade priests from plying the trades of keeping taverns gaminghouses and brothels  ponder also that under his successor sixtus iv the tax levied upon the courtesans of rome enriched the pontifical coffers to the extent of some 20000 ducats yearly ponder further that when the vicar of the libidinous innocent viii published in 1490 an edict against the universal concubinage practised by the clergy forbidding its continuation under pain of excommunication all that it earned him was the severe censure of the holy father who disagreed with the measure and who straightway repealed and cancelled the edict1        1  see burchards diarium thuasne edition vol ii p442      et seq   all this being considered and man being admittedly a creature of his environment can we still pretend to horror at this roderigo and at the fact that being the man he wasprelate though he might behandsome brilliant courted in the full vigour of youth and a voluptuary by nature he should have succumbed to the temptations by which he was surrounded  one factor only could have caused him to use more restraintthe good example of his peers that example he most certainly had not  virtue is a comparative estate when all is said and before we can find that roderigo was vile that he deserves unqualified condemnation for his conduct we must ascertain that he was more or less exceptional in his licence that he was less scrupulous than his fellows do we find that to find the contrary we do not need to go beyond the matter which provoked that letter from the pontiff for we see that he was not even alone as an ecclesiastic in the adventure that he had for associate on that amorous frolic one giacopo ammanati cardinalpresbyter of san crisogno roderigos senior and an ordained priest whichwithout seeking to make undue capital out of the circumstancewe may mention that roderigo was not he was a cardinaldeacon be it remembered1 we know that the very pontiff who admonished these young prelates though now admittedly a man of saintly ways had been a very pretty fellow himself in his lusty young days in siena we know that roderigos unclethe calixtus to whom pius ii refers in that letter as of blessed memoryhad at least one acknowledged son2 we know that piero and girolamo riario though styled by pope sixtus iv his nephews were generally recognized to be his sons3 and we know that the numerous bastards of innocent viiiroderigos immediate precursor on the pontifical thronewere openly acknowledged by their father we know in short that it was the universal custom of the clergy to forget its vows of celibacy and to circumvent them by dispensing with the outward form and sacrament of marriage and we have it on the word of pius ii himself that if there are good reasons for enjoining the celibacy of the clergy there are better and stronger for enjoining them to marry        1  he was not ordained priest until 1471 after the election      of sixtus iv       2  don francisco de borja born at valencia in 1441       3  macchiavelli istorie fiorentine   what more is there to say if we must be scandalized let us be scandalized by the times rather than by the man upon what reasonable grounds can we demand that he should be different from his fellows and if we find him no different what right or reason have we for picking him out and rendering him the object of unparalleled obloquy  if we are to deal justly with roderigo borgia we must admit that in so far as his concessions to his lusts are concerned he was a typical churchman of his day neither more nor lessas will presently grow abundantly clear  it may be objected by some that had such been the case the pope would not have written him such a letter as is here cited but consider a moment the close relations existing between them roderigo was the nephew of the late pope in a great measure pius ii owed his election as we have seen to roderigos action in the conclave that his interest in him apart from that was paternal and affectionate is shown in every line of that letter and consider further that roderigos companion is shown by that letter to be equally guilty in so far as the acts themselves are to be weighed guilty in a greater degree when we remember his seniority and his actual priesthood yet to cardinal ammanati the pope wrote no such admonition is not that sufficient proof that his admonition of roderigo was dictated purely by his personal affection for him  in this same year 1460 was born to cardinal roderigo a sondon pedro luis de borjaby a spinster mulier soluta unnamed this son was publicly acknowledged and cared for by the cardinal  seven years laterin 1467he became the father of a daughtergirolama de borjaby a spinster whose name again does not transpire like pedro luis she too was openly acknowledged by cardinal roderigo it was widely believed that this childs mother was madonna giovanna de catanei who soon became quite openly the cardinals mistress and was maintained by him in such state as might have become a maîtresse en titre but as we shall see later the fact of that maternity of girolama is doubtful in the extreme it was never established and it is difficult to understand why not if it were the fact  meanwhile paul iipietro barbo cardinal of venicehad succeeded pius ii in 1464 and in 1471 the latter was in his turn succeeded by the formidable sixtus ivcardinal francesco maria della roverea franciscan of the lowest origin who by his energy and talents had become general of his order and had afterwards been raised to the dignity of the purple  it was cardinal roderigo de lanzol y borja who in his official capacity of archdeacon of holy church performed the ceremony of coronation and placed the triple crown on the head of pope sixtus it is probable that this was his last official act as arch­deacon for in that same year 1471 at the age of forty he was ordained priest and consecrated bishop of albano     chapter ii the reigns of sixtus iv and innocent viii   the rule of sixtus was as vigorous as it was scandalous to sayas has been saidthat with his succession to st peters chair came for the church a still sadder time than that which had preceded it is not altogether true politically at least sixtus did much to strengthen the position of the holy see and of the pontificate he was not long in giving the roman factions a taste of his stern quality if he employed unscrupulous means he employed them against unscrupulous menon the sound principle of similia similibus curanturand to some extent they were justified by the ends in view  he found the temporal throne of the pontiffs tottering when he ascended it stefano porcaro and his distinguished following already in 1453 had attempted the overthrow of the pontifical authority inspired no doubt by the attacks that had been levelled against it by the erudite and daring lorenzo valla  this valla was the distinguished translator of homer herodotus and thucydides who more than any one of his epoch advanced the movement of greek and latin learning which whilst it had the effect of arresting the development of italian literature enriched europe by opening up to it the sources of ancient erudition of philosophy poetry and literary taste towards the year 1435 he drifted to the court of alfonso of aragon whose secretary he ultimately became some years later he attacked the temporal power and urged the secularization of the states of the church ut papa he wrote tantum vicarius christi sit et non etiam coesari in his de falso credita et ementita constantini donatione he showed that the decretals of the donation of constantine upon which rests the popes claim to the pontifical states was an impudent forgery that constantine had never had the power to give nor had given rome to the popes and that they had no right to govern there he backed up this terrible indictment by a round attack upon the clergy its general corruption and its practices of simony and as a result he fell into the hands of the inquisition there it might have gone very ill with him but that king alfonso rescued him from the clutches of that dread priestly tribunal  meanwhile he had fired his petard if a pretext had been wanting to warrant the taking up of arms against the papacy that pretext valla had afforded never was the temporal power of the church in such danger and ultimately it must inevitably have succumbed but for the coming of so strong and unscrupulous a man as sixtus iv to stamp out the patrician factions that were heading the hostile movement  his election it is generally admitted was simoniacal and by simony he raised the funds necessary for his campaign to reestablish and support the papal authority this simony of his says dr jacob burckhardt grew to unheardof proportions and extended from the appointment of cardinals down to the sale of the smallest benefice  had he employed these means of raising funds for none but the purpose of putting down the assailants of the pontificate a measure of justification political if not ecclesiastical might be argued in his favour unfortunately having discovered these ready sources of revenue he continued to exploit them for purposes far less easy to condone  as a nepotist sixtus was almost unsurpassed in the history of the papacy four of his nephews and their aggrandizement were the particular objects of his attentions and two of theseas we have already saidpiero and girolamo riario were universally recognized to be his sons  piero who was a simple friar of twentysix years of age at the time that his father became pope was given the archbishopric of florence made patriarch of constantinople and created cardinal to the title of san sisto with a revenue of 60000 crowns  we have it on the word of cardinal ammanati1the same gentleman who with roderigo de lanzol y borja made so scandalously merry in de bichis garden at sienathat cardinal riarios luxury exceeded all that had been displayed by our forefathers or that can even be imagined by our descendants and macchiavelli tells us2 that although of very low origin and mean rearing no sooner had he obtained the scarlet hat than he displayed a pride and ambition so vast that the pontificate seemed too small for him and he gave a feast in rome which would have appeared extraordinary even for a king the expense exceeding 20000 florins       1  in a letter to francesco gonzaga       2  istorie florentine   knowing so much it is not difficult to understand that in one year or less he should have dissipated 200000 florins and found himself in debt to the extent of a further 60000  in 1473 sixtus being at the time all but at war with florence this cardinal riario visited venice and milan in the latter state he was planning with duke galeazzo maria that the latter should become king of lombardy and then assist him with money and troops to master rome and ascend the papal thronewhich it appears sixtus was quite willing to yield to himthus putting the papacy on a hereditary basis like any other secular state  it is as well perhaps that he should have died on his return to rome in january of 1474worn out by his excesses and debaucheries say some of poison administered by the venetians say othersleaving a mass of debts contracted in his transactions with the world the flesh and the devil to be cleared up by the vicar of christ  his brother girolamo meanwhile had married caterina sforza a natural daughter of duke galeazzo maria she brought him as her dowry the city of imola and in addition to this he received from his holiness the city of forli to which end the ordelaffi were dispossessed of it here again we have a papal attempt to found a family dynasty and an attempt that might have been carried further under circumstances more propitious and had not death come to check their schemes  the only one of the four nephews of sixtusand to this one was imputed no nearer kinshipwho was destined to make any lasting mark in history was giuliano della rovere he was raised by his uncle to the purple with the title of san pietro in vincoli and thirtytwo years later he was to become pope as julius ii of him we shall hear much in the course of this story  under the pontificate of sixtus iv the position and influence of cardinal roderigo were greatly increased for once again the spanish cardinal had made the most of his opportunities as at the election of pius ii so at the election of sixtus iv it was cardinal roderigo who led the act of accession which gave the new pope his tiara and for this act roderigoin common with the cardinals orsini and gonzaga who acceded with himwas richly rewarded and advanced receiving as his immediate guerdon the wealthy abbey of subiaco  at about this time 1470 must have begun the relations between cardinal roderigo and giovanna catanei or vannozza catanei as she is styled in contemporary documentsvannozza being a corruption or abbreviation of giovannozza an affectionate form of giovanna  who she was or whence she came are facts that have never been ascertained she is generally assumed to have been a roman but there are no obvious grounds for the assumption her name for instance being common to many parts of italy and just as we have no sources of information upon her origin neither have we any elements from which to paint her portrait gregorovius rests the probability that she was beautiful upon the known characteristics and fastidious tastes of the cardinal since it is unthinkable that such a man would have been captivated by an ugly woman or would have been held by a stupid one it is fairly reasonable to conclude that she was beautiful and readywitted  all that we do know of her up to the time of her liaison with cardinal roderigo is that she was born on july 13 1442 this fact being ascertainable by a simple calculation from the elements afforded by the inscription on her tomb in santa maria del popolo  vix ann lxxvi m iv d xii objit anno mdxviii xxvi nov  and again just as we know nothing of her family origin neither have we any evidence of what her circumstances were when she caught the magnetic eye of cardinal roderigo de lanzol y borjaor borgia as by now his name which had undergone italianization was more generally spelled  infessura states in his diaries that roderigo desiring lateras pope alexander vito create cardinal his son by her cesare borgia he caused false witness to be borne to the fact that cesare was the legitimate son of one domenico darignano to whom he the pope had in fact married her guicciardini1 makes the same statement without however mentioning name of this darignano       1  istoria ditalia   now bastards were by canon law excluded from the purple and it is probably upon this circumstance that both infessura and guicciardini have built the assumption that some such means as these had been adopted to circumvent the law andas so often happens in chronicles concerning the borgiasthe assumption is straightway stated as a fact but there were other ways of circumventing awkward commandments and unfortunately for the accuracy of these statements of infessura and guicciardini another way was taken in this instance as early as 1480 pope sixtus iv had granted cesare borgiain a bull dated october 11dispensation from proving the legitimacy of his birth this entirely removed the necessity for any such subsequent measures as those which are suggested by these chroniclers       1  see the supplement to the appendix of thuasnes edition      of burchards diarium   moreover had cardinal roderigo desired to fasten the paternity of cesare on another there was ready to his hand vannozzas actual husband giorgio della croce2 when exactly this man became her husband is not to be ascertained all that we know is that he was so in 1480 and that she was living with him in that year in a house in piazza pizzo di merlo now piazza sforza cesarini not far from the house on banchi vecchi which cardinal roderigo as vicechancellor had converted into a palace for himself and a palace so sumptuous as to excite the wonder of that magnificent age       2  darignano is as much a fiction as the rest of      infessuras story   this giorgio della croce was a milanese under the protection of cardinal roderigo who had obtained for him a post at the vatican as apostolic secretary according to some he married him to vannozza in order to afford her an official husband and thus cloak his own relations with her it is an assumption which you will hesitate to accept if we know our cardinal roderigo at all he was never the man to pursue his pleasures in a holeandcorner fashion nor one to bethink him of a cloak for his amusements had he but done so scandalmongers would have had less to fasten upon in their work of playing havoc with his reputation what is far more likely is that della croce owed cardinal roderigos protection and the appointment as apostolic secretary to his own complacency in the matter of his wifes relations with the splendid prelate however we look at it the figure cut in this story by della croce is not heroic  between the years 1474 and 1476 vannozza bore roderigo two sons cesare borgia afterwards cardinal of valencia and duke of valentinois the central figure of our story and giovanni borgia afterwards duke of gandia  lucrezia borgia we know from documentary evidence before us was born on april 19 1479  but there is a mystery about the precise respective ages of vannozzas two eldest sons and we fear that at this time of day it has become impossible to establish beyond reasonable doubt which was the firstborn and this in spite of the documents discovered by gregorovius and his assertion that they remove all doubt and enable him definitely to assert that giovanni was born in 1474 and cesare in 1476  let us look at these documents they are letters from ambassadors to their masters probably correct and the more credible since they happen to agree and corroborate one another still not so utterly and absolutely reliable as to suffice to remove the doubts engendered by the no less reliable documents whose evidence contradicts them  the first letters quoted by gregorovius are from the ambassador gianandrea boccaccio to his master the duke of ferrara in 1493 in these he mentions cesare borgia as being sixteen to seventeen years of age at the time but the very manner of writingsixteen to seventeen yearsis a common way of vaguely suggesting age rather than positively stating it so we may pass that evidence over as of secondary importance  next is a letter from gerardo saraceni to the duke of ferrara dated october 26 1501 and it is more valuable claiming as it does to be the relation of something which his holiness told the writer it is in the postscriptum that this ambassador says the pope gave me to understand that the said duchess lucrezia borgia will complete twentytwo years of age next april and at that same time the duke of romagna will complete his twentysixth year1     1  facendomi intendere the epsa duchessa é di etá di anni ventidui li quali finiranno a questo aprile in el qual tempo anche lo illmo duca di romagna fornirá anni ventisei   this certainly fixes the year of cesares birth as 1476 but we are to remember that saraceni is speaking of something that the pope had recently told him exactly how recently does not transpire an error would easily be possible in so far as the age of cesare is concerned in so far as the age of lucrezia is concerned an error is not only possible but has actually been committed by saraceni at least the age given in his letter is wrong by one year as we know by a legal document drawn up in february of 1491lucrezias contract of marriage with don juan cherubin de centelles2     2  a contract never executed   according to this protocol in old spanish dated february 26 1491 lucrezia completed her twelfth year on april 19 14913 which definitely and positively gives us the date of her birth as april 19 1479     3  item mes attenent que dita dona lucretia a xviiii de abril prop vinent entrará in edat de dotze anys   a quite extraordinary error is that made by gregorovius when he says that lucrezia borgia was born on april 18 1480 extraordinary considering that he made it apparently with this very protocol under his eyes and cites it in fact document iv in the appendix to his lucrezia borgia as his authority  to return however to cesare and giovanni there is yet another evidence quoted by gregorovius in support of his contention that the latter was the elder and born in 1474 but it is of the same nature and of no more nor less value than those already mentioned  worthy of more consideration in view of their greater official and legal character are the ossuna documents given in the supplement of the appendix in thuasnes edition of burchards diary namely   a october 1 1480a bull from sixtus iv already mentioned dispensing cesare from proving his legitimacy in this he is referred to as in his sixth yearin sexto tuo aetatis anno  this assuming boccaccios letter to be correct in the matter of april being the month of cesares birth fixes the year of his birth as 1475   b august 16 1482a bull of sixtus iv appointing roderigo borgia administrator of cesares benefices in this he is mentioned as being seven years of age ie presumably in his eighth year which again gives us his birthyear as 1475   c september 12 1484a bull of sixtus iv appointing cesare treasurer of the church of carthage in this he is mentioned as in his ninth yearin nono tuo aetatis anno this is at variance with the other two and gives us 1476 as the year of his birth  to these evidences conflicting as they are may be added burchards mention in his diary under date of september 12 1491 that cesare was then seventeen years of age this would make him out to have been born in 1474   clearly the matter cannot definitely be settled upon such evidence as we have all that we can positively assert is that he was born between the years 1474 and 1476 and we cannot we think do better for the purposes of this story than assume his birthyear to have been 1475  we know that between those same years or in one or the other of them was born giovanni borgia but just as the same confusion prevails with regard to his exact age so is it impossible to determine with any finality whether he was cesares junior or senior  the one document that appears to us to be the most important in this connection is that of the inscription on their mothers tomb this runs  faustiae cathanae cesare valentinae johannae candiae juffredo scylatii et lucretia ferrariae ducib filiis nobili probitate insigni religione eximia etc etc   if giovanni was as is claimed the eldest of her children why does his name come second if cesare was her second son why does his name take the first place on that inscription  it has been urged that if cesare was the elder of these two he and not giovanni would have succeeded to the duchy of gandia on the death of pedro luiscardinal roderigos eldest son by an unknown mother but that does not follow inevitably for it is to be remembered that cesare was already destined for an ecclesiastical career and it may well be that his father was reluctant to change his plans  meanwhile the turbulent reign of sixtus iv went on until his ambition to increase his dominions had the result of plunging the whole of italy into war  lorenzo demedici had thwarted the popes purposes in romagna coming to the assistance of città di castello when this was attacked in the popes interest by the warlike giuliano della rovere to avenge himself for this and to remove a formidable obstacle to his familys advancement the pope inspired the pazzi conspiracy against the lives of the famous masters of florence the conspiracy failed for although giuliano demedici fell stabbed to the heartbefore christs altar and at the very moment of the elevation of the hostlorenzo escaped with slight hurt and by the very risk to which he had been exposed rallied the florentines to him more closely than ever  open war was the only bolt remaining in the papal quiver and open war he declared preluding it by a bull of excommunication against the florentines naples took sides with the pope venice and milan came to the support of florence whereupon milans attentions were diverted to her own affairs genoa being cunningly set in revolt against her  in 1480 a peace was patched up but it was shortlived a few months later war flared out again from the holy see against florence this time and on the pretext of its having joined the venetians against the pope in the late war a complication now arose created by the venetians who seized the opportunity to forward their own ambitions and increase their territories on the mainland and upon a pretext of the pettiest themselves declared war upon ferrara genoa and some minor tyrannies were drawn into the quarrel on the one side whilst on the other florence naples mantua milan and bologna stood by ferrara whilst the papal forces were holding in check the neapolitans who sought to pass north to aid ferrara whilst the roman campagna was being harassed by the colonna and milan was engaged with genoa the venetians invested ferrara forced her to starvation and to yieldingpoint thereupon the pope perceiving the trend of affairs and that the only likely profit to be derived from the campaign would lie with venice suddenly changed sides that he might avoid a contingency so far removed from all his aims  he made a treaty with naples and permitted the neapolitan army passage through his territories of which they availed themselves to convey supplies to ferrara and neutralize the siege at the same time the pope excommunicated the venetians and urged all italy to make war upon them  in this fashion the campaign dragged on to every ones disadvantage and without any decisive battle fought until at last the peace of bagnolo was concluded in august of 1484 and the opposing armies withdrew from ferrara  the news of it literally killed sixtus when the ambassadors declared to him the terms of the treaty he was thrown into a violent rage and declared the peace to be at once shameful and humiliating the gout from which he suffered flew to his heart and on the following dayaugust 12 1484he died  two things he did during his reign to the material advantage of the church however much he may have neglected the spiritual he strengthened her hold upon her temporal possessions and he enriched the vatican by the addition of the sistine chapel for the decoration of this he procured the best tuscan talent of his dayand of many daysand brought alessandro filipeppi botticelli pietro vannuccio il perugino and domenico bigordi il ghirlandajo from florence to adorn its walls with their frescoes1     1  the glory of the sistine chapel however is michelangelos last judgement which was added later in the reign of pope julius ii giuliano della rovere   in the last years of the reign of pope sixtus cardinal roderigos family had suffered a loss and undergone an increase  in 1481 vannozza bore him another songiuffredo borgia and in the following year died his eldest son by an unknown mother pedro luis de borgia who had reached the age of twentytwo and was betrothed at the time of his decease to the princess maria daragona  in january of that same year 1482 cardinal roderigo had married his daughter girolamanow aged fifteento giovanni andrea cesarini the scion of a patrician roman house the alliance strengthened the bonds of good feeling which for some considerable time had prevailed between the two families unfortunately the young couple were not destined to many years of life together as in 1483 both died  of cesare all that we know at this period is what we learn from the papal bulls conferring several benefices upon him in july 1482 he was granted the revenues from the prebendals and canonries of valencia in the following month he was appointed canon of valencia and apostolic notary in april 1484 he was made provost of alba and in september of the same year treasurer of the church of carthage no doubt he was living with his mother his brothers and his sister at the house in the piazza pizzo di merlo where an ample if not magnificent establishment was maintained  by this time cardinal roderigos wealth and power had grown to stupendous proportions and he lived in a splendour well worthy of his lofty rank he was now fiftythree years of age still retaining the air and vigour of a man in his very prime which no doubt he owed as much as to anything to his abstemious and singularly sparing tablehabits he derived a stupendous income from his numerous abbeys in italy and spain his three bishoprics of valencia porto and carthage and his ecclesiastical offices among which the vicechancellorship alone yielded him annually eight thousand florins1     1  the gold florin ducat or crown was equal to ten shillings of our present money and had a purchasing power of five times that amount   volterra refers with wonder to the abundance of his plate to his pearls his gold embroideries and his books the splendid equipment of his beds the trappings of his horses and other similar furnishings in gold in silver and in silk in short he was the wealthiest prince of the church of his day and he lived with a magnificence worthy of a king or of the pope himself  of the actual man volterra writing in 1586 says he is of a spirit capable of anything and of a great intelligence a ready speaker and of distinction notwithstanding his indifferent literary culture naturally astute and of marvellous talent in the conduct of affairs  in the year in which volterra wrote of cardinal roderigo in such terms vannozza was left a widow by the death of giorgio della croce her widowhood was short however for in the same yearon june 6she took a second husband possibly at the instance of roderigo borgia who did not wish to leave her unprotected that at least is the general inference although there is very little evidence upon which to base it this second husband was carlo canale a mantovese scholar who had served cardinal francesco gonzaga in the capacity of chamberlain and who had come to rome on the death of his patron  the marriage contract shows that by this time vannozza had removed her residence to piazza branchis in addition to this she had by this time acquired a villa with its beautiful gardens and vine­yards in the suburra near s pietro in vincoli she is also known to have been the proprietor of an innthe albergo del leonein via del orso opposite the torre di nona for she figures with della croce in a contract regarding a lease of it in 1483  with her entrance into second nuptials her relations with cardinal roderigo came to an end and his two children by her then in romelucrezia and giuffredowent to take up their residence with adriana orsini née de mila at the orsini palace on monte giordano she was a cousin of roderigos and the widow of lodovico orsini by whom she had a son orso orsini who from early youth had been betrothed to giulia farnese the daughter of a patrician family still comparatively obscure but destined through this very girl to rise to conspicuous eminence  for her surpassing beauty this giulia farnese has been surnamed la bellaand as giulia la bella was she known in her dayand she has been immortalized by pinturicchio and guglielmo della porta she sat to the former as a model for his madonna in the borgia tower of the vatican and to the latter for the statue of truth which adorns the tomb of her brother alessandro farnese who became pope paul iii  here in adriana orsinis house where his daughter lucrezia was being educated cardinal roderigo now at the mature age of some sixandfifty years made the acquaintance and became enamoured of this beautiful goldenheaded giulia some forty years his junior to the fact that she presently became his mistresssomewhere about the same time that she became orso orsinis wifeis due the sudden rise of the house of farnese this began with her handsome dissolute brother alessandros elevation to the purple by her lover and grew to vast proportions during his subsequent and eminently scandalous occupation of the papal throne as paul iii  in the year 1490 lucrezia was the only one of roderigos children by vannozza who remained in rome  giovanni borgia was in spain whither he had gone on the death of his brother pedro luis to take posession of the duchy of gandia which the power of his fathers wealth and vast influence at the valencian court had obtained for that same pedro luis to this giovanni now succeeded  cesare borgianow aged fifteenhad for some two years been studying his humanities in an atmosphere of latinity at the sapienza of perugia there if we are to believe the praises of him uttered by pompilio he was already revealing his unusual talents and a precocious wit in the preface of the syllabica on the art of prosody dedicated to him by pompilio the latter hails him as the hope and ornament of the hous of borgiaborgiae familiae spes et decus  from perugia he was moved in 1491 to the famous university of pisa a college frequented by the best of italy for preceptor he had giovanni vera of arcilla a spanish gentleman who was later created a cardinal by cesares father there in pisa cesare maintained an establishment of a magnificence in keeping with his fathers rank and with the example set him by that same father  it was cardinal roderigos wish that cesare should follow an ecclesiastical career and the studies of canon law which he pursued under filippo decis the most rated lecturer on canon law of his day were such as peculiarly to fit him for that end and for the highest honours the church might have to bestow upon him later at the age of seventeen while still at pisa he was appointed prothonotary of the church and preconized bishop of pampeluna  sixtus iv died as we have seen in august 1482 the death of a pope was almost invariably the signal for disturbances in rome and they certainly were not wanting on this occasion the riario palaces were stormed and looted and girolamo riariothe popes nepotthrew himself into the castle of sant angelo with his forces  the orsini and colonna were in arms so that in a few days incendiarism robbery and murder raged in several parts of the city the cardinals besought the count to surrender the castle to the sacred college withdraw his troops and deliver rome from the fear of his forces and he that he might win the favour of the future pope obeyed and withdrew to imola1     1  macchiavelli istorie fiorentine   the cardinals having thus contrived to restore some semblance of order proceeded to the creation of a new pontiff and a genoese giovanni battista cibo cardinal of malfetta was elected and took the name of innocent viii  again as in the case of sixtus there is no lack of those who charge this pontiff with having obtained his election by simony the cardinals giovanni d aragona brother to the king of naples and ascanio sforza brother of lodovico duke of milan are said to have disposed of their votes in the most open and shameless manner practically putting them up for sale to the highest bidder italy rang with the scandal of it we are told  under innocents lethargic rule the church again began to lose much of the vigour with which sixtus had inspired it if the reign of sixtus had been scandalous infinitely worse was that of innocenta sordid grasping sensualist without even the one redeeming virtue of strength that had been his predecessors nepotism had characterized many previous pontificates open paternity was to characterize his for he was the first pope who in flagrant violation of canon law acknowledged his children for his own he proceeded to provide for some seven bastards and that provision appears to have been the only aim and scope of his pontificate  not content with raising money by the sale of preferments innocent established a traffic in indulgences the like of which had never been seen before in the rome of his day you might had you the money buy anything from a cardinals hat to a pardon for the murder of your father  the most conspicuous of his bastards was francesco ciboconspicuous chiefly for the cupidity which distinguished him as it distinguished the pope his father for the rest he was a poorspirited fellow who sorely disappointed lorenzo demedici whose daughter maddalena he received in marriage lorenzo had believed that backed by the popes influence francesco would establish for himself a dynasty in romagna but father and son were alike too invertebratethe one to inspire the other to execute any such designs as had already been attempted by the nepots of calixtus iii and sixtus iv  under the weak and scandalous rule of innocent viii rome appears to have been abandoned to the most utter lawlessness anarchy robbery and murder preyed upon the city no morning dawned without revealing corpses in the streets and if by chance the murderer was caught there was pardon for him if he could afford to buy it or tor di nona and the hangmans noose if he could not  it is not wonderful that when at last innocent viii died infessura should have blessed the day that freed the world of such a monster  but his death did not happen until 1492 a feeble old man he had become subject to lethargic or cataleptic trances which had several times already deceived those in attendance into believing him dead he grew weaker and weaker and it became impossible to nourish him upon anything but womans milk towards the end came infessura tells us a hebrew physician who claimed to have a prescription by which he could save the popes life for his infusion1 he needed young human blood and to obtain it he took three boys of the age of ten and gave them a ducat apiece for as much as he might require of them unfortunately he took so much that the three boys incontinently died of his phlebotomy and the hebrew was obliged to take to flight to save his own life for the pope being informed of what had taken place execrated the deed and ordered the physicians arrest judeus quidem aufugit et papa sanatus not est concludes infessura     1  the silly interpretation of this afforded by later writers that this physician attempted transfusion of bloodsilly because unthinkable in an age which knew nothing of the circulation of the bloodhas already been exploded  innocent viii breathed his last on july 25 1492     chapter iii alexander vi   the ceremonies connected with the obsequies of pope innocent viii lastedas prescribednine days they were concluded on august 5 1492 and says infessura naïvely sic finita fuit eius memoria  the sacred college consisted at the time of twentyseven cardinals four of whom were absent at distant sees and unable to reach rome in time for the immuring of the conclave the twentythree present were in the order of their seniority roderigo borgia oliviero caraffa giuliano della rovere battista zeno giovanni michieli giorgio costa girolamo della rovere paolo fregosi domenico della rovere giovanni dei conti giovanni giacomo sclafetani lorenzo cibo ardicino della porta antoniotto pallavicino maffeo gerardo francesco piccolomini raffaele riario giovanni battista savelli giovanni colonna giovanni orsini ascanio maria sforza giovanni demedici and francesco sanseverino  on august 6 they assembled in st peters to hear the sacred mass of the holy ghost which was said by giuliano della rovere on the tomb of the prince of the apostles and to listen to the discourse pro eligendo pontefice delivered by the learned and eloquent bishop of carthage thereafter the cardinals swore upon the gospels faithfully to observe their trust and thereupon the conclave was immured  according to the dispatches of valori the ferrarese ambassador in rome it was expected that either the cardinal of naples oliviero caraffa or the cardinal of lisbon giorgio costa would be elected to the pontificate and according to the dispatch of cavalieri the ambassador of modena the king of france had deposited 200000 ducats with a roman banker to forward the election of giuliano della rovere nevertheless early on the morning of august 11 it was announced that roderigo borgia was elected pope and we have it on the word of valori that the election was unanimous for he wrote on the morrow to the council of eight the signory of florence that after long contention alexander vi was created omnium consensumne li manco un solo voto  the subject of this election is one with which we rarely find an author dealing temperately or with a proper and sane restraint to vituperate in superlatives seems common to most who have taken in hand this and other episodes in the history of the borgias every fresh writer who comes to the task appears to be mainly inspired by a desire to emulate his forerunners allowing his pen to riot zestfully in the accumulation of scandalous matter and seeking to increase if possible its lurid quality by a degree or two as a rule there is not even an attempt made to put forward evidence in substantiation of anything that is alleged wild and sweeping statement takes the place that should be held by calm deduction and reasoned comment  he was the worst pontiff that ever filled st peters chair is one of these sweeping statements culled from the pages of an able modern italian author whose writings sound in all that concerns other matters are strewn with the most foolish extravagances and flagrant inaccuracies in connection with alexander vi and his family  to say of him as that writer says that he was the worst pontiff that ever filled st peters chair can only be justified by an utter ignorance of papal history you have but to compare him calmly and honestlyyour mind stripped of preconceptionswith the wretched and wholly contemptible innocent viii whom he succeeded or with the latters precursor the terrible sixtus iv  that he was better than these men morally or ecclesiastically is not to be pretended that he was worsemeasuring achievement by opportunityis strenuously to be denied for the rest that he was infinitely more gifted and infinitely more a man of affairs is not to be gainsaid by any impartial critic  if we take him out of the background of history in which he is set and judge him singly and individually we behold a man who as a churchman and christs vicar fills us with horror and loathing as a scandalous exception from what we are justified in supposing from his office must have been the rule therefore that he may be judged by the standard of his own time if he is to be judged at all if we are even to attempt to understand him have we given a sketch of the careers of those popes who immediately preceded him with whom as vicechancellor he was intimately associated and whose examples were the only papal examples that he possessed  that this should justify his course we do not pretend a good churchman in his place would have bethought him of his duty to the master whose vicar he was and would have aimed at the sorely needed reform but we are not concerned to study him as a good churchman it is by no means clear that we are concerned to study him as a churchman at all the papacy had by this time become far less of an ecclesiastical than a political force the weapons of the church were there but they were being employed for the furtherance not of churchly but of worldly aims if the pontiffs in the pages of this history remembered or evoked their spiritual authority it was but to employ it as an instrument for the advancement of their temporal schemes and personal considerations entered largely into these  selfaggrandizement insufferable in a cleric is an ambition not altogether unpardonable in a temporal prince and if alexander aimed at selfaggrandizement and at the founding of a permanent dynasty for his family he did not lack examples in the careers of those among his predecessors with whom he had been associated  that the papacy was christs vicarage was a fact that had long since been obscured by the conception that the papacy was a kingdom of this world in striving then for worldly eminence by every means in his power alexander is no more blameworthy than any other what then remains the fact that he succeeded better than any of his forerunners but are we on that account to select him for the special object of our vituperation the papacy had tumbled into a slough of materialism in which it was to wallow even after the reformation had given it pause and warning under what obligation was alexander vi more than any other pope to pull it out of that slough as he found it so he carried it on as much a selfseeker as much a worldly prince as much a family man and as little a churchman as any of those who had gone immediately before him  by the outrageous discrepancy between the papacys professed and actual aims it was fast becoming an object of execration and it is alexanders misfortune that coming when he did he has remained as the type of his class  the mighty of this world shall never want for detractors the mean and insignificant writhing under the consciousness of his shortcomings ministers to his selflove by vilifying the great that he may lessen the gap between himself and them to achieve greatness is to achieve enemies it is to excite envy and as envy no seed can raise up such a crop of hatred  does this need labouring have we not abundant instances about us of the vulgar tittletattle and scandalous unfounded gossip which born heaven alone knows on what backstairs or in what servants hall circulates currently to the detriment of the distinguished in every walk of life and the more conspicuously great the individual the greater the incentive to slander him for the interest of the slander is commensurate with the eminence of the personage assailed  such to a great extent is the case of alexander vi he was too powerful for the stomachs of many of his contemporaries and he and his son cesare had a way of achieving their ends since that could not be denied it remained to inveigh loudly against the means adopted and with pious uplifting of hands and eyes to cry shame and horror and the like has never been heard of in wilful blindness to what had been happening at the vatican for generations  later writers take up the tale of it it is a fine subject about which to make phrases and the passion for phrasemaking will at times outweigh the respect for truth thus villari with his the worst pontiff that ever filled st peters chair and again elsewhere echoing what many a writer has said before him from guicciardini downwards in utter and diametric opposition to the true facts of the case the announcement of his election was received throughout italy with universal dismay to this he adds the ubiquitous story of king ferrantes bursting into tears at the newsthough never before known to weep for the death of his own children  let us pause a moment to contemplate the grief the neapolitan king what picture is evoked in your minds by that statement of his bursting into tears at alexanders election we seedo we nota pious noble soul horrorstricken at the sight of the papacys corruption a truly sublime figure whose tears will surely stand to his credit in heaven a great heart breaking a venerable head bowed down with lofty righteous grief weeping over the grave of christian hopes such surely is the image we are meant to see by guicciardini and his many hollow echoers  turn we now for corroboration of that noble picture to the history of this same ferrante a shock awaits us we find in this bastard of the great and brilliant alfonso a cruel greedy covetous monster so treacherous and so fiendishly brutal that we are compelled to extend him the charity of supposing him to be something less than sane let us consider but one of his characteristics he loved to have his enemies under his own supervision and he kept them sothe living ones caged and guarded the dead ones embalmed and habited as in life and this collection of mummies was his pride and delight more and worse could we tell you of him butex pede herculem  this man shed tears we are told not another word it is left to our imagination to paint for us a picture of this weeping it is left to us to conclude that these precious tears were symbolical of the grief of italy herself that the catastrophe that provoked them must have been terrible indeed  but now that we know what manner of man was this who wept see how different is the inference that we may draw from his sorrow can we still imagine itas we are desired to doto have sprung from a lofty christian piety let us track those tears to their very source and we shall find it to be compounded of rage and fear  ferrante saw trouble ahead of him with lodovico sforza concerning a matter which shall be considered in the next chapter and not at all would it suit him at such a time that such a pope as alexanderwho he had every reason to suppose would be on the side of lodovicoshould rule in rome  so he had set himself by every means in his power to oppose roderigos election his rage at the news that all his efforts had been vain his fear of a man of roderigos mettle and his undoubted dread of the consequences to himself of his frustrated opposition of that mans election may indeed have loosened the tears of this ferrante who had not even wept at the death of his own children we say may advisedly for the matter from beginning to end is one of speculation if we leave it for the realm of fact we have to askwere there any tears at all upon what authority rests the statement of the florentine historian what in fact does he say  it is well known that the king of naples for all that in public he dissembled the pain it caused him signified to the queen his wife with tearswhich were unusual in him even on the death of his childrenthat a pope had been created who would be most pernicious to italy  so that when all is said ferrante shed his kingly tears to his wife in private and to her in private he delivered his opinion of the new pontiff how then came guicciardini to know of the matter true he says it is well knownmeaning that he had those tears upon hearsay it is of course possible that ferrantes queen may have repeated what passed between herself and the king but that would surely have been in contravention of the wishes of her husband who had be it remembered dissembled his grief in public and ferrante does not impress one as the sort of husband whose wishes his wife would be bold enough to contravene  it is surprising that upon no better authority than this should these precious tears of ferrantes have been crystallized in history  if this trivial instance has been dealt with at such length it is because for one reason it is typical of the foundation of so many of the borgia legends and for another because when history has been carefully sifted for evidence of the universal dismay with which the election of roderigo borgia was received king ferrantes is the only case of dismay that comes through the mesh at all therefore was it expedient to examine it minutely  that universal dismaylike the tears of ferranterests upon the word of guicciardini he says that men were filled with dread and horror by this election because it had been effected by such evil ways con arte si brutte and no less because the nature and condition of the person elected were largely known to many  guicciardini is to be read with the greatest caution and reserve when he deals with rome his bias against and his enmity of the papacy are as obvious as they are notorious and in his endeavours to bring it as much as possible into discredit he does not even spare his generous patrons the medicean popesleo x and clement vii if he finds it impossible to restrain his invective against these pontiffs who heaped favours and honours upon him what but virulence can be expected of him when he writes of alexander vi he is largely to blame for the flagrant exaggeration of many of the charges brought against the borgias that he hated them we know and that when he wrote of them he dipped his golden tuscan pen in vitriol and set down what he desired the world to believe rather than what contemporary documents would have revealed to him we can prove here and now from that one statement of his which we have quoted  who were the men who were filled with dismay horror or dread at roderigos election  the milanese no for we know that cardinal ascanio sforza the duke of milans brother was the most active worker in favour of roderigos election and that this same election was received and celebrated in milan with public rejoicings  the florentines no for the medici were friendly to the house of borgia and we know that they welcomed the election and that from florence manfredithe ferrarese ambassadorwrote home it is said he will be a glorious pontiff dicesi che sará glorioso pontefice  were venice genoa mantua siena or lucca dismayed by this election surely not if the superlatively laudatory congratulations of their various ambassadors are of any account  venice confessed that a better pastor could not have been found for the church since he had proved himself a chief full of experience and an excellent cardinal  genoa said that his merit lay not in having been elected but in having been desired  mantua declared that it had long awaited the pontificate of one who during forty years had rendered himself by his wisdom and justice capable of any office  siena expressed its joy at seeing the summit of eminence attained by a pope solely upon his meritspervenuto alla dignitá pontificale meramente per meriti proprii  lucca praised the excellent choice made and extolled the accomplishments the wisdom and experience of the pontiff  not dismay then but actual rejoicing must have been almost universal in italy on the election of pope alexander vi and very properlyalways considering the pontificate as the temporal state it was then being accounted for roderigos influence was vast his intelligence was renowned and had again and again been proved and his administrative talents and capacity for affairs were known to all he was wellborn cultured of a fine and noble presence and his wealth was colossal comprising the archbishoprics of valencia and porto the bishoprics of majorca carthage agria the abbeys of subiaco the monastery of our lady of bellefontaine the deaconry of sancta maria in via lata and his offices of vicechancellor and dean of holy church  we are told that he gained his election by simony it is very probable that he did but the accusation has never been categorically established and until that happens it would be well to moderate the vituperation hurled at him charges of that simony are common conclusive proof there is none we find giacomo trotti the french ambassador in milan writing to the duke of ferrara a fortnight after roderigos election that the papacy has been sold by simony and a thousand rascalities which is a thing ignominious and detestable  ignominious and detestable indeed if true but be it remembered that trotti was the ambassador of france whose candidate backed by french influence and french gold as we have seen was della rovere and even if his statement was true the ignominious and detestable thing was at least no novelty yet guicciardini treating of this matter says he gained the pontificate owing to discord between the cardinals ascanio sforza and giuliano di san pietro in vincoli and still more because in a manner without precedent in that age con esempio nuovo in quella etá he openly bought the votes of many cardinals some with money some with promises of his offices and benefices which were very great  again guicciardini betrays his bias by attempting to render roderigos course assuming it for the moment to be truly represented peculiarly odious by this assertion that it was without precedent in that age  without precedent what of the accusations of simony against innocent viii which rest upon a much sounder basis than these against alexander and what of those against sixtus iv further if a simoniacal election was unprecedented what of lorenzo vallas fierce indictment of simonyfor which he so narrowly escaped the clutches of the inquisition some sixty years before this date  simony was rampant at the time and it is the rankest hypocrisy to make this outcry against alexanders uses of it and to forget the others  whether he really was elected by simony or not depends largelyso far as the evidence available goesupon what we are to consider as simony if payment in the literal sense was made or promised then unquestionably simony there was but this though often asserted still awaits proof if the conferring of the benefices vacated by a cardinal on his elevation to the pontificate is to be considered simony then there never was a pope yet against whom the charge could not be levelled and established  consider that by his election to the pontificate his archbishoprics offices nay his very house itselfwhich at the time of which we write it was customary to abandon to pillageare vacated and remember that as pope they are now in his gift and that they must of necessity be bestowed upon somebody in a time in which pontiffs are imbued with a spiritual sense of their office and duties they will naturally make such bestowals upon those whom they consider best fitted to use them for the greater honour and glory of god but we are dealing with no such spiritual golden age as that when we deal with the cinquecento as we have already seen and therefore all that we can expect of a pope is that he should bestow the preferment he has vacated upon those among the cardinals whom he believes to be devoted to himself considering his election in a temporal sense it is natural that he should behave as any other temporal prince that he should remember those to whom he owes the pontificate and that he should reward them suitably alexander vi certainly pursued such a course and the greatest profit from his election was derived by the cardinal sforza whoas roderigo himself admittedhad certainly exerted all his influence with the sacred college to gain him the pontificate alexander gave him the vacated vicechancellorship for which when all is said ascanio sforza was excellently fitted his vacated palace on banchi vecchi the town of nepi and the bishopric of agri  to orsini he gave the church of carthage and the legation of marche to colonna the abbey of subiaco to savelli the legation of perugia from which he afterwards recalled him not finding him suited to so difficult a charge to raffaele riario went spanish benefices worth four thousand ducats yearly to sanseverino roderigos house in milan whilst he consented that sanseverinos nephewknown as fracassashould enter the service of the church with a condotta of a hundred menatarms and a stipend of thirteen thousand ducats yearly  guicciardini says of all this that ascanio sforza induced many of the cardinals to that abominable contract and not only by request and persuasion but by example because corrupt and of an insatiable appetite for riches he bargained for himself as the reward of so much turpitude the vicechancellorships churches fortresses the very plurals betray the frenzy of exaggeration dictated by his malice and his roderigos palace in rome full of furniture of great value  what possible proof can guicciardini havewhat possible proof can there beof such a bargain it rests upon purest assumption formed after those properties had changed handsascanio being rewarded by them for his valuable services and alsoso far as the vicechancellorship was concernedbeing suitably preferred to say that ascanio received them in consequence of a bargain and as the price of his vote and electioneering services is not only an easy thing to say but it is the obvious thing for any one to say who aims at defaming  it is surprising that we should find in guicciardini no mention of the four muleloads of silver removed before the election from cardinal roderigos palace on banchi vecchi to cardinal ascanios palace in trastevere this is generally alleged to have been part of the price of ascanios services whether it was so or whether as has also been urged it was merely removed to save it from the pillaging by the mob of the palace of the cardinal elected to the pontificate the fact is interesting as indicating in either case cardinal roderigos assurance of his election  m yriarte does not hesitate to say we know today by the dispatches of valori the narrative of girolamo porzio and the diarium of burchard the master of ceremonies each of the stipulations made with the electors whose votes were bought  now whilst we do know from valori and porzio what benefices alexander actually conferred we do not know nor could they possibly have told us what stipulations had been made which these benefices were insinuated to satisfy  burchards diarium might be of more authority on this subject for burchard was the master of ceremonies at the vatican but unfortunately for the accuracy of m yriartes statement burchard is silent on the subject for the excellent reason that there is no diary for the period under consideration burchards narrative is interrupted on the death of innocent viii on july 12 and not resumed until december 2 when it is not retrospective  there is it is true the diarium of infessura but that is of no more authority on such a matter than the narrative of porzio or the letters of valori  lord actonin his essay upon this subjecthas not been content to rest the imputation of simony upon such grounds as satisfied m yriarte he has realized that the only testimony of any real value in such a case would be the actual evidence of such cardinals as might be willing to bear witness to the attempt to bribe them and he takes it for grantedas who would not at this time of day and in view of such positive statements as aboundthat such evidence has been duly collected thus he tells us confidently that the charge rests upon the evidence of those cardinals who refused roderigos bribes  that it most certainly does not if it did there would be an end to the matter and so much ink would not have been spilled over it but no single cardinal has left any such evidence as lord acton supposes and alleges it suffices to consider that according to the only evidences availablethe casanatense codices1 and the dispatches of that same valori2 whom m yriarte so confidently cites roderigo borgias election was unanimous who then were these cardinals who refused his bribes or are we to suppose that notwithstanding that refusala refusal which we may justifiably suppose to have been a scandalized and righteously indignant onethey still afforded him their votes     1  essendo concordi tutti i cardinali quasi da contrari voti rivolti tutti in favore di uno solo crearono lui sommo ponteflce

ii manco un solo voto valoris letter to the otto di pratica august 12 1492 see supplement to appendix in e thuasnes edition of burchards diarium   this charge of simony was levelled with the object of making alexander vi appear singularly heinous so much has that object engrossed and blinded those inspired by it that of itself it betrays them had their horror been honest had it sprung from true principles had it been born of any but a desire to befoul and bespatter at all costs roderigo borgia it is not against him that they would have hurled their denunciations but against the whole college of cardinals which took part in the sacrilege and which included three future popes1     1  cardinals piccolomini demedici and giuliano della rovere   assuming not only that there was simony but that it was on as wholesale a scale as was alleged and that for goldcoined or in the form of beneficesroderigo bought the cardinals votes what then he bought them true but theythey sold him their sacred trust their duty to their god their priestly honour their holy vows for the gold he offered them they bartered these so much admitted then surely in that transaction those cardinals were the prostitutes the man who bought so much of them at least was on no baser level than were they yet invective singles him out for its one object and so betrays the aforethought malice of its inspiration  our quarrel is with that with that and with those writers who have taken alexanders simony for grantedeagerly almostfor the purpose of heaping odium upon him by making him appear a scandalous exception to the prevailing rule  if nevertheless we hold as we have said that simony probably did take place we do so not so much upon the inconclusive evidence of the fact as upon the circumstance that it had become almost an established custom to purchase the tiara and that roderigo borgiasince his ambition clearly urged him to the pontificatewould have been an exception had he refrained  it may seem that to have disputed so long to conclude by admitting so much is no better than a waste of labour not so we hope our aim has been to correct the adjustment of the focus and properly to trim the light in which roderigo borgia is to be viewed to the end that you may see him as he wasneither better nor worsethe creature of his times of his environment and of the system in which he was reared and trained thus shall you also get a clearer view of his son cesare when presently he takes the stage more prominently  during the seventeen days of the interregnum between the death of innocent and the election of alexander the wild scenes usual to such seasons had been taking place in rome and notwithstanding the cardinalchamberlains prompt action in seizing the gates and bridges and the patrols endeavours to maintain order crime was unfettered to such an extent that some 220 murders are computed to have taken placegiving the terrible average of thirteen a day  it was a very natural epilogue to the lax rule of the lethargic innocent one of the first acts of alexanders reign was to deal summarily with this lawlessness he put down violence with a hard hand that knew no mercy he razed to the ground the house of a murderer caught redhanded and hanged him above the ruins and so dealt generally that such order came to prevail as had never before been known in rome  infessura tells us how in the very month of his election he appointed inspectors of prisons and four commissioners to administer justice and that he himself gave audience on tuesdays and settled disputes concluding et justitiam mirabili modo facere coepit  he paid all salaries promptlya striking departure it would seem from what had been usual under his predecessorand the effect of his improved and strenuous legislation was shortly seen in the diminished prices of commodities  he was crowned pope on august 6 on the steps of the basilica of st peter by the cardinalarchdeacon piccolomini the ceremony was celebrated with a splendour worthy of the splendid figure that was its centre through the eyes of michele fernodespite his admission that he is unable to convey a worthy notion of the spectacleyou may see the gorgeous procession to the lateran in which alexander vi showed himself to the applauding romans the multitude of richly adorned men gay and festive the seven hundred priests and prelates with their familiars the splendid cavalcade of knights and nobles of rome the archers and turkish horsemen and the palatine guard with its great halberds and flashing shields the twelve white horses with their golden bridles led by footmen and then alexander himself on a snowwhite horse serene of brow and of majestic dignity his hand upliftedthe fishermans ring upon its forefingerto bless the kneeling populace the chronicler flings into superlatives when he comes to praise the personal beauty of the man his physical vigour and health which go to increase the veneration shown him  thus in the brilliant sunshine of that italian august amid the plaudits of assembled rome amid banners and flowers music and incense the flash of steel and the blaze of decorations with the borgian arms everywhere displayedor a grazing steer gulesalexander vi passes to the vatican the aim and summit of his vast ambition  friends and enemies alike have sung the splendours of that coronation and the bull deviceas you can imagineplays a considerable part in those verses be they paeans or lampoons the former allude to borgia as the bull from the majesty and might of the animal that was displayed upon their shield the latter render it the subject of much scurrilous invective to which it lends itself as readily and thereafter in almost all verse of their epoch writers ever say the bull when they mean the borgia     chapter iv borgia alliances   at the time of his fathers election to the throne of st peter cesare borgianow in his eighteenth yearwas still at the university of pisa  it is a little odd considering the great affection for his children which was ever one of roderigos most conspicuous characteristics that he should not have ordered cesare to rome at once to share in the general rejoicings it has been suggested that alexander wished to avoid giving scandal by the presence of his children at such a time but that again looks like a judgement formed upon modern standards for by the standards of his day one cannot conceive that he would have given very much scandal moreover it is to be remembered that lucrezia and giuffredo at least were in rome at the time of their fathers election to the tiara  however that may be cesare did not quit pisa until august of that year 1492 and even then not for rome but for spoletoin accordance with his fathers orderswhere he took up his residence in the castle thence he wrote a letter to piero demedici which is interesting firstly as showing the good relations prevailing between them secondly as refuting a story in guicciardini wherewith that historian ready as ever to belittle the borgias attempts to show him cutting a poor figure he tells us1 that whilst at pisa cesare had occasion to make an appeal to piero demedici in the matter of a criminal case connected with one of his familiars that he went to florence and waited several hours in vain for an audience whereafter he returned to pisa accounting himself despised and not a little injured     1  istoria ditalia tom v   no doubt guicciardini is as mistaken in this as in many another matter for the letter written from spoleto expresses his regret that on the occasion of his passage through florence on his way from pisa to spoleto he should not have had time to visit piero particularly as there was a matter upon which he desired urgently to consult with him he recommends to piero his faithful remolino whose ambition it is to occupy the chair of canon law at the university of pisa and begs his good offices in that connection that juan vera cesares preceptor and the bearer of that letter took back a favourable answer is highly probable for in fabronis hist acad pisan we find this remolino duly established as a lecturer on canon law in the following year  the letter is further of interest as showing cesares full consciousness of the importance of his position its tone and its signatureyour brother cesar de borgia elect of valenciabeing such as were usual between princes  the two chief aims of alexander vi from the very beginning of his pontificate were to reestablish the power of the church which was then the most despised of the temporal states of italy and to promote the fortune of his children already on the very day of his coronation he conferred upon cesare the bishopric of valencia whose revenues amounted to an annual yield of sixteen thousand ducats for the time being however he had his hands very full of other matters and it behoved him to move slowly at first and with the extremest caution  the clouds of war were lowering heavily over italy when alexander came to st peters throne and it was his first concern to find for himself a safe position against the coming of the threatening storm the chief menace to the general peace was lodovico maria sforza surnamed il moro1 who sat as regent for his nephew duke gian galeazzo upon the throne of milan that regency he had usurped from gian galeazzos mother and he was now in a fair way to usurp the throne itself he kept his nephew virtually a prisoner in the castle of pavia together with his young bride isabella of aragon who had been sent thither by her father the duke of calabria heir to the crown of naples     1  touching lodovico marias byname of il morowhich is generally translated as the moor whilst in one writer we have found him mentioned as black lodovico benedetto varchis explanation in his storia fiorentina may be of interest he tells us that lodovico was not so called on account of any swarthiness of complexion as is supposed by guicciardini because on the contrary he was fair nor yet on account of his device showing a moorish squire who brush in hand dusts the gown of a young woman in regal apparel with the motto per italia nettar dogni bruttura this device of the moor he tells us was a rébus or pun upon the word moro which also means the mulberry and was so meant by lodovico the mulberry burgeons at the end of winter and blossoms very early thus lodovico symbolized his own prudence and readiness to seize opportunity betimes   gian galeazzo thus bestowed lodovico maria went calmly about the business of governing like one who did not mean to relinquish the regency save to become duke but it happened that a boy was born to the young prisoners at pavia whereupon spurred perhaps into activity by this parenthood and stimulated by the thought that they had now a sons interests to fight for as well as their own they made appeal to king ferrante of naples that he should enforce his grandsoninlaws rights to the throne of milan king ferrante could desire nothing better for if his grandchild and her husband reigned in milan and by his favour and contriving great should be his influence in the north of italy therefore he stood their friend  matters were at this stage when alexander vi ascended the papal throne  this election gave ferrante pause for as we have seen he had schemed for a pope devoted to his interests who would stand by him in the coming strife and his schemes were rudely shaken now whilst he was still cogitating the matter of his next move the wretched francesco cibo pope innocents son offered to sell the papal fiefs of cervetri and anguillara which had been made over to him by his father to gentile orsinithe head of his powerful house and gentile purchased them under a contract signed at the palace of cardinal giuliano della rovere on september 3 for the sum of forty thousand ducats advanced him by ferrante  alexander protested strongly against this illegal transaction for cervetri and anguillara were fiefs of the church and neither had cibo the right to sell nor orsini the right to buy them moreover that they should be in the hands of a powerful vassal of naples such as orsini suited the pope as little as it suited lodovico maria sforza it stirred the latter into taking measures against the move he feared ferrante might make to enforce gian galeazzos claims  lodovico maria went about this with that sly shrewdness so characteristic of him so well symbolized by his mulberry badgea humorous shrewdness almost which makes him one of the most delightful rogues in history just as he was one of the most debonair and cultured he may indeed be considered as one of the types of the subtle crafty selfish politician that was the ideal of macchiavelli  you see him then effacing the tightlipped cunning smile from his comely face and pointing out to venice with a grave sober countenance how little it can suit her to have the neapolitan spaniards ruffling it in the north as must happen if ferrante has his way with milan the truth of this was so obvious that venice made haste to enter into a league with him and into the camp thus formed came for their own sakes mantua ferrara and siena the league was powerful enough thus to cause ferrante to think twice before he took up the cudgels for gian galeazzo if lodovico could include the pope the leagues might would be so paralysing that ferrante would cease to think at all about his grandchildrens affairs  foreseeing this ferrante had perforce to dry the tears guicciardini has it that he shed and replacing them by a smile servile and obsequious repaired hat in hand to protest his friendship for the popes holiness  and so in december of 1492 came the prince of altamuraferrantes second sonto rome to lay his fathers homage at the feet of the pontiff and at the same time to implore his holiness to refuse the king of hungary the dispensation the latter was asking of the holy see to enable him to repudiate his wife donna leonoraferrantes daughter  altamura was received in rome and sumptuously entertained by the cardinal giuliano della rovere this cardinal had failed as we have seen to gain the pontificate for himself despite the french influence by which he had been supported writhing under his defeat and hating the man who had defeated him with a hatred so bitter and venomous that the imprint of it is on almost every act of his lifefrom the facilities he afforded for the assignment to orsini of the papal fiefs that cibo had to sellhe was already scheming for the overthrow of alexander to this end he needed great and powerful friends to this end had he lent himself to the ciboorsini transaction to this end did he manifest himself the warm wellwisher of ferrante to this end did he cordially welcome the latters son and envoy and promise his support to ferrantes petition  but the holy father was by no means as anxious for the friendship of the old wolf of naples the matter of the king of hungary was one that required consideration and meanwhile he may have hinted slyly there was between naples and rome a little matter of two fiefs to be adjusted  thus his most shrewd holiness thought to gain a little time and in that time he might look about him and consider what alliances would suit his interests best  at this cardinal della rovere in high dudgeon flung out of rome and away to his castle of ostia to fortifyto wield the sword of st paul since he had missed the keys of st peter it was a shrewd move he foresaw the injured dignity of the spanish house of naples and ferrantes wrath at the popes light treatment of him and apathy for his interests and the cardinal knew that with ferrante were allied the mighty houses of colonna and orsini thus by his political divorcement from the holy see he flung in his lot with theirs hoping for red war and the deposition of alexander  but surely he forgot milan and lodovico maria whose brother ascanio sforza was at the popes elbow the energetic friend to whose efforts alexander owed the tiara and who was therefore hated by della rovere perhaps as bitterly as alexander himself  alexander went calmly about the business of fortifying the vatican and the castle of sant angelo and gathering mercenaries into his service and lest any attempt should be made upon his life when he went abroad he did so with an imposing escort of menatarms which so vexed and fretted king ferrante that he did not omit to comment upon it in scathing terms in a letter that presently we shall consider for the rest the popes holiness preserved an unruffled front in the face of the hostile preparations that were toward in the kingdom of naples knowing that he could check them when he chose to lift his finger and beckon the sforza into alliance and presently naples heard an alarming rumour that lodovico maria had in fact made overtures to the pope and that the pope had met these advances to the extent of betrothing his daughter lucrezia to giovanni sforza lord of pesaro and cousin to lodovico  so back to the vatican went the neapolitan envoys with definite proposals of an alliance to be cemented by a marriage between giuffredo borgiaaged twelveand ferrantes granddaughter lucrezia of aragon the pope with his plans but halfmatured as yet temporized was evasive and continued to arm and to recruit at last his arrangements completed he abruptly broke off his negotiations with naples and on april 25 1493 publicly proclaimed that he had joined the northern league  the fury of ferrante who realized that he had been played with and outwitted was expressed in a rabid letter to his ambassador at the court of spain  this pope he wrote leads a life that is the abomination of all without respect for the seat he occupies he cares for nothing save to aggrandize his children by fair means or foul and this is his sole desire from the beginning of his pontificate he has done nothing but disturb the peace molesting everybody now in one way now in another rome is more full of soldiers than of priests and when he goes abroad it is with troops of menatarms about him with helmets on their heads and lances by their sides all his thoughts being given to war and to our hurt nor does he overlook anything that can be used against us not only inciting in france the prince of salerno and other of our rebels but befriending every bad character in italy whom he deems our enemy and in all things he proceeds with the fraud and dissimulation natural to him and to make money he sells even the smallest office and preferment  thus ferrante of the man whose friendship he had been seeking some six weeks earlier and who had rejected his advances it is as well to know the precise conditions under which that letter was indited for extracts from it are too often quoted against alexander these conditions known and known the man who wrote it the letters proper value is at once apparent  it was ferrantes hope and no doubt the hope of giuliano della rovere that the king of spain would lend an ear to these grievances and move in the matter of attempting to depose alexander but an event more important than any other in the whole history of spainor of europe for that matterwas at the moment claiming its full attention and the trifling affairs of the king of naplestrifling by comparisonwent all unheeded for this was the year in which the genoese navigator cristofero colombo returned to tell of the new and marvellous world he had discovered beyond the seas and ferdinand and isabella were addressing an appeal to the popeas ruler of the worldto establish them in the possession of the discovered continent whereupon the pope drew a line from pole to pole and granted to spain the dominion over all lands discovered or to be discovered one hundred miles westward of cape verde and the azores  and thus ferrantes appeal to spain against a pope who showed himself so ready and complaisant a friend to spain went unheeded by ferdinand and isabella and what time the neapolitan nursed his bitter chagrin the alliance between rome and milan was consolidated by the marriage of lucrezia borgia to giovanni sforza the comely weakling who was lord of pesaro and cotignola  lucrezia borgias story has been told elsewhere her rehabilitation has been undertaken by a great historian1 among others and all seriousminded students must be satisfied at this time of day that the lucrezia borgia of hugos tragedy is a creature of fiction bearing little or no resemblance to the poor lady who was a pawn in the ambitious game played by her father and her brother cesare before she withdrew to ferrara where eventually she died in childbirth in her fortyfirst year we know that she left the duke her husband stricken with a grief that was shared by his subjects to whom she had so deeply endeared herself by her exemplary life and loving rule2     1  ferdinand gregorovius lucrezia borgia 2 see inter alia the letters of alfonso deste and giovanni gonzaga on her death quoted in gregorovius lucrezia borgia   later in the course of this narrative where she crosses the story of her brother cesare it will be necessary to deal with some of the revolting calumnies concerning her that were circulated and in passing shall be revealed the sources of the malice that inspired them and the nature of the evidence upon which they rest to the eternal shame alike of those pretended writers of fact and those avowed writers of fiction who as dead to scruples as to chivalry have not hesitated to make her serve their base melodramatic or pornographic ends  at present however there is no more than her first marriage to be recorded she was fourteen years of age at the time and like all the borgias of a rare personal beauty with blue eyes and golden hair twice before already had she entered into betrothal contracts with gentlemen of her fathers native spain but his eversoaring ambition had caused him successively to cancel both those unfulfilled contracts a husband worthy of the daughter of cardinal roderigo borgia was no longer worthy of the daughter of pope alexander vi for whom an alliance must now be sought among italys princely houses and so she came to be bestowed upon the lord of pesaro with a dowry of 30000 ducats  her nuptials were celebrated in the vatican on june 12 1493 in the splendid manner worthy of the rank of all concerned and of the reputation for magnificence which the borgia had acquired that night the pope gave a supperparty at which were present some ten cardinals and a number of ladies and gentlemen of rome besides the ambassadors of ferrara venice milan and france there was vocal and instrumental music a comedy was performed the ladies danced and they appear to have carried their gaieties well into the dawn hardly the sort of scene for which the vatican was the ideal stage yet at the time it should have given little or no scandal but what a scandal was there not shortly afterwards in connection with it and how that scandal was heaped up later by stories so revolting of the doings of that night that one is appalled at the minds that conceived them and the credulity that accepted them  infessura writes of what he heard and he writes venomously as he betrays by the bitter sarcasm with which he refers to the fifty silver cups filled with sweetmeats which the pope tossed into the laps of ladies present at the earlier part of the celebration he did it says infessura to the greater honour and glory of almighty god and the church of rome beyond that he ventures into no great detail checking himself betimes however with a suggested motive for reticence a thousand times worse than any formal accusation thus much else is said of which i do not write because either it is not true or if true incredible1     1  et multa alia dicta sunt que hic non scribo que aut non sunt vel si sunt incredibilia infessura diarium   it is amazing that the veil which infessura drew with those words should have been piercednot indeed by the cold light of fact but by the hot eye of prurient imagination amazing that he should be quoted at allhe who was not presentconsidering that we have the testimony of what did take place from the pen of an eyewitness in a letter from gianandrea boccaccio the ambassador of ferrara to his master  at the end of his letter which describes the proceedings and the weddinggifts and their presentation he tells us how the night was spent afterwards the ladies danced and as an interlude a worthy comedy was performed with much music and singing the pope and all the rest of us being present throughout what else shall i add it would make a long letter the whole night was spent in this manner let your lordship decide whether well or ill  is not that sufficient to stop the foul mouth of inventive slander what need to suggest happenings unspeakable yet it is the fashion to quote the last sentence above from boccaccios letter in the originaltotam noctem comsumpsimus judicet modo exma dominatio vestra si bene o maleas though decency forbade its translation and at once this poisonous reticence does its work and the imaginationand not only that of the unletteredis fired and all manner of abominations are speculatively conceived  infessura being absent says that the comedies performed were licentious lascive but what comedies of that age were not it was an age which had not yet invented modesty as we understand it that boccaccio who was present saw nothing unusual in the comedythere was only one according to himis proved by his description of it as worthy una degna commedia  m yriarte on this same subject1 is not only petty but grotesque he chooses to relate the incident from the point of view of infessura whom by the way he translates with an amazing freedom2 and he makes bold to add regarding gianandrea boccaccio that it must also be said that the ambassador of ferrara either because he did not see everything or because he was less austere than infessura was not shocked by the comedies etc soit quil nait pas tout vu soit quil ait été moins austère quinfessura nest pas choqué     1  la vie de césar borgia 2 thus in the matter of the fifty silver cups tossed by the pope into the ladies laps sinum is the word employed by infessuraa word which has too loosely been given its general translation of bosom ignoring that it equally means lap and that lap it obviously means in this instance m yriarte however goes a step further and prefers to translate it as corsage which at once and unpleasantly falsifies the picture and he adds matter to dot the is to an extent certainly not warranted even by infessura   m yriarte you observe does not scruple to opine that boccaccio who was present did not see everything but he has no doubt that infessura who was not present and who wrote from hearsay missed nothing  alas too much of the history of the borgias has been written in this spirit and the discrimination in the selection of authorities has ever been with a view to obtaining the more sensational rather than the more truthful narrative  although it is known that cesare came to rome in the early part of 1493for his presence there is reported by gianandrea boccaccio in march of that yearthere is no mention of him at this time in connection with his sisters wedding apparently then he was not present although it is impossible to suggest where he might have been at the time  boccaccio draws a picture of him in that letter which is worthy of attention on the day before yesterday i found cesare at home in trastevere he was on the point of setting out to go hunting and entirely in secular habit that is to say dressed in silk and armed riding together we talked a while i am among his most intimate acquaintances he is man of great talent and of an excellent nature his manners are those of the son of a great prince above everything he is joyous and lighthearted he is very modest much superior to and of a much finer appearance than his brother the duke of gandia who also is not short of natural gifts the archbishop never had any inclination for the priesthood but his benefice yields him over 16000 ducats  it may not be amissthough perhaps no longer very necessary after what has been writtento say a word at this stage on the social position of bastards in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries to emphasize the fact that no stigma attached to cesare borgia or to any other member of his fathers family on the score of the illegitimacy of their birth  it is sufficient to consider the marriages they contracted to perceive that however shocking the circumstances may appear to modern notions the circumstance of their father being a pope not only cannot have been accounted extraordinarily scandalous if scandalous at all but on the contrary rendered them eligible for alliances even princely  in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries we see the bastard born of a noble as noble as his father displaying his fathers arms without debruisement and enjoying his rank and inheritance unchallenged on the score of his birth even though that inheritance should be a throneas witness lucrezias husband giovanni who though a bastard of the house of sforza succeeded nevertheless his father in the tyranny of pesaro and cotignola  later we shall see this same lucrezia her illegitimacy notwithstanding married into the noble house of este and seated upon the throne of ferrara and before then we shall have seen the bastard cesare married to a daughter of the royal house of navarre already we have seen the bastard francesco cibo take to wife the daughter of the great lorenzo demedici and we have seen the bastard girolamo riario married to caterina sforzaa natural daughter of the ducal house of milanand we have seen the pair installed in the tyranny of imola and forli a score of other instances might be added but these should suffice  the matter calls for the making of no philosophies craves no explaining and above all needs no apology it clears itself the fifteenth and sixteenth centuriesmore just than our own more enlightened timesattributed no shame to the men and women born out of wedlock saw no reasonas no reason is there christian or paganwhy they should suffer for a condition that was none of their contriving  to mention it may be of help in visualizing and understanding that direct and forceful epoch and may even suggest some lenience in considering a popes carnal paternity to those to whom the point of view of the renaissance does not promptly suggest itself from this plain statement of fact all unargued as we leave it we recommend a perusal of gianpietro de crescenzis il nobile romano  the marriage of lucrezia borgia to giovanni sforza tightened the relations between the pope and milan as the pope intended meanwhile however the crafty and mistrustful lodovico having no illusions as to the true values of his allies and realizing them to be selfseekers like himself with interests that were fundamentally different from his own perceived that they were likely only to adhere to him for just so long as it suited their own ends he bethought him therefore of looking about him for other means by which to crush the power of naples france was casting longing eyes upon italy and it seemed to lodovico that in france was a ready catspaw charles viii as the representative of the house of anjou had a certain meagre claim upon the throne of naples if he could be induced to ride south lance on thigh and press that claim there would be an end to the dominion of the house of aragon and so an end to lodovicos fears of a neapolitan interference with his own occupation of the throne of milan  to an ordinary schemer that should have been enough but as a schemer lodovico was wholly extraordinary his plans grew in the maturing and took in sideissues until he saw that naples should be to charles viii as the cheese within the mousetrap let his advent into italy to break the power of naples be free and open but once within he should find milan and the northern allies between himself and his retreat and lodovicos should it be to bring him to his knees thus schemed lodovico to shiver first naples and then france before hurling the latter back across the alps a daring bold and yet simple plan of action and what a power in italy should not lodovico derive from its success  forthwith he got secretly to work upon it sending his invitation to charles to come and make good his claim to naples offering the french troops free passage through his territory1 and in the character of his invitation he played upon the nature of malformed ambitious charles whose brain was stuffed with romance and chivalric rhodomontades the conquest of naples was an easy affair no more than a step in the glorious enterprise that awaited the french king for from naples he could cross to engage the turk and win back the holy sepulchre thus becoming a second charles the great     1  see corlo storia di milano and lodovicos letter to charles viii quoted therein lib vii   thus lodovico maria the crafty to dazzle charles the romantic and to take the bull of impending invasion by the very horns  we have seen the failure of the appeal to spain against the pope made by the king of naples to that failure was now added the tightening of romes relations with milan by the marriage between lucrezia borgia and giovanni sforza and ferranterumours of a french invasion with naples for its objective being already in the airrealized that nothing remained him but to make another attempt to conciliate the popes holiness and this time he went about his negotiations in a manner better calculated to serve his ends since his need was grown more urgent he sent the prince of altamura again to rome for the ostensible purpose of settling the vexatious matter of cervetri and anguillara and making alliance with the holy father whilst behind altamura was the neapolitan army ready to move upon rome should the envoy fail this time  but on the terms now put forward alexander was willing to negotiate and so a peace was patched up between naples and the holy see the conditions of which were that orsini should retain the fiefs for his lifetime but that they should revert to holy church on his death and that he should pay the church for the lifelease of them the sum of 40000 ducats which already he had paid to francesco cibo that the peace should be consolidated by the marriage of the popes bastard giuffredo with sancia of aragon the natural daughter of the duke of calabria heir to the throne of naples and that she should bring the principality of squillace and the county of coriate as her dowry  the other condition demanded by naplesat the suggestion of cardinal giuliano della roverewas that the pope should disgrace and dismiss his vice­chancellor ascanio sforza which would have shattered the pontifical relations with milan to this however the pope would not agree but he met naples in the matter to the extent of consenting to overlook cardinal della roveres defection and receive him back into favour  on these terms the peace was at last concluded in august of 1493 and immediately afterwards there arrived in rome the sieur peron de basche an envoy from the king of france charged with the mission to prevent any alliance between rome and naples  the frenchman was behind the fair the pope took the only course possible under the awkward circumstances and refused to see the ambasssador thereupon the offended king of france held a grand council in which were proposed and treated many things against the pope and for the reform of the church  these royal outbursts of christianity these pious kingly frenzies to unseat an unworthy pontiff and reform the church follow always you will observe upon the miscarriage of royal wishes  in the consistory of september 1493 the pope created twelve new cardinals to strengthen the sacred college in general and his own hand in particular  amongst these new creations were the popes son cesare and alessandro farnese the brother of the beautiful giulia the grant of the red hat to the latter appears to have caused some scandal for owing to the popes relations with his sister to which it was openly said that farnese owed the purple he received the byname of cardinal della gonellacardinal of the petticoat  that was the first important step in the fortunes of the house of farnese which was to give dukes to parma and reach the throne of spain in the person of isabella farnese before becoming extinct in 1758      book ii the bull pascant  roma bovem invenit tunc cum fundatur aratro et nunc lapsa suo est ecce renata bove  from an inscription quoted by bernardino coaxo      chapter i the french invasion   you see cesare borgia now in his nineteenth year raised to the purple with the title of cardinaldeacon of santa maria nuovanotwithstanding which however he continues to be known in preference and indeed to sign himself by the title of his archbishopric cardinal of valencia  it is hardly necessary to mention that although already bishop of pampeluna and archbishop of valencia he had received so far only his first tonsure he never did receive any ecclesiastical orders beyond the minor and revocable ones  it was said by infessura and has since been repeated by a multitude of historians upon no better authority than that of this writer on hearsay and inveterate gossip that to raise cesare to the purple alexander was forced to prove the legitimacy of that young mans birth and that to this end he procured false witnesses to swear that he was the son of vannozza de catanei and her husband domenico darignano already has this been touched upon in an earlier chapter here it was shown that vannozza never had a husband of the name of darignano and it might reasonably be supposed that this circumstance alone would have sufficed to restrain any serious writer from accepting and repeating infessuras unauthoritative statement  but if more they needed it was ready to their hands in the bull of sixtus iv of october 1 1480to which also allusion has been madedispensing cesare from proving his legitimacy super defectum natalium od ordines et quoecumque beneficia  besides that of what avail would any false swearing have been considering that cesare was openly named borgia that he was openly acknowledged by his father and that in the very bull above mentioned he is stated to be the son of roderigo borgia  this is another instance of the lightness the recklessness with which alexander vi has been accused of unseemly and illicit conduct which it may not be amiss to mention at this stage since if not the accusation itself at least the matter that occasioned it belongs chronologically here  during the first months of his reignfollowing in the footsteps of predecessors who had made additions to the vaticanalexander set about the building of the borgia tower for its decoration he brought perugino pinturicchio volterrano and peruzzi to rome concerning pinturicchio and alexander vasari tells us in his vita degli artefici that over the door of one of the rooms in the borgia tower the artist painted a picture of the virgin mary in the likeness of giulia farnese who posed to him as the model with alexander kneeling to her in adoration arrayed in full pontificals  such a thing would have been horrible revolting sacrilegious fortunately it does not even amount to a truth untruly told and well would it be if all the lies against the borgias were as easy to refute true pinturicchio did paint giulia farnese as the madonna true also that he did paint alexander kneeling in adorationbut not to the madonna not in the same picture at all the madonna for which giulia farnese was the model is over a doorway as vasari says the kneeling alexander is in another room and the object of his adoration is the saviour rising from his tomb  yet one reputable writer after another has repeated that lie of vasaris and shocked us by the scandalous spectacle of a pope so debauched and lewd that he kneels in pontificals in adoration at the feet of his mistress depicted as the virgin mary  in october of that same year of 1493 cesare accompanied his father on a visit to orvieto a journey which appears to have been partly undertaken in response to an invitation from giulia farneses brother alessandro  orvieto was falling at the time into decay and ruin no longer the prosperous centre it had been less than a hundred years earlier but the shrewd eye of alexander perceived its value as a stronghold to be used as an outpost of rome or as a refuge in time of danger and he proceeded to repair and fortify it in the following summer cesare was invested with its governorship at the request of its inhabitants who sent an embassy to the pope with their proposalby way no doubt of showing their gratitude for his interest in the town  but in the meantime towards the end of 1493 king ferrantes uneasiness at the everswelling rumours of the impending french invasion was quickened by the fact that the pope had not yet sent his son giuffredo to naples to marry donna sancia as had been contracted ferrante feared the intrigues of milan with alexander and that the latter might be induced after all to join the northern league in a frenzy of apprehension the old king was at last on the point of going to milan to throw himself at the feet of lodovico sforza who was now his only hope when news reached him that his ambassadors had been ordered to leave france  that deathblow to his hopes was a deathblow to the man himself upon receiving the news he was smitten by an apoplexy and upon january 25 1494 he departed this life without the consolation of being able to suppose that any of his schemes had done anything to avert the impending ruin of his house  in spite of all alexanders intercessions and representations calculated to induce charles viii to abandon his descent upon italy in spite no less of the counsel he received at home from such farseeing men as had his ear the christian king was now determined upon the expedition and his preparations were well advanced in the month of march he assumed the title of king of sicily and sent formal intimation of it to alexander demanding his investiture at the hands of the pope and offering to pay him a heavy annual tribute alexander was thus given to choose between the wrath of france and the wrath of naples andto put the basest construction on his motiveshe saw that the peril from an enemy on his very frontiers would be more imminent than that of an enemy beyond the alps it is also possible that he chose to be guided by his sense of justice and to do in the matter what he considered right by whatever motive he was prompted the result was that he refused to accede to the wishes of the christian king  the consistory which received the french ambassadorperon de baschebecame the scene of stormy remonstrances cardinal giuliano della rovere of course supporting the ambassador and being supported in his act of insubordination by the vicechancellor ascanio sforza who represented his brother lodovico in the matter and the cardinals sanseverino colonna and savelli all attached to french interests peron de basche so far presumed no doubt emboldened by this support as to threaten the pope with deposition if he persisted in his refusal to obey the king of france  you see once more that kingly attitude and you shall see it yet again presently and be convinced of its precise worth in one hand a bribe of heavy annual tribute in the other a threat of deposition it was thus they conducted their business with the holy father in this instance his holiness took the threat and dismissed the insolent ambassador della rovere conceiving that in france he had a stouter ally than in naples and seeing that he had once more incurred the papal anger by his open enmity fled back to ostia and not feeling safe there for the pontifical forces were advancing upon his fortress took ship to genoa and thence to france to plot the popes ruin with the exasperated charles and the charge of simony being the only weapon with which they could attack alexanders seat upon the papal throne the charge of simony was once more brandished  his holiness took the matter with a becoming and stately calm he sent his nephew giovanni borgia to naples to crown alfonso and with him went giuffredo borgia to carry out the marriage contract with alfonsos daughter and thus strengthen the alliance between rome and naples  by the autumn charles had crossed the alps with the most formidable army that had ever been sent out of france full ninety thousand strong and so badly was the war conducted by the neapolitan generals who were sent to hold him in check that the appearance of the french under the very walls of rome was almost such as to take the pope by surprise charless advance from the north had been so swift and unhindered that alexander contemptuously said the french soldiers had come into italy with wooden spurs and chalk in their hands to mark their lodgings  charles had been well received by the intriguing lodovico sforza with whom he visited the castle of pavia and the unfortunate gian galeazzo who from long confinement chagrin and other causes was now reduced to the sorriest condition indeed on october 22 some days after that visit the wretched prince expired whether or not lodovico had him poisoned as has been allegeda charge which after all rests on no proof nor even upon the word of any person of reliancehis death most certainly lies at his ambitious uncles door  charles was at piacenza when the news of gian galeazzos death reached him like the good christian that he accounted himself he ordered the most solemn and imposing obsequies for the poor youth for whom in life he had done nothing  gian galeazzo left a heartbroken girlwidow and two children to succeed him to the throne he had never been allowed to occupythe eldest francesco sforza being a boy of five nevertheless lodovico was elected duke of milan not only did he suborn the parliament of milan to that end but he induced the emperor to confirm him in the title to this the emperor consented seeking to mask the unscrupulous deed by a pitiful sophism he expounded that the throne of milan should originally have been lodovicos and never galeazzo marias gian galeazzos father because the latter was born before francesco sforza had become duke of milan whereas lodovico was born when he already was so  the obsequies of gian galeazzo completed charles pushed on from florence he issued his manifesto and although this confined itself to claiming the kingdom of naples and said no word of punishing the pope for his disobedience in crowning alfonso and being now in alliance with him it stirred up grave uneasiness at the vatican  the popes position was becoming extremely difficult nevertheless he wore the boldest possible face when he received the ambassadors of france and on december 9 refused to grant the letters patent of passage through the pontifical states which the french demanded thereupon charles advanced threateningly upon rome and was joined now by those turbulent barons orsini colonna and savelli  alexander vi has been widely accused of effecting a volteface at this stage and betraying his neapolitan allies but his conduct properly considered can hardly amount to that what concessions he made to france were such as a wise and inadequately supported man must make to an army ninety thousand strong to be recklessly and quixotically heroic is not within the function of popes moreover alexander had rome to think of for charles had sent word that if he were resisted he would leave all in ruins whereas if a free passage were accorded him he would do no hurt nor suffer any pillage to be done in rome  so the pope did the only thing consistent with prudence he made a virtue of necessity and gave way where it was utterly impossible for him to resist he permitted charles the passage through his territory which charles was perfectly able to take for himself if refused there ensued an interchange of compliments between pope and king and early in january charles entered rome in such warlike panoply as struck terror into the hearts of all beholders of that entrance paolo giovio has left us an impressive picture  the vanguard was composed of swiss and german mercenariestall fellows these professional warriors superb in their carriage and stepping in time to the beat of their drums they were dressed in variegated closefitting garments that revealed all their athletic symmetry a fourth of them were armed with long squarebladed halberts new to italy the remainder trailed their tenfoot pikes and carried a short sword at their belts whilst to every thousand of them there were a hundred arquebusiers after them came the french infantry without armour save the officers who wore steel corselets and headpieces these again were followed by five thousand gascon arbalisters each shouldering his arbalesta phalanx of short rude fellows not to be compared with the stately swiss next came the cavalry advancing in squadrons glittering and resplendent in their steel casings 2500 of these were in full heavy armour wielding iron maces and the ponderous lances that were usual also in italy every manatarms had with him three horses mounted by a squire and two valets four men going to the lance in france some 5000 of the cavalry were more lightly armed in corselets and headpiece only and they carried long wooden bows in the english fashion whilst some were armed with pikes intended to complete the work of the heavier cavalry these were followed by 200 knightsthe very flower of french chivalry for birth and valourshouldering their heavy iron maces their armour covered by purple goldembroidered surcoats behind them came 400 mounted archers forming the bodyguard of the king  the misshapen monarch himself was the very caricature of a man hideous and grotesque as a gargoyle he was short of stature spindleshanked rachitic and malformed and of his face with its colossal nose loose mouth and shallow brow giovio says that it was the ugliest ever seen on man  such was the person of the young kinghe was twentyfour years of age at the timewho poured his legions into rome and all fullarmed as if for work of immediate destruction seen as they were by torchlight and the blaze of kindled bonfiresfor night had fallen long before the rearguard had entered the citythey looked vague fantastic and terrifying but the most aweinspiring sight of all was kept for the end it consisted of the thirtysix pieces of artillery which brought up the rear each piece upon a carriage swiftly drawn by horses and the longest measuring eight feet weighing six thousand pounds and discharging an iron ball as big as a mans head  the king lay in the palace of san marco where a lodging had been prepared for him and thither on the day after his entrance came cesare borgia with six cardinals from the castle of sant angelo whither the pope had withdrawn to wait upon his christian majesty charles immediately revealed the full and exigent nature of his demands he required the popes aid and counsel in the conquest of naples upon which he was proceeding that cesare borgia be delivered into his hands as a hostage to ensure the popes friendliness and that the castle of sant angelo be handed over to him to be used as a retreat in case of need or danger further he demanded that prince djemthe brother of sultan bajazet who was in the popes handsshould be delivered up to him as a further hostage  this djem gem or zizim as his name is variously spelled was the second son of mahomet ii whose throne he had disputed with his brother bajazet on their fathers death he had raised an army to enforce his claim and had not lacked for partisans but he was defeated and put to flight by his brother for safety he had delivered himself up to the knights of rhodes whom he knew to be bajazets implacable enemies they made him very welcome for daubusson the grand master of rhodes realized that the possession of the princes person was a very fortunate circumstance for christianity since by means of such a hostage the turk could be kept in submission accordingly daubusson had sent him to france and wrote while djem lives and is in our hands bajazet will never dare to make war upon christians who will thus enjoy great peace thus is it salutary that djem should remain in our power and in france djem had been well received and treated with every consideration due to a person of his princely rank  but he appears to have become a subject of contention among the powers several of which urged that he could be of greater service to christianity in their hands than in those of france thus the king of hungary had demanded him because being a neighbour of bajazets he was constantly in apprehension of turkish raids ferdinand of spain had desired him because the possession of him would assist the catholic king in the expulsion of the moors ferrante of naples had craved him because he lived in perpetual terror of a turkish invasion  in the end he had been sent to rome whither he went willingly under the advice of the knights of rhodes whose prisoner he really considered himself they had discovered that bajazet was offering enormous bribes to charles for the surrender of him and they feared lest charles should succumb to the temptation  so prince djem had come to rome in the reign of pope innocent viii and there he had since remained sultan bajazet making the pope an annual allowance of forty thousand ducats for his brothers safe custody he was a willing prisoner or rather a willing exile for far from being kept a prisoner he was treated at rome with every consideration associating freely with those about the pontifical court and being frequently seen abroad in company with the pope and the duke of gandia  now charles was aware that the pope in his dread of a french invasion and seeing vain all his efforts to dissuade charles from making his descent upon italy had appealed for aid to bajazet for so doing he has been severely censured and with some justice for the picture of the head of christianity making appeal to the infidel to assist him against christians is not an edifying one still it receives some measure of justification when we reflect what was the attitude of these same christians towards their head  bajazet himself thrown into a panic at the thought of djem falling into the hands of a king who proposed to make a raid upon him answered the pope begging his holiness to have djem removed from the tribulations of this world and his soul transported to another where he might enjoy a greater peace for this service he offered the pope 300000 ducats to be paid on delivery of the princes body and if the price was high so was the service required for it would have ensured bajazet a peace of mind he could not hope to enjoy while his brother lived  this letter was intercepted by giovanni della rovere the prefect of sinigaglia who very promptly handed it to his brother the cardinal giuliano the cardinal in his turn laid it before the king of france who now demanded of the pope the surrender of the person of this djem as a further hostage  alexander began by rejecting the kings proposals severally and collectively but charles pressed him to reconsider his refusal and so being again between the sword and the wall the pope was compelled to submit a treaty was drawn up and signed on january 15 the king on his side promising to recognize the pope and to uphold him in all his rights  on the following day charles made solemn act of veneration to the pontiff in consistory kissing his ring and his foot and professing obedience to him as the kings of france his forbears had ever done words for deeds  charles remained twelve days longer in rome and set out at last on january 28 upon the conquest of naples first he went solemnly to take his leave of the pope and they parted with every outward mark of a mutual esteem which they most certainly cannot have experienced when charles knelt for the popes blessing alexander raised him up and embraced him whilst cesare completed the show of friendliness by presenting charles with six beautiful chargers  they set out immediately afterwards the french king taking with him his hostages neither of which he was destined to retain for long with cesare riding in the place of honour on his right  the army lay at marino that night and on the following at velletri in the latter city charles was met by an ambassador of spainantonio da fonseca ferdinand and isabella were moved at last to befriend their cousins of naples whom all else had now abandoned and at the same time serve their own interests their ambassador demanded that charles should abandon his enterprise and return to france or else be prepared for war with spain  it is eminently probable that cesare had knowledge of this ultimatum to charles and that his knowledge influenced his conduct however that may be he slipped out of velletri in the dead of that same night disguised as a groom half a mile out of the town francesco del sacco an officer of the podestá of velletri awaited him with a horse and on this he sped back to rome where he arrived on the night of the 30th he went straight to the house of one antonio flores an auditor of the tribunal of the ruota and a person of his confidence who through his influence and protection was destined to rise to the eminence of the archbishopric of avignon and papal nuncio to the court of france  cesare remained at floress house sending word to the pope of his presence but not attempting to approach the vatican on the following day he withdrew to the stronghold of spoleto  meanwhile rome was thrown into a panic by the young cardinals action and the dread of reprisals on the part of france the quaking municipality sent representatives to charles to assure him that rome had had nothing to do with this breach of the treaty and to implore him not to visit it upon the city the king replied by a special embassy to the pope and there apparently dropped the matter for a few days later cesare reappeared at the vatican  charles meanwhile despite the threats of spain pushed on to accomplish his easy conquest  king alfonso had already fled the kingdom january 25 abdicating in favour of his brother federigo his avowed object was to withdraw to sicily retire from the world and do penance for his sins for which no doubt there was ample occasion the real spur was probablyas opined by comminescowardice for says that frenchman jamais homme cruel ne fut hardi  federigos defence of the realm consigned to him was not conspicuous for the french entered naples almost without striking a blow within twenty days of their departure from rome  scarcely had charles laid aside his armour when death robbed him of the second hostage he had brought from the vatican on february 25 after a weeks illness prince djem died of dysentery at the castle of capua whither charles had sent him  rumours that he had been poisoned by the pope arose almost at once but considering that twenty­eight days had elapsed since his parting from alexander it was with the best intentions in the world rather difficult to make that poisoning credible until the bright notion was conceived and made public that the poison used was a white powder of unknown components which did its work slowly and killed the victim some time after it had been administered thus by a bold and brazen invention an impossible falsehood was made to wear a possible aspect  and in that you have most probably the origin of the famous secret poison of the borgias having been invented to fit the alleged poisoning of prince djem which it was desired to fasten upon the pope by hook or by crook it was found altogether too valuable an invention not to be used again by means of it it became possible to lay almost any death in the world at the door of alexander  before proceeding to inquire further into this particular case let us here and now say that just as today there is no inorganic toxin known to science that will either lie fallow for weeks in the human system suddenly to become active and slay or yet to kill by slow degrees involving some weeks in the process so none was known in the borgian or any other era science indeed will tell you that the very notion of any such poison is flagrantly absurd and that such a toxic action is against all the laws of nature  but a scientific disquisition is unnecessary for our present needs arguments of common sense should abundantly suffice this poisonthis white powderwas said to be a secret of the borgias if that is so by what borgia was the secret of its existence ever divulged or if it never was divulged how comes it to be known that a poison so secret and working at such distances of time was ever wielded by them  the very nature of its alleged action was such as utterly to conceal the hand that had administered it yet here on the first recorded occasion of its alleged use it was more or less common knowledge if giovio and guicciardini are to be believed  sagredo1 says that djem died at terracina three days after having been consigned to charles viii of poison administered by alexander to whom bajazet had promised a large sum of money for the deed the same is practically giovios statement save that giovio causes him to die at a later date and at gaeta guicciardini and corio tell a similar story but inform us that he died in naples     1  in mem storiche dei monarchi ottomani   it is entirely upon the authority of these four writers that the pope is charged with having poisoned djem and it is noteworthy that in the four narratives we find different dates and three different places given as the date and place of the turks death and more noteworthy still that in not one instance of these four is date or place correctly stated  now the place where djem died and the date of his death were public facts about which there was no mystery they were to be ascertainedas they are stillby any painstaking examiner his poisoning on the other hand was admittedly a secret matter the truth of which it was impossible to ascertain with utter and complete finality yet of this poisoning they know all the secrets these four nimble writers who cannot correctly tell us where or when the man died  we will turn from the fictions they have left uswhich alas have but too often been preferred by subsequent writers to the true facts which lay just as ready to their hands but of course were less sensationaland we will consider instead the evidence of those contemporaries who do at least know the time and place of djems decease  if any living man might have known of a secret poison of the borgias at this stage that man was burchard the caeremoniarius and had he known of it not for a moment would he have been silent on the point yet not a word of this secret poison shall you find in his diaries and concerning the death of djem he records that on february 25 died at the castle of capua the said djem through meat or drink that disagreed with him  panvinio who being a neapolitan was not likely to be any too friendly to the popeas indeed he proves again and againtells us positively that djem died of dysentry at capua1     1  vitis pontif rom   sanuto writing to the council of ten says that djem took ill at capua of a catarrh which descended to his stomach and that so he died  and now mark sanutos reasoning upon his death which is the very reasoning we should ourselves employ finally to dispose of this chatter of poisoning did we not find it awaiting quotation more authoritative therefore than it could be from us and utterly irrefutable and conclusive in its logic this death is very harmful to the king of france to all italy and chiefly to the pope who is thereby deprived of 40000 ducats yearly which was paid him by his djems brother for his custody and the king showed himself greatly grieved by this death and it was suspected that the pope had poisoned him which however was not to be believed as it would have been to his own loss  just soto his own infinite loss not only of the 40000 ducats yearly but of the hold which the custody of djem gave him upon the turks  the reason assigned by those who charged alexander with this crime was the bribe of 300000 ducats offered by bajezet in the intercepted letter the offerwhich incidentally had never reached the popewas instantly taken as proof of its acceptancea singular case of making cause follow upon effect a method all too prevalent with the borgian chroniclers moreover they entirely overlooked the circumstance that for djems death in the hands of france the pope could make no claim upon bajazet  finallythough the danger be incurred of becoming tedious upon this pointthey also forgot that years before bajazet had offered such bribes to charles for the life of djem as had caused the knights of rhodes to remove the turk from french keeping upon that circumstance they might had it sorted with their inclinations have set up a stronger case of poisoning against charles than against the pope and they would not have been put to the necessity of inventing a toxin that never had place in any earthly pharmacopoeia  it is not by this suggested that there is any shadow of a case against charles djem died a perfectly natural death as is established by the only authorities competent to speak upon the matter and his death was against the interests of everybody save his brother bajazet and against nobodys so much as the popes     chapter ii the pope and the supernatural   by the middle of march of that year 1495 the conquest of naples was a thoroughly accomplished fact and the french rested upon their victory took their ease and made merry in the capital of the vanquished kingdom  but in the north lodovico sforzanow duke of milan de facto as we have seenset about the second part of the game that was to be played he had a valuable ally in venice which looked none too favourably on the french and was fully disposed to gather its forces against the common foe the council of ten sent their ambassador zorzi to the pope to propose an alliance  news reached charles in naples of the league that was being formed he laughed at it and the matter was made the subject of ridicule in some of the comedies that were being performed for the amusement of his court meanwhile the intrigue against him went forward on march 26 his holiness sent the golden rose to the doge and on palm sunday the league was solemnly proclaimed in st peters its terms were vague there was nothing in it that was directly menacing to charles it was simply declared to have been formed for the common good but in the north the forces were steadily gathering to cut off the retreat of the french and suddenly lodovico sforza threw aside the mask and made an attack upon the french navy at genoa  at last charles awoke to his danger and began to care for his safety rapidly he organized the occupation of naples and leaving montpensier as viceroy and daubigny as captaingeneral he set out for rome with his army intent upon detaching the pope from the league for the pope being the immediate neighbour of naples would be as dangerous as an enemy as he was valuable as an ally to charles  he entered rome on june 1 the pope however was not there to receive him alexander had left on may 28 for orvieto accompanied by cesare the sacred college 200 menatarms and 1000 horse and 3000 foot supplied by venice at orvieto on june 3 the pontiff received an ambassador from the emperor who had joined the league and on the 4th he refused audience to the ambassador of france sent to him from ronciglione where the king had halted charles insistent sent again determined to see the pope but alexander quite as determined not to see the king pushed on to perugia with his escort  there his holiness abode until the french and italians had met on the river taro and joined battle at fornovo of which encounter both sides claimed the victory if charless only object was to win through then the victory undoubtedly was his for he certainly succeeded in cutting a way through the italians who disputed his passage but he suffered heavily and left behind him most of his precious artillery his tents and carriages and the immense neapolitan booty he was taking home with which he had loaded says gregorovius twenty thousand mules all this fell into the hands of the italian allies under gonzaga of mantua whilst from fornovo charless retreat was more in the nature of a flight thus he won back to france no whit the better for his expedition and the only mark of his passage which he left behind him was an obscene ailment which with the coming of the french into italy first manifested itself in europe and which the italians paid them the questionable compliment of calling the french diseasemorbo gallico or il mal francese  during the popes visit to perugia an incident occurred which is not without importance to students of his character and of the character left of him by his contemporaries and others  there lived in perugia at this time a young nun of the order of st dominic who walked in the way of st catherine of siena colomba da rieti by name you will find some marvellous things about her in the perugian chronicles of matarazzo which for that matter abound in marvellous thingstoo marvellous mostly to be true  when he deals with events happening beyond the walls of his native town matarazzo as an historian is contemptible to a degree second only to that of those who quote him as an authority when he deals with matters that so to speak befell under his very eyes he is worthy if not of credit at least of attention for his atmosphere is valuable  of this sister colomba matarazzo tells us that she ate not nor drank save sometimes some jujube fruit and even these but rarely on the day of her coming to perugia which happened in 1488 as she was crossing the bridge of st gianni some young men attempted to lay hands upon her for she was comely and beautiful but as they did so she showed them the jujube fruit which she carried in a white cloth whereupon they instantly stood bereft of strength and wits  next he tells us how she would pass from life for an hour or two and sometimes for half a day and her pulse would cease to beat and she would seem all dead and then she would quiver and come to herself again and prophesy the future and threaten disaster and again one morning two of her teeth were found to have fallen out which had happened in fighting with the devil and for the many intercessions which she made and the scandals which she repaired by her prayers the people came to call her saint  notwithstanding all this and the fact that she lived without nourishment he tells us that the brothers of st francis had little faith in her nevertheless the community built her a very fine monastery which was richly endowed and many nuns took the habit of her order  now it happened that whilst at perugia in his student days cesare had witnessed a miracle performed by this poor ecstatic girl or rather he had arrived on the scenethe church of st catherine of sienato find her with a little naked boy in her lap the centre of an excited frenzied crowd which was proclaiming loudly that the child had been dead and that she had resurrected him this was a statement which the prior of the dominicans did not seem disposed unreservedly to accept for when approached with a suggestion that the bells should be rung in honour of the event he would not admit that he saw any cause to sanction such a course  in the few years that were sped since then however sister colomba had acquired the great reputation of which matarazzo tells us so that throughout the plain of tiber the dominicans were preaching her fame from convent to convent in december of 1495 charles viii heard of her at siena and was stirred by a curiosity which he accounted devotionalthe same curiosity that caused one of his gentlemen to entreat savonarola to perform just a little miracle for the kings entertainment you can picture the gloomy fanatics reception of that invitation  the pope now took the opportunity of his sojourn in perugia to pay colomba da rieti a visit and there can be no doubt that he did so in a critical spirit accompanied by cesare and some cardinals and gentlemen of his following he went to the church of st dominic and was conducted to the sisters cell by the priorthe same who in cesares studentdays had refused to have the bells rung  upon seeing the magnificent figure of the pontiff filling the doorway of her little chamber sister colomba fell at his feet and taking hold of the hem of his gown she remained prostrate and silent for some moments when at last she timidly arose alexander set her some questions concerning the divine mysteries these she answered readily at first but as his questions grew she faltered became embarrassed and fell silent standing before him white and trembling no doubt a very piteous figure the pope not liking this turned to the prior to demand an explanation and admonished him sternly caveto pater quia ego papa sum  this had the effect of throwing the prior into confusion and he set himself to explain that she was in reality very wonderful that he himself had not at first believed in her but that he had seen so much that he had been converted at this stage cesare came to his aid bearing witness as he could that he himself had seen the prior discredit her when others were already hailing her as a saint wherefore if he now was convinced he must have had very good evidence to convince him we can imagine the priors gratitude to the young cardinal for that timely word when he saw himself in danger perhaps of being called to account for fostering and abetting an imposture  what was alexanders opinion of her in the end we do not know but we do know that he was not readily credulous when for instance he heard that the stigmata were alleged to have appeared upon the body of lucia di narni he did what might be expected of a sceptic of our own times rather than of a churchman of his superstitious agehe sent his physicians to examine her  that is but one instance of his commonsense attitude towards supernatural manifestations his cold calm judgement caused him to seek by all available and practical means to discriminate between the true and the spurious in an age in which men by their credulity were but too ready to become the prey of any impostor it argues a breadth of mind altogether beyond the times in which he had his being witches and warlocks who elsewhereand even in much later ages and in protestant as well as catholic stateswere given to the fire he contemptuously ignored the unfortunate moors and jews who elsewhere in europe were being persecuted by the holy inquisition and burnt at the stake as an act of faith for the good of their souls and the greater honour and glory of god found in alexander a tolerant protector and in rome a safe shelter  these circumstances concerning him are not sufficiently known it is good to know them for their own sake but apart from that they have a great historical value which it is well to consider it is not to be imagined that such breadth of views could be tolerated in a pope in the dawn of the sixteenth century the times were not ripe for it men did not understand it and what men do not understand they thirst to explain and have a way of explaining in their own fashion and according to their own lights  a pope who did such things could not be a good pope since such things must be abhorrent to godas men conceived god then  to understand this is to understand much of the bad feeling against alexander and his family for this is the source of much of it because he did not burn witches and magicians it was presently said that he was himself a warlock and that he practised black magic it was not perhaps wanton calumny it was said in good faith for it was the only reason the times could think of that should account for his restraint because he tolerated moors and jews it was presently said by some that he was a moor by others that he was a jew and by others still that he was both  what wonder then if the rancorous cardinal giuliano della rovere venomously dubbed him moor and jew and the rabid fanatic savonarola screamed that he was no pope at all that he was not a christian nor did he believe in any god  misunderstood in these matters he was believed to be an infidel and no crime was too impossible to be fastened upon the man who was believed to be that in the italy of the cinquecento  alexander however was very far from being an infidel very far from not being a christian very far from not believing in god as he has left abundant evidence in the bulls he issued during his pontificate it is certainly wrong to assumeand this is pointed out by lespinoisthat a private life which seems to ignore the commandments of the church must preclude the possibility of a public life devoted to the service of the church this is far from being the case such a state of thingssuch a dual personalityis by no means inconsistent with churchmen of the fifteenth or for that matter of the twentieth century  the whole truth of the matter is contained in a portuguese rhyme which may roughly be translated       soundly father thomas preaches      dont do as he does do as he teaches  a debauchee may preach virtue with salutary effect just as a man may preach hygiene without practising the privations which it entails or may save you from dyspepsia by pointing out to you what is indigestible without himself abstaining from it  such was the case of alexander vi as we are justified in concluding from the evidence that remains  let us consider the apostolic zeal revealed by his bull granting america to spain this was practically concededas the very terms of it will showon condition that spain should employ the dominion accorded her over the new world for the purpose of propagating the christian faith and the conversion and baptism of the heathen this is strictly enjoined and emphasized by the command that spain shall send out godfearing men who are learned in religion and capable of teaching it to the people of the newly discovered lands  thus alexander invented the missionary  to king manuel the fortunate of portugal who sought his authority for the conquest of africa he similarly enjoined that he should contrive that the name of the saviour be adored there and the catholic faith spread and honoured to the end that the king might win eternal life and the blessing of the holy see  to the soldiers going upon this expedition his holiness granted the same indulgences as to those who fought in the holy land and he aided the kings of spain and portugal in this propagation of christianity out of the coffers of the church  he sent to america a dozen of the children of st francis as apostles to preach the faith and he invested them with the amplest powers  he prosecuted with stern rigour the heretics of bohemia who were obscenely insulting church and sacraments and he proceeded similarly against the picards and vaudois against the lombard demoniacs who had grown bold were banding themselves together and doing great evil to property to life and to religion alexander raised his mighty arm  then there is his bull of june 1 1501 against those who already were turning to evil purposes the newly discovered printingpress in this he inveighed against the printing of matter prejudicial to healthy doctrine to good manners and above all to the catholic faith or anything that should give scandal to the faithful he threatened the printers of impious works with excommunication should they persist and enlisted secular weapons to punish them in a temporal as well as a spiritual manner he ordered the preparation of indexes of all works containing anything hurtful to religion and pronounced a ban of excommunication against all who should peruse the books so indexed  thus alexander invented the index expurgatorius  there is abundant evidence that he was a fervid celebrant and of his extreme devotion to the blessed virginin whose honour he revived the ringing of the angelus bellshall be considered later  whatever his private life it is idle to seek to show that his public career was other than devoted to the upholding of the dignity and honour of the church     chapter iii the roman barons   having driven charles viii out of italy it still remained for the allies to remove all traces of his passage from naples and to restore the rule of the house of aragon in this they had the aid of ferdinand and isabella who sent an army under the command of that distinguished soldier gonzalo de cordoba known in his day as the great captain  he landed in calabria in the spring of 1496 and war broke out afresh through that already sorely devastated land the spaniards were joined by the allied forces of venice and the church under the condotta of the marquis gonzaga of mantua the leader of the italians at fornovo  lodovico had detached himself from the league and again made terms with france for his own safetys sake but his cousin giovanni sforza tyrant of pesarothe husband of lucrezia borgiacontinued in the pontifical army at the head of a condotta of 600 lances another command in the same ranks was one of 700 lances under the youthful giuffredo borgia now prince of squillace and the husband of doña sancia of aragon a lady of exceedingly loose morals who had brought to rome the habits acquired in the most licentious court of that licentious age  the french lost naples even more easily than they had conquered it and by july 7 ferdinand ii was able to reenter his capital and reascend his throne daubigny the french general withdrew to france whilst montpensier the viceroy retired to pozzuoli where he died in the following year  nothing could better have suited the purposes of alexander than the state of things which now prevailed affording him as it did the means to break the power of the insolent roman barons who already had so vexed and troubled him so in the consistory of june 1 he published a bull whereby gentile virginio orsini giangiordano orsini and his bastard paolo orsini and bartolomeo dalviano were declared outlawed for having borne arms with france against the church and their possessions were confiscated to the state this decree was to be enforced by the sword and for the purposes of the impending war the duke of gandia was recalled to rome he arrived early in august having left at gandia his wife maria enriquez a niece of the royal house of spain it was cesare borgia who took the initiative in the pomp with which his brother was received in rome riding out at the head of the entire pontifical court to meet and welcome the young duke  in addition to being duke of gandia giovanni borgia was already duke of sessa and prince of teano which further dignities had been conferred upon him on the occasion of his brother giuffredos marriage to donna sancia to these the pope now added the governorship of viterbo and of the patrimony of st peter dispossessing cardinal farnese of the latter office to bestow it upon this wellbeloved son  in venice it was being related a few months laterin octoberthat gandia had brought a woman from spain for his father and that the latter had taken her to live with him the story is given in sanuto and of course has been unearthed and served up by most historians and essayists it cannot positively be said that it is untrue but it can be said that it is unconfirmed there is for instance no word of it in burchards diarium and when you consider how ready a chronicler of scandalous matter was this master of ceremonies you will no doubt conclude that if any foundation there had been for that venetian story burchard would never have been silent on the subject  the pope had taken into his pay that distinguished condottiero duke guidobaldo of urbino who later was to feel the relentless might of cesare to guidobaldos command was now entrusted the punitive expedition against the orsini and with him was to go the duke of gandia ostensibly to share the leadership in reality that under so able a master he might serve his apprenticeship to the trade of arms so on october 25 giovanni borgia was very solemnly created gonfalonier of the church and captaingeneral of the pontifical troops on the same day the three standards were blessed in st petersone being the papal gonfalon bearing the arms of the church and the other two the personal banners of guidobaldo and gandia the two condottieri attended the ceremony arrayed in full armour and received the white truncheons that were the emblems of their command  on the following day the army set out accompanied by the cardinal de luna as papal legate a latere and within a month ten orsini strongholds had surrendered  so far all had been easy for the papal forces but now the orsini rallied in the last three fortresses that remained thembracciano trevignano and anguillara and their resistance suddenly acquired a stubborn character particularly that of bracciano which was captained by bartolomeo dalviano a clever resourceful young soldier who was destined to go far thus the campaign so easily conducted at the outset received a check which caused it to drag on into the winter and now the barons received further reinforcements vitellozzo vitelli the tyrant of città di castello came to the aid of the orsini as did also the turbulent baglioni of perugia the della rovere in rome and all those who were inimical to alexander vi on the other hand however the barons colonna and savelli ranged themselves on the side of the pope  already trevignano had fallen and the attack of the pontifical army was concentrated upon bracciano hard pressed and with all supplies cut off bartolomeo dalviano was driven to the very verge of surrender when over the hills came carlo orsini with the men of vitellozzo vitelli to take the papal forces by surprise and put them to utter rout guidobaldo was made prisoner whilst the duke of gandia fabrizio colonna and the papal legate narrowly escaped and took shelter in ronciglione the popes son being slightly wounded in the face  it was a severe and sudden conclusion to a war that had begun under such excellent auspices for the pontificals yet notwithstanding that defeat which had left guns and baggage in the hands of the enemy the pope was the gainer by the campaign having won eleven strongholds from the orsini in exchange for one battle lost  the barons now prepared to push home their advantage and complete the victory but the pope checkmated them by an appeal to gonzalo de cordoba who promptly responded and came with prospero colonna to the aid of the church he laid siege to ostia which was being held for the cardinal della rovere and compelled it to a speedy surrender thereby bringing the orsini resistance practically to an end for the present the might of the barons was broken and they were forced to pay alexander the sum of 50000 ducats to redeem their captured fortresses  gonzalo de cordoba made a triumphal entry into rome bringing with him monaldo da guerra the unfortunate defender of ostia in chains he was received with great honour by the duke of gandia accompanied by his brotherinlaw giovanni sforza and they escorted him to the vatican where the pope awaited him  this was but one of the many occasions just then on which giovanni sforza was conspicuous in public in close association with his fatherinlaw the pope burchard mentions his presence at the blessing of the candles on the feast of the purification and shows him to us as a candlebearer standing on the popes right hand again we see him on palm sunday in attendance upon alexander he and gandia standing together on the steps of the pontifical throne in the sixtine chapel during the blessing of the palms there and elsewhere lucrezias husband is prominently in the public eye during those months of february and march of 1497 and we generally see him sharing with the duke of gandia the honour of close attendance upon the pontiff all of which but serves to render the more marked his sudden disappearance from that scene  the matter of his abrupt and precipitate flight from rome is one concerning which it is unlikely that the true and complete facts will ever be revealed it was public gossip at this time that his marriage with lucrezia was not a happy one and that discord marred their life together lucrezias reported grievance upon this subject reads a little vaguely to us now whatever it may have conveyed at the time she complained that giovanni did not fittingly keep her company1 which may be taken to mean that a good harmony did not prevail between them or almost equally well that there were the canonical grounds for complaint against him as a husband which were afterwards formally preferred and made the grounds for the divorce it is also possible that alexanders ambition may have urged him to dissolve the marriage to the end that she might be free to be used again as a pawn in his farreaching game     1  che non gli faceva buona compagnia   all that we do know positively is that one evening in holy week sforza mounted a turkish horse and on the pretext of going as far as the church of sant onofrio to take the air he slipped out of rome and so desperately did he ride that twentyfour hours later he was home in pesaro his horse dropping dead as he reached the town  certainly some terrible panic must have urged him and this rather lends colour to the story told by almerici in the memorie di pesaro according to this the lord of pesaros chamberlain giacomino was in lucrezias apartments one evening when cesare was announced whereupon by lucrezias orders giacomino concealed himself behind a screen the cardinal of valencia entered and talked freely with his sister the essence of his conversation being that the order had been issued for her husbands death  the inference to be drawn from this is that giovanni had been given to choose in the matter of a divorce and that he had refused to be a party to it whence it was resolved to remove him in a still more effective manner  be that as it may the chroniclers of pesaro proceed to relate that after cesare had left her lucrezia asked giacomino if he had heard what had been said and upon being answered in the affirmative urged him to go at once and warn giovanni it was as a consequence of this alleged warning that giovanni made his precipitate departure  a little while later at the beginning of june lucrezia left the vatican and withdrew to the convent of san sisto in the appian way a step which immediately gave rise to speculation and to unbridled gossip all of which however is too vague to be worthy of the least attention aretinos advices to the cardinal ippolito deste suggest that she did not leave the vatican on good terms with her family and it is very possible if what the pesaro chroniclers state is true that her withdrawal arose out of her having warned giovanni of his danger and enabled him to escape  at about the same time that lucrezia withdrew to her convent her brother gandia was the recipient of further honours at the hands of his fond father the pope had raised the fief of benevento to a dukedom and as a dukedom conferred it upon his son to him and to his legitimate heirs for ever to this he added the valuable lordships of terracina and pontecorvo  cesare meanwhile had by no means been forgotten and already this young cardinal waswith perhaps the sole exception of the cardinal destoutevillethe richest churchman in christendom to his many other offices and benefices it was being proposed to add that of chamberlain of the holy see cardinal riario who held the office being grievously ill and his recovery despaired of together with that office it was the popes avowed intention to bestow upon cesare the palace of the late cardinal of mantua and with it no doubt he would receive a proportion of the dead cardinals benefices  cesare was twentytwo years of age at the time tall of an athletic slenderness and exceedingly graceful in his movements he was acknowledged to be the handsomest man of his age his face was long and pale his brow lofty his nose delicately aquiline he had long auburn hair and his hazel eyes large quick in their movements and singularly searching in their glance were alive with the genius of the soul behind them he inherited from his father the stupendous health and vigour for which alexander had been remarkable in his youth and was remarkable still in his old age the chase had ever been cesares favourite pastime and the wild boar his predilect quarry and in the pursuit of it he had made good use of his exceptional physical endowments cultivating them untillike his father before himhe was equal to the endurance of almost any degree of fatigue  in the consistory of june 8 he was appointed legate a latere to go to naples to crown king federigo of aragonfor in the meanwhile another change had taken place on the neapolitan throne by the death of young ferdinand ii who had been succeeded by his uncle federigo prince of altamura  cesare made ready for his departure upon this important mission upon which he was to be accompanied by his brother giovanni duke of gandia they were both to be back in rome by september when gandia was to return to spain taking with him his sister lucrezia  thus had the pope disposed but the borgia family stood on the eve of the darkest tragedy associated with its name a tragedy which was to alter all these plans     chapter iv the murder of the duke of gandia   on june 14 1497 the eve of cesare and giovanni borgias departure for naples their mother vannozza gave them a farewell supper in her beautiful vineyard in trastevere in addition to the two guests of honour several other kinsmen and friends were present among whom were the cardinal of monreale and young giuffredo borgia they remained at supper until an advanced hour of the night when cesare and giovanni took their departure attended only by a few servants and a mysterious man in a mask who had come to giovanni whilst he was at table and who almost every day for about a month had been in the habit of visiting him at the vatican  the brothers and these attendants rode together into rome and as far as the vicechancellor ascanio sforzas palace in the ponte quarter here giovanni drew rein and informed cesare that he would not be returning to the vatican just yet as he was first going elsewhere to amuse himself with that he took his leave of cesare and with one single exceptionin addition to the man in the maskdismissed his servants the latter continued their homeward way with the cardinal whilst the duke taking the man in the mask upon the crupper of his horse and followed his single attendant turned and made off in the direction of the jewish quarter  in the morning it was found that giovanni had not yet returned and his uneasy servants informed the pope of his absence and of the circumstances of it the pope however was not at all alarmed explaining his sons absence in the manner so obviously suggested by giovannis parting words to cesare on the previous night he assumed that the gay young duke was on a visit to some complacent lady and that presently he would return  later in the day however news was brought that his horse had been found loose in the streets in the neighbourhood of the cardinal of parmas palace with only one stirrupleather the other having clearly been cut from the saddle and at the same time it was related that the servant who had accompanied him after he had separated from the rest had been found at dawn in the piazza della giudecca mortally wounded and beyond speech expiring soon after his removal to a neighbouring house  alarm spread through the vatican and the anxious pope ordered inquiries to be made in every quarter where it was possible that anything might be learned it was in answer to these inquiries that a boatman of the schiavonione giorgio by namecame forward with the story of what he had seen on the night of wednesday he had passed the night on board his boat on guard over the timber with which she was laden she was moored along the bank that runs from the bridge of sant angelo to the church of santa maria nuova  he related that at about the fifth hour of the night just before daybreak he had seen two men emerge from the narrow street alongside the hospital of san girolamo and stand on the rivers brink at the spot where it was usual for the scavengers to discharge their refuse carts into the water these men had looked carefully about as if to make sure that they were not being observed seeing no one astir they made a sign whereupon a man well mounted on a handsome white horse his heels armed with golden spurs rode out of that same narrow street behind him on the crupper of his horse giorgio beheld the body of a man the head hanging in one direction and the legs in the other this body was supported there by two other men on foot who walked on either side of the horseman  arrived at the waters edge they turned the horses hindquarters to the river then taking the body between them two of them swung it well out into the stream after the splash giorgio had heard the horseman inquire whether they had thrown well into the middle and had heard him receive the affirmative answersignor si the horseman then sat scanning the surface a while and presently pointed out a dark object floating which proved to be their victims cloak the men threw stones at it and so sank it whereupon they turned and all five departed as they had come  such is the boatmans story as related in the diarium of burchard when the pope had heard it he asked the fellow why he had not immediately gone to give notice of what he had witnessed to which this giorgio replied that in his time he had seen over a hundred bodies thrown into the tiber without ever anybody troubling to know anything about them  this story and gandias continued absence threw the pope into a frenzy of apprehension he ordered the bed of the river to be searched foot by foot some hundreds of boatmen and fishermen got to work and on that same afternoon the body of the illfated duke of gandia was brought up in one of the nets he was not only completely dressedas was to have been expected from giorgios storybut his gloves and his purse containing thirty ducats were still at his belt as was his dagger the only weapon he had carried the jewels upon his person too were all intact which made it abundantly clear that his assassination was not the work of thieves  his hands were still tied and there were from ten to fourteen wounds on his body in addition to which his throat had been cut  the corpse was taken in a boat to the castle of sant angelo where it was stripped washed and arrayed in the garments of the captaingeneral of the church that same night on a bier the body covered with a mantle of brocade the face looking more beautiful than in life he was carried by torchlight from sant angelo to santa maria del popolo for burial quietly and with little pomp  the popes distress was terrible as the procession was crossing the bridge of sant angelo those who stood there heard his awful cries of anguish as is related in the dispatches of an eyewitness quoted by sanuto alexander shut himself up in his apartments with his passionate sorrow refusing to see anybody and it was only by insistence that the cardinal of segovia and some of the popes familiars contrived to gain admission to his presence but even then not for three days could they induce him to taste food nor did he sleep  at last he roused himself partly in response to the instances of the cardinal of segovia partly spurred by the desire to avenge the death of his child and he ordered rome to be ransacked for the assassins but although the search was pursued for two months it proved utterly fruitless  that is the ofttold story of the death of the duke of gandia those are all the facts concerning it that are known or that ever will be known the rest is speculation and this speculation follows the trend of malice rather than of evidence  suspicion fell at first upon giovanni sforza who was supposed to have avenged himself thus upon the pope for the treatment he had received there certainly existed that reasonable motive to actuate him but not a particle of evidence against him  next rumour had it that cardinal ascanio sforzas was the hand that had done this work and with this rumour rome was busy for months it was known that he had quarrelled violently with gandia who had been grossly insulted by a chamberlain of ascanios and who had wiped out the insult by having the man seized and hanged  sanuto quotes a letter from rome on july 21 which states that it is certain that ascanio murdered the duke of gandia cardinal ascanios numerous enemies took care to keep the accusation alive at the vatican and ascanio in fear for his life had left rome and fled to grottaferrata when summoned to rome he had refused to come save under safe­conduct his fears however appear to have been groundless for the pope attached no importance to the accusation against him convinced of his innocence as he informed him  thereupon public opinion looked about for some other likely person upon whom to fasten its indictment and lighted upon giuffredo borgia gandias youngest brother here again a motive was not wanting already has mention been made of the wanton ways of giuffredos neapolitan wife doña sancia that she was prodigal of her favours there is no lack of evidence and it appears that amongst those she admitted to them was the dead duke jealousy then it was alleged was the spur that had driven giuffredo to the deed and that the rumour of this must have been insistent is clear when we find the pope publicly exonerating his youngest son  thus matters stood and thus had public opinion spoken when in the month of august the pope ordered the search for the murderer to cease bracci the florentine ambassador explains this action of alexanders he writes that his holiness knew who were the murderers and that he was taking no further steps in the matter in the hope that thus conceiving themselves to be secure they might more completely discover themselves  braccis next letter bears out the supposition that he writes from inference and not from knowledge he repeats that the investigations have been suspended and that to account for this some say what already he has written whilst others deny it but that the truth of the matter is known to none  later in the year we find the popular voice denouncing bartolomeo dalviano and the orsini already in august the ferrarese ambassador manfredi had written that the death of the duke of gandia was being imputed to bartolomeo dalviano and in december we see in sanuto a letter from rome which announces that it is positively stated that the orsini had caused the death of giovanni borgia  these various rumours were hardly worth mentioning for their own values but they are important as showing how public opinion fastened the crime in turn upon everybody it could think of as at all likely to have had cause to commit it and more important still for the purpose of refuting what has since been written concerning the immediate connection of cesare borgia with the crime in the popular mind  not until february of the following year was the name of cesare ever mentioned in connection with the deed the first rumour of his guilt synchronized with that of his approaching renunciation of his ecclesiastical career and there can be little doubt that the former sprang from the latter the world conceived that it had discovered on cesares part a motive for the murder of his brother that motiveof which so very much has been madeshall presently be examined meanwhile to deal with the actual rumour and its crystallization into history the ferrarese ambassador heard it in venice on february 12 1498 capello seized upon it and repeated it two and a half years later stating on september 28 1500 etiam amazó il fratello  and there you have the whole source of all the unbridled accusations subsequently launched against cesare all of which find a prominent place in gregoroviuss geschichte der stadt rom whilst the rumours accusing others which we have mentioned here are there slurred over  one hesitates to attack the arguments and conclusions of the very eminent author of that mighty history of rome in the middle ages but conscience and justice demand that his chapter upon this subject be dealt with as it deserves  the striking talents of gregorovius are occasionally marred by the egotism and pedantry sometimes characteristic of the scholars of his nation he is too positive he seldom opines he asserts with finality the things that only god can know occasionally his knowledge transcending the possible quits the realm of the historian for that of the romancer as for instanceto cite one amid a thousandwhen he actually tells us what passes in cesare borgias mind at the coronation of the king of naples in the matter of authorities he follows a dangerous and insidious eclecticism preferring those who support the point of view which he has chosen without a proper regard for their intrinsic values  he tells us definitely that if alexander had not positive knowledge he had at least moral conviction that it was cesare who had killed the duke of gandia in that again you see the godlike knowledge which he usurps you see him clairvoyant rather than historical starting out with the positive assertion that cesare borgia was the murderer he sets himself to prove it by piling up a mass of worthless evidence whose worthlessness it is unthinkable he should not have realized  according to the general opinion of the day which in all probability was correct cesare was the murderer of his brother  thus gregorovius in his lucrezia borgia a deliberate misstatement for as we have been at pains to show not until the crime had been fastened upon everybody whom public opinion could conceive to be a possible assassin not until nearly a year after gandias death did rumour for the first time connect cesare with the deed until then the ambassadors letters from rome in dealing with the murder and reporting speculation upon possible murderers never make a single allusion to cesare as the guilty person  later when once it had been bruited it found its way into the writings of every defamer of the borgias and from several of these it is taken by gregorovius to help him uphold that theory  two motives were urged for the crime one was cesares envy of his brother whom he desired to supplant as a secular prince fretting in the cassock imposed upon himself which restrained his unbounded ambition the otherand no epoch but this one under consideration in its reaction from the age of chivalry could have dared to level it without a careful examination of its sourceswas cesares jealousy springing from the incestuous love for their sister lucrezia which he is alleged to have disputed with his brother thus as lespinois has pointed out to convict cesare borgia of a crime which cannot absolutely be proved against him all that is necessary is that he should be charged with another crime still more horrible of which even less proof exists  this latter motive it is true is rejected by gregorovius our sense of honesty he writes repels us from attaching faith to the belief spread in that most corrupt age yet the authorities urging one motive are commonly those urging the other and gregorovius quotes those that suit him without considering that if he is convinced they lie in one connection he has not the right to assume them truthful in another  the contemporary or quasicontemporary writers upon whose authority it is usual to show that cesare borgia was guilty of both those revolting crimes are sanazzaro capello macchiavelli matarazzo sanuto pietro martire danghiera guicciardini and panvinio  a formidable array but consider them one by one at close quarters and take a critical look at what they actually wrote  sanazzaro was a neapolitan poet and epigrammatist who could nothis times being what they werebe expected to overlook the fact that in these slanderous rumours of incest was excellent matter for epigrammatical verse therefore he crystallized them into lines which whilst doing credit to his wit reveal his brutal cruelty no one will seriously suppose that such a man would be concerned with the veracity of the matter of his verseseven leaving out of the question his enmity towards the house of borgia which will transpire later for him a ben trovato was as good matter as a truth or better he measured its value by its piquancy by its adaptability to epigrammatic rhymes  conceive the heartlessness of the man who at the moment of alexanders awful grief at the murder of his sona grief which so moved even his enemies that the bitter savonarola and the scarcely less bitter cardinal della rovere wrote to condole with himcould pen that terrible epigram       piscatorem hominum ne te non sexte putemus      piscaris notum retibus ecce tuum  consider the ribaldry of that and ask yourselves whether this is a man who would immolate the chance of a witticism upon the altar of truth  it is significant that sanazzaro for what he may be worth confines himself to the gossip of incest nowhere does he mention that cesare was the murderer and we think that his silence upon the matter if it shows anything shows that cesares guilt was not so very much the general opinion of the day as gregorovius asks us to believe  cappello was not in rome at the time of the murder nor until three years later when he merely repeated the rumour that had first sprung up some eight months after the crime  the precise value of his famous relation in which this matter is recorded and to which we shall return in its proper place and the spirit that actuated him is revealed in another accusation of murder which he levels at cesare an accusation which of course has also been widely disseminated upon no better authority than his own it is capello who tells us that cesare stabbed the chamberlain perrotto in the popes very arms he adds the details that the man had fled thither for shelter from cesares fury and that the blood of him when he was stabbed spurted up into the very face of the pope where he got the story is not readily surmisedunless it be assumed that he evolved it out of his feelings for the borgias the only contemporary accounts of the death of this perrottoor pedro caldes as was his real namestate that he fell by accident into the tiber and was drowned  burchard who could not have failed to know if the stabbing story had been true and would not have failed to report it chronicles the fact that perrotto was fished out of tiber having fallen in six days earliernon libenter this statement coming from the pen of the master of ceremonies at the vatican requires no further corroboration yet corroboration there actually is in a letter from rome of february 20 1498 quoted by marino sanuto in his diarii this states that perrotto had been missing for some days no one knowing what had become of him and that now he has been found drowned in the tiber  we mention this in passing with the twofold object of slaying another calumny and revealing the true value of capello who happens to be the chief witness for the prosecution put forward by gregorovius is it not of great significance inquires the german historian that the fact should have been related so positively by an ambassador who obtained his knowledge from the best sources  the question is frivolous for the whole trouble in this matter is that there were no sources at all in the proper sense of the wordgood or bad there was simply gossip which had been busy with a dozen names already  macchiavelli includes a note in his extracts from letters to the ten in which he mentions the death of gandia adding that at first nothing was known and then men said it was done by the cardinal of valencia  there is nothing very conclusive in that besides incidentally it may be mentioned that it is not clear when or how these extracts were compiled by macchiavelli in his capacity of secretary to the signory of florence from the dispatches of her ambassadors but it has been shownthough we are hardly concerned with that at the momentthat these extracts are confused by comments of his own either for his own future use or for that of another  matarazzo is the perugian chronicler of whom we have already expressed the only tenable opinion the task he set himself was to record the contemporary events of his native townthe stronghold of the blooddripping baglioni he enlivened it by every scrap of scandalous gossip that reached him however alien to his avowed task the authenticity of this scandalmongering chronicle has been questioned but even assuming it to be authentic it is so wildly inaccurate when dealing with matters happening beyond the walls of perugia as to be utterly worthless  matarazzo relates the story of the incestuous relations prevailing in the borgia family and with an unsparing wealth of detail not to be found elsewhere but on the subject of the murder he has a tale to tell entirely different from any other that has been left us for whilst he urges the incest as the motive of the crime the murderer he tells us was giovanni sforza the outraged husband and he gives us the fullest details of that murder time and place and exactly how committed and all the other matters which have never been brought to light  it is all a worthless garbled piece of fiction most obviously as such it has ever been treated but it is as plausible as it is untrue and at least as authoritative as any available evidence assigning the guilt to cesare  sanuto we accept as a more or less careful and painstaking chronicler whose writings are valuable and sanuto on the matter of the murder confines himself to quoting the letter of february 1498 in which the accusation against cesare is first mentioned after having given other earlier letters which accuse first ascanio and then orsini far more positively than does the latter letter accuse cesare  on the matter of the incest there is no word in sanuto but there is mention of doña sancias indiscretions and the suggestion that through jealousy on her account it was rumoured that the murder had been committedanother proof of how vague and illdefined the rumours were  pietro martire danghiera writes from burgos in spain that he is convinced of the fratricide it is interesting to know of that conviction of his but difficult to conceive how it is to be accepted as evidence  if more needs to be said of him let it be mentioned that the letter in which he expresses that conviction is dated april 1497two months before the murder took place so that even gregorovius is forced to doubt the authenticity of that document  guicciardini is not a contemporary chronicler of events as they happened but an historian writing some thirty years later he merely repeats what capello and others have said before him it is for him to quote authorities for what he writes and not to be set up as an authority he is not reliable and he is a notorious defamer of the papacy sparing nothing that will serve his ends he dilates with gusto upon the accusation of incest  lastly panvinto is in the same category as guicciardini he was not born until some thirty years after these events and his history of the popes was not written until some sixty years after the murder of the duke of gandia this history bristles with inaccuracies he never troubles to verify his facts and as an authority he is entirely negligible  in the valuable diarium of burchard there is unfortunately a lacuna at this juncture from the day after the murder of which he gives the full particulars to which we have gone for our narrative of that event until the month of august following and now we may see gregorovius actually using silence as evidence he seizes upon that lacuna and goes so far as to set up the tentative explanation that burchard perhaps purposely interrupted his diary that he might avoid mentioning the fratricide  if such were the case it would be a strange departure from burchards invariable rule which is one of cold relentless uncritical chronicling of events no matter what their nature besides any significance with which that lacuna might be invested is discounted by the fact that such gaps are of fairly common occurrence in the course of burchards record finally it remains to be shown that the lacuna in question exists in the original diaries which have yet to be discovered  so much for the valuable authorities out of whichand by means of a selection which is not quite clearly definedgregorovius claims to have proved that the murderer of the duke of gandia was his brother cesare borgia cardinal of valencia1     1  it is rather odd that in the course of casting about for a possible murderer of gandia public opinion should never have fastened upon cardinal alessandro farnese he had lately been stripped of the patrimony of st peter that the governorship of this might be bestowed upon gandia his resentment had been provoked by that action of the popes and the relations between himself and the borgias were strained in consequence possibly there was clear proof that he could have had no connection with the crime   now to examine more closely the actual motives given by those authorities and by later critical writers for attributing the guilt to cesare  in september of the year 1497 the pope had dissolved the marriage of his daughter lucrezia and giovanni sforza and the grounds for the dissolution were that the husband was impotens et frigidus naturaadmitted by himself2     2  el s de pesaro ha scripto qua de sua mano non haverla mai cognosciuta et esser impotente alias la sententia non se potea dare el prefato s dice pero haver scripto cosi per obedire el duca de milano et aschanio collenuccios letter from rome to the duke of ferrara dec 25 1497   if you know anything of the italy of today you will be able to conceive for yourself how the italy of the fifteenth century must have held her sides and pealed her laughter at the contemptible spectacle of an unfortunate who afforded such reason to be bundled out of a nuptial bed the echo of that mighty burst of laughter must have rung from calabria to the alps and well may it have filled the handsome weakling who was the object of its cruel ridicule with a talion fury the weapons he took up wherewith to defend himself were a little obvious he answered the odious reflections upon his virility by a wholesale charge of incest against the borgia family he screamed that what had been said of him was a lie invented by the borgias to serve their own unutterable ends1 such was the accusation with which the squirming lord of pesaro retaliated and however obvious yet it was not an accusation that the world of his day would lightly cast aside for all that the perspicacious may have rated it at its proper value     1 et mancho se e curato de fare prova de qua con done per poterne chiarire el rev legato che era qua sebbene sua excellentia tastandolo sopra cio gli ne abbia facto offerta and further anzi haverla conosciuta infinite volte ma chel papa non geiha tolta per altro se non per usare con lei costabilis letter from milan to the duke of ferrara june 23 1497   what is of great importance to students of the history of the borgias is that this was the first occasion on which the accusation of incest was raised of course it persisted such a charge could not do otherwise but now that we see in what soil it had its roots we shall know what importance to attach to it  not only did it persist but it developed as was but natural cesare and the dead gandia were included in it and presently it suggested a motivenot dreamed of until thenwhy cesare might have been his brothers murderer  then early in 1498 came the rumour that cesare was intending to abandon the purple and later writers from capello down to our own times have chosen to see in cesares supposed contemplation of that step a motive so strong for the crime as to prove it in the most absolutely conclusive manner in no case could it be such proof even if it were admitted as a motive but is it really so to be admitted did such a motive exist at all does it really followas has been taken for grantedthat cesare must have remained an ecclesiastic had gandia lived we cannot see that it does indeed such evidence as there is when properly considered points in the opposite direction even if no account is taken of the fact that this was not the first occasion on which it was proposed that cesare should abandon the ecclesiastical career as is shown by the ferrarese ambassadors dispatches of march 1493  it is contended that gandia was a stumblingblock to cesare and that gandia held the secular possessions which cesare coveted but if that were really the case why when eventually some fourteen months after gandias death cesare doffed the purple to replace it by a soldiers harness did he not assume the secular possessions that had been his brothers  his dead brothers lands and titles went to his dead brothers son whilst cesares career was totally different as his aims were totally different from any that had been gandias or that might have been gandias had the latter lived true cesare became captaingeneral of the church in his dead brothers place but for that his brothers death was not necessary gandia had neither the will nor the intellect to undertake the things that awaited cesare he was a softnatured pleasureloving youth whose way of life was already mapped out for him his place was at gandia in spain and whilst he might have continued lord of all the possessions that were his it would have been cesares to become duke of valentinois and to have made himself master of romagna precisely as he did  in conclusion gandias death no more advanced than his life could have impeded the career which cesare afterwards made his own and to say that cesare murdered him to supplant him is to set up a theory which the subsequent facts of cesares life will nowise justify  it is idle of gregorovius to say that the logic of the crime is inexorablein its assigning the guilt to cesarefatuous of him to suppose that as he claims he has definitely proved cesare to be his brothers murderer  there is much against cesare borgia but it never has been proved and never will be proved that he was a fratricide indeed the few really known facts of the murder all point to a very different conclusiona conclusion more or less obvious which has been discarded presumably for no better reason than because it was obvious  where was all this need to go so far afield in quest of a probable murderer imbued with political motives where the need to accuse in turn every enemy that gandia could possibly possess before finally fastening upon his own brother  certain evidence is afforded by the known facts of the case scant as they are it may not amount to much but at least it is sufficient to warrant a plausible conclusion and there is no justification for discarding it in favour of something for which not a particle of evidence is forthcoming  there is first of all the man in the mask to be accounted for that he is connected with the crime is eminently probable if not absolutely certain  it is to be remembered that for a monthaccording to burchardhe had been in the habit of visiting gandia almost daily he comes to vannozzas villa on the night of the murder is it too much to suppose that he brought a message from some one from whom he was in the habit of bringing messages  he was seen last on the crupper of gandias horse as the latter rode away towards the jewish quarter1 gandia himself announced that he was bound on pleasuregoing to amuse himself even without the knowledge which we possess of his licentious habits no doubt could arise as to the nature of the amusement upon which he was thus bound at dead of night and there are the conclusions formed in the morning by his father when it was found that gandia had not returned     1  the ghetto was not yet in existence  it was not built until 1556 under paul iv   is it so very difficult to conceive that gandia in the course of the assignation to which he went should have fallen into the hands of an irate father husband or brother is it not really the obvious inference to draw from the few facts that we possess that it was the inference drawn by the pope and clung to even some time after the crime and while rumours of a different sort were rife is shown by the perquisition made in the house of antonio pico della mirandola who had a daughter whom it was conceived might have been the object of the young dukes nocturnal visit and whose house was near the place where gandia was flung into the tiber  we could hazard speculations that would account for the man in the mask but it is not our business to speculate save where the indications are fairly clear  let us consider the significance of gandias tied hands and the wounds upon his body in addition to the mortal gash across his throat to what does this condition point surely not to a murder of expediency so much as to a fierce lustful butchery of vengeance surely it suggests that gandia may have been tortured before his throat was cut why else were his wrists pinioned had he been swiftly done to death there would have been no need for that had hired assassins done the work they would not have stayed to pinion him nor do we think they would have troubled to fling him into the river they would have slain and left him where he fell  the whole aspect of the case suggests the presence of the master of the personal enemy himself we can conceive gandias wrists being tied to the end that this personal enemy might do his will upon the wretched young man dealing him one by one the ten or fourteen wounds in the body before making an end of him by cutting his throat we cannot explain the pinioned wrists in any other way then the man on the handsome white horse the man whom the four others addressed as men address their lord remember his gold spursa trifle perhaps but hired assassins do not wear gold spurs even though their bestriding handsome white horses may be explainable  surely that was the master the personal enemy himselfand it was not cesare for cesare at the time was at the vatican  there we must leave the mystery of the murder of the duke of gandia but we leave it convinced that such scant evidence as there is points to an affair of sordid gallantry and nowise implicates his brother cesare     chapter v the renunciation of the purple   at the consistory of june 19 1497 the sacred college beheld a brokenhearted old man who declared that he had done with the world and that henceforth life could offer him nothing that should endear it to him  a greater sorrow than this could not be ours for we loved him exceedingly and now we can hold neither the papacy nor any other thing as of concern had we seven papacies we would give them all to restore the duke to life so ran his bitter lament  he denounced his course of life as not having been all that it should have been and appeared to see in the murder of his son a punishment for the evil of his ways much has been made of this and quite unnecessarily it has been taken eagerly as an admission of his unparalleled guilt an admission of guilt it undoubtedly was but what man is not guilty and how many menay and saints evenin the hour of tribulation have cried out that they were being made to feel the wrath of god for the sins that no man is without  if humanity contains a type that would not have seen in such a cause for sorrow a visitation of god it is the type of inhuman monster to which we are asked to believe that alexander vi belonged a sinner unquestionably he was and a great one but a human sinner and not an incarnate devil else there could have been no such outcry from him in such an hour as this  he announced that henceforth the spiritual needs of the church should be his only care he inveighed against the corruption of the ecclesiastical estate confessing himself aware of how far it had strayed from the ancient discipline and from the laws that had been framed to bridle licence and cupidity which were now rampant and unchecked and he proclaimed his intention to reform the curia and the church of rome to this end he appointed a commission consisting of the cardinalbishops oliviero caraffa and giorgio costa the cardinalpriests antonietto pallavicino and gianantonio sangiorgio and the cardinaldeacons francesco piccolomini and raffaele riario  there was even a suggestion that he was proposing to abdicate but that he was prevailed upon to do nothing until his grief should have abated and his judgement be restored to its habitual calm this suggestion however rests upon no sound authority  letters of condolence reached him on every hand even his archenemy cardinal giuliano della rovere put aside his rancour in the face of the popes overwhelming griefand also because it happened to consort with his own interests as will presently transpire he wrote to alexander from france that he was truly pained to the very soul of him in his concern for the popes holinessa letter which no doubt laid the foundations to the reconciliation that was toward between them  still more remarkable was it that the thaumaturgical savonarola should have paused in the atrabilious invective with which he was inflaming florence against the pope should have paused to send him a letter of condolence in which he prayed that the lord of all mercy might comfort his holiness in his tribulation  that letter is a singular document singularly human yielding a singular degree of insight into the nature of the man who penned it a whole chapter of intelligent speculation upon the character of savonarola based upon a study of externals could not reveal as much of the mentality of that fanatical demagogue as the consideration of just this letter  the sympathy by which we cannot doubt it to have been primarily inspired is here overspread by the mans rampant fanaticism there diluted by the prophecies from which he cannot even now refrain and throughout the manner is that of the pulpitthumping orator the first half of his letter is a prelude in the form of a sermon upon faith all very trite and obvious and the notion of this excommunicated friar holding forth to the popes holiness in polemical platitudes delivered with all the authority of inspired discoveries of his own is one more proof that at the root of fanaticism in all ages and upon all questions lies an utter lack of a sense of fitness and proportion having said that the just man liveth in the lord by faith and that the lord in his mercy passeth over all our sins he proclaims that he announces things of which he is assured and for which he is ready to suffer all persecutions and begs his holiness to turn a favourable eye upon the work of faith in which he is labouring and to give heed no more to the impious promising the holy father that thus shall the lord bestow upon him the essence of joy instead of the spirit of grief having begun as we have seen with an assurance that the lord in his mercy passeth over all our sins he concludes by prophesying with questionable logic that the thunders of his wrath will ere long be heard nor does he omit to mentionwith an apparent arrogance that again betrays that same want of a sense of proportionthat all his predictions are true  his letter however and that of cardinal della rovere among so many others show us how touched was the world by the popes loss and overwhelming grief how shocked at the manner in which this had been brought about  the commission which alexander had appointed for the work of reform had meanwhile got to work and the cardinal of naples edited the articles of a constitution which was undoubtedly the object of prolonged study and consideration as is revealed by the numerous erasures and emendations which it bears unfortunatelyfor reasons which are not apparentit was never published by alexander possibly by the time that it was concluded the aggrandizement of the temporal power was claiming his entire attention to the neglect of the spiritual needs of the holy see it is also possibleas has been abundantly suggestedthat the stern mood of penitence had softened with his sorrow and was now overpast  nevertheless it may have been some lingering remnant of this fervour of reform that dictated the severe punishment which fell that year upon the flagitious bishop of cosenza a fine trade was being driven in rome by the sale of forged briefs of indulgence raynaldus cites a bull on that score addressed by alexander in the first year of his pontificate to the bishops of spain enjoining them to visit with punishment all who in that kingdom should be discovered to be pursuing such a traffic on september 4 1497 burchard tells us three servants of the pontifical secretary the archbishop of cosenza bartolomeo florido were arrested in consequence of the discovery of twenty forged briefs issued by them in their examination they incriminated their master the archbishop who was consequently put upon his trial and found guilty alexander deposed degraded and imprisoned him in sant angelo in a dark room where he was supplied with oil for his lamp and bread and water for his nourishment until he died his underlings were burnt in the campo di fiori in the following month  the duke of gandia left a widow and two childrengiovanni a boy of three years of age and isabella a girl of two in the interests of her son the widowed duchess applied to the governor of valencia in the following september for the boys investiture in the rights of his deceased father this was readily granted upon authority from rome and so the boy giovanni was recognized as third duke of gandia prince of sessa and teano and lord of cerignola and montefoscolo and the administration of his estates during his minority was entrusted to his uncle cesare borgia  the lordship of beneventothe last grant made to giovanni borgiawas not mentioned nor was it then nor ever subsequently claimed by the widow it is the one possession of gandias that went to cesare who was confirmed in it by the king of naples  the gandia branch of the borgia family remained in spain prospered and grew in importance and incidentally produced st francis de borgia this duke of gandia was master of the household to charles v and thus a man of great worldly consequence but it happened that he was so moved by the sight of the disfigured body of his masters beautiful queen that he renounced the world and entered the society of jesus eventually becoming its general he died in 1562 and in the fulness of time was canonized  cesares departure for naples as legate a latere to anoint and crown federigo of aragon was naturally delayed by the tragedy that had assailed his house and not until july 22 did he take his leave of the pope and set out with an escort of two hundred horse  naples was still in a state of ferment split into two parties one of which favoured france and the other aragon so that disturbances were continual alexander expressed the hope that cesare might appear in that distracted kingdom in the guise of an angel of peace and that by his coronation of king federigo he should set a term to the strife that was toward  the city of naples itself was now being ravaged by fever and in consequence of this it was determined that cesare should repair instead to capua where federigo would await him arrived there however cesare fell ill and the coronation ceremony again suffered a postponement until august 10 cesare remained a fortnight in the kingdom and on august 22 set out to return to rome and his departure appears to have been a matter of relief to federigo for so impoverished did the king of naples find himself that the entertainment of the legate and his numerous escort had proved a heavy tax upon his flabby purse  on the morning of september 6 all the cardinals in rome received a summons to attend at the monastery of santa maria nuova to welcome the returned cardinal of valencia in addition to the sacred college all the ambassadors of the powers were present and after the celebration of the mass the entire assembly proceeded to the vatican where the pope was waiting to receive his son when the young cardinal presented himself at the foot of the papal throne alexander opened his arms to him embraced and kissed him speaking no word  this rests upon the evidence of two eyewitnesses1 and the circumstance has been urged and propounded into the one conclusive piece of evidence that cesare had murdered his brother and that the pope knew it in this you have some more of what gregorovius terms inexorable logic he kissed him but he spake no word to him therefore they reason cesare murdered gandia can absurdity be more absurd fatuity more fatuous lucus a non lucendo to square the circle should surely present no difficulty to these subtle logicians     1  non dixit verbum pape valentinus nec papa sibi sed eo deosculato descendit de solio burchards diarium and solo lo bació in letter from rome in sanutos diarii   it was as we have seen in february of 1498 that it was first rumoured that cesare intended to put off the purple and that the rumour had ample foundation was plain from the circumstance that the pope was already laying plans whose fulfilment must be dependent upon that step and seeking to arrange a marriage for cesare with carlotta of aragon king federigo of napless daughter stipulating that her dowry should be such that cesare in taking her to wife should become prince of altamura and tarentum  but federigo showed himself unwilling possibly in consideration of the heavy dowry demanded and of the heavy draft already made by the borgiasthrough giuffredo borgia prince of squillaceupon this naples which the french invasion had so impoverished he gave out that he would not have his daughter wedded to a priest who was the son of a priest and that he would not give his daughter unless the pope could contrive that a cardinal might marry and yet retain his hat  it all sounded as if he were actuated by nice scruples and high principles but the opinion is unfortunately not encouraged when we find him nevertheless giving his consent to the marriage of his nephew alfonso to lucrezia borgia upon the pronouncement of her divorce from giovanni sforza the marriage let us say in passing was celebrated at the vatican on june 20 1498 lucrezia receiving a dowry of 40000 ducats but the astute alexander saw to it that his family should acquire more than it gave and contrived that alfonso should receive the neapolitan cities of biselli and quadrata being raised to the title of prince of biselli  nevertheless there was a vast difference between giving in marriage a daughter who must take a weighty dowry out of the kingdom and receiving a daughter who would bring a handsome dowry with her and the facts suggest that such was the full measure of federigos scruples  meanwhile to dissemble his reluctance to let cesare have his daughter to wife federigo urged that he must first take the feeling of ferdinand and isabella in this matter  while affairs stood thus charles viii died suddenly at amboise in april of that year 1498 some work was being carried out there by artists whom he had brought from naples for the purpose and in going to visit this the king happened to enter a dark gallery and struck his forehead so violently against the edge of a door that he expired the same dayat the age of twentyeight he was a poor malformed fellow as we have seen and of little understanding commines tells us but so good that it would have been impossible to have found a kinder creature  with him the valois dynasty came to an end he was succeeded by his cousin the duke of orleans who upon his coronation at rheims assumed the title of king of france and the two sicilies and duke of milana matter which considerably perturbed federigo of aragon and lodovico sforza each of these rulers saw in that assumption of his own title by louis xii a declaration of enmity the prelude to a declaration of open war wherefore deeming it idle to send their ambassadors to represent them at the court of france they refrained from doing so  louis xiis claim upon the duchy of milan was based upon his being the grandson of valentina visconti and considering himself a visconti he naturally looked upon the sforza dominion as no better than a usurpation which too long had been left undisturbed to disturb it now was the first aim of his kingship and to this end as well as in another matter the friendship of the pope was very desirable to louis  the other matter concerned his matrimonial affairs no sooner did he find himself king of france than he applied to rome for the dissolution of his marriage with jeanne de valois the daughter of louis xi the grounds he urged were threefold firstly between himself and jeanne there existed a relationship of the fourth degree and a spiritual affinity resulting from the fact that her father louis xi had held him at the baptismal fontwhich before the council of trent did constitute an impediment to marriage secondly he had not been a willing party to the union but had entered into it as a consequence of intimidation from the terrible louis xi who had threatened his life and possessions if not obeyed in this thirdly jeanne laboured under physical difficulties which rendered her incapable of maternity  of such a nature was the appeal he made to alexander and alexander responded by appointing a commission presided over by the cardinal of luxembourg and composed of that same cardinal and the bishops of albi and ceuta assisted by five other bishops as assessors to investigate the kings grievance there appears to be no good reason for assuming that the inquiry was not conducted fairly and honourably or that the finding of the bishops and ultimate annulment of the marriage was not in accordance with their consciences we are encouraged to assume that all this was indeed so when we consider that jeanne de valois submitted without protest to the divorce and that neither then nor subsequently at any time did she prefer any complaint accepting the judgement it is presumable as a just and fitting measure  she applied to the pope for permission to found a religious order whose special aim should be the adoration and the emulation of the perfections of the blessed virgin a permission which alexander very readily accorded her he was himself imbued with a very special devotion for the mother of the saviour we see the spur of this special devotion of his in the votive offering of a silver effigy to her famous altar of the santissima nunziata in florence which he had promised in the event of rome being freed from charles viii again after the accident of the collapse of a roof in the vatican in which he narrowly escaped death it is to santa maria nuova that we see him going in procession to hold a solemn thanksgiving service to our lady in a dozen different ways did that devotion find expression during his pontificate and be it remembered that catholics owe it to alexander vi that the angelusbell is rung thrice daily in honour of the blessed virgin  to us this devotion to the mother of chastity on the part of a churchman openly unchaste in flagrant subversion of his vows is a strange and incongruous spectacle but the incongruity of it is illumining it reveals alexanders simple attitude towards the sins of the flesh and shows how in common with most churchmen of his day he found no conscientious difficulty in combining fervid devotion with perfervid licence whatever it may seem by ours by his lightsby the light of the examples about him from his youth by the light of the precedents afforded him by his predecessors in st peters chairhis conduct was a normal enough affair which can have afforded him little with which to reproach himself  in the matter of the annulment of the marriage of louis xii it is to be conceded that alexander made the most of the opportunity it afforded him he perceived that the moment was propitious for enlisting the services of the king of france to the achievement of his own ends more particularly to further the matter of the marriage of cesare borgia with carlotta of aragon who was being reared at the court of france accordingly alexander desired the bishop of ceuta to lay his wishes in the matter before the christian king and to the end that cesare might find a fitting secular estate awaiting him when eventually he emerged from the clergy the pope further suggested to louis through the bishops agency that cesare should receive the investiture of the counties of valentinois and dyois in dauphiny on the face of it this wears the look of inviting bribery in reality it scarcely amounted to so much although the opportunism that prompted the request is undeniable yet it is worthy of consideration that in what concerned the counties of valentinois and dyois the popes suggestion constituted a wise political step these territories had been in dispute between france and the holy see for a matter of some two hundred years during which the popes had been claiming dominion over them the claims had been admitted by louis xi who had relinquished the counties to the church but shortly after his death the parliament of dauphiny had restored them to the crown of france charles viii and innocent viii had wrangled over them and an arbitration was finally projected but never held  alexander now perceived a way to solve the difficulty by a compromise which should enrich his son and give the latter a title to replace that of cardinal which he was to relinquish so his proposal to louis xii was that the church should abandon its claim upon the territories whilst the king raising valentinois to the dignity of a duchy should so confer it upon cesare borgia  although the proposal was politically sound it constituted at the same time an act of flagrant nepotism but let us bear in mind that alexander did not lack a precedent for this particular act when louis xi had surrendered valentinois to sixtus iv this pope had bestowed it upon his nephew girolamo thereby vitiating any claim that the holy see might subsequently have upon the territory we judge itunder the circumstances that louis xi had surrendered it to the churchto be a far more flagrant piece of nepotism than was alexanders now  louis xii nothing behind the pope in opportunism saw in the concession asked of him the chance of acquiring alexanders goodwill he consented accompanying his consent by a request for a cardinals hat for georges damboise bishop of rouen who had been his devoted friend in less prosperous times and the sharer of his misfortunes under the previous reign and was now his chief counsellor and minister in addition he besoughtdependent of course upon the granting of the solicited divorcea dispensation to marry anne of brittany the beautiful widow of charles viii this was louiss way of raising the price as it were of the concession and services asked of him yet that there might be no semblance of bargaining his consent to cesares being created duke of valentinois was simultaneous with his request for further favours  with the royal patents conferring that duchy upon the popes son louis de villeneuve reached rome on august 7 1498 on the same day the young cardinal came before the sacred college assembled in consistory to crave permission to doff the purple  after the act of adoration of the popes holiness he humbly submitted to his brother cardinals that his inclinations had ever been in opposition to his embracing the ecclesiastical dignity and that if he had entered upon it at all this had been solely at the instances of his holiness just as he had persevered in it to gratify him but that his inclinations and desires for the secular estate persisting he implored the holy father of his clemency to permit him to put off his habit and ecclesiastical rank to restore his hat and benefices to the church and to grant him dispensation to return to the world and be free to contract marriage and he prayed the very reverend cardinals to use their good offices on his behalf adding to his own their intercessions to the popes holiness to accord him the grace he sought  the cardinals relegated the decision of the matter to the pope cardinal ximenes aloneas the representative of spainstood out against the granting of the solicited dispensation and threw obstacles in the way of it in this no doubt he obeyed his instructions from ferdinand and isabella who saw to the bottom of the intrigue with france that was toward and of the alliance that impended between louis xii and the holy seean alliance not at all to the interests of spain  the pope made a speedy rout of the cardinals objections with the most apostolic and irresistible of all weapons he pointed out that it was not for him to hinder the cardinal of valencias renunciation of the purple since that renunciation was clearly become necessary for the salvation of his soulpro salutae animae suaeto which of course ximenes had no answer  but with the object of conciliating spain this everpolitic pope indicated that if cesare was about to become a prince of france his many ecclesiastical benefices yielding some 35000 gold florins yearly being mostly in spain would be bestowed upon spanish churchmen and he further begged ximenes to remember that he already had a nephew at the court of spain in the person of the heir of gandia whom he particularly commended to the favour of ferdinand and isabella  thus was cesare borgias petition granted and his return to the world accomplished and by a strange chance of homonymy his title remained unchanged despite his change of estate the cardinal of valencia in spain became the duke of valenceor valentinoisin france and in italy valentino remained valentino      book iii the bull rampant  cum numine caesaris omen  motto on cesare borgias sword      chapter i the duchess of valentinois   king louis xii dispatched the sieur de sarenon by sea with a fleet of three ships and five galleys to the end that he should conduct the new duke to france which fleet was delayed so that it did not drop its anchors at ostia until the end of september  meanwhile cesares preparations for departure had been going forward and were the occasion of a colossal expenditure on the part of his sire for the pope desired that his son in going to france to assume his estate and for the further purposes of marrying a wife of conveying to louis the dispensation permitting his marriage with anne of brittany and of bearing the red hat to amboise should display the extraordinary magnificence for which the princes of cultured and luxurious italy were at the time renowned  his suite consisted of fully a hundred attendants what with esquires pages lacqueys and grooms whilst twelve chariots and fifty sumptermules were laden with his baggage the horses of his followers were all sumptuously caparisoned with bridles and stirrups of solid silver and for the rest the splendour of the liveries the weapons and the jewels and the richness of the gifts he bore with him were the amazement even of that age of dazzling displays  in cesares train went ramiro de lorqua the master of his household agabito gherardi his secretary and his spanish physician gaspare torellathe only medical man of his age who had succeeded in discovering a treatment for the pudendagra which the french had left in italy and who had dedicated to cesare his learned treatise upon that disease  as a bodyguard or escort of honour cesare took with him thirty gentlemen mostly romans among whom were giangiordano orsini pietro santa croce mario di mariano domenico sanguigna giulio alberini bartolomeo capranica and gianbattista manciniall young and all members of those patrician families which alexander vi had skilfully attached to his own interest  the latest of these was the orsini family with which an alliance was established by the marriage celebrated at the vatican on september 28 of that same year between fabio orsini and girolama borgia a niece of the popes  cesares departure took place on october 1 in the early morning when he rode out with his princely retinue and followed the tiber along trastevere without crossing the city he was mounted on a handsome charger caparisoned in red silk and gold brocadethe colours of france in which he had also dressed his lacqueys he wore a doublet of white damask laced with gold and carried a mantle of black velvet swinging from his shoulders of black velvet too was the cap on his auburn head its sable colour an effective background for the ruddy effulgence of the great rubiesas large as beanswith which it was adorned  of the gentlemen who followed him the romans were dressed in the french mode like himself whilst the spaniards adhered to the fashions of their native spain  he was escorted as far as the end of the banchi by four cardinals and from a window of the vatican the pope watched the imposing cavalcade and followed it with his eyes until it was lost to view weeping we are told for very joy at the contemplation of the splendour and magnificence which it had been his to bestow upon his beloved sonthe very heart of him as he wrote to the king of france in that letter of which cesare was the bearer  on october 12 the duke of valentinois landed at marseilles where he was received by the bishop of dijon whom the king had sent to meet him and who now accompanied the illustrious visitor to avignon there cesare was awaited by the cardinal giuliano della rovere this prelate was now anxious to make his peace with alexanderand presently we shall look into the motives that probably inspired him a matter which has so far we fancy escaped criticism for reasons that we shall also strive to make apparent to the beginnings of a reconciliation with the pontiff afforded by his touching letter of condolence on the death of the duke of gandia he now added a very cordial reception and entertainment of cesare and throughout his sojourn in france the latter received at the hands of della rovere the very friendliest treatment the cardinal missing no opportunity of working in the dukes interests and for the advancement of his ends  the pope wrote to the cardinal commending cesare to his good graces and the cardinal replied with protestations which he certainly proceeded to make good  della rovere was to escort cesare to the king who was with his court then at chinon awaiting the completion of the work that was being carried out at his castle of blois which presently became his chief residence but cesare appears to have tarried in avignon for he was still there at the end of october nor did he reach chinon until the middle of december the pomp of his entrance was a thing stupendous we find a detailed relation of it in brantôme translated into prose form some old verses which he tells us that he found in the family treasury he complains of their coarseness and those who are acquainted with the delightful old frenchmans own frankness of expression may well raise their brows at that criticism of his whatever the coarse liberties taken with the subjectof which we are not allowed more than an occasional glimpseand despite the fact that the relation was in verse which ordinarily makes for the indulgence of the rhymers fancythe description appears to be fairly accurate for it corresponds more or less with the particulars given in sanuto  at the head of the cavalcade went twentyfour sumptermules laden with coffers and other baggage under draperies embroidered with cesares armsprominent among which would be the red bull the emblem of his house and the threepointed flame his own particular device behind these came another twentyfour mules caparisoned in the kings colours of scarlet and gold to be followed in their turn by sixteen beautiful chargers led by hand similarly caparisoned and their bridles and stirrups of solid silver next came eighteen pages on horseback sixteen of whom were in scarlet and yellow whilst the remaining two were in cloth of gold these were followed by a posse of lacqueys in the same liveries and two mules laden with coffers draped with cloth of gold which contained the gifts of which cesare was the bearer behind these rode the dukes thirty gentlemen in cloth of gold and silver and amongst them came the duke himself  cesare was mounted on a superb warhorse that was all empanoplied in a cuirass of gold leaves of exquisite workmanship its head surmounted by a golden artichoke its tail confined in a net of gold abundantly studded with pearls the duke was in black velvet through the slashings of which appeared the gold brocade of the undergarment suspended from a chain said by brantômes poet to be worth thirty thousand ducats a medallion of diamonds blazed upon his breast and in his black velvet cap glowed those same wonderful rubies that we saw on the occasion of his departure from rome his boots were of black velvet laced with gold thread that was studded with gems  the rear of the cavalcade was brought up by more mules and the chariots bearing his plate and tents and all the other equipage with which a prince was wont to travel  it is said by some that his horse was shod with solid gold and there is also a storypretty but probably untruethat some of his mules were shod in the same metal and that either because the shoes were loosely attached of intent or because the metal being soft parted readily from the hoofs these golden shoes were freely cast and left as largesse for those who might care to take them  the bishop of rouenthat same georges damboise for whom he was bringing the red hatthe seneschal of toulouse and several gentlemen of the court went to meet him on the bridge and escorted him up through the town to the castle where the king awaited him louis xii gave him a warm and cordial welcome showing him then and thereafter the friendliest consideration not so however the lady he was come to woo it was said in venice that she was in love with a young breton gentleman in the following of queen anne whether this was true and carlotta acted in the matter in obedience to her own feelings or whether she was merely pursuing the instructions she had received from naples she obstinately and absolutely refused to entertain or admit the suit of cesare  della rovere on january 18 wrote to the pope from nantes whither the court had moved a letter in which he sang the praises of the young duke of valentinois  by his modesty his readiness his prudence and his other virtues he has known how to earn the affections of every one unfortunately there was one important exception as the cardinal was forced to add the damsel either out of her own contrariness or because so induced by others which is easier to believe constantly refuses to hear of the wedding  della rovere was quite justified in finding it easier to believe that carlotta was acting upon instructions from others for when hard pressed to consent to the alliance she demanded that the neapolitan ambassador should himself say that her father desired her to do soa statement which it seems the ambassador could not bring himself to make  baffled by the persistence of that refusal cesare all but returned a bachelor to italy so far indeed was his departure a settled matter that in february of 1489 at the castle of loches he received the kings messages for the pope yet louis hesitated to let him go without having bound his holiness to his own interests by stronger bonds  in the task of tracing the annals of the borgias the honest seeker after truth is compelled to proceed axe in hand that he may hack himself a way through the tangle of irresponsible or malicious statements that have grown up about this subject driving their roots deep into the soil of history not a single chance does malignity free or chartered appear to have missed for the invention of flagitious falsehoods concerning this family or for the no less flagitious misinterpretation of known facts  amid a mass of written nonsense dealing with cesares sojourn in france is the oftrepeated totally unproven statement that he withheld from louis the dispensation enabling the latter to marry anne of brittany until such time as he should have obtained from louis all that he desired of himin short that he sold him the dispensation for the highest price he could extract the only motive served by this statement is once more to show alexander and his son in the perpetration of simoniacal practices and the statement springs beyond doubt from a passage in macchiavellis extracts from dispatches to the ten elsewhere has been mentioned the confusion prevailing in those extracts and their unreliability as historical evidences that circumstance can be now established the passage in question runs as follows  this dispensation was given to valentinois when he went to france without any one being aware of its existence with orders to sell it dearly to the king and not until satisfied of the wife and his other desires and whilst these things were toward the king learnt from the bishop of ceuta that the dispensation already existed and so without having received or even seen it the marriage was celebrated and for revealing this the bishop of ceuta was put to death by order of valentinois  now to begin with macchiavelli admits that what passed between pope and duke was secret how then does he pretend to possess these details of it but leaving that out of the question his statementso abundantly repeated by later writersis traversed by every one of the actual facts of the case  that there can have been no secret at all about the dispensation is made plain by the fact that manfredi the ferrarese ambassador writes of it to duke ercole on october 2the day after cesares departure from rome and as for the death of fernando dalmeida bishop of ceuta this did not take place then nor until two years later on january 7 1499 at the siege of forli whither he had gone in cesares trainas is related in bernardis chronicles and bonolis history of that town  to return to the matter of cesares imminent departure unwed from france louis xii was not the only monarch to whom this was a source of anxiety keener far was the anxiety experienced on that score by the king of naples who feared that its immediate consequence would be to drive the holy father into alliance with venice which was paying its court to him at the time and with that end in view eager to conciliate alexander in this hour of peril federigo approached him with alternative proposals and offered to invest cesare in the principalities of salerno and sanseverino which had been taken from the rebel barons to this the pope might have consented but that in the moment of considering it letters reached him from cesare which made him pause  louis xii had also discovered an alternative to the marriage of cesare with carlotta and one that should more surely draw the pope into the alliance with venice and himself  among the ladies of the court of queen annelouis had now been wedded a monththere were besides carlotta two other ladies either of whom might make cesare a suitable duchess one of these was a niece of the kings the daughter of the comte de foix the other was charlotte dalbret a daughter of alain dalbret duc de guyenne and sister to the king of navarre between these two cesare was now given to choose by louis and his choice fell upon charlotte  she was seventeen years of age and said to be the most beautiful maid in france and she had been reared at the honourable and pious court of jeanne de valois whence she had passed into that of anne of brittany which latter says hilarion de coste1 was a school of virtue an academy of honour     1  Éloges et vies des reynes princesses etc   negotiations for her hand were opened with alain who it is said was at first unwilling but in the end won over to consent navarre had need of the friendship of the king of france that it might withstand the predatory humours of castille and so for his sons sake alain could not long oppose the wishes of louis considering closely the pecuniary difficulties under which this alain dalbret was labouring and his notorious avarice one is tempted to conclude that such difficulties as he may have made were dictated by his reduced circumstances his impossibility or unwillingness to supply his daughter with a dowry fitting her rank and an unworthy desire to drive in the matter the best bargain possible and this is abundantly confirmed by the obvious care and hardheaded cunning with which the sieur dalbret investigated cesares circumstances and sources of revenue to verify their values to be what was alleged  eventually he consented to endow her with 30000 livres tournois 90000 francs to be paid as follows 6000 livres on the celebration of the marriage and the balance by annual instalments of 1500 livres until cleared off this sum as a matter of fact represented her portion of the inheritance from her deceased mother françoise de bretagne and it was tendered subject to her renouncing all rights and succession in any property of her fathers or her said deceased mothers  thus is it set forth in the contract drawn up by alain at casteljaloux on march 23 1499 which contract empowers his son gabriel and one regnault de st chamans to treat and conclude the marriage urged by the king between the duke of valentinois and alains daughter charlotte dalbret but that was by no means all among other conditions imposed by alain he stipulated that the pope should endow his daughter with 100000 livres tournois and that for his son amanieu dalbret there should be a cardinals hatfor the fulfilment of both of which conditions cesare took it upon himself to engage his father  on april 15 the treaty between france and venice was signed at blois it was a defensive and offensive alliance directed against all with the sole exception of the reigning pontiff who should have the faculty to enter into it if he so elected this was the first decisive step against the house of sforza and so secretly were the negotiations conducted that lodovico sforzas first intimation of them resulted from the capture in milanese territory of a courier from the pope with letters to cesare in france from these he learnt to his dismay not only of the existence of the league but that the pope had joined it the immediate consequence of this positive assurance that alexander had gone over to sforzas enemies was ascanio sforzas hurried departure from rome on july 13  in the meantime cesares marriage had followed almost immediately upon the conclusion of the treaty the nuptials were celebrated on may 12 and on the 19th he received at the hands of the king of france the knightly order of st michael which was then the highest honour that france could confer when the news of this reached the pope he celebrated the event in rome with public festivities and illuminations  of cesares courtship we have no information the fact that the marriage was purely one of political expediency would tend to make us conceive it as invested with that sordid lovelessness which must so often attend the marriages of princes but there exists a little data from which we may draw certain permissible inferences this damsel of seventeen was said to be the loveliest in france and there is more than a suggestion in le ferons de gestis regnum gallorum that cesare was by no means indifferent to her charms he tells us that the duke of valentinois entered into the marriage very heartily not only for the sake of its expediency but for the beauty of the lady which was equalled by her virtues and the sweetness of her nature  cesare we have it on more than one authority was the handsomest man of his day the gallantry of his bearing merited the approval of so fastidious a critic in such matters as baldassare castiglione who mentions it in his il cortigiano of his personal charm there is also no lack of commendation from those who had his acquaintance at this time added to this his italian splendour and flamboyance may well have dazzled a maid who had been reared amid the grey and something stern tones of the court of jeanne de valois  and so it may well be that they loved and that they were blessed in their love for the little space allotted them in each others company the sequel justifies in a measure the assumption just one little summer out of the span of their livesbrief though those lives weredid they spend together and it is good to find some little evidence that during that brief season at least they inhabited lifes rosegarden  in septemberjust four short months after the weddingbells had pealed above themthe trumpets of war blared out their call to arms louiss preparations for the invasion of milan were complete and he poured his troops through piedmont under the command of giangiacomo trivulzio  cesare was to accompany louis into italy he appointed his seventeenyearold duchess governor and administrator of his lands and lordships in france and dauphiny under a deed dated september 8 and he made her heiress to all his moveable possessions in the event of his death surely this bears some witness not only to the prevailing of a good understanding between them but to his esteem of her and the confidence he reposed in her mental qualities the rest her later mourning of him shows  thus did cesare take leave of the young wife whom he was never to see again their childborn in the following springhe was never to see at all the pity of it ambitiondriven to fulfil the destiny expected of him he turned his back upon that pleasant land of dauphiny where the one calm little season of his manhood had been spent where happiness and peace might have been his lifelong portion had he remained he set his face towards italy and the storm and stress before him and in the train of king louis he set out upon the turbulent meteoric course that was to sear so deep and indelible a brand across the scroll of history     chapter ii the knell of the tyrants   in the hour of his need lodovico sforza found himself without friends or credit and he had to pay the price of the sly faithless egotistical policy he had so long pursued with profit  his farreaching schemes were flung into confusion because a french king had knocked his brow against a door and had been succeeded by one who conceived that he had a legal right to the throne of milan and the intent and might to enforce it be the right legal or not it was in vain now that lodovico turned to the powers of italy for assistance in vain that his cunning set fresh intrigues afoot his neighbours had found him out long since he had played fast and loose with them too often and there was none would trust him now  thus he found himself isolated and in no case to withstand the french avalanche which rolled down upon his duchy the fall of milan was a matter of days of resistance there was practically none town after town threw up its gates to the invaders and lodovico seeing himself abandoned on all sides sought in flight the safety of his own person  cesare took no part in the war which after all was no warno more than an armed progress he was at lyons with the king and he did not move into italy until louis went to take possession of his new duchy  amid the acclamations of the everfickle mob hailing him as its deliverer louis xii rode triumphantly into milan on october 6 attended by a little host of princes including the prince of savoy the dukes of montferrat and ferrara and the marquis of mantua but the place of honour went to cesare borgia who rode at the kings side a brilliant and arresting figure this was the occasion on which baldassare castiglionewho was in the marquis of mantuas suitewas moved to such praise of the appearance and gallant bearing of the duke and of the splendid equipment of his suite which outshone those of all that little host of attendant princes  from this time onward cesare signs himself cesare borgia of france and quarters on his shield the golden lilies of france with the red bull of the house of borgia  the conditions on which alexander vi joined the league of france and venice became apparent at about this time they were to be gathered from the embassy of his nephew the cardinal giovanni borgia to venice in the middle of september there the latter announced to the council of ten that the popes holiness aimed at the recovery to the church of those romagna tyrannies which originally were fiefs of the holy see and held by her vicars who however had long since repudiated the pontifical authority refused the payment of their tributes and in some instances had even gone so far as to bear arms against the church  with one or two exceptions the violent and evil misgovernment of these turbulent princelings was a scandal to all italy they ruled by rapine and murder and rendered romagna little better than a nest of brigands their state of secession from the holy see arose largely out of the nepotism practised by the last popesa nepotism writers are too prone to overlook when charging alexander with the same abuse such popes as sixtus iv and innocent viii had broken up the states of the church that they might endow their children and their nephews the nepotism of such as these never had any result but to impoverish the holy see whilst on the other hand the nepotism of alexanderthis pope who is held up to obloquy as the archetype of the nepotisthad a tendency rather to enrich it it was not to the states of the church not by easy ways of plundering the territories of the holy see that he turned to found dominions and dynasties for his children he went beyond and outside of them employing princely alliances as the means to his ends gandia was a duke in spain giuffredo a prince in naples and cesare a duke in france for none of these could it be said that territories had been filched from rome whilst the alliances made for them were such as tended to strengthen the power of the pope and therefore of the church  the reconsolidation of the states of the church the recovery of her full temporal power which his predecessors had so grievously dissipated had ever been alexanders aim louis xii afforded him at last his opportunity since with french aid the thing now might be attempted  his son cesare was the hercules to whom was to be given the labour of cleaning out the augean stable of the romagna  that alexander may have been singleminded in his purpose has never been supposed it might indeed be to suppose too much and the general assumption that from the outset his chief aim was to found a powerful state for his son may be accepted but let us at least remember that such had been the aims of several popes before him sixtus iv and innocent viii had similarly aimed at founding dynasties in romagna for their families but lacking the talents and political acuteness of alexander and a son of the mettle and capacity of cesare borgia the feeble trail of their ambition is apt to escape attention it is also to be remembered that whatever alexanders ulterior motive the immediate results of the campaign with which he inspired his son were to reunite to the church the states which had fallen away from her and to reestablish her temporal sway in the full plenitude of its dominion however much he may have been imbued with the desire to exalt and aggrandize his children politically he did nothing that did not at the same time make for the greater power and glory of the church  his formidable bull published in october set forth how after trial it had been found that the lords or vicars of rimini pesaro imola forli camerino and faenza with other feudatories of the holy see including the duchy of urbino had never paid the yearly tribute due to the church wherefore he by virtue of his apostolic authority deprived them of all their rights and did declare them so deprived  it has been said again and again that this bull amounting to a declaration of war was no more than a pretext to indulge his rapacity but surely it bears the impress of a real grievance and however blameable the results that followed out of it for the measure itself there were just and ample grounds  the effect of that bull issued at a moment when cesare stood at arms with the might of france at his back ready to enforce it was naturally to throw into a state of wild dismay these romagna tyrants whose acquaintance we shall make at closer quarters presently in the course of following cesares campaign cesare borgia may have been something of a wolf but you are not to suppose that the romagna was a fold of lambs  giovanni sforzacesares sometime brotherin­law and lord of pesaroflies in hot haste to venice for protection there are no lengths to which he will not go to thwart the borgias in their purpose to save his tyranny from falling into the power of this family which he hates most rabidly and of which he says that having robbed him of his honour it would now deprive him of his possessions he even offers to make a gift of his dominions to the republic  there was much traders blood in venice and traderlike she was avid of possessions you can surmise how she must have watered at the mouth to see so fine a morsel cast thus into her lap and yet to know that the consumption of it might beget a woeful indigestion venice shook her head regretfully she could not afford to quarrel with her ally king louis and so she made answera thought contemptuously it seemsthat giovanni should have made his offer while he was free to do so  the florentines exerted themselves to save forli from the fate that threatened it they urged a league of bologna ferrara forli piombino and siena for their common safetya proposal which came to nothing probably because ferrara and siena not being threatened by the bull saw no reason why for the sake of others they should call down upon themselves the wrath of the borgias and their mighty allies  venice desired to save faenza whose tyrant manfredi was also attainted for nonpayment of his tributes and to this end the republic sent an embassy to rome with the moneys due but the holy father refused the gold declaring that it was too late for payment  forlis attempt to avert the danger was of a different sort and not exerted until this dangerin the shape of cesare himselfstood in arms beneath her walls two men both named tommasothough it does not transpire that they were relatedone a chamberlain of the palace of forli the other a musician were so devoted to the countess sforzariario the grim termagant who ruled the fiefs of her murdered husband girolamo riario as to have undertaken an enterprise from which they cannot have hoped to emerge with their lives it imported no less than the murder of the pope they were arrested on november 21 and in the possession of one of them was found a hollow cane containing a letter so impregnated with poison that even to unfold it would be dangerous this letter was destined for the holy father  the story reads like a gross exaggeration emanating from men who on the subject of poisoning display the credulity of the fifteenth century so ignorant in these matters and so prone to the fantastic and our minds receive a shock upon learning that when put to the question these messengers actually made a confessionupon which the story restsadmitting that they had been sent by the countess to slay the pope in the hope that thus forli might be saved to the riarii at first we conclude that those wretched men examined to the accompaniment of torture confessed whatever was required of them as so frequently happened in such cases such indeed is the very explanation advanced by more than one writer coupled with the suggestion in some instances that the whole affair was trumped up by the pope to serve his own ends  they will believe the wildest and silliest of poisoning stories such as those of djem and cardinal giovanni borgia which reveal the borgias as the poisoners but let another be accused and the borgias be the intended victims and at once they grow rational and point out to you the wildness of the statement the impossibility of its being true yet it is a singular fact that a thorough investigation of this case of the countess sforzariarios poisoned letter reveals it to be neither wild nor impossible but simply diabolical the explanation of the matter is to be found in andrea bernardis chronicles of forli he tells us exactly how the thing was contrived with a precision of detail which we could wish to see emulated by other contemporaries of his who so lightly throw out accusations of poisoning he informs us that a deadly and infectious disease was rampant in forli in that year 1499 and that before dispatching her letter to the pope the countess caused it to be placed upon the body of one who was sick of this infectionthus hoping to convey it to his holiness1     1  dite litre lei le aveva fate tocare et tenere adose ad uno nostro infetadoandrea bernardi cronache di forli   alexander held a thanksgiving service for his escape at santa maria della pace and cardinal raffaele riario fled precipitately from rome justly fearful of being involved in the papal anger that must fall upon his house  by that time however cesare had already taken the field the support of louis conqueror of milan had been obtained and in this cardinal giuliano della rovere had once more been helpful to the borgias  his reconciliation with the pope long since deserved by the services he had rendered the house of borgia in forwarding cesares aims as we have seen was completed now by an alliance which bound the two families together his nephew francesco della rovere had married alexanders niece angela borgia  there is a letter from giuliano to the pope dated october 12 1499 in which he expresses his deep gratitude in the matter of this marriage which naturally redounded to the advantage of his house and pledges himself to exert all the influence which he commands with louis xii for the purpose of furthering the duke of valentinois wishes so well does he keep this promise that we see him utterly abandoning his cousins the riarii who were likely to be crushed under the hoofs of the now charging bull and devoting himself strenuously to equip cesare for that same charge so far does he go in this matter that he is one of the suretiesthe other being the cardinal giovanni borgiafor the loan of 45000 ducats raised by cesare in milan towards the cost of his campaign  this is the moment in which to pause and consider this man who because he was a bitter enemy of alexanders and who because earlier he had covered the pope with obloquy and insult and is to do so again later is hailed as a fine upright lofty independent noble soul  not so fine upright or noble but that he can put aside his rancour when he finds that there is more profit in fawning than in snarling not so independent but that he can become a sycophant who writes panegyrics of cesare and letters breathing devotion to the pope once he has realized that thus his interests will be better served this is the man remember who dubbed alexander a jew and a moor this the man who agitated at the courts of france and spain for alexanders deposition from the pontificate on the score of the simony of his election this the man whose vituperations of the holy father are so often quoted sincecoming from lips so honestthey must from the very moment that he utters them be merited if only the historian would turn the medal about a little and allow us a glimpse of the reverse as well as of the obverse what a world of trouble and misconceptions should we not be spared  della rovere had discovered vain his work of defamation vain his attempts to induce the kings of france and spain to summon a general council and depose the man whose seat he coveted so he had sought to make his peace with the holy see the death of charles viii and the succession of a king who had need of the popes friendship and who found a friend in alexander rendered it all the more necessary that della rovere should set himself to reconquer by every means in his power the favour of alexander  and so you see this honourable upright man sacrificing his very family to gain that personal end where now is that stubbornly honest conscience of his which made him denounce alexander as no christian and no pope stifled by selfinterest it is as well that this should be understood for this way lies the understanding of many things  the funds for the campaign being found cesare received from louis three hundred lances captained by yves dallègre and four thousand foot composed of swiss and gascons led by the bailie of dijon further troops were being assembled for him at cesenathe one fief of romagna that remained faithful to the churchby achille tiberti and ercole bentivogli and to these were to be added the pontifical troops that would be sent to him so that cesare found himself ultimately at the head of a considerable army some ten thousand strong wellequipped and supported by good artillery  louis xii left milan on november 7one month after his triumphal entranceand set out to return to france leaving trivulzio to represent him as ruler of the milanese two days later cesares army took the road and he himself went with his horse by way of piacenza whilst the foot under the bailie of dijon having obtained leave of passage through the territories of ferrara and cremona followed the po down to argenta  thus did cesare borgiapersonally attended by a caesarian guard wearing his liveryset out upon the conquest of the romagna perhaps at no period of his career is he more remarkable than at this moment to all trades men serve apprenticeships and to none is the apprenticeship more gradual and arduous than to the trade of arms yet cesare borgia served none like minerva springing fullgrown and armed into existence so cesare sprang to generalship in the hour that saw him made a soldier this was the first army in which he had ever marched yet he marched at the head of it in his twentyfour years of life he had never so much as witnessed a battle pitched yet here was he riding to direct battles and to wrest victories boundless audacity and swiftest intelligence welded into an amazing whole     chapter iii imola and forli   between his departure from milan and his arrival before imola where his campaign was to be inaugurated cesare paid a flying visit to rome and his father whom he had not seen for a full year he remained three days at the vatican mostly closeted with the popes holiness at the end of that time he went north again to rejoin his army which by now had been swelled by the forces that had joined it from cesena some pontifical troops and a condotta under vitellozzo vitelli  the latter who was lord of castello had gone to milan to seek justice at the hands of louis xii against the florentines who had beheaded his brother paolodeservedly for treason in the conduct of the war against pisa this vitellozzo was a valuable and experienced captain he took service with cesare spurred by the hope of ultimately finding a way to avenge himself upon the florentines and in cesares train he now advanced upon imola and forli  the warlike countess caterina sforzariario had earlier been granted by her children full administration of their patrimony during their minority to the defence of this she now addressed herself with all the resolution of her stern nature her life had been unfortunate and of horrors she had touched a surfeit her father galeazzo sforza was murdered in milan cathedral by a little band of patriots her brother giangaleazzo had died of want or poison in the castle of pavia the victim of her ambitious uncle lodovico her husband girolamo riario she had seen butchered and flung naked from a window of the very castle which she now defended giacomo feo whom she had secretly married in second nuptials was done to death in forli under her very eyes by a party of insurrectionaries him she had terribly avenged getting her menatarms together she had ridden at their head into the quarter inhabited by the murderers and there orderedas macchiavelli tells usthe massacre of every human being that dwelt in it women and children included whilst she remained at hand to see it done thereafter she took a third husband in giovanni di pierfrancesco demedici who died in 1498 by him this lusty woman had a son whose name was to ring through italy as that of one of the most illustrious captains of his daygiovanni delle bande nere  such was the woman whom sanuto has called greatsouled but a most cruel virago who now shut herself into her castle to defy the borgia  she had begun by answering the popes bull of attainder with the statement that far from owing the holy see the tribute which it claimed the holy see was actually in her debt her husband count girolamo riario having been a creditor of the church for the provisions made by him in his office of captaingeneral of the pontifical forces this subterfuge however had not weighed with alexander whereupon having also been frustrated in her attempt upon the life of the popes holiness she had proceeded to measures of martial resistance her children and her treasures she had dispatched to florence that they might be out of danger retaining of the former only her son ottaviano a young man of some twenty years but for all that she kept him near her it is plain that she did not account him worthy of being entrusted with the defence of his tyranny for it was she herself the daughter of the bellicose race of sforza who set about the organizing of this  disposing of forces that were entirely inadequate to take the field against the invader she entrenched herself in her fortress of forli provisioning it to withstand a protracted siege and proceeding to fortify it by throwing up outworks and causing all the gates but one to be built up  whilst herself engaged upon military measures she sent her son ottaviano to imola to exhort the council to loyalty and the defence of the city but his mission met with no success labouring against him was a mighty factor which in other future cases was to facilitate cesares subjection of the romagna the riariiin common with so many other of the romagna tyrantshad so abused their rule so ground the people with taxation so offended them by violence and provoked such deep and bitter enmity that in this hour of their need they found themselves deservedly abandoned by their subjects the latter were become eager to try a change of rulers in the hope of finding thus an improved condition of things a worse they were convinced would be impossible  so detested were the riarii and so abhorred the memory they left behind them in imola that for years afterwards the name of cesare borgia was blessed there as that of a minister of divine justice tanquam minister divina justitiae who had lifted from them the harsh yoke by which they had been oppressed  and so it came to pass that before ever cesare had come in sight of imola he was met by several of its gentlemen who came to offer him the town and he received a letter from the pedagogue flaminio with assurances that if it should be at all possible to them the inhabitants would throw open the gates to him on his approach and flaminio proceeded to implore the duke that should he nevertheless be constrained to have recourse to arms to win admittance he should not blame the citizens nor do violence to the city by putting it to pillage assuring him that he would never have a more faithful loving city than imola once this should be in his power  the duke immediately sent forward achille tiberti with a squadron of horse to demand the surrender of the town and the captain of the garrison of imola replied that he was ready to capitulate since that was the will of the people three days lateron november 27cesare rode in as conqueror  the example of the town however was not followed by the citadel under the command of dionigio di naldo the latter held out and as the dukes army made its entrance into imola the castellan signified his resentment by turning his cannon upon the town itself with such resolute purpose that many houses were set on fire and demolished this naldo was one of the best reputed captains of foot of his day and he had seen much service under the sforza but his experience could avail him little here  on the 28th cesare opened the attack training his guns upon the citadel but it was not until a week later that having found a weak spot in the walls on the side commanding the town he opened a breach through which his men were able to force a passage and so possess themselves of a halfmoon seeing the enemy practically within his outworks and being himself severely wounded in the head naldo accounted it time to parley he begged a threedays armistice pledging himself to surrender at the end of that time should he not receive reinforcements in the meanwhile and to this arrangement the duke consented  the good faith of naldo has been questioned and it has been suggested that his asking for three days grace was no better than a cloak to cover his treacherous sale of the fortress to the besieger it seems however to be no more than one of those lightlyuttered irresponsible utterances with which the chronicles of the time abound for naldo had left his wife and children at forli in the hands of the countess as hostages for his good faith and this renders improbable the unsupported story of his baseness  on december 7 no reinforcements having reached him naldo made formal surrender of the citadel safeconduct having been granted to his garrison  a week later there arrived at imola cesares cousin the cardinal giovanni borgia whom the pope had constituted legate in bologna and the romagna in place of the cardinal ascanio sforza and whom he had sent to support cesares operations with ecclesiastical authority cardinal giovanni as the popes representative received in the church of san domenico the oath of fealty of the city to the holy see this was pledged by four representative members of the council of thirty and by that act the conquest and subjection of the town became a fully accomplished fact  the lesser strongholds of the territory threw up their gates one by one before the advancing enemy until only forli remained to be taken cesare pushed forward to reduce it  on his way he passed through faenza whose tyrant manfredi deeming himself secure in the protection of venice and in view of the circumstance that the republic had sent to rome the arrears of tribute due from his fief and anxious to conciliate the pope received and entertained cesare very cordially  at forli the case of imola was practically repeated notwithstanding that the inhabitants were under the immediate eye of the formidable countess and although she sent her brother alessandro sforza to exhort the people and the council to stand by her the latter weary as the rest of the oppressive tyranny of her family dispatched their representatives to cesare to offer him the town  the countesss valour was of the sort that waxes as the straits become more desperate since the town abandoned and betrayed her she would depend upon her citadel and by a stubborn resistance make cesare pay as dearly as possible for the place to the danger which she seems almost eager to incur for her own part this strongminded comely matron will not subject the son she has kept beside her until now and so she packs ottaviano off to florence and safety that done she gives her mutinous subjects a taste of her anger by attempting to seize half a dozen of the principal citizens of forli as it happened not only did this intent miscarry but it went near being the means of involving her in battle even before the dukes arrival for the people getting wind of the affair took up arms to defend their threatened fellowcitizens  she consoled herself however by seizing the persons of nicolo tornielli and lodovico ercolani whom the council had sent to inform her that their representatives had gone to cesare with the offer of the town further to vent her rage and signify her humour she turned her cannon upon the communal palace and shattered the tower of it  meanwhile cesare advanced it was again tiberti who now rode forward with his horse to demand the surrender of forli this was accorded as readily as had been that of imola whereupon cesare came up to take possession in person but despite the cordial invitation of the councillors he refused to enter the gates until he had signed the articles of capitulation  on december 19 under a deluge of rain cesare in full armour the banner of the church borne ahead of him rode into forli with his troops he was housed in the palace of count luffo nomaglie one of the gentlemen whom caterina had hoped to capture and his men were quartered through the town these foreign soldiers of his seem to have got a little out of hand here at forli and they committed a good many abuses to the dismay and discomfort of the citizens  sanuto comments upon this with satisfaction accounting the city well served for having yielded herself up like a strumpet it is a comment more picturesque than just for obviously forli did not surrender through pusillanimity but to the end that it might be delivered from the detestable rule of the riarii  the city occupied it now remained to reduce the fortress and bring its warriormistress to terms cesare set about this at once nor allowed the christmas festivities to interfere with his labours but kept his men at work to bring the siegeguns into position on christmas day the countess belatedly attempted a feeble ruse in the hope of intimidating them she flew from her battlements a banner bearing the device of the lion of st mark thinking to trick cesare into the belief that she had obtained the protection of venice or perhaps signifying thus that she threw herself into the arms of the republic making surrender of her fiefs to the venetians to the end that she might spite a force which she could not long withstandas giovanni sforza had sought to do  but cesare nowise disturbed by that banner pursued his preparations which included the mounting of seven cannons and ten falconets in the square before the church of st john the baptist when all was ready for the bombardment he made an effort to cause her to realize the hopelessness of her resistance and the vain sacrifice of life it must entail he may have been moved to this by the valour she displayed or it may have been that he obeyed the instincts of generalship which made him ever miserly in the matter of the lives of his soldiers be that as it may with intent to bring her to a reasonable view of the situation he rode twice to the very edge of the ditch to parley with her but all that came of his endeavours was that on the occasion of his second appeal to her he had a narrow escape of falling a victim to her treachery and so losing his life  she came down from the ramparts and ordering the lowering of the bridge invited him to meet her upon it that there they might confer more at their ease having meanwhile instructed her castellan to raise the bridge again the moment the duke should set foot upon it the castellan took her instructions too literally for even as the duke did set one foot upon it there was a grind and clank of machinery and the great structure swung up and clattered into place the duke remained outside saved by a too great eagerness on the part of those who worked the winches for had they waited but a second longer they must have trapped him  cesare returned angry to forli and set a price upon caterinas head20000 ducats if taken alive 10000 if dead and on the morrow he opened fire for a fortnight this was continued without visible result and daily the countess was to be seen upon the walls with her castellan directing the defences but on january 12 cesares cannon having been concentrated upon one point a breach was opened at last instantly the waiting citizens who had been recruited for the purpose made forward with their faggots heaping them up in the moat until a passage was practicable over this went cesares soldiers to force an entrance  a stubborn fight ensued within the ravelin where the dukes men were held in check by the defenders and not until some four hundred corpses choked that narrow space did the besieged give ground before them  like most of the italian fortresses of the period the castle of forli consisted of a citadel within a citadel in the heart of the main fabricbut cut off from it again by its own moatarose the great tower known as the maschio this was ever the last retreat of the besieged when the fortress itself had been carried by assault and in the case of the maschio of the citadel of forli so stout was its construction that it was held to be practically invulnerable  had the countesss soldiers made their retreat in good order to this tower where all the munitions and provisions were stored cesare would have found the siege but in the beginning but in the confusion of that grim hour besieged and besiegers borgian and riarian swept forward interlocked a writhing hacking bleeding mob of menatarms thus they flung themselves in a body across the bridge that spanned the inner moat and so into the maschio whilst the stream of cesares soldiers that poured uninterruptedly across in the immediate wake of that battling mass rendered it impossible for the defenders to take up the bridge  within the tower the carnage went on and the dukes men hacked their way through what remained of the forlivese until they had made themselves masters of that inner stronghold whither caterina had sought her last refuge  a burgundian serving under the bailie of dijon was the first to come upon her in the room to which she had fled with a few attendants and a handful of men amongst whom were alessandro sforza paolo riario and scipione riariothis last an illegitimate son of her first husbands whom she had adopted the burgundian declared her his prisoner and held her for the price that had been set upon her head until the arrival of cesare who entered the citadel with his officers a little while after the final assault had been delivered  cesare received and treated her with the greatest courtesy and seeing her for the moment destitute he presented her with a purse containing two hundred ducats for her immediate needs under his escort she left the castle and was conducted with her few remaining servants to the nomaglie palace to remain in the dukes care his prisoner her brother and the other members of her family found with her were similarly made prisoners  after her departure the citadel was given over to pillage and all hell must have raged in it if we may judge from an incident related by bernardi in his chronicles a young clerk named evangelista da monsignane being seized by a burgundian soldier who asked him if he had any money produced and surrendered a purse containing thirteen ducats and so got out of the mercenaries clutches but only to fall into the hands of others one of whom again declared him a prisoner the poor youth terrified at the violence about him and eager to be gone from that shambles cried out that if they would let him go he would pay them a ransom of a hundred ducats  thereupon surrender to me cried one of the soldiers and as the clerk was about to do so another equally greedy for the ransom thrust himself forward no surrender to me rather demanded this one  the first insisted that the youth was his prisoner whereupon the second brandished his sword threatening to kill evangelista the clerk in a panic flung himself into the arms of a monk who was with him crying out for mercy and there in the monks arms he was brutally slain to put an end said his murderer to the dispute  forlimpopoli surrendered a few days later to yves dallègre whom cesare had sent thither whilst in forli as soon as he had reduced the citadel and before even attempting to repair the damage done the duke set about establishing order and providing for the dispensation of justice exerting to that end the rare administrative ability which not even his bitterest detractors have denied him  he sent a castellan to forlimpopoli and fetched from imola a podestà for forli1 he confirmed the council of forty that ruled forlibeing ten for each quarter of the cityand generally made sound and wise provision for the towns wellbeing which we shall presently see bearing fruit     1  it was customary throughout italy that the podestà or chief magistrate should never be a native of the townrarely of the statein which he held his office thus having no local interests or relationships he was the likelier to dispense justice with desirable singlemindedness   next the repairing of the fortress claimed his attention and he disposed for this entrusting the execution of his instructions to ramiro de lorqua whom he left behind as governor in the place where the breach was opened by his cannon he ordered the placing of a marble panel bearing his arms and there it is to be seen to this day dexter the sable bars of the house of lenzol sinister the borgia bull in chief and the lilies of france and superimposed an inescutcheon bearing the pontifical arms  all measures being taken so far as forli was concerned cesare turned his attention to pesaro and prepared to invade it before leaving however he awaited the return of his absent cousin the cardinal giovanni borgia who as papal legate was to receive the oath of fealty of the town but instead of the cardinal whom he was expecting came a messenger with news of his death of fever at fossombrone  giovanni borgia had left forli on december 28 to go to cesena with intent it was said to recruit to his cousins army those men of rimini who exiled and in rebellion against their tyrant malatesta had sought shelter in that pontifical fief thence he had moved on to urbino wherein the ducal palacehe awaited news of the fall of forli and where whilst waiting he fell ill nevertheless when the tidings of cesares victory reached him he insisted upon getting to horse to repair to forli but discovering himself too ill to keep the saddle he was forced to abandon the journey at fossombrone whilst the outcome of the attempt was an aggravation of the fever resulting in the cardinals death  cesare appears to have been deeply grieved by the loss of giovanni and there is every cause to suppose that a sincere attachment prevailed between the cousins yet cesare has been charged with his death and accused of having poisoned him and amidst the host of silly baseless accusations levelled against cesare you shall find none more silly or baseless than this in other instances of unproven crimes with which he has been charged there may be some vestiges of matter that may do duty for evidence or be construed into motives here there is none that will serve one purpose or the other and the appalling and rabid unscrupulousness the relentless malice of borgian chroniclers is in nothing so completely apparent as in this accusation  sanuto mentions the advices received and the rumours which say that cesare murdered him through jealousy knowing him beloved by the pope seeing him a legate and fearing that he might come to be given the governorship of some romagna fief  when gandia died and cesare was accused of having murdered him the motive advanced was that cesare a papal legate resented a brother who was a duke now cesare being a duke resents a cousins being a papal legate you will observe that if this method of discovering motives is pursued a little further there is no man who died in cesares lifetime whom cesare could not be shown to have had motives for murdering  sillier even than sanutos is the motive with which giovio attempts to bolster up the accusation which he reports he cesare poisoned him because he giovanni favoured the duke of gandia  that apparently was the best that giovio could think of it is hardly intelligiblewhich is perhaps inevitable for it is not easy to be intelligible when you dont quite know yourself what you mean which must have been giovios case  the whole charge is so utterly foolish stupid and malicious that it would scarcely be worth mentioning were it not that so many modern writers have included this among the borgia crimes as a matter of factand as a comparison of the abovecited dates will showeighteen days had elapsed between giovanni borgias leaving cesare at forli and his succumbing at urbinowhich in itself disposes of the matter it may be mentioned that this is a circumstance which those foolish or deliberately malicious calumniators either did not trouble to ascertain or else thought it wiser to slur over although had they been pressed there was always the death of djem to be cited and the fiction of the slowworking poison specially invented to meet and explain his case  the preparations for the invasion of pesaro were complete and it was determined that on january 22 the army should march out of forli but on the night of the 21st a disturbance occurred the swiss under the bailie of dijon became mutinousthey appear throughout to have been an illconditioned lotand they clamoured now for higher pay if they were to go on to pesaro urging that already they had served the duke of valentinois as far as they had pledged themselves to the king of france  towards the third hour of the night the bailie himself with these mutineers at his heels presented himself at the nomaglie palace to demand that the countess sforzariario should be delivered into his hands his claim was that she was his prisoner since she had been arrested by a soldier of his own and that her surrender was to france to which he addeda thought inconsequently it seemsthat the french law forbade that women should be made prisoners valentinois taken utterly by surprise and without the force at hand to resist the bailie and his swiss was compelled to submit and to allow the latter to carry the countess off to his own lodging but he dispatched a messenger to forlimpopoli with orders for the immediate return of allègre and his horse and in the morning after mass he had the army drawn up in the marketplace and so backed by his spanish french and italian troops he faced the threatening swiss  the citizens were in a panic expecting to see battle blaze out at any moment and apprehensive of the consequences that might ensue for the town  the swiss had grown more mutinous than ever overnight and they now refused to march until they were paid it was cesares to quell and restore them to obedience he informed them that they should be paid when they reached cesena and that if they were retained thereafter in his employ their pay should be on the improved scale which they demanded beyond that he made no concessions the remainder of his harangue was matter to cow them into submission for he threatened to order the ringing of the alarmbells and to have them cut to pieces by the people of forli whom their gross and predatory habits had already deeply offended  order was at last restored and the bailie of dijon was compelled to surrender back the countess to cesare but their departure was postponed until the morrow on that day january 23 after receiving the oath of fealty from the anziani in the church of san mercuriale the duke marched his army out of forli and took the road to pesaro  caterina sforza riario went with him dressed in black and mounted upon a white horse the handsome amazon rode between cesare borgia and yves dallègre  at cesena the duke made a halt and there he left the countess in the charge of dallègre whilst he himself rode forward to overtake the main body of his army which was already as far south as cattolica as for giovanni sforza despite the fact that the duke of urbino had sent some foot to support him he was far more likely to run than to fight and in fact he had already taken the precaution of placing his money and valuables in safety and was disposing himself to follow them but it happened that there was not yet the need fatein the shape of his cousin lodovico of milanpostponed the occasion  on the 26th cesare lay at montefiori and there he was reached by couriers sent at all speed from milan by trivulzio lodovico sforza had raised an army of swiss and german mercenaries to reconquer his dominions and the milanese were opening their arms to receive him back having already discovered that in exchanging his rule for that of the french they had but exchanged king log for king stork trivulzio begged for the instant return of the french troops serving under cesare and cesare naturally compelled to accede was forced to postpone the continuance of his campaign a matter which must have been not a little vexatious at such a moment  he returned to cesena where on the 27th he dismissed yves dallègre and his men who made all haste back to milan so that cesare was left with a force of not more than a thousand foot and five hundred horse these no doubt would have sufficed him for the conquest of pesaro but giovanni sforza encouraged by his cousins return and hopeful now of assistance would certainly entrench himself and submit to a siege which must of necessity be longdrawn since the departure of the french had deprived cesare of his artillery  therefore the duke disposed matters for his return to rome instead and leaving ercole bentivogli with five hundred horse and gonsalvo de mirafuente with three hundred foot to garrison forli he left cesena with the remainder of his forces including vitellis horse on january 30 with him went caterina sforzariario and of course there were not wanting those who alleged that during the few days at cesena he had carried his conquest of her further than the matter of her territories1a rumour whose parent was no doubt the ribald jest made in milan by trivulzio when he heard of her capture     1  teneva detta madona la qual é belissima dona fiola del ducha galeazo di milan di zorno e di note in la sna camera con la qualejudicio omniumsi deva piacer sanutos diarii   he conducted her to romein golden chains like another palmyra it is saidand there she was given the beautiful belvedere for her prison until she attempted an escape in the following june whereupon for greater safety she was transferred to the castle of sant angelo there she remained until may of 1501 when by the intervention of the king of france she was set at liberty and permitted to withdraw to florence to rejoin her children in the city of the lilies she abode devoting herself to good works until she ended her turbulent unhappy life in 1509  the circumstance that she was not made to pay with her life for her attempt to poison the pope is surely something in favour of the borgias and it goes some way towards refuting the endless statements of their fierce and vindictive cruelty of course it has been urged that they spared her from fear of france but if that is admitted what then becomes of the theory of that secret poison which might so well have been employed in such a case as this     chapter iv gonfalonier of the church   although cesare borgias conquest of imola and forli cannot seriously be accounted extraordinary military achievementssave by consideration of the act that this was the first campaign he had conductedyet in rome the excitement caused by his victory was enormous possibly this is to be assigned to the compelling quality of the mans personality which was beginning to manifest and assert itself and to issue from the shadow into which it had been cast hitherto by that of his stupendous father  the enthusiasm mounted higher and higher whilst preparations were being made for his reception and reached its climax on february 26 when with overpowering pomp he made an entrance into rome that was a veritable triumph  sanuto tells us that as news came of his approach the pope in his joyous impatience and excitement became unable to discharge the business of his office and no longer would give audience to any one alexander had ever shown himself the fondest of fathers to his children and now he overflowed with pride in this son who already gave such excellent signs of his capacity as a condottiero and justified his having put off the cassock to strap a soldiers harness to his lithe and comely body  cardinals farnese and borgia with an imposing suite rode out some way beyond the gates of santa maria del popolo to meet the duke at the gate itself a magnificent reception had been prepared him and the entire pontifical court prelates priests ambassadors of the powers and officials of the city and curia down to the apostolic abbreviators and secretaries waited to receive him  it was towards eveningbetween the twentysecond and the twentythird hourswhen he made his entrance in the van went the baggagecarts and behind these marched a thousand foot in full campaign apparel headed by two heralds in the dukes livery and one in the livery of the king of france next came vitellozzos horse followed by fifty mounted gentlemenatarmsthe dukes caesarean guardimmediately preceding cesare himself  the handsome young dukebello e biondowas splendidly mounted but very plainly dressed in black velvet with a simple gold chain for only ornament and he had about him a hundred guards on foot also in black velvet halbert on shoulder and a posse of trumpeters in a livery that displayed his arms in immediate attendance upon him came several cardinals on their mules and behind these followed the ambassadors of the powers cesares brother giuffredo borgia and alfonso of aragon duke of biselli and prince of salernolucrezias husband and the father of her boy roderigo born some three months earlier conspicuous too in cesares train would be the imposing figure of the formidable countess sforzariario in black upon her white horse riding in her golden shackles between her two attendant women  as the procession reached the bridge of sant angelo a salute was thundered forth by the guns from the castle where floated the banners of cesare and of the church the press of people from the porta del popolo all the way to the vatican was enormous it was the year of the papal jubilee and the city was thronged with pilgrims from all quarters of europe who had flocked to rome to obtain the plenary indulgence offered by the pope so great was the concourse on this occasion that the procession had the greatest difficulty in moving forward and the progress through the streets packed with shouting multitudes was of necessity slow at last however the bridge of sant angelo being crossed the procession pushed on to the vatican along the new road inaugurated for the jubilee by alexander in the previous december  from the loggia above the portals of the vatican the pope watched his sons imposing approach and when the latter dismounted at the steps his holiness with his five attendant cardinals descended to the chamber of the papagallothe papal audience­chamber contiguous to the borgia apartmentsto receive the duke thither sped cesare with his multitude of attendants and at sight of him now the popes eyes were filled with tears of joy the duke advanced gravely to the foot of the throne where he fell upon his knees and was overheard by burchard to express to his father in their native spanish all that he owed to the popes holiness to which alexander replied in the same tongue then cesare stooped and kissed the popes feet and then his hand whereupon alexander conquered no doubt by the paternal instincts of affection that were so strong in him raised his son and took him fondly in his arms  the festivities in honour of cesares return were renewed in rome upon the morrow and to this the circumstance that the season was that of carnival undoubtedly contributed and lent the displays a threatrical character which might otherwise have been absent in these the dukes victories were made the subject of illustration there was a procession of great chariots in piazza navona with groups symbolizing the triumphs of the ancient caesar in the arrangement of which no doubt the assistance had been enlisted of that posse of valiant artists who were then flocking to rome and the pontifical court  yriarte mixing his facts throughout with a liberal leaven of fiction tells us that this is the precise moment in which cesare borgia fixing his eyes upon the roman caesar takes him definitely for his model and adopts the device aut caesar aut nihil  cesare borgia never adopted that device and never displayed it in connection with him it is only to be found upon the sword of honour made for him when while still a cardinal he went to crown the king of naples it is not at all unlikely that the inscription of the device upon that swordwhich throughout is engraved with illustrations of the career of julius caesarmay have been the conceit of the swordmaker as a rather obvious play upon cesares name1 undoubtedly were the device of cesares own adoption we should find it elsewhere and nowhere else is it to be found     1  the scabbard of this sword is to be seen in the south kensington museum the sword itself is in the possession of the caetani family   shortly after cesares return to rome imola and forli sent their ambassadors to the vatican to beseech his holiness to sign the articles which those cities had drawn up and by virtue of which they created cesare their lord in the place of the deposed riarii  it is quite true that alexander had announced that in promoting the romagna campaign he had for object to restore to the church the states which had rebelliously seceded from her yet there is not sufficient reason to suppose that he was flagrantly breaking his word in acceding to the request of which those ambassadors were the bearers and in creating his son count of imola and forli admitted that this was to cesares benefit and advancement it is still to be remembered that those fiefs must be governed for the church by a vicar as had ever been the case  that being so who could have been preferred to cesare for the dignity seeing that not only was the expulsion of the tyrants his work but that the inhabitants themselves desired him for their lord for the rest granted his exceptional qualifications it is to be remembered that the pope was his father andsetting aside the guilt and scandal of that paternityit is hardly reasonable to expect a father to prefer some other to his son for a stewardship for which none is so well equipped as that same son that imola and forli were not free gifts to cesare detached for the purpose of so making them from the holy see is clear from the title of vicar with which cesare assumed control of them as set forth in the bull of investiture  in addition to his receiving the rank of vicar and count of imola and forli it was in this same month of march at lastand after cesare may be said to have earned itthat he received the gonfalon of the church with the unanimous concurrence of the sacred college the pope officially appointed him captaingeneral of the pontifical forcesthe coveting of which position was urged it will be remembered as one of his motives for his alleged murder of the duke of gandia three years earlier  on march 29 cesare comes to st peters to receive his new dignity and the further honour of the golden rose which the pope is to bestow upon himthe symbol of the church militant and the church triumphant  having blessed the rose the pope is borne solemnly into st peters preceded by the college of cardinals arrived before the high altar he puts off his tiarathe conical richly jewelled cap woven from the plumage of white peacocksand bareheaded kneels to pray whereafter he confesses himself to the cardinal of benevento who was the celebrant on this occasion that done he ascends and takes his seat upon the pontifical throne whither come the cardinals to adore him while the organ peals forth and the choir gives voice last of all comes cesare dressed in cloth of gold with ermine border to kneel upon the topmost step of the throne whereupon the pope removing his tiara and delivering it to the attendant cardinal of san clemente pronounces the beautiful prayer of the investiture that ended the pope receives from the hands of the cardinal of san clemente the splendid mantle of gonfalonier and sets it about the dukes shoulders with the prescribed words may the lord array thee in the garment of salvation and surround thee with the cloak of happiness next he takes from the hands of the master of the ceremoniesthat same burchard whose diary supplies us with these detailsthe gonfaloniers cap of scarlet and ermine richly decked with pearls and surmounted by a dovethe emblem of the holy spiritlikewise wrought in pearls this he places upon cesares auburn head whereafter once more putting off his tiara he utters the prescribed prayer over the kneeling duke  that done and the holy father resuming his seat and his tiara cesare stoops to kiss the popes feet then rising goes in his gonfalonier apparel the cap upon his head to take his place among the cardinals the organ crashes forth again the choir intones the introito ad altare deum the celebrant ascends the altar and having offered incense descends again and the mass begins  the mass being over and the celebrant having doffed his sacred vestments and rejoined his brother cardinals the cardinal of san clemente repairs once more to the papal throne preceded by two chamberlains who carry two folded banners one bearing the popes personal arms the other the arms of holy church behind the cardinal follows an acolyte with the censer and incenseboat and another with the holy water and the aspersorio and behind these again two prelates with a missal and a candle the pope rises blesses the folded banners and incenses them having received the censer from the hands of a priest who has prepared it then as he resumes his seat cesare steps forward once more and kneeling places both hands upon the missal and pronounces in a loud clear voice the words of the oath of fealty to st peter and the pope swearing ever to protect the latter and his successors from harm to life limb or possessions thereafter the pope takes the blessed banners and gives the charge of them to cesare delivering into his hands the white truncheon symbolic of his office whilst the master of ceremonies hands the actual banners to the two deputies who in full armour have followed to receive them and who attach them to the lances provided for the purpose  the investiture is followed by the bestowal of the golden rose whereafter cesare having again kissed the popes feet and the ring of the fisherman on his finger has the cap of office replaced upon his head by burchard himself and so the ceremonial ends  the bishop of isernia was going to cesena to assume the governorship of that pontifical fief and profiting by this cesare appointed him his lieutenantgeneral in romagna with authority over all his other officers there and full judicial powers further he desired him to act as his deputy and receive the oath of fealty of the dukes new subjects  meanwhile cesare abode in rome no doubt impatient of the interruption which his campaign had suffered and which it seemed must continue yet awhile lodovico sforza had succeeded in driving the french out of his dominions as easily as he himself had been driven out by them a few months earlier but louis xii sent down a fresh army under la trémouille and lodovico basely betrayed by his swiss mercenaries at novara in april was taken prisoner  that was the definite end of the sforza rule in milan for ten years the crafty scheming lodovico was left to languish a prisoner in the castle of loches at the end of which time he miserably died  immediately upon the return of the french to milan the pope asked for troops that cesare might resume his enterprise not only against pesaro faenza and rimini but also against bologna where giovanni bentivogli had failed to supportas in duty boundthe king of france against lodovico sforza but bentivogli repurchased the forfeited french protection at the price of 40000 ducats and so escaped the impending danger whilst venice it happened was growing concerned to see no profit accruing to herself out of this league with france and rome and that was a matter which her trader spirit could not brook therefore venice intervened in the matter of rimini and faenza which she protected in somewhat the same spirit as the dog protected the straw in the manger next when having conquered the milanese louis xii turned his thoughts to the conquest of naples and called upon venice to march with him as became a good ally the republic made it quite clear that she was not disposed to move unless there was to be some profit to herself she pointed out that mantua and ferrara were in the same case as bologna for having failed to lend assistance to the french in the hour of need and proposed to louis xii the conquest and division of those territories  thus matters stood and cesare had perforce to await the conclusion of the pisan war in which the french were engaged confident however that once that was at an end louis in his anxiety to maintain friendly relations with the pope would be able to induce venice to withdraw her protection from rimini and faenza so much accomplished for him he was now in a position to do the rest without the aid of french troops if necessary the jubileeprotracted for a further year so vast and continuous was the concourse of the faithful 200000 of whom knelt in the square before st peters on easter day to receive the popes blessingwas pouring vast sums of money into the pontifical coffers and for money men were to be had in plenty by a young condottiero whose fame had been spreading ever since his return from the romagna he was now the hope of the soldiers of fortune who abounded in italy attracted thither from all quarters by the continual opportunities for employment which that tumultuous land afforded  it is in speaking of him at about this time and again praising his personal beauty and fine appearance that capello says of him that if he lives he will be one of italys greatest captains  such glimpses as in the pages of contemporary records we are allowed of cesare during that crowded time of the papal jubilee are slight and fleeting on april 13 we see him on horseback accompanying the pope through rome in the cavalcade that visited the four basilicas to win the indulgence offered and as usual he is attended by his hundred armed grooms in black  on another occasion we behold him very differently engagedgiving an exhibition of his superb physical gifts his strength his courage and his matchless address on june 24 at a bullfight held in romespanish tauromachia having been introduced from naples where it flourished under the aragon dominionhe went down into the arena and on horseback armed only with a light lance he killed five wild bulls but the masterstroke he reserved for the end dismounting and taking a double­handed sword to the sixth bull that was loosed against him he beheaded the great beast at one single stroke a feat which all rome considered great  thus sped the time of waiting and meanwhile he gathered about him a court not only of captains of fortune but of men of art and letters whom he patronized with a liberalityindeed a prodigalityso great that it presently became proverbial and incidentally by its proportions provoked his fathers disapproval in the brilliant group of men of letters who enjoyed his patronage were such writers as justolo sperulo and that unfortunate poet serafino cimino da aquila known to fame and posterity as the great aquilano and it would be no doubt during these months that pier di lorenzo painted that portrait of cesare which vasari afterwards saw in florence but which unfortunately is not now known to exist bramante too was of his court at this time as was michelangelo buonarroti whose superb group of mercy painted for cardinal de villiers had just amazed all rome with pinturicchio and leonardi da vinciwhom we shall see later beside cesaremichelangelo was ever held in the highest esteem by the duke  the story of that young sculptors leap into fame may not be so widely known but that its repetition may be tolerated here particularly since remotely at least it touches cesare borgia  when in 1496 young buonarroti at the age of twentythree came from florence to rome to seek his fortune at the opulent pontifical court he brought a letter of recommendation to cardinal sforzariario this was the time of the great excavations about rome treasures of ancient art were daily being rescued from the soil and cardinal sforzariario was a great dilletante and collector of the antique with pride of possession he conducted the young sculptor through his gallery and displaying his statuary to him inquired could he do anything that might compare with it if the cardinal meant to use the young florentine cavalierly his punishment was immediate and poetic for amid the antiques michelangelo beheld a sleeping cupid which he instantly claimed as his own work riario was angry no doubt suspicious too of fraud this cupid wasas its appearance showeda genuine antique which the cardinal had purchased from a milanese dealer for two hundred ducats michelangelo in a passion named the dealerone baldassareto whom he had sent the statue after treating it with the questionable morality of the cinquecentist so as to give it the appearance of having lain in the ground to the end that baldassare might dispose of it as an antique  his present fury arose from his learning the price paid by the cardinal to baldassare from whom michelangelo had received only thirty ducats in his wrath he demandedvery arbitrarily it seemsthe return of his statue but to this the cardinal would not consent until baldassare had been arrested and made to disgorge the money paid him then at last sforzariario complied with michelangelos demands and delivered him his cupida piece of work whose possession had probably ceased to give any pleasure to that collector of the antique  but the story was bruited abroad and cultured rome was agog to see the statue which had duped so astute a judge as sforzariario the fame of the young sculptor spread like a ripple over water and it was cesare borgiaat that time still cardinal of valencia who bought the cupid years later he sent it to isabella deste assuring her that it had not its equal among contemporary works of art     chapter v the murder of alfonso of aragon   we come now to the consideration of an event which despite the light that so many and with such assurance have shed upon it remains wrapped in uncertainty and presents a mystery second only to that of the murder of the duke of gandia  it was you will remember in july of 1498 that lucrezia took a second husband in alfonso of aragon the natural son of alfonso ii of naples and nephew of federigo the reigning king he was a handsome boy of seventeen at the time of his marriageone year younger than lucreziaand in honour of the event and in compliance with the popes insistence he was created by his uncle duke of biselli and prince of salerno on every hand the marriage was said to be a lovematch and of it had been born in november of 1499 the boy roderigo  on july 15 1500 at about the third hour of the night alfonso was assaulted and grievously woundedmortally it was said at firston the steps of st peters  burchards account of the affair is that the young prince was assailed by several assassins who wounded him in the head right arm and knee leaving him no doubt for dead they fled down the steps at the foot of which some forty horsemen awaited them who escorted them out of the city by the pertusa gate the prince was residing in the palace of the cardinal of santa maria in portico but so desperate was his condition that those who found him upon the steps of the basilica bore him into the vatican where he was taken to a chamber of the borgia tower whilst the cardinal of capua at once gave him absolution in articulo mortis  the deed made a great stir in rome and was of course the subject of immediate gossip and three days later cesare issued an edict forbidding under pain of death any man from going armed between sant angelo and the vatican  news of the event was carried immediately to naples and king federigo sent his own physician galieno to treat and tend his nephew in the care of that doctor and a hunchback assistant alfonso lay ill of his wounds until august 17 when suddenly be died to the great astonishment of rome which for some time had believed him out of danger in recording his actual death burchard is at once explicit and reticent to an extraordinary degree not dying he writes from the wound he had taken he was yesterday strangled in his bed at the nineteenth hour  between the chronicling of his having been wounded on the steps of st peters and that of his death thirtythree days later there is no entry in burchards diary relating to the prince nor anything that can in any way help the inquirer to a conclusion whilst on the subject of the strangling not another word does the master of ceremonies add to what has above been quoted that he should so coldlyalmost cynicallystate that alfonso was strangled without so much as suggesting by whom is singular in one who however grimly laconic is seldom reticentnotwithstanding that he may have been so accounted by those who despaired of finding in his diary the confirmation of such points of view as they happen to have chosen and of such matters as it pleased them to believe and propagate  that same evening alfonsos body was borne without pomp to st peters and placed in the chapel of santa maria delle febbre it was accompanied by francesco borgia archbishop of cosenza  the doctor who had been in attendance upon the deceased and the hunchback were seized taken to sant angelo and examined but shortly thereafter set at liberty  so far we are upon what we may consider safe ground beyond that we cannot go save by treading the uncertain ways of speculation and by following the accounts of the various rumours circulated at the time formal and absolutely positive evidence of the author of alfonsos murder there is none  the venetian ambassador the ineffable gossip­mongering paolo capello whom we have seen possessed of the fullest details concerning the duke of gandias deathalthough he did not come to rome until two and a half years after the crimeis again as circumstantial in this instance you see in this capello the forerunner of the modern journalist of the baser sort the creature who prowls in quest of scraps of gossip and items of scandal and who having found them does not concern himself greatly in the matter of their absolute truth so that they provide him with sensational copy it is this same capello bear in mind who gives us the story of cesares murdering in the popes very arms that pedro caldes who is elsewhere shown to have fallen into tiber and been drowned down to the lurid details of the bloods spurting into the popes face  his famous relazione to the senate in september of 1500 is little better than an epitome of all the scandal current in rome during his sojourn there as ambassador and his resurrection of the old affair of the murder of gandia goes some way towards showing the spirit by which he was actuated and his love of sensational matter it has pleased most writers who have dealt with the matter of the murder of alfonso of aragon to follow capellos statements consequently these must be examined  he writes from romeas recorded by sanutothat on july 16 alfonso of biselli was assaulted on the steps of st peters and received four wounds one in the head one in the arm one in the shoulder and one in the back that was all that was known to capello at the time he wrote that letter and you will observe already the discrepancy between his statement penned upon hearsay and burchards accountwhich considering the latters position at the vatican must always be preferred according to burchard the wounds were three and they were in the head right arm and knee  on the 19th capello writes again and having stated that lucreziawho was really prostrate with grief at her husbands deathwas stricken with fever adds that it is not known who has wounded the duke of biselli but it is said that it was the same who killed and threw into tiber the duke of gandia my lord of valentinois has issued an edict that no one shall henceforth bear arms between sant angelo and the vatican  on the face of it that edict of valentinois seems to argue vexation at what had happened and the desire to provide against its repetitiona provision hardly likely to be made by the man who had organized the assault unless he sought by this edict to throw dust into the eyes of the world and one cannot associate after the event and the fear of criticism with such a nature as cesares or with such a character as is given him by those who are satisfied that it was he who murdered biselli  the rumour that alfonso had been assailed by the murderer of gandia is a reasonable enough rumour so long as the latter remains unnamed for it would simply point to some enemy of the house of borgia who having slain one of its members now attempts to slay another whether capello actually meant cesare when he penned those words on july 19 is not as obvious as may be assumed for it is to be borne in mind that at this date capello had not yet compiled the relation in which he deals with gandias murder  on july 23 he wrote that the duke was very ill indeed from the wound in his head and on the 28th that he was in danger owing to the same wound although the fever had abated  on august 18 he announces alfonsos death in the following terms the duke of biselli madonna lucrezias husband died today because he was planning the death of the duke of valentinois by means of an arbalestbolt when he walked in the garden and the duke has had him cut to pieces in his room by his archers  this cuttingtopieces form of death is one very dear to the imagination of capello and bears some witness to his sensationmongering proclivities  coming to matters more public and upon which his evidence is more acceptable he writes on the 20th that some servants of the princes have been arrested and that upon being put to the question they confessed to the princes intent to kill the duke of valentinois adding that a servant of the dukes was implicated on the 23rd capello circumstantially confirms this matter of alfonsos attempt upon cesares life and states that this has been confessed by the master of alfonsos household the brother of his mother madonna drusa  that is the sum of capellos reports to the senate as recorded by sanuto the rest the full lurid richlycoloured sensational story is contained in his relation of september 20 he prefaces the narrative by informing the senate that the pope is on very bad terms with naples and proceeds to relate the case of alfonso of aragon as follows  he was wounded at the third hour of night near the palace of the duke of valentinois his brother­inlaw and the prince ran to the pope saying that he had been wounded and that he knew by whom and his wife lucrezia the popes daughter who was in the room fell into anguish he was ill for thirtythree days and his wife and sister who is the wife of the prince of squillace another son of the popes were with him and cooked for him in a saucepan for fear of his being poisoned as the duke of valentinois so hated him and the pope had him guarded by sixteen men for fear that the duke should kill him and when the pope went to visit him valentinois did not accompany him save on one occasion when he said that what had not been done at breakfast might be done at supper on august 17 he valentinois entered the room where the prince was already risen from his bed and driving out the wife and sister called in his man named michieli and had the prince strangled and that night he was buried  now the following points must arise to shake the students confidence in this narrative and in capello as an authority upon any of the other matters that he relates    i  he was wounded near the palace of the duke of valentinois  this looks exceedingly like an attempt to pile up evidence against cesare and shows a disposition to resort to the invention of it whatever may not have been known about alfonsos death it was known by everybody that he was wounded on the steps of st peters and capello himself in his dispatches had said so at the time a suspicion that capellos whole relation is to serve the purpose of heaping odium upon cesare at once arises and receives confirmation when we consider that as we have already said it is in this same relation that the fiction about pedro caldes finds place and that the guilt of the murder of the duke of gandia is definitely fixed upon cesare    ii  he ran to the pope corse dal papa saying that he had been wounded and that he knew by whom a man with a wound in his head which endangered his life for over a week would hardly be conscious on receiving it nor is it to be supposed that had he been conscious his assailants would have departed it cannot be doubted that they left him for dead he was carried into the palace and we know from burchard that the cardinal of capua gave him absolution in articulo mortis which abundantly shows his condition it is unthinkable that he should have been able to run to the pope doubtful that he should have been able to speak and if he did who was it reported his words to the venetian ambassador capello wisely refrains from saying    iii  lucrezia and sancia attempt to protect him from poison by cooking his food in his room this is quite incredible even admitting the readiness to do so on the part of these princesses where was the need considering the presence of the doctoradmitted by capellosent from naples and his hunchback assistant    iv  the pope had him guarded by sixteen men for fear the duke should kill him yet when according to capello the duke comes on his murderous errand attended only by michieli who has been generally assumed by writers to have been don michele da corella one of cesares captains where were these sixteen guards capello mentions the dismissal only of lucrezia and sancia    v  valentinoissaid that what had not been done at breakfast might be done at supper it will be observed that capello never once considers it necessary to give his authorities for anything that he states it becomes perhaps more particularly noteworthy than usual in the case of this reported speech of cesares he omits to say to whom cesare addressed those sinister words and who reported them to him the statement is hardly one to be accepted without that very necessary mention of authorities nor can we conceive capello omitting them had he possessed them  it will be seen that it is scarcely necessary to go outside of capellos own relation for the purpose of traversing the statements contained in it so far as the death of alfonso of aragon is concerned  it is however still to be considered that if alfonso knew who had attempted his lifeas capello states that he told the popeand knew that he was in hourly danger of death from valentinois it may surely be taken for granted that he would have imparted the information to the neapolitan doctor sent him by his uncle who must have had his confidence  we know that after the princes death the physician and his hunchback assistant were arrested but subsequently released they returned to naples and in naples if not elsewhere the truth must have been knowndefinite and authentic facts from the lips of eyewitnesses not mere matters of rumour as was the case in rome it is to neapolitan writings then that we must turn for the truth of this affair and yet from naples all that we find is a rumourthe echo of the roman rumourthey say writes the venetian ambassador at the court of king federigo that he was killed by the popes son  a more mischievous document than capellos relazione can seldom have found its way into the pages of history it is the prime source of several of the unsubstantiated accusations against cesare borgia upon which subsequent writers have drawnaccepting without criticismand from which they have formed their conclusions as to the dukes character even in our own times we find the learned gregorovius following capellos relation step by step and dealing out this matter of the murder of the duke of biselli in his own paraphrases as so much substantiated unquestionable fact we find in his lucrezia borgia the following statement the affair was no longer a mystery cesare himself publicly declared that he had killed the duke because his life had been attempted by the latter  to say that cesare publicly declared that he had killed the duke is to say a very daring thing and is dangerously to improve upon capello if it is true that cesare made this public declaration how does it happen that no one but capello heard him for in all other documents there is no more than offered us a rumour of how alfonso died surely it is to be supposed that had cesare made any such declaration the letters from the ambassadors would have rung with it yet they will offer you nothing but statements of what is being rumoured  nor does gregorovius confine himself to that in his sedulous following of capellos relation he serves up out of capello the lying story of the murder of pedro caldes what he says of cesare to support his view that cesare murdered alfonso of aragon could be beyond this terrible man who had poignarded the spaniard pedro caldesunder the popes very cloak so that his blood spurted up into the popes face this in his history of rome in his lucrezia borgia he almost improves upon it when he says that the venetian ambassador paolo capello reports how cesare borgia stabbed the chamberlain perotto etc but burchard makes no mention of the fact of the fact of the stabbing burchard certainly makes no mention but he does mention that the man was accidentally drowned as has been considered it is againand more flagrantly than evera case of proving cesare guilty of a crime of which there is no conclusive evidence by charging him with another whichin this instancethere is actually evidence that he did not commit  but this is by the way  burchards entries in his diary relating to the assault upon alfonso of aragon can no more escape the criticism of the thoughtful than can capellos relation his forty horsemen for instance need explaining apart from the fact that this employment of forty horsemen would be an altogether amazing and incredible way to set about the murder of a single man it is to be considered that such a troop drawn up in the square before st peters must of necessity have attracted some attention it was the first hour of the night rememberaccording to burchardthat is to say at dusk presumably too those horsemen were waiting when the prince arrived how then did heand why was he allowedto pass them only to be assailed in ascending the steps burchard presumably did not himself see these horsemen certainly he cannot have seen them escorting the murderers to the pertusa gate therefore he must have had the matter reported to him naturally enough had the horsemen existed they must have been seen how then does it happen that capello did not hear of them nor the florentine ambassador who says that the murderers were four nor any one else apparently  to turn for a moment to the florentine ambassadors letters upon the subject we find in this other capellofrancesco capello was his nameaccounts which differ alike from paolo capellos and from burchard stories  but he is careful to say that he is simply repeating the rumours that are abroad and cites several different versions that are current adding that the truth of the affair is not known to anybody his conclusions however particularly those given in cipher point to cesare borgia as the perpetrator of the deed and hint at some such motive of retaliation for an attempt upon his own life as that which is given by the ambassador of venice  there is much mystery in the matter despite gregoroviuss assertion to the contrarymystery which mere assertion will not dissipate this conclusion however it is fair to draw if on capellos evidence we are to accept it that cesare borgia is responsible for the death of alfonso of aragon then on the same evidence we must accept the motive as well as the deed we must accept as equally exact his thricerepeated statement in letters to the senate that the prince had planned cesares death by posting crossbowmen to shoot him1     1  it is extremely significant that capellos relazione contains no mention of alfonsos plot against cesares life a matter which as we have seen had figured so repeatedly in that ambassadors dispatches from rome at the time of the event this omission is yet another proof of the malicious spirit by which the relation was inspired the suppression of anything that might justify a deed attributed to cesare reveals how much defamation and detraction were the aims of this venetian   either we must accept all or we must reject all that capello tells us if we reject all then we are left utterly without information as to how alfonso of aragon died if we accept all then we find that it was as a measure of retaliation that cesare compassed the death of his brotherinlaw which made it not a murder but a private executionjustifiable under the circumstances of the provocation received and as the adjustment of these affairs was understood in the cinquecento     chapter vi rimini and pesaro   in the autumn of 1500 fretting to take the field again cesare was occupied in raising and equipping an armyan occupation which received an added stimulus when towards the end of august louis de villeneuve the french ambassador arrived in rome with the articles of agreement setting forth the terms upon which louis xii was prepared further to assist cesare in the resumption of his campaign in these it was stipulated that in return for such assistance cesare should engage himself on his side to aid the king of france in the conquest of naples when the time for that expedition should be ripe further loius xii was induced to make representations to venice to the end that the republic should remove her protection from the manfredi of faenza and the malatesta of rimini  venice being at the time in trouble with the turk and more anxious than ever to conciliate france and the pope was compelled to swallow her reluctance and submit with the best grace she could assume accordingly she dispatched her ambassadors to rome to convey her obedience to the popes holiness and formally to communicate the news that she withdrew her protection from the proscribed fiefs  later in the yearin the month of octoberthe senate was to confer upon cesare borgia the highest honour in her gift the honour of which the venetians were jealous above all elsethe honour of venetian citizenship inscribing his name in the golden book bestowing upon him a palace in venice and conferring the other marks of distinction usual to the occasion one is tempted to ask was it in consequence of paolo capellos lurid relation that the proud republic considered him qualified for such an honour  to return however to the matter of the republics removal of her shield from rimini and faenza alexander received the news of this with open joy and celebrated it with festivities in the vatican whilst from being angry with venice and from declaring that the republic need never again look to him for favour he now veered round completely and assured the venetian envoys in a burst of gratitude that he esteemed no power in the world so highly cesare joined in his fathers expressions of gratitude and appreciation and promised that alexander should be succeeded in st peters chair by such a pope as should be pleasing to venice and that if the cardinals but remained united the pontificate should go to none but a venetian  thus did cesare sincerely or otherwise attempt to lessen the republics chagrin to see him ride lanceonthigh as conqueror into the dominions which she so long had coveted  france once more placed yves dallègre at cesares disposal and with him went six hundred lances and six hundred swiss foot these swelled the forces which already cesare had assembled into an army some ten thousand strong the artillery was under the command of vitellozzo vitelli whilst bartolomeo da capranica was appointed campmaster cesares banner was joined by a condotta under paolo orsinibesides whom there were several roman gentlemen in the dukes following including most of those who had formed his guard of honour on the occasion of his visit to france and who had since then continued to follow his fortunes achille tiberti came to rome with a condotta which he had levied in the romagna of young men who had been moved by cesares spreading fame to place their swords at his disposal a member of the exiled malvezzi family of bologna headed a little troop of fellowexiles which came to take service with the duke whilst at perugia a strong body of foot awaited him under gianpaolo baglioni  in addition to these condotte numerous were the adventurers who came to offer cesare their swords indeed he must have possessed much of that personal magnetism which is the prime equipment of every born leader for he stirred men to the point of wild enthusiasm in those days and inspired other than warriors to bear arms for him we see men of letters such as justolo calmeta sperulo and others throwing down their quills to snatch up swords and follow him painters and sculptors too are to be seen abandoning the ideals of art to pursue the ugly realities of war in this young condottieros train among these artists bulks the great pietro torrigiani the astounding pen of his brothersculptor benvenuto cellini has left us a sharp portrait of this man in which he speaks of his personal beauty and tells us that he had more the air of a great soldier than a sculptor which must have been we fancy cellinis own case torrigiani lives in history chiefly for two pieces of work widely dissimilar in characterthe erection of the tomb of henry vii of england and the breaking of the nose of michelangelo buonarroti in the course of a quarrel which he had with him in florence when they were fellowstudents under masaccio of nothing that he ever did in life was he so proudas we may gather from cellinias of having disfigured michelangelo and in that sentiment the naïve spirit of his age again peeps forth  we shall also see leonardo da vinci joining the dukes army as engineerbut that not until some months later  meanwhile his forces grew daily in rome and his time was consumed in organizing equipping and drilling these to bring about that perfect unity for which his army was to be conspicuous in spite of the variety of french italian spanish and swiss elements of which it was composed so effectively were his troops armed and so excellent was the discipline prevailing among them that their like had probably never before been seen in the peninsula and they were to exciteas much else of cesares workthe wonder and admiration of that great critic macchiavelli  so much however was not to be achieved without money and still more would be needed for the campaign ahead for this the church provided never had the coffers of the holy see been fuller than at this moment additional funds accrued from what is almost universally spoken of as the sale of twelve cardinals hats  in that yearin septembertwelve new cardinals were appointed and upon each of those was levied as a tax a tithe of the first years revenues of the benefices upon which they entered the only justifiable exception that can be taken to this lies in the number of cardinals elected at one time which lends colour to the assumption that the sole aim of that election was to raise additional funds for cesares campaign probably it was also alexanders aim further to strengthen his power with the sacred college so that he could depend upon a majority to ensure his will in all matters but we are at the moment concerned with the matter of the levied tax  it has been dubbed an atrocious act of simony but the reasoning that so construes it is none so clear the cardinals hats carried with them vast benefices these benefices were the property of the church they were in the gift and bestowal of the pope and in the bestowing of them the pope levied a proportionate tax setting aside the argument that this tax was not an invention of alexanders does such a proceeding really amount to a sale of benefices a sale presupposes bargaining a making of terms between two parties an adjusting of a price to be paid there is evidence of no such marketing of these benefices indeed one cardinal vowed to poverty received his hat without the imposition of a tax another was cesares brotherinlaw amanieu dalbret who had been promised the hat a year ago it is further to be borne in mind that four months earlier the pope had levied a similar decima or tax upon the entire college of cardinals and every official in the service of the holy see for the purposes of the expedition against the muslim who was in arms against christianity naturally that tax was not popular with luxurious selfseeking cinquecento prelates who in the main cared entirely for their own prosperity and not at all for that of christianity and you may realize how by levying it alexander laid himself open to harsh criticism  the only impugnable matter in the deed lies as has been said in the number of cardinals so created at a batch but the ends to be served may be held to justify if not altogether at least in some measure the means adopted the romagna war for which the funds were needed was primarily for the advancement of the church to expunge those faithless vicars who appointed by the holy see and holding their fiefs in trust for her refused payment of just tribute and otherwise so acted as to alienate from the church the states which she claimed for her own their restoration to the churchhowever much it might be a means of founding a borgia dynasty in the romagnamade for the greater power and glory of the holy see let us remember this and that such was the end which that tax levied upon those newly elected cardinals went to serve the aggrandizement of the house of borgia was certainly one of the results to be expected from the romagna campaign but we are not justified in accounting it the sole aim and end of that campaign  alexander had this advantage over either sixtus iv or innocent viiinot to go beyond those popes whom he had served as vicechancellor for instances of flagrant nepotismthat he at least served two purposes at once and that in aggrandizing his own family he strengthened the temporal power of the church whereas those others had done nothing but undermine it that they might enrich their progeny  and whilst on this subject of the sale of cardinals hats it may not be amiss to say a word concerning the sale of indulgences with which alexander has been so freely charged here again there has been too loud an outcry against alexanderan outcry whose indignant stridency leads one to suppose that the sale of indulgences was a simony invented by him or else practised by him to an extent shamefully unprecedented such is very far from being the case the archtype of indulgenceselleras of all other simoniacal practicesis innocent viii in his reign we have seen the murderer commonly given to choose between the hangman and the purchase of a pardon and we have seen the moneys so obtained providing his bastard the cardinal francesco cibo with the means for the luxuriously licentious life whose gross disorders prematurely killed him  to no such flagitious lengths as these can it be shown that alexander carried the sale of the indulgences he dispensed he had no lack of precedent for the practice and so far as the actual practice itself is concerned it would be difficult to show that it was unjustifiable or simoniacal so long as confined within certain welldefined bounds and so long as the sums levied by it were properly employed to the benefit of christianity it is a practice comparable to the mulcting of a civil offender against magisterial laws because our magistrates levy fines it does not occur to modern critics to say that they sell pardons and immunity from gaol it is universally recognized as a wise and commendable measure serving the two­fold purpose of punishing the offender and benefiting the temporal state against which he has offended need it be less commendable in the case of spiritual offences against a spiritual state it is more useful than the imposition of the pattering of a dozen prayers at bedtime and since no doubt it falls more heavily upon the offender it possibly makes to an even greater extent for his spiritual improvement  thus considered this sale of indulgences loses a deal of the heinousness with which it has been invested the funds so realized go into the coffers of the church which is fit and proper what afterwards becomes of them at the hands of alexander opens up another matter altogether one in which we cannot close our eyes to the fact that he was as undutiful as many another who wore the ring of the fisherman before him yet this is to be said for him that if he plunged his hands freely into the treasury of the holy see at least he had the ability to contrive that this treasury should be well supplied and the circumstance that when he died he left the church far wealthier and more powerful than she had been for centuries with her dominions which his precursors had wantonly alienated reconsolidated into that powerful state that was to endure for three hundred years is an argument to the credit of his pontificate not lightly to be set aside  imola and forli had themselves applied to the pontiff to appoint cesare borgia their ruler in the place of the deposed riarii to these was now added cesena in july disturbances occurred there between guelphs and ghibellines swords were drawn and blood flowed in the streets until the governor was constrained to summon ercole bentivogli and his horse from forli to quell the rioting the direct outcome of this was thatthe ghibellines predominating in councilcesena sent an embassy to rome to beg his holiness to give the lordship of the fief to the duke of valentinois to this the pope acceded and on august 2 cesare was duly appointed lord vicar of cesena he celebrated his investiture by remitting a portion of the taxes abolishing altogether the duty on flour and by bringing about a peace between the two prevailing factions  by the end of september cesares preparations for the resumption of the campaign were completed and early in october his army fortified in spirit by the popes blessing he set out and made his first halt at nepi lucrezia was there with her court and her child roderigo having withdrawn to this her castle to mourn her dead husband alfonso and there she abode until recalled to rome by her father some two months later  thence cesare pushed on as swiftly as the foul weather would allow him by way of viterbo assisi and nocera to cross the apennines at gualdo here he paused to demand the release of certain prisoners in the hill fortress of fossate and to be answered by a refusal angered by this resistance of his wishes and determined to discourage others from following the example of fossate he was swift and terrible in his rejoinder he seized the citadel and did by force what had been refused to his request setting at liberty the prisoners in durance there he gave the territory over to devastation by fire and pillage  that done he resumed his march but the weather retarded him more and more the heavy and continuous rains had reduced the roads to such a condition that his artillery fell behind and he was compelled to call a halt once more at deruta and wait there four days for his guns to overtake him  in rimini the great house of malatesta was represented by pandolforoberto malatestas bastard and successora degenerate so detested by his subjects that he was known by the name of pandolfaccio a contumelious augmentative expressing the evil repute in which he was held  among his many malpractices and the many abuses to which he resorted for the purposes of extorting money from his longsuffering subjects was that of compelling the richer men of rimini to purchase from him the estates which he confiscated from the fuoruscitithose who had sought in exile safety from the anger provoked by their just resentment of his oppressive misrule he was in the same case as other romagna tyrants and now that venice had lifted from him her protecting aegis he had no illusions as to the fate in store for him so when once more the tramp of cesare borgias advancing legions rang through the romagna pandolfaccio disposed himself not for battle but for surrender on the best terms that he might succeed in making  he was married to violante the daughter of giovanni bentivogli of bologna and in the first week of october he sent her with their children to seek shelter at her fathers court himself he withdrew into his citadelthe famous fortress of his terrible grandfather sigismondo the move suggested almost that he was preparing to resist the duke of valentinois and it may have prompted the message sent him by the council to inquire what might be his intention  honour was a thing unknown to this pandolfaccioeven so much honour as may be required for a dignified retreat since all was lost it but remainedby his lightsto make the best bargain that he could and get the highest possible price in gold for what he was abandoning so he replied that the council must do whatever it considered to its best advantage whilst to anticipate its members in any offer of surrender and thus seek the favour and deserve good terms at the hands of this man who came to hurl him from the throne of his family he dispatched a confidential servant to cesare to offer him town and citadel  in the meantimeas pandolfo fully expectedthe council also sent proposals of surrender to cesare as well as to his lieutenantgeneral of romagna bishop olivieri at cesena the communications had the effect of bringing olivieri immediately to rimini and there on october 10 the articles of capitulation were signed by the bishop as the dukes representative and by pandolfo malatesta it was agreed in these that malatesta should have safeconduct for himself and his familiars 3000 ducats and the valueto be estimatedof the artillery which he left in the citadel further for the price of 5500 ducats he abandoned also the strongholds of sarsina and medola and the castles of the montagna  his tyranny thus disposed of pandolfaccio took ship to ravenna where the price of his dishonour was to be paid him and in security for which he took with him gianbattista baldassare the son of the ducal commissioner  on the day of his departure to celebrate the bloodless conquest of rimini solemn high mass was sung in the cathedral and bishop olivieri received the citys oath of allegiance to the holy see whither very shortly afterwards rimini sent her ambassadors to express to the pope her gratitude for her release from the thraldom of pandolfaccio  like rimini pesaro too fell without the striking of a blow for all that it was by no means as readily relinquished on the part of its ruler giovanni sforza had been exerting himself desperately for the past two months to obtain help that should enable him to hold his tyranny against the borgia might but all in vain his entreaties to the emperor had met with no response whilst his appeal to francesco gonzaga of mantuawhose sister it will be remembered had been his first wifehad resulted in the marquiss sending him a hundred men under an albanian named giacopo  what giovanni was to do with a hundred men it is difficult to conceive nor are the motives of gonzagas action clear we know that at this time he was eagerly seeking cesares friendship sorely uneasy as to the fate that might lie in store for his own dominions once the duke of valentinois should have disposed of the feudatories of the church early in that year 1500 he had asked cesare to stand godfather for his child and cesare had readily consented whereby a certain bond of relationship and good feeling had been established between them which everything shows gonzaga most anxious to preserve unsevered the only reasonable conclusion in the matter of that condotta of a hundred men is that gonzaga desired to show friendliness to the lord of pesaro yet was careful not to do so to any extent that might be hurtful to valentinois  as for giovanni sforza of whom so many able pens have written so feelingly as the constant unfortunate victim of borgia ambition there is no need to enter into analyses for the purpose of judging him here his own subjects did so in his own day when a prince is beloved by all classes of his people it must follow that he is a good prince and a wise ruler when his subjects are divided into two factions one to oppose and the other to support him he may be good or bad or good and bad but when a prince can find none to stand by him in the hour of peril it is to be concluded that he has deserved little at the hands of those whom he has ruled the latter is the case of giovanni sforzathis prince whom yriarte tells us rendered sweet the lives of his subjects the nobility and the proletariate of pesaro abhorred him the trader classes stood neutral anxious to avoid the consequences of partisanship since it was the class most exposed to those consequences  on sunday october 11the day after pandolfo malatesta had relinquished rimininews reached pesaro that ercole bentivoglis horse was marching upon the town in advance of the main body of cesares army instantly there was an insurrection against giovanni and the people taking to arms raised the cry of duca in acclamation of the duke of valentinois under the very windows of their rulers palace  getting together the three hundred men that constituted his army giovanni beat a hasty retreat to pesaros magnificent fortress and that same night he secretly took ship to ravenna accompanied by the albanian giacopo and leaving his halfbrother galeazzo sforza di cotignola in command of the citadel thence giovanni repaired to bologna and already repenting his precipitate flight he appealed for help to bentivogli who was himself uneasy despite the french protection he enjoyed similarly giovanni addressed fresh appeals to francesco gonzaga but neither of these tyrants could or dared avail him and whilst he was still imploring their intervention his fief had fallen into cesares power  ercole bentivogli with a small body of horse had presented himself at the gates of pesaro on october 21 and galeazzo sforza having obtained safeconduct for the garrison surrendered  cesare meanwhile was at fano where he paused to allow his army to come up with him for he had outridden it from fossate through foul wintry weather attended only by his light horse it was said that he hoped that fano might offer itself to him as other fiefs had done andif pandolfo collenuccio is correcthe had been counselled by the pope not to attempt to impose himself upon fano but to allow the town a free voice in the matter if his hopes were as stated he was disappointed in them for fano made no offer to him and matters remained for the present as they were  on the 27th with the banners of the bull unfurled he rode into pesaro at the head of two thousand men making his entrance with his wonted pomp of whose dramatic values he was so fully aware he was met at the gates by the council which came to offer him the keys of the town and despite the pouring rain under which he entered the city the people of pesaro thronged the streets to acclaim him as he rode  he took up his lodgings at the sforza palace so lately vacated by giovannithe palace where lucrezia borgia had held her court when as giovannis wife she had been countess of pesaro and cotignola early on the morrow he visited the citadel which was one of the finest in italy rivalling that of rimini for strength on his arrival there a flourish of trumpets imposed silence while the heralds greeted him formally as lord of pesaro he ordered one of the painters in his train to draw up plans of the fortress to be sent to the pope and issued instructions for certain repairs and improvements which he considered desirable  here in pesaro came to him the famous pandolfo collenuccio as envoy from the duke of ferrara to congratulate cesare upon the victory in sending collenuccio at such a time ercole deste paid the duke of valentinois a subtle graceful compliment this distinguished poet dramatist and historian was a native of pesaro who had been exiled ten years earlier by giovanniwhich was the tyrants way of showing his gratitude to the man who more than any other had contributed to the bastard sforzas succession to his father as lord of pesaro and cotignola  collenuccio was one of the few literary men of his day who was not above using the italian tongue treating it seriously as a language and not merely as a debased form of latin he was eminent as a juris­consult and being a man of action as well as a man of letters he had filled the office of podestá in various cities he had found employment under lorenzo dei medici and latterly under ercole deste whom we now see him representing  cesare received him with all honour sending the master of his household ramiro de lorqua to greet him on his arrival and to bear him the usual gifts of welcome of barley wine capons candles sweetmeats etc whilst on the morrow the duke gave him audience treating him in the friendliest manner as we see from collenuccios own report to the duke of ferrara in this he says of cesare he is accounted valiant joyous and openhanded and it is believed that he holds honest men in great esteem harsh in his vengeance according to many he is great of spirit and of ambition athirst for eminence and fame  collenuccio was reinstated by cesare in the possessions of which giovanni had stripped him a matter which so excited the resentment of the latter that when ultimately he returned to his dominions one of his first acts was to avenge it collenuccio fearing that he might not stand well with the tyrant had withdrawn from pesaro but giovanni with all semblance of friendliness treacherously lured him back to cast him into prison and have him strangleda little matter which those who to the detriment of the borgia seek to make a hero of this giovanni sforza would do well not to suppress  a proof of the splendid discipline prevailing in cesares army is afforded during his brief sojourn in pesaro in the town itself some two thousand of his troops were accommodated whilst some thousands more swarmed in the surrounding country occupation by such an army was naturally enough cause for deep anxiety on the part of a people who were but too well acquainted with the ways of the fifteenth­century menatarms but here was a general who knew how to curb and control his soldiers under the pain of death his men were forbidden from indulging any of the predations or violences usual to their kind and as a consequence the inhabitants of pesaro had little to complain of  justolo gives us a picture of the duke of valentinois on the banks of the river montone which again throws into relief the discipline which his very presencesuch was the force of his personalitywas able to enforce a disturbance arose among his soldiers at the crossing of this river which was swollen with rains and the bridge of which had been destroyed it became necessary to effect the crossing in one small boatthe only craft availableand the men crowding to the bank stormed and fought for precedence until the affair grew threatening cesare rode down to the river and no more than his presence was necessary to restore peace under that calm cold eye of his the men instantly became orderly and whilst he sat his horse and watched them the crossing was soberly effected and as swiftly as the single craft would permit  the duke remained but two days in pesaro on the 29th having appointed a lieutenant to represent him and a captain to the garrison he marched out again to lie that night at cattolica and enter rimini on the morrow  there again he was received with open arms and he justified the peoples welcome of him by an immediate organization of affairs which gave universal satisfaction he made ample provision for the proper administration of justice and the preservation of the peace he recalled the fuorusciti exiled by the unscrupulous pandolfaccio and he saw them reinstated in the property of which that tyrant had dispossessed them as his lieutenant in rimini with strict injunctions to preserve law and order he left ramiro de lorqua when on november 2 he departed to march upon faenza which had prepared for resistance  what cesare did in rimini was no more than he was doing throughout the romagna as its various archives bear witness they bear witness no less to his vast ability as an administrator showing how he resolved the prevailing chaos into form and order by his admirable organization and suppression of injustice the same archives show us also that he found time for deeds of beneficence which endeared him to the people who everywhere hailed him as their deliverer from thraldom it would not be wise to join in the chorus of those who appear to have taken cesares altruism for granted the rejection of the wild stories that picture him as a corrupt and murderous monster utterly inhuman and lay a dozen ghastly crimes to his account need not entail our viewing cesare as an angel of deliverance a divine agent almost rescuing a suffering people from oppression out of sheer humanitarianism  he is the one as little as the other he is justas collenuccio wrote to ercole destegreat of spirit and of ambition athirst for eminence and fame he was consumed by the desire for power and worldly greatness a colossus of egotism to whom men and women were pieces to be handled by him on the chessboard of his ambition to be sacrificed ruthlessly where necessary to his ends but to be husbanded and guarded carefully where they could serve him  with his eyes upon the career of cesare borgia macchiavelli was anon to write of principalities newlyacquired that however great may be the military resources of a prince he will discover that to obtain firm footing in a province he must engage the favour and interest of the inhabitants  that was a principle selfevident to cesarethe principle upon which he acted throughout in his conquest of the romagna by causing his new subjects to realize at once that they had exchanged an oppressive for a generous rule he attached them to himself     chapter vii the siege of faenza   the second campaign of the romagna had opened for cesare as easily as had the first so far his conquest had been achieved by little more than a processional display of his armed legions like another joshua he reduced cities by the mere blare of his trumpets at last however he was to receive a check where grown men had fled cravenly at his approach it remained for a child to resist him at faenza as a woman had resisted him at forli  his progress north from pesaro was of necessity slow he paused as we have seen at rimini and he paused again and for a rather longer spell at forli so that it was not until the second week of november that astorre manfredithe boy of sixteen who was to hold faenzacaught in the distance the flash of arms and the banners with the bull device borne by the host which the duke of valentinois led against him  at first it had been astorres intent to follow the examples set him by malatesta and sforza and he had already gone so far as to remove his valuables to ravenna whither he too meant to seek refuge but he was in better case than any of the tyrants so far deposed inasmuch as his family which had ruled faenza for two hundred years had not provoked the hatred of its subjects and these were now ready and willing to stand loyally by their young lord but loyalty alone can do little unless backed by the might of arms against such a force as cesare was prepared to hurl upon faenza this astorre realized and for his own and his subjects sake was preparing to depart when to his undoing support reached him from an unexpected quarter  bolognawhose ruler giovanni bentivogli was astorres grandfatherin common with florence and urbino grew daily more and more alarmed at the continual tramp of armed multitudes about her frontiers and at the steady growth in numbers and in capacity of this splendid army which followed casarean army captained by such enemies of the bentivogli as the baglioni the orsini and the exiled malvezzi  bentivogli had good grounds for his anxiety not knowing how long he might depend upon the protection of france and well aware that once that protection was removed there would be no barrier between bologna and cesares manifest intentions concerning her  next to cesares utter annihilation to check his progress was the desire dearest just then to the heart of bentivogli and with this end in view he dispatched count guido torella to faenza in midoctober with an offer to assist astorre with men and money  astorre who had succeeded galeotto manfredi in the tyranny of faenza at the age of three had been and still continued under the tutelage of the council which really governed his territories to this council came count torella with bentivoglis offer adding the proposal that young astorre should be sent to venice for his personal safety but to this the council replied that it would be useless if that course were adopted to attempt resistance as the people could only be urged to it by their affection for their young lord and that if he were removed from their midst they would insist upon surrender  news of these negotiations reached rome and on october 24 alexander sent bentivogli his commands to refrain under pain of excommunication from interfering in the affairs of faenza bentivogli made a feeble attempt to mask his disobedience the troops with which he intended to assist his grandson were sent ostensibly to castel bolognese but with instructions to desert thence and make for faenza this they did and thus was astorre strengthened by a thousand men whilst the work of preparing his city for resistance went briskly forward  meanwhile ahead of cesare borgia swept vitellozzo vitelli with his horse into astorres dominions he descended upon the valley of the lamone and commenced hostilities by the capture and occupation of brisghella on november 7 the other lesser strongholds and townships offered no resistance to cesares arms indeed they were induced into ready rebellion against their lord by dionigio di naldothe sometime defender of imola who had now taken service with cesare  on november 10 cesare himself halted his host beneath the walls of faenza and called upon the town to surrender being denied he encamped his army for the siege he chose the eastern side of the town between the rivers lamone and marzano and that his artillery might have free play he caused several houses to be demolished  in faenza itself meanwhile the easy conquest of the valley had not produced a good effect moreover the defenders had cause to fear treachery within their gates for a paper had been picked up out of the moat containing an offer of terms of surrender it had been shot into the castle attached to an arbalest­bolt and was intended for the castellan castagnini this castagnini was arrested thrown into prison and his possessions confiscated whilst the council placed the citadel in the hands of four of its own members together with gianevangelista manfrediastorres halfbrother and a bastard of galeottos these set about defending it against cesare who had now opened fire the duke caused the guns to be trained upon a certain bastion through which he judged that a good assault might be delivered and an entrance gained night and day was the bombardment of that bastion kept up yet without producing visible effect until the morning of the 20th when suddenly one of its towers collapsed thunderously into the moat  instantly and without orders the soldiers all eager to be among the first to enter flung themselves forward in utter and fierce disorder to storm the breach cesare at breakfastas he himself wrote to the duke of urbinosprang up at the great noise and surmising what was taking place dashed out to restrain his men but the task was no easy one for gathering excitement and the frenzy of combat as they ran they had already gained the edge of the ditch and thither cesare was forced to follow them using voice and hands to beat back again  at last he succeeded in regaining control of them and in compelling them to make an orderly retreat and curb their impatience until the time for storming should have come which was not yet in the affair cesare had a narrow escape from a stoneshot fired from the castle whilst one of his officersonorio savelliwas killed by a cannonball from the dukes own guns whose men unaware of what was taking place were continuing the bombardment  hitherto the army had been forced to endure foul weatherrain fogs and wind but there was worse come snow began to fall on the morning of the 22nd it grew to a storm and the blizzard continued all that day which was a sunday all night and all the following day and lashed the men pitilessly and blindingly the army already reduced by shortness of victuals was now in a miserable plight in its unsheltered camp and the defenders of faenza as if realizing this made a sortie on the 23rd from which a fierce fight ensued with severe loss to both sides on the 25th the snow began again whereupon the hitherto unconquerable cesare defeated at last by the elements and seeing that his men could not possibly continue to endure the situation was compelled to strike camp on the 26th and go into winter quarters no doubt with immense chagrin at leaving so much work unaccomplished  so he converted the siege into a blockade closing all roads that lead to faenza with a view to shutting out supplies from the town and he distributed troops throughout the villages of the territory with orders constantly to harass the garrison and allow it no rest  he also sent an envoy with an offer of terms of surrender but the council rejected it with the proud answer that its members had agreed in general assembly to defend the dominions of manfredi to the death  thereupon cesare withdrew to forli with 150 lances and 2500 foot and here he affords a proof of his considerateness the town had already endured several occupations and the severities of being the seat of war during the siege of the citadel cesare was determined that it should feel the present occupation as little as possible so he issued an order to the inhabitants upon whom his soldiers were billeted to supply the men only with bed light and fire what more they required must be paid for and to avoid disputes as to prices of victuals and other necessaries he ordered the council to draw up a tariff and issued an edict forbidding his soldiers under pain of death from touching any property of the townsfolk lest they should doubt his earnestness he hanged two of his soldiers on december 7a piedmontese and a gasconand on the 13th a third all from the windows of his own palace and all with a label hanging from their feet proclaiming that they had been hanged for taking goods of others in spite of the ban of the lord duke etc  he remained in forli until the 23rd when he departed to cesena which was really his capital in roomagna and in the huge citadel of which there was ample accommodation for the troops that accompanied him in forli he left as his lieutenants the bishop of trani and don michele da corellathe michieli of capellos relation and the michelotto of so many borgia fables that this officer ruled the soldiers left with him in forli in accordance with the stern example set him by his master we know from the chronicles of bernardi  in cesena the duke occupied the splendid palace of malatesta novello which had been magnificently equipped for him and there on christmas eve he entertained the council of the town and other important citizens to a banquet worthy of the repuation for lavishness which he enjoyed he was very different in this from his father whose table habits were of the most sparingto which no doubt his holiness owed the wonderful almost youthful vigour which he still enjoyed in this his seventieth year it was notorious that ambassadors cared little for invitations to the popes table where the meal never consisted of more than one dish  on christmas day the duke attended mass at the church of san giovanni evangelista with great pomp arrayed in the ducal chlamys and followed by his gentlemen with these young patricians cesare made merry during the days that followed the time was spent in games and joustings in all of which the duke showed himself freely making display of his physical perfections fully aware no doubt of what a short cut these afforded him to the hearts of the people ever ready to worship physical beauty prowess and address  yet business was not altogether neglected for on january 4 he went to porto cesenatico and there published an edict against all who had practised with the fuorusciti from his states forbidding the offence under pain of death and forfeiture of possessions  he remained in winter quarters until the following april from which however it is not to be concluded that faenza was allowed to be at peace for that spell the orders which he had left behind him that the town was constantly to be harassed were by no means neglected on the night of january 21 by arrangement with some of the inhabitants of the beleaguered city the foot surrounding faenza attempted to surprise the garrison by a secret escalade they were however discovered betimes in the attempt and repulsed some who had the mischanceas it happenedto gain the battlements before the alarm was raised being taken and hanged the dukes troops however consoled themselves by capturing russi and solarolo the last two strongholds in the valley that had held for astorre  meanwhile cesare and his merry young patricians spent the time as agreeably as might be in cesena during that carnival the author of the diario cesenate is moved by the dukes pastimes to criticize him severely as indulging in amusements unbecoming the dignity of his station he is particularly shocked to know that the duke should have gone forth in disguise with a few companions to repair to carnival festivities in the surrounding villages and there to wrestle with the rustics it is not difficult to imagine the discomfiture suffered by many a village hercules at the hands of this lithe young man who could behead a bull at a single stroke of a spadoon and break a horseshoe in his fingers the diary in question you will have gathered is that of a pedant prim and easily scandalized so much being obvious it is noteworthy that cesares conduct should have afforded him no subject for graver strictures than these cesare being such a man as has been represented and the time being that of carnival when licence was allowed full play  the pope accounted that the check endured by cesare before faenza was due not so much to the foul weather by which his army had been beset as to the assistance which giovanni bentivogli had rendered his grandson astorre and bitter were the complaints of it which he addressed to the king of france alarmed by this and fearing that he might have compromised himself and jeopardized the french protection by his action in the matter bentivogli made haste to recall his troops and did in fact withdraw them from faenza early in december shortly after cesare had gone into winter quarters nevertheless the popes complaints continued alexander in his secret crafty heart no doubt rejoicing that bentivogli should have afforded him so sound a grievance as louis xii desired for several reasons to stand well with rome he sent an embassy to bentivogli to express his regret and censure of the latters intervention in the affairs of faenza he informed bentivogli that the pope was demanding the return of bologna to the states of the church and without expressing himself clearly as to his own view of the matter he advised bentivogli to refrain from alliances with the enemies of the holy see and to secure bologna to himself by some sound arrangement this showed bentivogli in what danger he stood and his uneasiness was increased by the arrival at modena of yves dallègre sent by the king of france with a condotta of 500 horse for purposes which were not avowed but which bentivogli sorely feared might prove to be hostile to himself  at the beginning of february cesare moved his quarters from cesena to imola and thence he sent his envoys to demand winter quarters for his troops in castel bolognese this flung bentivogli into positive terror as he interpreted the request as a threat of invasion castel bolognese was too valuable a stronghold to be so lightly placed in the dukes hands thence bentivogli might in case of need hold the duke in check the fortress commanding as it did the road from imola to faenza he had the good sense however to compromise the matter by returning cesare an offer of accommodation for his men with victuals artillery etc but without the concession of castel bolognese with this cesare was forced to be content there being no reasonable grounds upon which he could decline so generous an offer it was a cunning concession on bentivoglis part for without strengthening the dukes position it yet gave the latter what he ostensibly required and left no cause for grievance and no grounds upon which to molest bologna so much was this the case that on february 26 the pope wrote to bentivogli expressing his thanks at the assistance which he had thus given cesare in the faenza emprise  it was during this sojourn of cesares at imola that the abduction took place of dorotea caracciolo the young wife of gianbattista caracciolo a captain of foot in the venetian service the lady who was attached to the duchess of urbino had been residing at the latters court and in the previous december caracciolo had begged leave of the council of ten that he might himself go to urbino for the purpose of escorting her to venice the council however had replied that he should send for her and this the captain had done near cervia on the confines of the venetian territory towards evening of february 14 the ladys escort was set upon by ten well­armed men and rudely handled by them some being wounded and one at least killed whilst the lady and a woman who was with her were carried off  the podestá of cervia reported to the venetian senate that the abductors were spaniards of the army of the duke of valentinois and it was feared in veniceaccording to sanutothat the deed might be the work of cesare  the matter contained in that relation of capellos to the senate must by now have been widespread and of a man who could perpetrate the wickednesses therein divulged anything could be believed indeed it seems to have followed that where any act of wickedness was brought to light at once men looked to see if cesare might not be responsible nor looked close enough to make quite sure to no other cause can it be assigned that in the stir which the senate made the name of cesare was at once suggested as that of the abductor and this so broadly that letters poured in upon him on all sides begging him to right this cruel wrong so much do you see assumed upon no more evidence than was contained in that letter from the podestá of cervia which went no further than to say that the abductors were spaniards of the duke of valentinois army the envoy manenti was dispatched at once to cesare by the senate and he went persuaded it is clear that cesare borgia was the guilty person he enlisted the support of monsieur de trans the french ambassador then on his way to rome and that of yves dallègre and he took them with him to the duke at imola  there acting upon his strong suspicions manenti appears to have taken a high tone representing to the duke that he had done an unworthy thing and imploring him to restore the lady to her husband cesares patience under the insolent assumption in justification of which manenti had not a single grain of evidence to advance isguilty or innocenta rare instance of selfcontrol he condescended to take oath that he had not done this thing which they imputed to him he admitted that he had heard of the outrage and he expressed the belief that it was the work of one diego ramiresa captain of foot in his service this ramires he explained had been in the employ of the duke of urbino and in urbino had made the acquaintance and fallen enamoured of the lady and he added that the fellow had lately disappeared but that already he had set on foot a search for him and that once taken he would make an example of him  in conclusion he begged that the republic should not believe this thing against him assuring the envoy that he had not found the ladies of the romagna so difficult that he should be driven to employ such rude and violent measures  the french ambassador certainly appears to have attached implicit faith to cesares statement and he privately informed manenti that ramires was believed to be at medola and that the republic might rest assured that if he were taken exemplary justice would be done  all this you will find recorded in sanuto after that his diary entertains us with rumours which were reaching venice now that the deed was the dukes now that the lady was with ramires later the two rumours are consolidated into one in a report of the podestá of cervia to the effect that the lady is in the castle of forli with ramires and that he took her there by order of the duke the podestá says that a man whom he sent to gather news had this story from one benfaremo but he omits to say who and what is this benfaremo and what the source of his information  matters remaining thus and the affair appearing in danger of being forgotten caracciolo goes before the senate on march 16 and implores permission to deal with it himself this permission is denied him the doge conceiving that the matter will best be dealt with by the senate and caracciolo is ordered back to his post at gradisca thence he writes to the senate on march 30 that he is certain his wife is in the citadel of forli  after this sanuto does not mention the matter again until december of 1503nearly three years laterwhen we gather that under pressure of constant letters from the husband the venetian ambassador at the vatican makes so vigorous a stir that the lady is at last delivered up and goes for the time being into a convent but we are not told where or how she is found nor where the convent in which she seeks shelter that is sanutos first important omission  and now an odd light is thrown suddenly upon the whole affair and it begins to look as if the lady had been no unwilling victim of an abduction but rather a party to an elopement she displays a positive reluctance to return to her husband she is afraid to do soin fear for her very lifeand she implores the senate to obtain from caracciolo some security for her or else to grant her permission to withdraw permanently to a convent  the senate summons the husband and represents the case to him he assures the senate that he has forgiven his wife believing her to be innocent this however does not suffice to allay her uneasinessor her reluctancefor on january 4 1504 sanuto tells us that the senate has received a letter of thanks from her in which she relates her misfortunes and in which again she begs that her husband be compelled to pledge security to treat her well darli buona vita or else that she should be allowed to return to her mother of the nature of the misfortunes which he tells us she related in her letter sanuto says nothing that is his second important omission  the last mention of the subject in sanuto relates to her restoration to her husband he tells us that caracciolo received her with great joy but he is silent on the score of the ladys emotions on that occasion  there you have all that is known of dorotea caracciolos abduction which later writersincluding bembo in his historiaehave positively assigned to cesare borgia drawing upon their imagination to fill up the lacunae in the story so as to support their point of view  those lacunae however are invested with a certain eloquence which it is well not to disregard admitting that the construing of silence into evidence is a dangerous course all fraught with pitfalls yet it seems permissible to pose the following questions  if the revelation of the circumstances under which she was found the revelations contained in her letters to the senate and the revelations which one imagines must have followed her return to her husband confirm past rumours and convict cesare of the outrage how does it happen that sanutowho has never failed to record anything that could tell against cesareshould be silent on the matter and how does it happen that so many pens that busied themselves greedily with scandal that touched the borgias should be similarly silent is it unreasonable to infer that those revelations did not incriminate himthat they gave the lie to all the rumours that had been current if that is not the inference then what is  it is further noteworthy that on january 16after doroteas letter to the senate giving the details of her misfortunes which details sanuto has suppresseddiego ramires the real and known abductor is still the object of a hunt set afoot by some venetians would that be the case had her revelations shown ramires to be no more than the dukes instrument possibly but not probably in such a case he would not have been worth the trouble of pursuing  reasonably may it be objected how if cesare was not guilty does it happen that he did not carry out his threat of doing exemplary justice upon ramires when takensince ramires obviously lay in his power for years after the event the answer to that you will find in the ladys reluctance to return to caracciolo and the tale it tells it is not in the least illogical to assume that when cesare threatened that vengeance upon ramires for the outrage which it was alleged had been committed he fully intended to execute it but that upon taking ramires and upon discovering that here was no such outrage as had been represented but just the elopement of a couple of lovers he found there was nothing for him to avenge was it for cesare borgia to set up as a protector and avenger of cuckolds rather would it be in keeping with the feelings of his age and race to befriend the fugitive pair who had planted the antlers upon the brow of the venetian captain  lastly cesares attitude towards women may be worth considering that we may judge whether such an act as was imputed to him is consistent with it women play no part whatever in his history not once shall you find a womans influence swaying him not once shall you see him permitting dalliance to retard his advancement or jeopardize his chances with him as with egotists of his type governed by cold will and cold intellect the sentimental side of the relation of the sexes has no place with him one woman was as another woman as he craved women so he took women but with an almost contemptuous undiscrimination for all his needs concerning them the lupanaria sufficed  is this mere speculation think you is there no evidence to support it do you say consider pray in all its bearings the treatise on pudendagra dedicated to a man of cesare borgias rank by the physician torella written to meet his needs and see what inference you draw from that surely such an inference as will invest with the ring of truthexpressing as it does his intimate nature and confirming further what has here been saidthat answer of his to the venetian envoy that he had not found the ladies of romagna so difficult that he should be driven to such rude and violent measures     chapter viii astorre manfredi   on march 29 cesare borgia departed from cesenawhither meanwhile he had returnedto march upon faenza resume the attack and make an end of the citys stubborn resistance  during the past months however and notwithstanding the presence of the borgia troops in the territory the people of faenza had been able to increase their fortifications by the erection of outworks and a stout bastion in the neighbourhood of the osservanza hospital well beyond the walls this bastion claimed cesares first attention and it was carried by assault on april 12 thither he now fetched his guns mounted them and proceeded to a steady bombardment of the citadel but the resistance continued with unabated determinationa determination amounting to heroism considering the hopelessness of their case and the straits to which the faentini were reduced by now victuals and other necessaries of life had long since been running low still the men of faenza tightened their belts looked to their defences and flung defiance at the borgia the wealthier inhabitants distributed wine and flour at prices purely nominal and lent astorre money for the payment of his troops it is written that to the same end the very priests their patriotism surmounting their duty to the holy father in whose name this war was waged consented to the despoiling of the churches and the melting down of the sacred vessels  even the women of faenza bore their share of the burden of defence carrying to the ramparts the heavy stones that were to be hurled down upon the besiegers or actually donning casque and bodyarmour and doing sentry duty on the walls while the men rested  but the end was approaching on april 18 the borgia cannon opened at last a breach in the walls and cesare delivered a terrible assault upon the citadel the fight upon the smoking ruins was fierce and determined on both sides the dukes men pressing forward gallantly under showers of scalding pitch and a storm of boulders launched upon them by the defenders who used the very ruins of the wall for ammunition for four hours was that assault maintained nor did it cease until the deepening dusk compelled cesare to order the retreat since to continue in the failing light was but to sacrifice men to no purpose  cesares appreciation of the valour of the garrison ran high it inspired him with a respect which shows his dispassionate breadth of mind and he is reported to have declared that with an army of such men as those who held faenza against him he would have conquered all italy he did not attempt a second assault but confined himself during the three days that followed to continuing the bombardment  within faenza men were by now in desperate case weariness and hunger were so exhausting their endurance so sapping their high valour that nightly there were desertions to the dukes camp of men who could bear no more the fugitives from the town were well received all save onea man named grammante a dyer by tradewho in deserting to the duke came in to inform him that at a certain point of the citadel the defences were so weak that an assault delivered there could not fail to carry it  this man afforded cesare an opportunity of marking his contempt for traitors and his respect for the gallant defenders of faenza the duke hanged him for his pains under the very walls of the town he had betrayed  on the 21st the bombardment was kept up almost without interruption for eight hours and so shattered was the citadel by that pitiless cannonade that the end was in sight at last but the dukes satisfaction was tempered by his chagrin at the loss of achille tiberti one of the most valiant of his captains and one who had followed his fortunes from the first with conspicuous devotion he was killed by the bursting of a gun a great funeral at cesena bore witness to the extent to which cesare esteemed and honoured him  astorre now seeing the citadel in ruins and the possibility of further resistance utterly exhausted assembled the council of faenza to determine upon their course of action and as a result of their deliberations the young tyrant sent his ambassadors to the duke to propose terms of surrender it was a belated proposal for there was no longer on cesares part the necessity to make terms the citys defences were destroyed and to talk of surrender now was to talk of giving something that no longer existed yet cesare met the ambassadors in a spirit of splendid generosity  the terms proposed were that the people of faenza should have immunity for themselves and their property that astorre should have freedom to depart and to take with him his moveable possessions his immoveables remaining at the mercy of the pope by all the laws of war cesare was entitled to a heavy indemnity for the losses he had sustained through the resistance opposed to him considering those same laws and the application they were wont to receive in his day no one could have censured him had he rejected all terms and given the city over to pillage yet not only does he grant the terms submitted to him but in addition he actually lends an ear to the councils prayer that out of consideration for the great suffering of the city in the siege he should refrain from exacting any indemnity this was to be forbearing indeed but he was to carry his forbearance even further in answer to the councils expressed fears of further harm at the hands of his troopers once these should be in faenza he actually consented to effect no entrance into the town  we are not for a moment to consider cesare as actuated in all this by any lofty humanitarianism he was simply pursuing that wise policy of his in refraining from punishing conquered states which were to be subject henceforth to his rule and which therefore must be conciliated that they might be loyal to him but it is well that you should at least appreciate this policy and the fruit it bore when you read that cesare borgia was a bloodglutted monster of carnage who ravaged the romagna rending and devouring it like some beast of prey  on the 26th the council waited upon cesare at the hospital of the osservanzawhere he was lodgedto tender the oath of fealty that same evening astorre himself attended by a few of his gentlemen came to the duke  to this rather sickly and melancholy lad who had behind him a terrible family history of violence and to his bastard brother gianevangelista the duke accorded the most gracious welcome indeed so amiable did astorre find the duke that although the terms of surrender afforded him perfect liberty to go whither he listed he chose to accept the invitation cesare extended to him to remain in the dukes train  it is eminently probable however that the dukes object in keeping the young man about him was prompted by another phase of that policy of his which macchiavelli was later to formulate into rules of conduct expedient in a prince  in order to preserve a newly acquired state particular attention should be given to two points in the first place care should be taken entirely to extinguish the family of the ancient sovereign in the second laws should not be changed nor taxes increased  thus macchiavelli the second point is all that is excellent the first is all that is wisecold horrible and revolting though it be to our twentiethcentury notions  cesare borgia as a matter of fact hardly went so far as macchiavelli advises he practised discrimination he did not for instance seek the lives of pandolfaccio malatesta or of caterina sforzariario he saw no danger in their living no future trouble to apprehend from them the hatred borne them by their subjects was to cesare a sufficient guarantee that they would not be likely to attempt a return to their dominions and so he permitted them to keep their lives but to have allowed astorre manfredi or even his bastard brother to live would have been bad policy from the appallingly egotistical point of view which was cesaresa point of view remember which receives macchiavellis horribly intellectual utterly unsentimental revoltingly practical approval  soto anticipate a littlewe see cesare taking astorre and gianevangelista manfredi to rome when he returned thither in the following june a fortnight lateron june 26the formidable amazon of forli the countess sforzariario was liberated as we know from the castle of sant angelo and permitted to withdraw to florence but the gates of that grim fortress in opening to allow her to pass out opened also for the purpose of admitting astorre and gianevangelista upon whom they closed  all that is known positively of the fate of these unfortunate young men is that they never came forth again alive  the record in burchard june 9 1502 of astorres body having been found in the tiber with a stone round his neck suffers in probability from the addition that together with it were found the bodies of two young men with their arms tied a certain woman and many others  the dispatch of giustiniani to the effect that it is said that this night were thrown into tiber and drowned the two lords of faenza together with their seneschal was never followed up by any other dispatch confirming the rumour nor is it confirmed by any dispatch so far discovered from any other ambassador nor yet does the matter find place in the chronicles of faenza  but that is of secondary importance the ugliest feature of the case is not the actual assassination of the young men but the fact that cesare had pledged himself that astorre should go free and yet had kept him by himat first it would seem in his train and later as a prisoneruntil he put an end to his life it was an ugly unscrupulous deed but there is no need to exaggerate its heinousness as is constantly done upon no better authority than guicciardinis who wrote that the murder had been committed saziata prima la libidine di qualcuno  of all the unspeakable calumnies of which the borgias have been the subject none is more utterly wanton than this foul exhalation of guicciardinis lewd invention let the shame that must eternally attach to him for it brand also those subsequent writers who repeated and retailed that abominable and utterly unsupported accusation and more particularly those who have not hesitated to assume that guicciardinis qualcuno was an old man in his seventysecond yearpope alexander vi  others a little more merciful a little more careful of physical possibilities but no whit less salacious have taken it that cesare was intended by the florentine historian  but under one form or another the lie has spread as only such foulness can spread it has become woven into the warp of history it has grown to be one of those facts which are unquestioningly accepted but it stands upon no better foundation than the frequent repetition which a charge so monstrous could not escape its source is not a contemporary one it is first mentioned by guicciardini and there is no logical conclusion to be formed other than that guicciardini invented it another story which owes its existence mainly and its particulars almost entirely to guicciardinis libellous penthe story of the death of alexander vi which in its place shall be examinedprovoked the righteous anger of voltaire atheist and violent anticlerical though he was the storys obvious falseness so revolted him that he penned his formidable indictment in which he branded guicciardini as a liar who had deceived posterity that he might vent his hatred of the borgias better cause still was there in this matter of astorre manfredi for voltaires indignation as there is for the indignation of all conscientious seekers after truth     chapter ix castel bolognese and piombino   to return to the surrender of faenza on april 26 1501 we see cesare on the morrow of that event striking camp with such amazing suddenness that he does not even pause to provide for the government of the conquered tyranny but appoints a vicar four days later to attend to it  he makes his abrupt departure from faenza and is off like a whirlwind to sweep unexpectedly into the bolognese territory and by striking swiftly to terrify bentivogli into submission in the matter of castel bolognese  this fortress standing in the dukes dominions on the road between faenza and imola must be a menace to him whilst in the hands of a power that might become actively hostile  ahead of him cesare sent an envoy to bentivogli to demand its surrender  the alarmed lord of bologna having convened his council the reggimento replied that they must deliberate in the matter and two days later they dispatched their ambassador to lay before cesare the fruits of these deliberations they were to seek the duke at imola but they got no farther than castel s pietro which to their dismay they found already in the hands of vitellozzo vitellis menat­arms for what time bentivogli had been deliberating cesare borgia had been acting with that promptness which was one of his most salient characteristics and in addition to castel s pietro he had already captured casalfiuminense castel guelfo and medecina which were now invested by his troops  when the alarming news of this swift action reached bologna it caused bentivogli to bethink him at last of louis xiis advice that he should come to terms with cesare borgia and he realized that the time to do so could no longer be put off he made haste therefore to agree to the surrender of castel bolognese to the duke to concede him stipend for one hundred lances of three men each and to enter into an undertaking to lend him every assistance for one year against any power with which he might be at war the king of france excepted in return cesare was to relinquish the captured strongholds and undertake that the pope should confirm bentivogli in his ancient privileges on april 29 paolo orsini went as cesares plenipotentiary to bologna to sign this treaty  it was a crafty arrangement on bentivoglis part for over and above the pacification of cesare and the advantage of an alliance with him he gained as a result the alliance also of those famous condottieri vitelli and orsini both bitter enemies of florencethe latter intent upon the restoration of the medici the former impatient to avenge upon the signory the execution of his brother paolo as an instalment on account of that debt vitelli had already put to death pietro da marcianothe brother of count rinuccio da marcianowhen this gentleman fell into his hands at medicina  two days before the treaty was signed bentivogli had seized four members of the powerful house of marescotti this family was related to the exiled malvezzi who were in arms with cesare and bentivogli feared that communications might be passing between the two to his undoing on that suspicion he kept them prisoners for the present nor did be release them when the treaty was signed nor yet when amid public rejoicings expressing the relief of the bolognese it was published on may 2  hermes bentivogligiovannis youngest sonwas on guard at the palace with several other young bolognese patricians and he incited these to go with him to make an end of the traitors who had sought to destroy the peace by their alleged plottings with bentivoglis enemies in cesares camp he led his companions to the chamber where the marescotti were confined and there more or less in cold blood those four gentlemen were murdered for no better reasonostensiblythan because it was suspected they had been in communication with their relatives in the duke of valentinoiss army that was the way of the cinquecento which appears to have held few things of less account than human life  in passing it may be mentioned that guicciardini of course does his ludicrous best to make this murder appearat least indirectly since directly it would be impossiblethe work of cesare borgia  as for castel bolognese itself cesare borgia sent a thousand demolishers in the following july to raze it to the ground it is said to have been the most beautiful castle in the romagna but cesare had other qualities than beauty to consider in the matter of a stronghold its commanding position rendered it almost in the nature of a gateway controlling as we know the road from faenza to imola and its occupation by the bolognese or other enemies in time of disturbance might be of serious consequence to cesare therefore he ruthlessly ordered ramiro de lorqua to set about its demolition  the council of castel bolognese made great protest and implored ramiro to stay his hand until they should have communicated with the duke petitioning for the castles preservation but ramiroa hard stern man and cesares most active officer in the romagnatold them bluntly that to petition the duke in such a matter would be no better than a waste of time he was no more than right for cesare being resolved upon the expediency of the castles destruction would hardly be likely to listen to sentimental reasonings for its preservation confident of this ramiro without more ado set about the execution of the orders he had received he pulled down the walls and filled up the moat until nothing remained so much as to show the place where the fortress had stood  another fortress which shared the fate of castel bolognese was the castle of sant arcangelo and similarly would cesare have disposed of solarolo but that being of lesser importance and the inhabitants offering in their petition for its preservation to undertake themselves the payment of the castellan he allowed it to remain  scarcely was the treaty with bologna signed than cesare received letters from the pope recalling him to rome and recommending that he should not molest the florentines in his passagea recommendation which alexander deemed very necessary considering the disposition towards florence of vitelli and orsini he foresaw that they would employ arguments to induce valentinois into an enterprise of which all the cost would be his and all the possible profit their own  the duke would certainly have obeyed and avoided tuscany but thatprecisely as the shrewd pope had fearedvitelli and orsini implored him to march through florentine territory vitelli indeed flung himself on his knees before cesare in the vehemence of his supplications urging that his only motive was to effect the deliverance from his unjust imprisonment of cerbone who had been his executed brothers chancellor beyond that he swore he would make no demands upon florence that he would not attempt to mix himself in the affairs of the medici and that he would do no violence to town or country  thus implored cesare gave way probably he remembered the very circumstances under which vitelli had joined his banner and considered that he could not now oppose a request backed by a promise of so much moderation so on may 7 he sent his envoys to the signory to crave leave of passage for his troops through florentine territory  whilst still in the bolognese he was sought out by giuliano demedici who begged to be allowed to accompany him a request which cesare instantly refused as being contrary to that to which he had engaged himself and he caused giuliano to fall behind at lojano nor would he so much as receive in audience piero demedici who likewise sought to join him in siennese territory as soon as he perceived what was toward yet however much the duke protested that he had no intention to make any change in the state of florence there were few who believed him florence weary and sorely reduced by the long struggle of the pisan war was an easy prey conscious of this great was her anxiety and alarm at cesares request for passage the signory replied granting him the permission sought but imposing the condition that he should keep to the country refraining from entering any town nor bring with him into florentine territory vitelli orsini or any other enemy of the existing government it happened however that when the florentine ambassador reached him with this reply the duke was already over the frontier of tuscany with the excluded condottieri in his train  it was incumbent upon him as a consequence to vindicate this highhanded anticipation of the unqualified florentine permission which had not arrived so he declared that he had been offended last year by florence in the matter of forli and again this year in the matter of faenza both of which cities he charged the signory with having assisted to resist him and he announced that to justify his intentions so far as florence was concerned he would explain himself at barberino  there on may 12 he gave audience to the ambassador he declared to him that he desired a good understanding with florence and that she should offer no hindrance to the conquest of piombino upon which he was now bound adding that since he placed no trust in the present government which already had broken faith with him he would require some good security for the treaty to be made of reinstating the medici he said nothing but he demanded that some satisfaction be given vitelli and orsini and to quicken florence in coming to a decision he pushed forward with his army as far as forno dei campialmost under her very walls  the republic was thrown into consternation instantly she got together what forces she disposed of and proceeded to fling her artillery into the arno to the end that she should be constrained neither to refuse it to cesare upon his demand nor yet to deliver it  macchiavelli censures the signorys conduct of this affair as impolitic he contends that the duke being in great strength of arms and florence not armed at all and therefore in no case to hinder his passage it would have been wiser and the signory would better have saved its face and dignity had it accorded cesare the permission to pass which he demanded rather than have been subjected to behold him enforce that passage by weight of arms but all that now concerned the florentines was to be rid of an army whose presence in their territory was a constant menace and to gain that end they were ready to give any undertakings just as they were resolved to fulfil none  similarly it chanced that cesare was in no less a hurry to be gone for he had received another letter from the pope commanding his withdrawal and in addition he was being plagued by vitelli and orsinigrown restivewith entreaties for permission to go into either florence or pistoja where they did not lack for friends to resist them cesare had need of all the severity and resolution he could command and he even went so far as to back his refusal by a threat himself to take up arms against them if they insisted  on the 15th at last the treatywhich amounted to an offensive and defensive alliancewas signed by the terms of this florence undertook to give cesare a condotta of 300 lances for three years to be used in florentine service with a stipend of 36000 ducats yearly how much this really meant the duke was to discover two days later when he sent to ask the signory to lend him some cannon for the emprise against piombino and to pay him the first instalment of one quarter of the yearly stipend before he left florentine territory the signory replied that by the terms of the agreement there was no obligation for the immediate payment of the instalment whilst in the matter of the artillery they put him off from day to day until cesare understood that their only aim in signing the treaty had been the immediate one of being rid of his army  the risk florence incurred in so playing fastandloose with such a man particularly in a moment of such utter unfitness to resist him is notwithstanding the french protection enjoyed by the signory amazing in its reckless audacity it was fortunate for florence that the popes orders tied the dukes handsand it may be that of this the signory had knowledge and that it was upon such knowledge in conjunction with frances protection that it was presuming cesare took the matter in the spirit of an excellent loser  not a hint of his chagrin and resentment did he betray instead he set about furnishing his needs elsewhere sending vitelli to pisa with a request for artillery a request to which pisa very readily responded as much on vitellis account as on the dukes as for florence if cesare borgia could be terribly swift in punishing he could also be formidably slow if he could strike upon the instant where the opening for a blow appeared he could also wait for months until the opening should be found he waited now  it would be at about this time that young loenardo da vinci sought employment in cesare borgias service leonardo had been in milan until the summer of 1500 when he repaired to florence in quest of better fortune but finding little or no work to engage him there he took the chance of the duke of valentinoiss passage to offer his service to one whose liberal patronage of the arts was become proverbial cesare took him into his employ as engineer and architect leaving him in the romagna for the present leonardo may have superintended the repairs of the castle of forli whilst he certainly built the canal from cesena to the porto cesenatico before rejoining the duke in rome  on may 25 cesare moved by the way of the valley of cecina to try conclusions with giacomo dappiano tyrant of piombino who with some genoese and some florentine aid was disposed to offer resistance to the duke the first strategic movement in this affair must be the capture of the isle of elba whence aid might reach piombino on its promontory thrusting out into the sea for this purpose the pope sent from civita vecchia six galleys three brigantines and two galleons under the command of lodovico mosca captain of the papal navy whilst cesare was further reinforced by some vessels sent him from pisa together with eight pieces of cannon with these he made an easy capture of elba and pianosa that done he proceeded to lay siege to piombino which after making a gallant resistance enduring for two months was finally pressed to capitulate  long before that happened however cesare had taken his departure being awaited in rome he was unable to conduct the siege operations in person so he quitted piombino in june to join the french under daubigny bound at last upon the conquest of naples and claimingas their treaty with him providedcesares collaboration     chapter x the end of the house of aragon   cesare arrived in rome on june 13 there was none of the usual pomp on this occasion he made his entrance quietly attended only by a small body of menatarms and he was followed on the morrow by yves dallègre with the armyconsiderably reduced by the detachments which had been left to garrison the romagna and to lay siege to piombino  repairing to his quarters in the vatican the duke remained so close there for the few weeks that he abode in rome on this occasion1 that from now onward it became a matter of the utmost difficulty to obtain audience from him this may have been due to his habit of turning night into day and day into night whether at work or at play which in fact was the excuse offered by the pope to certain envoys sent to cesare from rimini who were left to cool their heels about the vatican antechambers for a fortnight without succeeding in obtaining an audience     1 mansit in palatio secrete says burchard   cesare borgia was now lord of imola forli rimini faenza and piombino warranting his assumption of the inclusive title of duke of romagna which he had taken immediately after the fall of faenza  as his state grew so naturally did the affairs of government and during those four weeks in rome business claimed his attention and an enormous amount of it was dispatched chiefly was he engaged upon the administration of the affairs of faenza which he had so hurriedly quitted in this his shrewd policy of generosity is again apparent as his representative and lieutenant he appointed a prominent citizen of faenza named pasi one of the very members of that council which had been engaged in defending the city and resisting cesare the duke gave it as his motive for the choice that the man was obviously worthy of trust in view of his fidelity to astorre  and there you have not only the shrewdness of the man who knows how to choose his servantswhich is one of the most important factors of successbut a breadth of mind very unusual indeed in the cinquecento  in addition to the immunity from indemnity provided for by the terms of the citys capitulation cesare actually went so far as to grant the peasantry of the valley 2000 ducats as compensation for damage done in the war further he supported the intercessions of the council to the pope for the erection of a new convent to replace the one that had been destroyed in the bombardment in giving his consent to thisin a brief dated july 12 1501the pope announces that he does so in response to the prayers of the council and of the duke  giovanni vera cesares erstwhile preceptorand still affectionately accorded this title by the dukewas now archbiship of salerno cardinal of santa balbina and papal legate in macerata and he was chosen by the pope to go to pesaro and fano for the purpose of receiving the oath of fealty with him cesare sent as his own personal representative his secretary agabito gherardi who had been in his employ in that capacity since the dukes journey into france and who was to follow his fortunes to the end  however the people of fano may have refrained from offering themselves to the dukes dominion when in the previous october he had afforded them by his presence the opportunity of doing so their conduct now hardly indicated that the earlier abstention had been born of reluctance or else their minds had undergone in the meanwhile a considerable change for when they received the brief appointing him their lord they celebrated the event by public rejoicings and illuminations whilst on july 21 the council representing the people in the presence of vera and gherardi took oath upon the gospels of allegiance to cesare and his descendants for ever  in the consistory of june 25 of that year the french and spanish ambassadors came formally to notify the holy father of the treaty of granada entered into in the previous november by louis xii of the one part and ferdinand and isabella of the other concerning the conquest and division of the kingdom of naples the rival claimants had come to a compromise by virtue of which they were to undertake together the conquest and thereafter share the spoilnaples and the abruzzi going to france and calabria and puglia to spain  alexander immediately published his bull declaring federigo of naples deposed for disobedience to the church and for having called the turk to his aid either of which charges it would have taxed alexanders ingenuityvast though it wasconvincingly to have established or being established to censure when all the facts were considered the charges were no better than pretexts for the spoliation of the unfortunate king who in the matter of his daughters alliance with cesare had conceived that he might flout the borgias with impunity  on june 28 daubigny left rome with the french troops accompanied by the bulk of the considerable army with which cesare supported his french ally besides 1000 foot raised by the pope and a condotta of 100 lances under morgante baglioni as the troops defiled before the castle of sant angelo they received the apostolic benediction from the pope who stood on the lower ramparts of the fortress  cesare himself cannot have followed to join the army until after july 10 for as late as that date there is an edict indited by him against all who should offer injury to his romagna officers at about the same time that he quitted rome to ride after the french gonsalo de cordoba landed a spanish army in calabria and the days of the aragon dominion in naples were numbered  king federigo prepared to face the foe whilst himself remaining in naples with prospero colonna he sent the bulk of his forces to capua under fabrizio colonna and count rinuccio marcianothe brother of that marciano whom vitelli had put to death in tuscany  ravaging the territory and forcing its strongholds as they came the allies were under the walls of capua within three weeks of setting out but on july 17 when within two miles of the town they were met by six hundred lances under colonna who attempted to dispute their passage it was cesare borgia himself who led the charge against them jean dautonin his chronicles of louis xiispeaks in warm terms of the dukes valour and of the manner in which by words and by example he encouraged his followers to charge the colonna forces with such good effect that they utterly routed the neapolitans and drove them headlong back to the shelter of capuas walls  the allies brought up their cannon and opened the bombardment this lasted incessantly from july 17which was a mondayuntil the following friday when two bastions were so shattered that the french were able to gain possession of them putting to the sword some two hundred neapolitan soldiers who had been left to defend those outworks thence admittance to the town itself was gained four days lateron the 25ththrough a breach according to some through the treacherous opening of a gate according to others through gate or breach the besiegers stormed to meet a fierce resistance and the most horrible carnage followed back and back they drove the defenders fighting their way through the streets and sparing none in the awful fury that beset them the defence was shattered resistance was at an end yet still the bloody work went on the combat had imperceptibly merged into a slaughter demoralized and panicstricken in the reaction from their late gallantry the soldiers of naples flung down their weapons and fled shrieking for quarter but none was given the invader butchered every human thing he came upon indiscriminant of age or sex and the blood of some four thousand victims flowed through the streets of capua like water after a thundershower that sack of capua is one of the most horrid pages in the horrid history of sacks you will find full details in dautons chronicle if you have a mind for such horrors there is a brief summary of the event in burchards diary under date of july 26 1501 which runs as follows  at about the fourth hour last night the pope had news of the capture of capua by the duke of valentinois the capture was due to the treason of one fabrizioa citizen of capuawho secretly introduced the besiegers and was the first to be killed by them after him the same fate was met by some three thousand foot and some two hundred horsesoldiers by citizens priests conventuals of both sexes even in the very churches and monasteries and all the women taken were given in prey to the greatest cruelty the total number of the slain is estimated at four thousand  dauton too bears witness to this wholesale violation of the women which he adds is the very worst of all wars excesses he informs us further that the footsoldiers of the duke of valentinois acquitted themselves so well in this that thirty of the most beautiful women went captive to rome a figure which is confirmed by burchard  what an opportunity was not this for guicciardini the footsoldiers of the duke of valentinois acquitted themselves so well in this that thirty of the most beautiful women went captive to rome  under his nimble malicious unscrupulous pen that statement is reedited until not thirty but forty is the number of the captured victims taken to rome and not valentinoiss foot but valentinois himself the ravisher of the entire forty but hear the elegant florentines own words  it was spread about divulgossi he writes that besides other wickednesses worthy of eternal infamy many women who had taken refuge in a tower and thus escaped the first fury of the assault were found by the duke of valentinois who with the title of kings lieutenant followed the army with no more people than his gentlemen and his guards1 he desired to see them all and after carefully examining them consideratele diligentemente he retained forty of the most beautiful     1  this incidentally is another misstatement  valentinois had with him besides the thousand foot levied by the pope and the hundred lances under morgante baglioni an army some thousands strong led for him by yves dallègre   guicciardinis aim is of course to shock you he considers it necessary to maintain in cesare the character of ravenous wolf which he had bestowed upon him the marvel is not that guicciardini should have penned that utterly ludicrous accusation but that more or less serious subsequent writersand writers of our own time eveninstead of being moved to contemptuous laughter at the wild foolishness of the story instead of seeking in the available records the germ of true fact from which it was sprung should sedulously and unblushingly have carried forward its dissemination  yriarte not only repeats the tale with all the sober calm of one utterly destitute of a sense of the ridiculous but he improves upon it by a delicious touch worthy of guicciardini himself when he assures us that cesare took these forty women for his harem  it is a nice instance of how borgia history has grown and is still growing  if verisimilitude itself does not repudiate guicciardinis story there are the capuan chronicles to do itparticularly that of pellegrini who witnessed the pillage in those chronicles from which guicciardini drew the matter for this portion of his history of italy you will seek in vain for any confirmation of that fiction with which the florentine historianhe who had a pen of gold for his friends and one of iron for his foesthought well to adorn his facts  if the grotesque in historybuilding is of interest to you you may turn the pages of the storia civile di capua by f granata published in 1752 this writer has carefully followed the capuan chroniclers in their relation of the siege but when it comes to these details of the forty ladies in the tower in which those chroniclers fail him he actually gives guicciardini as his authority setting a fashion which has not lacked for unconscious and no less egregious imitators  to return from the criticism of fiction to the consideration of fact fabrizio colonna and rinuccio da marciano were among the many captains of the neapolitan army that were taken prisoners rinuccio was the head of the florentine faction which had caused the execution of paolo vitelli and giovio has it that vitellozzo vitelli who had already taken an instalment of vengeance by putting pietro da marciano to death in tuscany caused rinuccios wounds to be poisoned so that he died two days later  the fall of capua was very shortly followed by that of gaeta and within a week by that of naples which was entered on august 3 by cesare borgia in command of the vanguard of the army he who had come as a cardinal to crown king federigo came now as a condottiero to depose him  federigo offered to surrender to the french all the fortresses that still held for him on condition that he should have safeconduct to ischia and liberty to remain there for six months this was agreed and federigo was further permitted to take with him his moveable possessions and his artillery which latter however he afterwards sold to the pope  thus the last member of the house of aragon to sit upon the throne of naples took his departure accompanied by the few faithful ones who loved him well enough to follow him into exile amongst these was that poet sanazzaro who to avenge the wrong suffered by the master whom he loved was to launch his terrible epigrams against alexander cesare and lucrezia and by means of those surviving verses enable the enemies of the house of borgia to vilify their memories through centuries to follow  federigos captains prospero and fabrizio colonna upon being ransomed took their swords to gonzalo de cordoba hoping for the day when they might avenge upon the borgia the ruin which even in this neapolitan conquest they attributed to the pope and his son  and here so far as naples is concerned closes the history of the house of aragon in italy it was extinct and it was to become so too in spain within the century     chapter xi the letter to silvio savelli   by september 15 cesare was back in rome the richer in renown in french favour and in a matter of 40000 ducats which is estimated as the total of the sums paid him by france and spain for the support which his condotta had afforded them  during his absence two important events had taken place the betrothal of his widowed sister lucrezia to alfonso deste son of duke ercole of ferrara and the publication of the bull of excommunication of august 20 against the savelli and colonna in consideration of all that they had wrought against the holy see from the pontificate of sixtus iv to the present time by virtue of that bull the pope ordered the confiscation of the possessions of the excommunicated families whilst the caetani suffered in like manner at the same time  these possessions were divided into two parts and by the bull of september 17 they were bestowed one upon lucrezias boy roderigo and with them the title of duke of sermoneta the other to a child giovanni borgia who is made something of a mystery with the title of duke of nepi and palestrina  the entire proceeding is undoubtedly open to grave censure since the distribution of the confiscated fiefs subjects to impeachment the purity of the motives that prompted this confiscation it was on the part of alexander a gross act of nepotism a gross abuse of his pontifical authority but there is at least this to be said that in perpetrating it he was doing no more than in his epoch it was customary for popes to do alexander it may be said again in this connection was part of a corrupt system not the corrupter of a pure one  touching the boy giovanni borgia the mystery attaching to him concerns his parentage and arises out of the singular circumstance that there are two papal bulls both dated september 1 1501 in each of which a different father is assigned to him the second appearing to supplement and correct the first  the first of these bulls addressed to dilecto filio nobili joanni de borgia infanti romano declares him to be a child of three years of age the illegitimate son of cesare borgia unmarried as cesare was at the time of the childs birth and of a woman unnamed as was usual in such cases also unmarried  the second declares him instead to be the son of alexander and runs since you bear this deficiency not from the said duke but from us and the said woman which we for good reasons did not desire to express in the preceding writing  that the second bull undoubtedly contains the truth of the matter is the only possible explanation of its existence and the good reasons that existed for the first one are no doubt as gregorovius says that officially and by canon law the pope was inhibited from recognizing children his other children be it remembered were recognized by him during his cardinalate and before his elevation to st peters throne hence the attempt by these bulls to circumvent the law to the end that the child should not suffer in the matter of his inheritance  burchard under date of november 3 of that year freely mentions this giovanni borgia as the son of the pope and a certain roman woman quadam romana  on the same date borne by those two bulls a third one was issued confirming the house of este perpetually in the dominion of ferrara and its other romagna possessions and reducing by onethird the tribute of 4000 ducats yearly imposed upon that family by sixtus iv and it was explicitly added that these concessions were made for lucrezia and her descendants  three days later a courier from duke ercole brought the news that the marriage contract had been signed in ferrara and it was in salvoes of artillery that day and illuminations after dark that the pope gave expression to the satisfaction afforded him by the prospect of his daughters entering one of the most ancient families and ascending one of the noblest thrones in italy  it would be idle to pretend that the marriage was other than one of convenience love between the contracting parties played no part in this transaction and ercole deste was urged to it under suasion of the king of france out of fear of the growing might of cesare and out of consideration for the splendid dowry which he demanded and in the matter of which he displayed a spirit which alexander contemptuously described as that of a tradesman nor would ercole send the escort to rome for the bride until he had in his hands the bull of investiture in the fiefs of cento and pieve which with 100000 ducats constituted lucrezias dowry altogether a most unromantic affair  the following letter from the ferrarese ambassador in rome dated september 23 is of interest in connection with this marriage   most illustrious prince and most noble lord  his holiness the pope taking into consideration such matters as might occasion displeasure not only to your excellency and to the most illustrious don alfonso but also to the duchess and even to himself has charged us to write to your excellency to urge you so to contrive that the lord giovanni of pesaro who as your excellency is aware is in mantua shall not be in ferrara at the time of the nuptials notwithstanding that his divorce from the said duchess is absolutely legitimate and accomplished in accordance with pure truth as is publicly known not only from the proceedings of the trial but also from the free confession of the said don giovanni it is possible that he may still be actuated by some lingering illwill wherefore should he find himself in any place where the said lady might be seen by him her excellency might in consequence be compelled to withdraw into privacy to be spared the memory of the past wherefore his holiness exhorts your excellency to provide with your habitual prudence against such a contingency   meanwhile the festivities wherewith her betrothal was celebrated went merrily amain and into the midst of them to bear his share came cesare crowned with fresh laurels gained in the neapolitan war no merrymakings ever held under the auspices of pope alexander vi at the vatican had escaped being the source of much scandalous rumour but none had been so scandalous and disgraceful as the stories put abroad on this occasion these found a fitting climax in that anonymous letter to silvio savelli published in germanywhich at the time be it borne in mind was extremely inimical to the pope viewing with jaundiced eyes his evergrowing power and stirred perhaps to this unspeakable burst of venomous fury by the noble este alliance so valuable to cesare in that it gave him a friend upon the frontier of his romagna possessions  the appalling publication which is given in full in burchard was fictitiously dated from gonzola de cordobas spanish camp at taranto on november 25 a copy of this anonymous pamphlet which is the most violent attack on the borgias ever penned perhaps the most terrible indictment against any family ever publisheda pamphlet which gregorovius does not hesitate to call an authentic document of the state of rome under the borgiasfell into the hands of the cardinal of modena who on the last day of the year carried it to the pope  before considering that letter it is well to turn to the entries in burchards diary under the dates of october 27 and november 11 of that same year you will find two statements which have no parallel in the rest of the entire diary few parallels in any sober narrative of facts the sane mind must recoil and close up before them so impossible does it seem to accept them  the first of these is the relation of the supper given by cesare in the vatican to fifty courtesansa relation which possibly suggested to the debauched regent dorléans his fêtes dadam a couple of centuries later  burchard tells us how for the amusement of cesare of the pope and of lucrezia these fifty courtesans were set to dance after supper with the servants and some others who were present dressed at first and afterwards not so he draws for us a picture of those fifty women on all fours in all their plastic nudity striving for the chestnuts flung to them in that chamber of the apostolic palace by christs vicaran old man of seventyby his son and his daughter nor is that all by any means there is much worse to followmatter which we dare not translate but must leave more or less discreetly veiled in the decadent latin of the caerimoniarius  tandem exposita dona ultima diploides de serico paria caligarum bireta ed alia pro illis qui pluries dictas meretrices carnaliter agnoscerent que fuerunt ibidem in aula publice carnaliter tractate arbitrio presentium dona distributa victoribus  such is the monstrous story  gregorovius in his defence of lucrezia borgia refuses to believe that she was present but he is reluctant to carry his incredulity any further  some orgy of that nature he writes or something similar may very well have taken place but who will believe that lucrezia already the legal wife of alfonso deste and on the eve of departure for ferrara can have been present as a smiling spectator  quite so gregorovius puts his finger at once upon one of the obvious weaknesses of the story but where there is one falsehood there are usually others and if we are not to believe that lucrezia was present why should we be asked to believe in the presence of the pope if burchard was mistaken in the one why might he not be mistaken in the other but the question is not really one of whom you will believe to have been present at that unspeakable performance but rather whether you can possibly bring yourself to believe that it ever took place as it is related in the diarium  gregorovius says you will observe some orgy of that nature or something similar may very well have taken place we could credit that cesare held some orgy of that nature he had apartments in the vatican and if it shock you to think that it pleased him with his gentlemen to make merry by feasting a parcel of roman harlots you areif you value justiceto be shocked at the times rather than the man the sense of humour of the cinquecento was primitive and in primitive humour prurience plays ever an important part as is discernible in the literature and comedies of that age if you would appreciate this to the full consider burchards details of the masks worn at carnival by some merrymakers venerunt ad plateam st petri larvatihabentes nasos lungos et grossos in forma priaporum and you must realize that in cesares conduct in this matter there would have been nothing so very abnormal considered from the point of view of the cinquecento even though it were to approach the details given by burchard  but even so you will hesitate before you accept the story of that saturnalia in its entirety and before you believe that an old man of seventy a priest and christs vicar was present with cesare and his friends burchard does not say that he himself was a witness of what he relates but the matter shall presently be further considered  meanwhile let us pass to the second of these entries in the diary and a not unimportant detail on the very next page of it under the date of november 11 in this it is related that certain peasants entered rome by the viridarian gate driving two mares laden with timber that in crossing the square of st peters some servants of the popes ran out and cut the cords so that the timber was loosened and the beasts relieved of their burden they were then led to a courtyard within the precincts of the palace where four stallions were loosed upon them ascenderunt equas et coierunt cum eis et eas graviter pistarunt et leserunt whilst the pope at a window above the doorway of the palace with madonna lucrezia witnessed with great laughter and delight the show which it is suggested was specially provided for their amusement  the improbabilities of the saturnalia of the fifty courtesans pale before the almost utter impossibility of this narrative to render it possible in the case of two chance animals as these must have been under the related circumstances a biological coincidence is demanded so utterly unlikely and incredible that we are at once moved to treat the story with scorn and reject it as a fiction yet not one of those many writers who have retailed that story from burchards diarium as a truth incontestable as the gospels has paused to consider thisso blinded are we when it is a case of accepting that which we desire to accept  the narrative too is oddlysuspiciouslycircumstantial even to the unimportant detail of the particular gate by which the peasants entered rome in a piece of fiction it is perfectly natural to fill in such minor details to the end that the picture shall be complete but they are rare in narratives of fact and one may be permitted to wonder how came the master of ceremonies at the vatican to know the precise gate by which those peasants came it is notas we have seenthe only occasion on which an excess of detail in the matter of a gate renders suspicious the accuracy of a story of burchards  both these affairs find a prominent place in the letter to silvio savelli indeed gregorovius cites the pamphlet as one of the authorities to support burchard and to show that what burchard wrote must have been true the other authority he cites is matarazzo disregarding not only the remarkable discrepancy between matarazzos relation and that of burchard but the circumstance that the matter of that pamphlet became current throughout italy and that it was thusand only thusthat matarazzo came to hear of the scandal1     1  the frequency with which the german historian cites matarazzo as an authority is oddly inconsistent considering that when he finds matarazzos story of the murder of the duke of gandia upsetting the theory which gregorovius himself prefers by fastening the guilt upon giovanni sforza he devotes some space to showingwith perfect justicethat matarazzo is no authority at all   the letter to silvio savelli opens by congratulating him upon his escape from the hands of the robbers who had stripped him of his possessions and upon his having found a refuge in germany at the emperors court it proceeds to marvel that thence he should have written letters to the pope begging for justice and reinstatement his wonder being at the credulity of savelli in supposing that the popebetrayer of the human race who has spent his life in betrayalswill ever do any just thing other than through fear or force rather does the writer suggest the adoption of other methods he urges savelli to make known to the emperor and all princes of the empire the atrocious crimes of that infamous wild beasts which have been perpetrated in contempt of god and religion he then proceeds to relate these crimes alexander cesare and lucrezia among others of the borgia family bear their share of the formidable accusations of the pope are related perfidies simonies and ravishments against lucrezia are urged the matter of her incest the supper of the fifty courtesans and the scene of the stallions against cesare there are the death of biselli the murder of pedro caldes the ruin of the romagna whence he has driven out the legitimate lords and the universal fear in which he is held  it is indeed a compendium of all the stories which from milan naples and venicethe three states where the borgias for obvious reasons are best hatedhave been disseminated by their enemies and a more violent work of rage and political malice was never uttered this malice becomes particularly evident in the indictment of cesare for the ruin of the romagna whatever cesare might have done he had not done thathis bitterest detractor could not without deliberately lying say that the romagna was other than benefiting under his sway that is not a matter of opinion not a matter of inference or deduction it is a matter of absolute fact and irrefutable knowledge  to return now to the two entries in burchards diarium when considered in conjunction with the letter to silvio savelli which burchard quotes in full it is remarkable that nowhere else in the discovered writings of absolute contemporaries is there the least mention of either of those scandalous stories the affair of the stallions for instance must have been of a fairly public character scandalmongering rome could not have resisted the dissemination of it yet apart from the savelli letter no single record of it has been discovered to confirm burchard  at this time moreover it is to be remembered lucrezias betrothal to alfonso deste was already accomplished preparations for her departure and wedding were going forward and the escort from ferrara was daily expected in rome if lucrezia had never been circumspect she must be circumspect now when the eyes of italy were upon her and there were not wanting those who would have been glad to have thwarted the marriagethe object no doubt of the pamphlet we are considering yet all that was written to ferrara was in praise of herin praise of her goodness and her modesty her prudence her devoutness and her discretion as presently we shall see  if from this we are to concludeas seems reasonablethat there was no gossip current in rome of the courtesans supper and the rest we may assume that there was no knowledge in rome of such matters for with knowledge silence would have been impossible so much being admitted it becomes a matter of determining whether the author of the letter to silvio savelli had access to the diary of burchard for his facts or whether burchard availed himself of the letter to silvio savelli to compile these particular entries the former alternative being out of the question there but remains the latterunless it is possible that the said entries have crept into the copies of the diarium and are not present in the original which is not available  this theory of interpolation tentatively put forward is justified to some extent at least by the following remarkable circumstances that two such entries havingas we have saidabsolutely no parallel in the whole of the diarium should follow almost immediately the one upon the other and that burchard should relate them coldly without reproof or comment of any kinda most unnatural reticence in a writer who loosed his indignation one eastertide to see lucrezia and her ladies occupying the choir of st peters where women never sat  the pope read the anonymous libel when it was submitted to him by the cardinal of modenaread it laughed it to scorn and treated it with the contempt which it deserved yet a contempt which considering its nature asks a certain greatness of mind  if the libel was true it is almost incredible that he should not have sought to avenge it for an ugly truth is notoriously hurtful and provocative of resentment far more so than is a lie cesare however was not of a temper quite as longsuffering as his father enough and more of libels and lampoons had he endured already early in december a masked mana neapolitan of the name of mancioniwho had been going through rome uttering infamies against him was seized and so dealt with that he should in future neither speak nor write anything in any mans defamation his tongue was cut out and his right hand chopped off and the hand with the tongue attached to its little finger was hung in sight of all and as a warning from a window of the church of holy cross  and towards the end of january whilst cesares fury at that pamphlet out of germany was still unappeased a venetian was seized in rome for having translated from greek into latin another libel against the pope and his son the venetian ambassador intervened to save the wretch but his intervention was vain the libeller was executed that same night  costabilithe ferrara ambassadorwho spoke to the pope on the matter of this execution reported that his holiness said that more than once had he told the duke that rome was a free city in which any one was at liberty to say or write what he pleased that of himself too much evil was being spoken but that he paid no heed to it  the duke proceeded alexander is goodnatured but he has not yet learnt to bear insult and he added that irritated cesare had protested that however much rome may be in the habit of speaking and writing for my own part i shall give these libellers a lesson in good manners  the lesson he intended was not one they should live to practise     chapter xii lucrezias third marriage   at about the same time that burchard was making in his diarium those entries which reflect so grossly upon the pope and lucrezia gianluca pozzi the ambassador of ferrara at the vatican was writing the following letter to his master duke ercole lucrezias fatherinlaw elect  this evening after supper i accompanied messer gerardo saraceni to visit the most illustrious madonna lucrezia in your excellencys name and that of the most illustrious don alfonso we entered into a long discussion touching various matters in truth she showed herself a prudent discreet and goodnatured lady1     1  see gregoroviuss lucrezia borgia   the handsome athletic cardinal ippolito deste with his brothers sigismondo and fernando had arrived in rome on december 23 with the imposing escort that was to accompany their brother alfonsos bride back to ferrara  cesare was prominent in the welcome given them never perhaps had he made greater display than on the occasion of his riding out to meet the ferrarese accompanied by no fewer than 4000 menatarms and mounted on a great warhorse whose trappings of cloth of gold and jewels were estimated at 10000 ducats  the days and nights that followed until lucrezias departure a fortnight later were days and nights of gaiety and merrymaking at the vatican in banquets dancing the performance of comedies masques etc was the time made to pass as agreeably as might be for the guests from ferrara and in all cesare was conspicuous either for the grace and zest with which he nightly danced or for the skill and daring which he displayed in the daily joustings and entertainments and more particularly in the bullfight that was included in them  lucrezia was splendidly endowed to the extent it was estimated of 300000 ducats made up by 100000 ducats in gold her jewels and equipage and the value of the castles of pieve and cento her departure from rome took place on january 6 and so she passes out of this chronicle which after all has been little concerned with her  of the honour done her everywhere on that journey to ferrara the details are given elsewhere particularly in the book devoted to her history and rehabilitation by herr gregorovius after all the real lucrezia borgia fills a comparatively small place in the actual history of her house it is in the fictions concerning her family that she is given such unenviable importance and presented as a maenad a poisoner and worse in reality she appears to us during her life in rome as a rather childish naïve and entirely passive figure important only in so far as she found employment at her fathers or brothers hands for the advancement of their high ambitions and unscrupulous aims  in the popular imagination she lives chiefly as a terrific poisoner an appalling artist in venenation it is remarkable that this should be the case for not even the scandal of her day so much as suggests that she was connecteddirectly or even indirectlywith a single case of poisoning no doubt that popular conception owes its being entirely to victor hugos drama  away from rome and settled in ferrara from the twentysecond year of her age to become anon its duchess her life is well known and admits of no argument the archives of the state she ruled show her devout godfearing and beloved in life and deeply mourned in death by a sorrowing husband and a sorrowing people not a breath of scandal touches her from the moment that she quits the scandalous environment of the papal court  cesare continued at the vatican after her departure his duchess was to have come to rome in that easter of 1502 and it had been disposed that the ladies and gentlemen who had gone as escort of honour with lucrezia should proceedafter leaving her in ferrarato lombardy to do the like office by charlotte dalbret and meeting her there accompany her to rome she was coming with her brother the cardinal amanieu dalbret and bringing with her cesares little daughter louise de valentinois now two years of age but the duchess fell ill at the last moment and was unable to undertake the journey of which cardinal dalbret brought word to rome where he arrived on february 7  ten days later cesare set out with his father for piombino for which purpose six galleons awaited them at civita vecchia under the command of lodovico mosca the captain of the pontifical navy on these the pope and his son embarked upon their visit to the scene of the latest addition to cesares evergrowing dominions  they landed at piombino on february 21 and made a solemn entrance into the town the pope carried in state in the sedia gestatoria under a canopy attended by six cardinals and six singers from the sixtine chapel whilst cesare was accompanied by a number of his gentlemen  they abode four days in piombino whence they crossed to elba for the purpose of disposing for the erection there of two fortressesa matter most probably entrusted to leonardo da vinci who continued in the ducal train as architect and engineer  on march 1 they took ship to return to rome but they were detained at sea for five days by a tempest which seems to have imperilled the vessels the pope was on board the captains galley with his cardinalsinwaiting and servants and when these were reduced by the storm and the imminent danger to a state of abject terror the popethis old man of seventyonesat calm and intrepid occasionally crossing himself and pronouncing the name of jesus and encouraging the very sailors by his example as much as by his words  in piombino cesare had left michele da corella as his governor this corella was a captain of foot a soldier of fortune who from the earliest days of cesares military career had followed the dukes fortunesthe very man who is alleged to have strangled alfonso of aragon by cesares orders he is generally assumed to have been a spaniard and is commonly designated as michelotto or don miguel but alvisi supposes him from his name of corella to have been a venetian and he tells us that by his fidelity to cesare and the implicit manner in which he executed his masters orders he earnedas is notoriousconsiderable hatred he has been spoken of indeed as the âme damnée of cesare borgia but that is a purely romantic touch akin to that which gave the same designation to richelieus father joseph  the romagna was at this time administered for cesare borgia by ramiro de lorqua who since the previous november had held the office of governor in addition to that of lieutenantgeneral in which he had been earlier invested his power in the romagna was now absolute all cesares other officers even the very treasurers being subject to him  he was a man of some fifty years of age violent and domineering feared by all and the dispenser of a harsh justice which had at least the merit of an impartiality that took no account of persons  bernardi gives us an instance of the mans stern uncompromising pitiless nature on january 29 1502 two malefactors were hanged in faenza the rope suspending one of them broke while the fellow was alive and the crowd into which he tumbled begged for mercy for him at first then swayed by pity the people resolved to save him in spite of the officers of justice who demanded his surrender preventing his recapture the mob bore him off to the church of the cerviti the lieutenant of faenza came to demand the person of the criminal but he was denied by the prior who claimed to extend him sanctuary  but the days of sanctuary were overpast and the laws of the time held that any church or consecrated place in which a criminal took refuge should ipso facto be deemed unconsecrated by his pursuers and further that any ecclesiastic sheltering such a fugitive did so under peril of excommunication from his bishop this law ramiro accounted it his duty to enforce when news was carried to him at imola of what had happened  he came at once to faenza and compelling the prior by actual force to yield up the man he sheltered he hanged the wretch for the second time from a window of the palace of the podestá at the same time he seized several who were alleged to have been ringleaders of the fellows rescue from the hands of the officers and made the citizens of faenza compromise for the lives of these by payment of a fine of 10000 ducats giving them a month in which to find the money  the faentini sent their envoys to ramiro to intercede with him but that harsh man refused so much as to grant them audiencewhich was well for them for as a consequence the council sent ambassadors to rome to submit the case to the popes holiness and to the duke of valentinois together with a petition that the fine should be remitteda petition that was readily granted  harsh as it was however ramiros rule was salutary its very harshness necessary in a province where lawlessness had become a habit through generations of misgovernment under cesares dominion the change already was remarkable during his two years of administrationto count from its commencementthe romagna was already converted from a seething hell of dissensions disorders and crimeschartered brigandage and murderinto a powerful state lawabiding and orderly where human life and personal possessions found zealous protection and where those who disturbed the peace met with a justice that was never tempered by mercy  a strong hand was wanted there and the duke supreme judge of the tools to do his work ruled the romagna and crushed its turbulence by means of the iron hand of ramiro de lorqua  it was also under the patronage of valentinois that the first printingpress of any consequence came to be established in italy this was set up at fano by girolamo sancino in 1501 and began the issue of worthy books one of the earliest works undertaken says alvisi was the printing of the statutes of fano for the first time in january of 1502 and it was approved by the council civil and ecclesiastical that sancino should undertake this printing of the statutes ad perpetuam memoriam illmi domini nostri ducis     chapter xiii urbino and camerino   it may well be that it was about this time that cesare his ambition spreadingas mens ambition will spread with being gratifiedwas considering the consolidation of central italy into a kingdom of which he would assume the crown  it was a scheme in the contemplation of which he was encouraged by vitellozzo vitelli who no doubt conceived that in its fulfilment the ruin of florence would be entailedwhich was all that vitelli cared about what to cesare would have been no more than the means would have been to vitelli a most satisfactory end  before however going so far there was still the work of subjugating the states of the church to be completed as this could not be so considered until urbino camerino and sinigaglia should be under the borgia dominion  for this no doubt cesare was disposing during that easter of 1502 which he spent in rome and during which there were heard from the south the first rumblings of the storm of war whereof illstarred naples was once morefor the third time within ten yearsto be the scene the allies of yesterday were become the antagonists of today and france and spain were ready to fly at each others throats over the division of the spoil as a consequence of certain illdefinitions of the matter in the treaty of granada the french viceroy louis darmagnac and the great spanish captain gonzalo de cordoba were on the point of coming to blows  nor was the menace of disturbance confined to naples in florence too the torch of war was alight and ifas he afterwards sworecesare borgia had no hand in kindling it it is at least undeniable that he complacently watched the conflagration conscious that it would make for the fulfilment of his own ends besides there was still that little matter of the treaty of forno dei campi between cesare and florence a treaty which the signory had never fulfilled and never intended to fulfil and cesare was not the man to forget how he had been fooled  but for the protection of france which she enjoyed florence must long ere this have been called to account by him and crushed out of all shape under the weight of his mailed hand as it was she was to experience the hurt of his passive resentment and find this rather more than she could bear  vitellozzo vitelli that vindictive firebrand whose original motive in allying himself with cesare had been the hope that the duke might help him to make florence expiate his brothers blood finding that cesare withheld the expected help was bent at last upon dealing himself with florence he entered into plots with the exiled piero demedici to restore the latter to his dominion he set intrigues afoot in pisa where his influence was vast and in siena whose tyrant pandolfo petrucci was ready and willing to forward his designs and generally made so disturbing a stir in tuscany that the signory became gravely alarmed  cesare certainly took no apparent active part in the affair he lent vitelli no aid but neither did he attempt to restrain him or any other of the borgia condottieri who were allied with him  the unrest spreading and growing sullenly a while burst suddenly forth in arezzo on june 4 when the cries of medici and marzocco rang in its streets to announce that the city was in arms against the government of florence arezzo followed this up by summoning vitelli and the waiting watchful condottiero was quick to answer the desired call he entered the town three days later at the head of a small body of foot and was very shortly afterwards followed by his brother giulio vitelli bishop of città di castello with the artillery and presently by gianpaolo baglioni with a condotta of horse  a few days later vitelli was in possession of all the strongholds of the val di chiana and panicstricken florence was speeding ambassadors hotfoot to rome to lay her complaints of these matters before the pope  alexander was able to reply that far from supporting the belligerents he had launched a bull against them provoked by the poisoning of the bishop depazzi  cesare looked on with the inscrutable calm for which macchiavelli was presently to find him so remarkable aware as he was of the french protection which florence enjoyed and could invoke he perceived how vain must ultimately prove vitellis efforts saw perhaps in all this the grave danger of ultimate ruin which vitelli was incurring yet vitellis action served cesares own purposes and so that his purposes were served there were no other considerations likely to weigh with that cold egotist let vitelli be caught in the toils he was spinning and be choked in them meanwhile florence was being harrowed and that was all to cesares satisfaction and advantage when sufficiently humbled it might well befall that the republic should come on her knees to implore his intervention and his pardon for having flouted him  while matters stood so in arezzo pisa declared spontaneously for cesare and sent on june 10 to offer herself to his dominion and to announce to him that his banner was already flying from her turretsand the growth of florences alarm at this is readily conceived  to cesare it must have been a sore temptation to accept such a piedàterre in tuscany as was now offered him would have been the first great step towards founding that kingdom of his dreams an impulsive man had surely gulped the bait but cesare boundless in audacity most swift to determine and to act was not impulsive cold reason foresight and calculation were the ministers of his indomitable will he looked ahead and beyond in the matter of pisas offer and he perceived the danger that might await him in the acceptance the time for that was not yet to take what pisa offered might entail offending france and although cesare was now in case to dispense with french support he was in no case to resist her opposition  and so the matter being considered and determined cesare quitted rome on the 12th and left it for the pope to give answer to the pisan envoys in the consistory of june 14that neither his holiness nor the duke of valentinois could assent to the proposals which pisa made  from rome cesare travelled swiftly to spoleto where his army some ten thousand strong was encamped he was bent at last upon the conquest of camerino and ever an opportunist he had seized the moment when florence which might have been disposed to befriend varano tyrant of camerino was overbusy with her own affairs  in addition to the powerful army awaiting him at spoleto the duke had a further 2000 men in the romagna another 1000 men held themselves at his orders between sinigaglia and urbino and dionigio di naldo was arming yet another 1000 men at verucchio for his service yet further to increase this force cesare issued an edict during his brief sojourn at spoleto ordering every house in the romagna to supply him with one manatarms  it was whilst hereas he afterwards wrote to the popethat news reached him that guidobaldo da montefeltre duke of urbino was arming men and raising funds for the assistance of camerino he wrote that he could not at first believe it but that shortly afterwardsat folignihe took a chancellor of camerino who admitted that the hopes of this state were all founded upon urbinos assistance and later a messenger from urbino falling into his hands he discovered that there was a plot afoot to seize the borgia artillery as it passed through ugubio it being known that as cesare had no suspicions the guns would be guarded only by a small force of this treachery the duke strongly expressed his indignation in his letter to the pope  whether the matter was trueor whether cesare believed it to be trueit is impossible to ascertain with absolute conviction but it is in the highest degree unlikely that cesare would have written such a letter to his father solely by way of setting up a pretext had that been his only aim letters expressing his simulated indignation would have been in better case to serve his ends had they been addressed to others  if guidobaldo did engage in such an act amounting to a betrayal he was certainly paid by cesare in kind and with interest if the duke had been short of a pretext for carrying a drawn sword into the dominions of guidobaldo he had that pretext now in this act of enmity against himself and the holy see  first however he disposed for the attack upon camerino this state lying on the eastern spurs of the apennines midway between spoleto and urbino was ruled by giulio cesare varano an old wardog of seventy years of age ruthless and bloodthirsty who owed his throne to his murder of his own brother  he was aided in the government of his tyranny by his four sons venanzio annibale pietro and gianmaria  several times already had he been menaced by cesare borgia for he was one of the vicars proscribed for the nonpayment of tribute due to the holy see and at last his hour was come against him cesare now dispatched an army under the command of francesco orsini duke of gravina and oliverotto eufreducci another murderous bloody gentleman who had hitherto served the duke in vitellis condotta and who by an atrocious act of infamy and brigandage had made himself lord of fermo which he pretendedbeing as sly as he was bloodyto hold as vicar for the holy see  this oliverotto eufreduccihereafter known as oliverotto da fermowas a nephew of giovanni fogliano lord of fermo he had returned home to his uncles court in the early part of that year and was there received with great honour and affection by fogliano and his other relatives to celebrate his homecoming oliverotto invited his uncle and the principal citizens of fermo to a banquet and at table contrived to turn the conversation upon the pope and the duke of valentinois whereupon saying that these were matters to be discussed more in private he rose from table and begged them to withdraw with him into another room  all unsuspectingwhat should old fogliano suspect from one so loved and so deeply in his debtthey followed him to the chamber where he had secretly posted a body of his menatarms there no sooner had the door closed upon this uncle and those others who had shown him so much affection than he gave the signal for the slaughter that had been concerted his soldiers fell upon those poor surprised victims of his greed and made a speedy and bloody end of all  that first and chief step being taken oliverotto flung himself on his horse and gathering his menatarms about him rode through fermo on the business of butchering what other relatives and friends of fogliano might remain among these were raffaele della rovere and two of his children one of whom was inhumanly slaughtered in its mothers lap  thereafter he confiscated to his own uses the property of those whom he had murdered and of those who more fortunate had fled his butchers hands he dismissed the existing council and replaced it by a government of his own which doneto shelter himself from the consequenceshe sent word to the pope that he held fermo as vicar of the church  whilst a portion of his army marched on camerino cesare armed with his pretext for the overthrow of guidobaldo set himself deliberately and by an elaborate stratagem to the capture of urbino of this there can be little doubt the cunning of the scheme is of an unsavoury sort when considered by the notions that obtain today for the stratagem was no better than an act of base treachery yet lest even in this you should be in danger of judging cesare borgia by standards which cannot apply to his age you will do well to consider that there is no lack of evidence that the fifteenth century applauded the business as a clever coup  guidobaldo da montefeltre was a good prince none in all italy was more beloved by his people towards whom he bore himself with a kindly paternal bonhomie he was a cultured scholarly man a patron of the arts happiest in the splendid library of the palace of urbino it happened unfortunately that he had no heir which laid his dominions open to the danger of division amongst the neighbouring greedy tyrants after his death to avoid this he had adopted francesco maria della rovere hereditary prefect of sinigaglia his sisters child and a nephew of cardinal giuliano della roveres there was wisdom and foresight in the adoption considering the favour enjoyed in rome and in france by the powerful cardinal  from nocera cesare sent guidobaldo a message calculated to allay whatever uneasiness he may have been feeling and to throw him completely off his guard the duke notified him that he was marching upon camerinowhich was at once true and untrueand begged guidobaldo to assist him in this enterprise by sending him provisions to gubbio which he should reach on the morrowsince he was marching by way of cagli and sassoferrato furtherand obviously with intent that the duke of urbino should reduce the forces at his disposalhe desired guidobaldo to send vitelli the support of a thousand men which the latter had earlier solicited but which guidobaldo had refused to supply without orders from the pope cesare concluded his letter with protestations of brotherly lovethe judas kiss which makes him hateful to us in this affair  it all proved very reassuring to guidobaldo who set his mind at ease and never bethought him of looking to his defences when from nocera cesare made one of those sudden movements terrible in their swiftness as the spring of a tigerenabling him to drive home his claws where least expected leaving all baggage behind him and with provisions for only three days he brought his troops by forced marches to cagli within the urbino state and possessed himself of it almost before the town had come to realize his presence  not until the citadel taken entirely by surprise was in cesares hands did a messenger speed to guidobaldo with the unwelcome tidings that the duke of valentinois was in arms as an enemy within the territory together with that message came others into the garden of the zoccolanti monasterythat favourite resort of guidobaldoswhere he was indulging his not unusual custom of supping in the cool of that summer evening they brought him word that while valentinois was advancing upon him from the south a force of 1000 men were marching upon urbino from isola di fano in the east and twice that number through the passes of sant angelo and verucchio in the northall converging upon his capital  the attack had been shrewdly planned and timed and if anything can condone the treachery by which guidobaldo was lulled into his false security it is the circumstance that this conduct of the matter avoided bloodsheda circumstance not wholly negligible and one that was ever a part of cesare borgias policy save where punishment had to be inflicted or reprisals taken  guidobaldo seeing himself thus beset upon all sides at once and being all unprepared for resistance perceived that nothing but flight remained him and that very night he left urbino hurriedly taking with him the boy francesco maria and intending at first to seek shelter in his castle of s leoa fortress that was practically impregnable but already it was too late the passes leading thither were by now in the hands of the enemy as guidobaldo discovered at dawn thereupon changing his plans he sent the boy and his few attendants to bagno and himself disguised as a peasant took to the hills despite the gout by which he was tormented thus he won to ravenna which was fast becoming a home for dethroned princes  urbino meanwhile in no case to resist sent its castellan to meet cesare and to make surrender to himwhereof cesare in the letter already mentioned gives news to the pope excusing himself for having undertaken this thing without the popes knowledge but that the treachery employed against me by guidobaldo was so enormous that i could not suffer it  within a few hours of poor guidobaldos flight cesare was housed in urbinos splendid palace whose stupendous library was the marvel of all scholars of that day much of this together with many of the arttreasures collected by the montefeltri cesare began shortly afterwards to transfer to cesena  in addition to publishing an edict against pillage and violence in the city of urbino cesare made doubly sure that none should take place by sending his soldiers to encamp at fermignano retaining near him in urbino no more than his gentlemenatarms the capital being taken the remainder of the duchy made ready surrender all the strongholds announcing their submission to cesare with the exception of that almost inaccessible castle of s leo which capitulated only after a considerable resistance  from urbino cesare now entered into communication with the florentines and asked that a representative should be sent to come to an agreement with him in response to this request the republic sent him bishop soderini as her ambassador the latter arrived in urbino on june 25 and was immediately and very cordially received by the duke with him in the subordinate capacity of secretary came a lean smallheaded tightlipped man with wideset intelligent eyes and prominent cheekbonesone niccolò macchiavelli who in needy circumstances at present and comparatively obscure was destined to immortal fame thus did macchiavelli meet cesare borgia for the first time and for all that we have no records of it it is not to be doubted that his study of that remarkable man began then in urbino to be continued presently as we shall see when macchiavelli returns to him in the quality of an ambassador himself  to soderini the duke expounded his just grievance founded upon the florentines unobservance of the treaty of forno dei campi he demanded that a fresh treaty should be drawn up to replace the broken one and that for the purpose florence should change her government as in the ruling one after what had passed he could repose no faith he disclaimed all associations with the affair of vitelli but frankly declared himself glad of it as it had no doubt led florence to perceive what came of not keeping faith with him he concluded by assuring soderini that with himself for their friend the florentines need fear no molestation from any one but he begged that the republic should declare herself in the matter since if she did not care to have him for her friend she was of course at liberty to make of him her enemy  so impressed was soderini by cesare borgia that on that same night he wrote to the signory  this lord is very magnificent and splendid and so spirited in feats of arms that there is nothing so great but that it must seem small to him in the pursuit of glory and in the acquisition of dominions he never rests and he knows neither danger nor fatigue he moves so swiftly that he arrives at a place before it is known that he has set out for it he knows how to make himself beloved of his soldiers and he has in his service the best men of italy these things render him victorious and formidable and to these is yet to be added his perpetual good fortune he argues the florentine envoy proceeds with such sound reason that to dispute with him would be a long affair for his wit and eloquence never fail him dello ingegno e della lingua si vale quanto vuole  you are to remember that this homage is one of the few surviving impressions of one who came into personal contact with cesare and of one moreover representing a government more or less inimical to him who would therefore have no reason to draw a favourable portrait of him for that governments benefit one single page of such testimony is worth a dozen volumes of speculation and inference drawn afterwards by men who never knew himin many cases by men who never began to know his epoch  the envoy concludes by informing the signory that he has the dukes assurances that the latter has no thought of attempting to deprive florence of any of her possessions as the object of his campaign has not been to tyrannize but to extirpate tyrants  whilst cesare awaited the florentines reply to their ambassadors communication he withdrew to the camp at fermignano where he was sought on july 6 by a herald from louis xii this messenger came to exhort cesare to embark upon no enterprise against the florentine republic because to offend florence would be to offend the majesty of france simultaneously however florence received messages from the cardinal damboise suggesting that they should come to terms with valentinois by conceding him at least a part of what had been agreed in the treaty of forno dei campi  as a consequence soderini was able to inform cesare that the republic was ready to treat with him but that first he must withdraw vitelli from arezzo and compel him to yield up the captured fortresses the duke not trustingas he had frankly avoweda government which once already had broken faith with him and perceiving that if he whistled his wardogs to heel as requested he would have lost the advantages of his position refused to take any such steps until the treaty should be concluded he consented however to enforce meanwhile an armistice  but now it happened that news reached florence of the advance of louis xii with an army of 20000 men bound for naples to settle the dispute with spain so the republicsly and treacherous as any other italian government of the cinquecentoinstructed soderini to temporize with the duke to spend the days in amiable inconclusive interviews and discussions of terms which the signory did not mean to make thus they counted upon gaining time until the arrival of the french should put an end to the trouble caused by vitelli and to the need for any compromise  but cesare though forced to submit was not fooled by soderinis smooth evasive methods he toohaving private sources of information in francewas advised of the french advance and of the imminence of danger to himself in consequence of the affairs of florence and it occasioned him no surprise to see soderini come on july 19 to take his leave of him advised by the signory that the french vanguard was at hand and that consequently the negotiations might now with safety be abandoned  to console him he had news on the morrow of the conquest of camerino  the septuagenarian giulio cesare varano had opposed to the borgia forces a stout resistance what time he sent his two sons pietro and gianmaria to venice for help it was in the hope of this solicited assistance that he determined to defend his tyranny and the war opened by a cavalry skirmish in which venanzio varano routed the borgia horse under the command of the duke of gravina thereafter however the varani had to endure a siege and the old story of the romagna sieges was repeated varano had given his subjects too much offence in the past and it was for his subjects now to call the reckoning  a strong faction led by a patrician youth of camerino demanded the surrender of the state and upon being resisted took arms and opened the gates to the troops of valentinois the three varani were taken prisoners old giulio cesare was shut up in the castle of pergola where he shortly afterwards diedwhich was not wonderful or unnatural at his time of life and does not warrant guicciardini for stating without authority that he was strangled venanzio and annibale were imprisoned in the fortress of cattolica  in connection with this surrender of camerino cesare wrote the following affectionate letter to his sister lucreziawho was dangerously ill at ferrara in consequence of her delivery of a stillborn child  most illustrious and most excellent lady our very dear sisterconfident of the circumstance that there can be no more efficacious and salutary medicine for the indisposition from which you are at present suffering than the announcement of good and happy news we advise you that at this very moment we have received sure tidings of the capture of camerino we beg that you will do honour to this message by an immediate improvement and inform us of it because tormented as we are to know you so ill nothing not even this felicitous event can suffice to afford us pleasure we beg you also kindly to convey the present to the illustrious lord don alfonso your husband and our beloved brotherinlaw to whom we are not writing today     chapter xiv the revolt of the condottieri   the coincidence of the arrival of the french army with the conquest of urbino and camerino and the tuscan troubles caused one more to be added to that ceaseless stream of rumours that flowed through italy concerning the borgias this time the envy and malice that are ever provoked by success and power gave voice in that rumour to the thing it hoped and there ensued as pretty a comedy as you shall find in the pages of history  the rumour had it that louis xii resentful and mistrustful of the growth of cesares might which tended to weaken france in italy and became a menace to the french dominions was come to make an end of him instantly louiss court in milan was thronged by all whom cesare had offendedand they made up by now a goodly crowd for a man may not rise so swiftly to such eminence without raising a rich crop of enemies  meanwhile however valentinois in the montefeltre palace at urbino remained extremely at ease he was not the man to be without intelligences in the train of louis was francesco troche the popes confidential chamberlain and cesares devoted servant who possessed of information was able to advise valentinois precisely what were the intentions of the king of france gathering from these advices that it was louiss wish that the florentines should not be molested further and naturally anxious not to run counter to the kings intentions cesare perceived that the time to take action had arrived the time for passivity in the affairs of florence was at an end  so he dispatched an envoy to vitelli ordering his instant evacuation of arezzo and his withdrawal with his troops from tuscany and he backed the command by a threat to compel vitelli by force of arms and to punish disobedience by depriving him of his state of città di castelloa matter cesare informed him which would be easily accomplished as the best men of that state have already offered themselves to me  it was a command which vitelli had no choice but to obey not being in sufficient force to oppose the duke so on july 29 with gianpaolo baglioni he relinquished the possession of arezzo and departed out of tuscany as he had been bidden but so incensed was he against the duke for this intervention between himself and his revenge and so freely did he express himself in the matter that it was put about at once that he intended to go against cesare  and that is the first hint of the revolt of the condottieri  having launched that interdict of his cesare on july 25 in the garb of a knight of st john of jerusalem and with only four attendants departed secretly from urbino to repair to milan and king louis he paused for fresh horses at forli on the morrow and on the 28th reached ferrara where he remained for a couple of hours to visit lucrezia who was now in convalescence ahead of him he dispatched thence a courier to milan to announce his coming and accompanied by alfonso deste resumed his journey  meanwhile the assembly of cesares enemies had been increasing daily in milan whither they repaired to support louis and to vent their hatred of cesare and their grievances against him there amongst others might be seen the duke of urbino pietro varano one of the sons of the deposed lord of camerino giovanni sforza of pesaro and francesco gonzaga of mantuawhich latter was ever ready to turn whichever way the wind was blowing and was now loudest in his denunciations of cesare and eagerly advocating the formation of a league against him  louis received the news of cesares coming andendowed it is clear with a nice sense of humour­kept the matter secret until within a few hours of the dukes actual arrival on the morning of august 5 according to bernardi1 he whispered the information in trivulzios ear­and whispered it loudly enough to be overheard by those courtiers who stood nearest     1 cronache forlivesi   whatever check their satisfaction at the supposed state of things may have received then was as nothing to their feelings a few hours later when they witnessed the greeting that passed between king and duke under their uneasy eyes louis rode forth to meet his visitor and gave him a glad and friendly welcome addressing him as cousin and dear relative and so no doubt striking dismay into the hearts of those courtiers who may well have deemed that perhaps they had expressed themselves too freely  louis in person accompanied valentinois to the apartments prepared for him in the castle of milan and on the morrow gave a banquet and commanded merrymakings in his visitors honour  conceive the feelings of those deposed tyrants and their friends and the sudden collapse of the hopes which they had imagined the king to be encouraging they did of course the only thing there was to do they took their leave precipitately and went their waysall save gonzaga whom the king retained that he might make his peace with cesare and engage in friendship with him a friendship consolidated there and then by the betrothal of their infant children little francesco gonzaga and louise de valentinois aged two the daughter whom cesare had never beheld and was never to behold  two factors were at work in the interests of valentinoisthe coming war in naples with the spaniard which caused louis to desire to stand well with the pope and the ambition of louiss friend and counsellor the cardinal damboise to wear the tiara which caused this prelate to desire to stand well with cesare himself since the latters will in the matter of a pope to succeed his father should be omnipotent with the sacred college  therefore that they might serve their interests in the end both king and cardinal served cesares in the meantime  the duke of valentinoiss visit to milan had served to increase the choler of vitelli who accounted that by this action cesare had put him in disgrace with the king of france and vitelli cried out that thus was he repaid for having sought to make cesare king of tuscany in such high dudgeon was the fierce tyrant of città di castello that he would not go to pay his court to louis and was still the more angry to hear of the warm welcome accorded in milan to the cardinal orsini in this he read approval of the orsini for having stood neutral in the florentine business and by inference from that disapproval of himself  before accusing valentinois of treachery to his condottieri before saying that he shifted the blame of the tuscan affair on to the shoulders of his captains it would be well to ascertain that there was any blame to shiftthat is to say any blame that must originally have fallen upon cesare certainly he made no effort to restrain vitelli until the king of france had arrived and he had secret information which caused him to deem it politic to intervene but of what avail until that moment would any but an armed intervention have been with so vindictive and oneidead a man and what manner of fool would not cesare have been to have spent his strength in battle with his condottieri for the purpose of befriending a people who had never shown themselves other than his own enemies  like the perfect egotist he was he sat on the fence and took pleasure in the spectacle of the harassing of his enemies by his friends prepared to reap any advantages there might be but equally prepared to avoid any disadvantages  it was not heroic it was not noble but it was extremely human  cesare was with the king of france in genoa at the end of august and remained in his train until september 2 when finally he took his leave of him when they heard of his departure from the court of louis his numerous enemies experienced almost as much chagrin as that which had been occasioned them by his going thither for they had been consoling themselves of late with a fresh rumour and again they were believing what it pleased them to believe rumours you perceive were never wanting where the borgias were concerned and it may be that you are beginning to rate these voces populi at their proper value and to apprehend the worth of many of those that have been embalmed as truths in the abiding records  this last one had it that louis was purposely keeping cesare by him and intended ultimately to carry him off to france and so put an end to the disturbances the duke was creating in italy what a consolation would not that have been to those italian princelings to whose undoing he had warred and can you marvel that they believed and circulated so readily the thing for which they hoped so fondly by your appreciation of that may you measure the fresh disappointment that was theirs  so mistaken were they indeed as it now transpired that louis had actually at last removed his protection from bologna under the persuasion of cesare and the pope before the duke took his departure from king louiss court the latter entered into a treaty with him in that connection to supply him with three hundred lances de bailler au valentinois trois cents lances pour laider à conquérir bologne au nome de leglise et opprimer les ursins baillons et vitelozze  it was a doubledealing age and louiss attitude in this affair sorted well with it feeling that he owed bologna some explanation he presently sent a singularly lame one by claude de seyssel he put it that the bentivogli personally were none the less under his protection than they had been hitherto but that the terms of the protection provided that it was granted exclusively of the rights and authority of the holy roman see over bologna and that the king could not embroil himself with the pope with such a shifty message went m de seyssel to make it quite clear to bentivogli what his position was and on the heels of it came on september 2 a papal brief citing bentivogli and his two sons to appear before the pontiff within fifteen days for the purpose of considering with his holiness the matter of the pacification and better government of bologna which for so many years had been so disorderly and turbulent thus the popes summons with a menace that was all too thinly veiled  but bentivogli was not taken unawares he was not even astonished ever since cesares departure from rome in the previous spring he had been disposing against such a possibility as thisfortifying bologna throwing up outworks and erecting bastions beyond the city and levying and arming men in all of which he depended largely upon the citizens and particularly upon the artguild which was devoted to the house of bentivogli  stronger than the affection for their lordwhich when all is said was none too great in bolognawas the deepseated hatred of the clergy entertained by the bolognese this it was that rallied to bentivogli such men as fileno della tuate who actually hated him but it was a choice of evils with fileno and many of his kidney detesting the ruling house and indignant at the injustices it practised they detested the priests still moreso much that they would have taken sides with satan himself against the pontificals in this spirit did they carry their swords to bentivogli  upon the nobles bentivogli could not countless than ever since the coldblooded murder of the marescotti but in the burghers adherence he deemed himself secure and indeed on september 17 he had some testimony of it  on that datethe fortnights grace expiringthe brief was again read to the reggimento but it was impossible to adopt any resolution the people were in arms and with enormous uproar protested that they would not allow giovanni bentivogli or his sons to go to rome lest they should be in danger once they had left their own state  italy was full of rumours at the time of cesares proposed emprise against bologna and it was added that he intended further to make himself master of città di castello and perugia and thus by depriving them of their tyrannies punish vitelli and baglioni for their defection  this was the natural result of the terms of cesares treaty with france having become known but the part of it which regarded the orsini vitelli and baglioni was purely provisional considering that these condottieri were now at odds with cesare they might see fit to consider themselves bound to bentivogli by the treaty of villafontana signed by vitelli and orsini on the dukes behalf at the time of the capitulation of castel bolognese they might choose to disregard the fact that this treaty had already been violated by bentivogli himself through the nonfulfilment of the terms of it and refuse to proceed against him upon being so bidden by valentinois  it was for such a contingency as this that provision was made by the clause concerning them in cesares treaty with louis  the orsini were still in the dukes service in command of troops levied for him and paid by him and considering that with them cesare had no quarrel it is by no means clear why they should have gone over to the alliance of the condottieri that was now forming against the duke join it however they did they too were in the treaty of villafontana but that they should consider themselves bound by it would have beenhad they urged itmore in the nature of a pretext than a reason but they chose a pretext even more slender they gave out that in milan louis xii had told cardinal orsini that the popes intention was to destroy the orsini  to accept such a statement as true we should have to believe in a disloyalty and a doubledealing on the part of louis xii altogether incredible to what end should he on the one side engage to assist cesare with 300 lances to oppress the orsiniif necessary and among otherswhilst on the other he goes to orsini with the story which they attribute to him what a mean treacherous unkingly figure must he not cut as a consequence he may have beenwe know indeed that he wasno more averse to double­dealing than any other cinquecentist but he was probably as averse to being found out in a meanness and made to look contemptible as any doubledealer of our own times it is a consideration worth digesting  when word of the story put about by the orsini was carried to the pope he strenuously denied the imputation and informed the venetian ambassador that he had written to complain of this to the king of france and that far from such a thing being true cesare was so devoted to the orsini as to be more orsini than borgian  it is further worth considering that the defection of the orsini was neither immediate nor spontaneous as must surely have been the case had the story been true it was the baglioni and vitelli only who first met to plot at todi to declare that they would not move against their ally of bologna and to express the hope that they might bring the orsini to the same mind they succeeded so well that the second meeting was held at magionea place belonging to the powerful cardinal orsini situated near the baglionis stronghold of perugia vitellozzo was carried thither on his bed so stricken with the morbo gallicowhich in italy was besetting most princes temporal and ecclesiasticalthat he was unable to walk  gentile and gianpaolo baglioni cardinal gianbattista orsini francesco orsini duke of gravina paolo orsini the bastard son of the archbishop of trani pandolfo petruccilord of sienaand hermes bentivogli were all present the lastnamed prone to the direct methods of murder by which he had rid bologna of the marescotti is said to have declared that he would kill cesare borgia if he but had the opportunity whilst vitelli swore solemnly that within a year he would slay or capture the duke or else drive him out of italy  from this it will be seen that the diet of magione was no mere defensive alliance but actually an offensive one with the annihilation of cesare borgia for its objective  they certainly had the power to carry out their resolutions for whilst cesare disposed at that moment of not more than 2500 foot 300 menatarms and the 100 lances of his caesarean guard of patricians the confederates had in arms some 9000 foot and 1000 horse conscious of their superior strength they determined to strike at once before cesare should be further supported by the french lances and to make sure of him by assailing him on every side at once to this end it was resolved that bentivogli should instantly march upon imola where cesare lay whilst the others should possess themselves of urbino and pesaro simultaneously  they even approached florence and venice in the matter inviting the republics to come into the league against valentinois  the florentines however could not trust such enemies of their own as vitelli and the orsini nor dared they join in an enterprise which had for scope to make war upon an ally of france and they sent word to cesare of their resolve to enter into no schemes against him  the venetians would gladly have moved to crush a man who had snatched the romagna from under their covetous eyes but in view of the league with france they dared not what they dared they did they wrote to louis at length of the evils that were befalling italy at the hands of the duke of valentinois and of the dishonour to the french crown which lay for louis in his alliance with cesare borgia they even went so farand most treacherously considering the leagueas to allow their famous captain bartolomeo dalviano to reconduct guidobaldo to urbino as we shall presently see  had the confederates but kept faith with one another cesares knell had soon been tolled but they were a weakkneed pack of traitors irresolute in their enmity as in their friendships the orsini hung back they urged that they did not trust themselves to attack cesare with men actually in his pay whilst bentivoglitreacherous by nature to the backbone of himactually went so far as to attempt to open secret negotiations with cesare through ercole deste of ferrara     chapter xv macchiavellis legation   on october 2 news of the revolt of the condottieri and the diet of magione had reached the vatican and rendered the pope uneasy cesare however had been informed of it some time before at imola where he was awaiting the french lances that should enable him to raid the bolognese and drive out the bentivogli  where another might have been paralyzed by a defection which left him almost without an army and would have taken the course of sending envoys to the rebels to attempt to make terms and by concessions to patch up a treaty cesare with characteristic courage assurance and promptitude of action flung out officers on every side to levy him fresh troops  his great reputation as a condottiero the fame of his wealth and his notorious liberality stood him now in excellent stead the response to his call was instantaneous soldiers of fortune and mercenaries showed the trust they had in him and flocked to his standard from every quarter one of the first to arrive was gasparo sanseverino known as fracassa a condottiero of great renown who had been in the pontifical service since the election of pope alexander he was a valuable acquisition to cesare who placed him in command of the horse another was lodovico pico della mirandola who brought a small condotta of 60 lances and 60 light horse ranieri della sassetta rode in at the head of 100 mounted arbalisters and francesco de luna with a body of 50 arquebusiers1     1  the arquebus although it had existed in italy for nearly a century was only just coming into general use   valentinois sent out raffaele dei pazzi and galeotto pallavicini the one into lombardy to recruit 1000 gascons the other to raise a body of swiss mercenaries yet when all is said these were but supplementary forces the main strength of cesares new army lay in the troops raised in the romagna which faithful to him and confident of his power and success rallied to him now in the hour of his need than this there can be no more eloquent testimony to the quality of his rule in command of these romagnuoli troops he placed such romagnuoli captains as dionigio di naldo and marcantonio da fano thereby again affording proof of his wisdom by giving these soldiers their own compatriots and men with whom they were in sympathy for their leaders  with such speed had he acted and such was the influence of his name that already by october 14 he had assembled an army of upwards of 6000 men which his officers were diligently drilling at imola whilst daily now were the french lances expected and the swiss and gascon mercenaries he had sent to levy  it may well be that this gave the confederates pause and suggested to them that they should reconsider their position and ask themselves whether the opportunity for crushing cesare had not slipped by whilst they had stood undecided  it was pandolfo petrucci who took the first step towards a reconciliation by sending word to valentinois that it was not his intention to take any measures that might displease his excellency his excellency will no doubt have smiled at that belated assurance from the sparrow to the hawk then a few days later came news that giulio orsini had entered into an agreement with the pope this appeared to give the confederacy its deathblow and paolo orsini was on the point of setting out to seek cesare at imola for the purpose of treating with himwhich would definitely have given burial to the revoltwhen suddenly there befell an event which threw the scales the other way  cesares people were carrying out some work in the castle of s leo in the interior of which a new wall was in course of erection for the purposes of this great baulks of timber were being brought into the castle from the surrounding country some peasants headed by one brizio who had been a squire of guidobaldos availed themselves of the circumstance to capture the castle by a stratagem bringing forward some great masses of timber and felled trees they set them down along the drawbridge in such a manner as to prevent its being hoisted that done an attack in force was directed against the fortress the place whose natural defences rendered it practically impregnable was but slightly manned being thus surprised and unable to raise the bridge it was powerless to offer any resistance so that the montefeltre peasants having killed every borgia soldier of the garrison took possession of it and held it for duke guidobaldo  this capture of s leo was as a spark that fired a train instantly the hardy hillmen of urbino were in arms to reconquer guidobaldos duchy for him stronghold after stronghold fell into their hands until they were in urbino itself they made short work of the capitals scanty defenders flung cesares governor into prison and finally obtained possession of the citadel  it was the news of this that caused the confederates once more to pause before declaring themselves they waited to see what action venice would take whilst in the meantime they sought shelter behind a declaration that they were soldiers of the church and would do nothing against the will of the pontiff they were confidently assured that venice would befriend guidobaldo and help him back to his throne now that his own people had done so much towards that end it remained however to be seen whether venice would at the same time befriend pesaro and rimini  instantly cesare borgiawho was assailed by grave doubts concerning the venetianstook his measures he ordered bartolomeo da capranica who was chief in command of his troops in urbino to fall back upon rimini with all his companies whilst to pesaro the duke dispatched michele da corella and ramiro de lorqua  it was a busy time of action with the duke at imola and yet amid all the occupation which this equipment of a new army must have given him he still found time for diplomatic measures and taking advantage of the expressed friendliness of florence he had replied by desiring the signory to send an envoy to confer with him florence responded by sending as her representative that same niccolò macchiavelli who had earlier accompanied soderini on a similar mission to valentinois and who had meanwhile been advanced to the dignity of secretary of state  macchiavelli has left us in his dispatches to his government the most precious and valuable information concerning that period of cesare borgias history during which he was with the duke on the business of his legation not only is it the rare evidence of an eyewitness that macchiavelli affords us but the evidence as we have said of one endowed with singular acumen and an extraordinary gift of psychological analysis the one clear and certain inference to be drawn not only from those dispatches but from the florentine secretarys later writings is that at close quarters with cesare borgia a critical witness of his methods he conceived for him a transcending admiration which was later to find its fullest expression in his immortal book the princea book remember compiled to serve as a guide in government to giuliano demedici the feeble brother of pope leo x a book inspired by cesare borgia who is the model prince held up by macchiavelli for emulation  does it serve any purpose in the face of this work from the pen of the acknowledged inventor of statecraft to describe cesares conquest of the romagna by opprobrious epithets and sweeping statements of condemnation and censurestatements kept carefully general and never permitted to enter into detail which must destroy their own ends and expose their falsehood  gregorovius in this connection is as full of contradictions as any man must be who does not sift out the truth and rigidly follow it in his writings consider the following scrupulously translated extracts from his geschichte der stadt rom    a cesare departed from rome to resume his bloody work in the romagna    b the frightful deeds performed by cesare on both sides of the apennines he assumes the semblance of an exterminating angel and performs such hellish iniquities that we can only shudder at the contemplation of the evil of which human nature is capable  and now pray consider and compare with those the following excerpt from the very next page of that same monumental work  before him cesare cities trembled the magistrates prostrated themselves in the dust sycophantic courtiers praised him to the stars yet it is undeniable that his government was energetic and good for the first time romagna enjoyed peace and was rid of her vampires in the name of cesare justice was administered by antonio di monte sansovino president of the ruota of cesena a man universally beloved  it is almost as if the truth had slipped out unawares for the first period hardly seems a logical prelude to the second by which it is largely contradicted if cesares government was so good that romagna knew peace at last and was rid of her vampires why did cities tremble before him there is by the way no evidence of such trepidations in any of the chronicles of the conquered states one and all of which hail cesare as their deliverer why if he was held in such terror did city after cityas we have seenspontaneously offer itself to cesares dominion  but to rebut those statements of gregoroviuss there is scarce the need to pose these questions sufficiently does gregorovius himself rebut them the men who praised cesare the historian tells us were sycophantic courtiers but where is the wonder of his being praised if his government was as good as gregorovius admits it to have been what was unnatural in that praise what so untruthful as to deserve to be branded sycophantic and by what right is an historian to reject as sycophants the writers who praise a man whilst accepting every word of his detractors as the words of inspired evangelists even when their falsehoods are so transparent as to provoke the derision of the thoughtful and analytic  as lespinois points out in his masterly essay in the revue des questions historiques gregorovius refuses to recognize in cesare borgia the messiah of a united central italy but considers him merely as a highflying adventurer whilst villari in his life and times of macchiavelli tells you bluntly that cesare borgia was neither a statesman nor a soldier but a brigandchief  these are mere words and to utter words is easier than to make them good  highflying adventurer or brigandchief by all means if it please you what but a highflying adventurer was the woodcutter muzio attendolo founder of the ducal house of sforza what but a highflying adventurer was that count henry of burgundy who founded the kingdom of portugal what else was the norman bastard william who conquered england what else the artillery officer napoleon bonaparte who became emperor of the french what else was the founder of any dynasty but a highflying adventureror a brigandchief if the melodramatic term is more captivating to your fancy  these terms are used to belittle cesare they achieve no more however than to belittle those who penned them for even as they are true the marvel is that the admirable matter in these truths appears to have escaped those authors  what else gregorovius opinesthat cesare was no messiah of united italyis true enough cesare was the messiah of cesare the wellbeing of italy for its own sake exercised his mind not so much as the wellbeing of the horse he rode he wrought for his own aggrandisementbut he wrought wisely and whilst the end in view is no more to be censured than the ambition of any man the means employed are in the highest degree to be commended since the wellbeing of the romagna which was not an aim was nevertheless an essential and praiseworthy incident  when it can be shown that every other of those conquerors who cut heroic figures in history were purest altruists it will be time to damn cesare borgia for his egotism  what villari says for the purpose of adding rhetorical force to his brigandchiefthat cesare was no statesman and no soldieris entirely of a piece with the rest of the chapter in which it occurs1a chapter rich in sweeping inaccuracies concerning cesare but it is staggering to find the statement in such a place amid macchiavellis letters on cesare breathing an obvious and profound admiration of the dukes talents as a politician and a soldieran admiration which later is to go perilously near to worship to macchiavelli cesare is the incarnation of a hazy ideal as is abundantly shown in the prince for villari to reconcile all this with his own views must seem impossible and impossible it is yet villari achieves it with an audacity that leaves you breathless     1  in his niccolò machiavelli   nohe practically tells youthis macchiavelli who daily saw and spoke with cesare for two months and during a critical time which is when men best reveal their natures this acute florentinethe acutest man of his age perhapswho studied and analysed cesare and sent his government the results of his analyses and was inspired by them later to write the princethis man did not know cesare borgia he wrote not about cesare himself but about a creation of his own intellect  that is what villari pretends macchiavelli the representative of a power unfriendly at heart under the mask of the expedient friendliness his mind already poisoned by all the rumours current throughout italy comes on this mission to valentinois florence fearing and hating valentinois as she does would doubtless take pleasure in detractory advices other ambassadorsparticularly those of venicepander to their governments wishes in this respect conscious that there is a sycophancy in slander contrasted with which the ordinary sycophancy of flattery is as water to wine they diligently send home every scrap of indecent or scandalous rumour they can pick up in the roman antechambers however unlikely uncorroborated or unconcerning the business of an ambassador  but macchiavelli in cesare borgias presence is overawed by his greatness his force and his intellect and these attributes engage him in his dispatches these same dispatches are a stumblingblock to all who prefer to tread the beaten sensational track and to see in cesare borgia a villain of melodrama a monster of crime brutal and consequently of no intellectual force but villari contrives to step more or less neatly if fatuously over that formidable obstacle by telling you that macchiavelli presents to you not really cesare borgia but a creation of his own intellect which he had come to admire it is a simple elementary expedient by means of which every piece of historical evidence ever penned may be destroyedincluding all that which defames the house of borgia  macchiavelli arrived at imola on the evening of october 7 1502 and all travelstained as he was repaired straight to the duke as if the message with which he was charged was one that would not brook a moments delay in its deliverance actually however he had nothing to offer cesare but the empty expressions of florences friendship and the hopes she founded upon cesares reciprocation the crafty young florentinehe was thirtythree at the timewas sent to temporize and to avoid committing himself or his government  valentinois listened to the specious compliments and replied by similar protestations and by reminding florence how he had curbed the hand of those very condottieri who had now rebelled against him as a consequence he showed himself calm and tranquil at the loss of urbino telling macchiavelli that he had not forgotten the way to reconquer it when it should suit him of the revolted condottieri he contemptuously said that he accounted them fools for not having known how to choose a more favourable moment in which to harm him and that they would presently find such a fire burning under their feet as would call for more water to quench it than such men as these disposed of  meanwhile the success of those rustics of urbino who had risen and the ease of their victories had fired others of the territory to follow their example fossombrone and pergola were the next to rebel and to put the borgia garrisons to the sword but in their reckless audacity they chose their moment ill for michele da corella was at hand with his lances and although his orders had been to repair straight to pesaro he ventured to depart from them to the extent of turning aside to punish the insurgence of those towns by launching his menatarms upon them and subjecting them to an appalling and pitiless sack  when cesare heard the news of it and the details of the horrors that had been perpetrated he turned smiling cruelly to macchiavelli who was with him and the constellations this year seem unfavourable to rebels he observed  a battle of wits was toward between the florentines secretary of state and the duke of valentinois each mistrustful of the other in the end cesare a little out of patience at so much inconclusiveness though outwardly preserving his immutable serenity sought to come to grips by demanding that florence should declare whether he was to account her his friend or not but this was precisely what macchiavellis instructions forbade him from declaring he answered that he must first write to the signory and begged the duke to tell him what terms he proposed should form the treaty but there it was the dukes turn to fence and to avoid a direct answer desiring that florence should open the negotiations and that from her should come the first proposal  he reminded macchiavelli that florence would do well to come to a decision before the orsini sought to patch up a peace with him since once that was done there would be fresh difficulties owing of course to orsinis enmity to the existing florentine government and of such a peace there was now every indication paolo orsini having at last sent cesare proposals for rejoining him subject to his abandoning the bologna enterprise in which the orsini argued they could not bear a hand without breaking faith with bentivogli and turning against florence vitelli at the same time announced himself ready to return to cesares service but first he required some honest security  well might it have pleased cesare to oblige the orsini to the letter and to give a lesson in straightdealing to these shuffling florentine pedlars who sent a nimblewitted secretary of state to hold him in play with sweet words of barren meaning but there was france and her wishes to be considered and he could not commit himself so his answer was peremptory and condescending he told them that if they desired to show themselves his friends they could set about reconquering and holding urbino for him  it looked as if the condottieri agreed to this for on october 11 vitelli seized castel durante and on the next day baglioni was in possession of cagli  in view of this cesare bade the troops which he had withdrawn to advance again upon the city of urbino and take possession of it but suddenly on the 12th a messenger from guidobaldo rode into urbino to announce their dukes return within a few days to defend the subjects who had shown themselves so loyal to him this the shifty confederates accounted must be done with the support of venice whence they concluded that venice must have declared against valentinois and again they treacherously changed sides  the orsini proceeded to prompt action assured of their return to himself and counting upon their support in urbino cesare had contented himself with sending thither a small force of 100 lances and 200 light horse upon these fell the orsini and put them to utter rout at calmazzo near fossombrone capturing ugo di moncada who commanded one of the companies but missing michele da corella who contrived to escape to fossombrone  the conquerors entered urbino that evening and as if to put it on record that they burnt their boats with valentinois paolo orsini wrote that same night to the venetian senate advices of the victory won three days lateron october 18guidobaldo accompanied by his nephews ottaviano fregioso and gianmaria varano reentered his capital amid the cheers and enthusiasm of his loyal and loving people  vitelli made haste to place his artillery at guidobaldos disposal for the reduction of cagli pergola and fossombrone which were still held for valentinois whilst oliverotto da fermo went with gianmaria varano to attempt the reconquest of camerino and gianpaolo baglioni to fano which however he did not attempt to enter as an enemyan idle course seeing how loyally the town held for cesarebut as a ducal condottiero  fired by orsinis example bentivogli also took the offensive and began by ordering the canonists of bologna university to go to the churches and encourage the people to disregard the excommunications launched against the city he wrote to the king of france to complain that cesare had broken the treaty of villafontana by which he had undertaken never again to molest bolognanaïvely ignoring the circumstance that he himself had been the first to violate the terms of that same treaty and that it was precisely upon such grounds that cesare was threatening him  thus matters stood the confederates turning anxious eyes towards venice and haply beginning to wonder whether the republic was indeed going to move to their support as they had so confidently expected and realizing perhaps by now their rashness and the ruin that awaited them should venice fail them and fail them venice did the venetians had received a reply from louis xii to that letter in which they had heaped odium upon the borgia and shown the king what dishonour to himself dwelt in his alliance with valentinois their criticisms and accusations were ignored in that reply which resolved itself into nothing more than a threat that if they opposed themselves to the enterprise of the church they would be treated by him as enemies and of this letter he sent cesare a copy as cesare himself told macchiavelli  so whilst valentinois in imola was able to breathe more freely the condottieri in urbino may well have been overcome with horror at their position and at having been thus left in the lurch by venice none was better aware than pandolfo petrucci of the folly of their action and of the danger that now impended and he sent his secretary to valentinois to say that if the duke would but reassure them on the score of his intentions they would return to him and aid him in recovering what had been lost  following upon this message came paolo orsini himself to imola on the 25th disguised as a courier and having first taken the precaution of obtaining a safeconduct he left again on the 29th bearing with him a treaty the terms of which had been agreed between himself and cesare during that visit these were that cesare should engage to protect the states of all his allied condottieri and they to serve him and the church in return a special convention was to follow to decide the matter of the bentivogli which should be resolved by cesare cardinal orsini and pandolfo petrucci in consultation their judgment to be binding upon all  cesares contempt for the orsini and the rest of the shifty men who formed that confederacythat diet of bankrupts as he had termed itwas expressed plainly enough to macchiavelli  today said he messer paolo is to visit me and tomorrow there will be the cardinal and thus they think to befool me at their pleasure but i on my side am only dallying with them i listen to all they have to say and bide my own time  later macchiavelli was to remember those words which meanwhile afforded him matter for reflection  as paolo orsini rode away from imola the dukes secretary gherardi followed and overtook him to say that cesare desired to add to the treaty another clauseone relating to the king of france to this paolo orsini refused to consent but upon being pressed in the matter by gherardi went so far as to promise to submit the clause to the others  on october 30 cesare published a notice in the romagna intimating the return to obedience on the part of his captains  macchiavelli was mystified by this and apprehensiveas men will be of the things they cannot fathomof what might be reserved in it for florence it was gherardi who reassured him laughing in the face of the crafty florentine as he informed him that even children should come to smile at such a treaty as this he added that he had gone after paolo orsini to beg the addition of another clause intentionally omitted by the duke  if they accept that clause concluded messer agabito it will open a window if they refuse it a door by which the duke can issue from the treaty  macchiavellis wonder increased but the subject of it now was that the condottieri should be hoodwinked by a document in such terms and well may he have bethought him then of those words which cesare had used to him a few days earlier     chapter xvi ramiro de lorqua   it really seemed as if the condottieri were determined to make their score as heavy as possible for even whilst paolo orsini had been on his mission of peace to cesare and whilst they awaited his return they had continued in arms against the duke the vitelli had aided guidobaldo to reconquer his territory and had killed in the course of doing so bartolomeo da capranica cesares most valued captain and vitellis brother­inarms of yesterday the baglioni were pressing michele da corella in pesaro but to little purpose whilst the butcher oliverotto da fermo in camerinoof which he had taken possession with gianmaria varanowas slaughtering every spaniard he could find  on the other side corella in pesaro hanged five men whom he caught practising against the dukes government and having taken young pietro varanowho was on his way to join his brother in camerino in view of the revolt therehe had him strangled in the marketplace there is a story that with life not yet extinct the poor youth was carried into church by the pitiful crowd but here a friar discovering that he still lived called in the soldiers and bade them finish him this friar going later through cagli was recognized set upon by a mob and torn to piecesin which if the rest of the tale be true he was richly served  into the theatre of bloodshed came paolo orsini from his mission to valentinois bringing with him the treaty for signature by the condottieri accustomed as they were to playing fast and loose they opined that so far as urbino was concerned enough changes of government had they contrived there already vitelli pointed out the unseemliness of once again deposing guidobaldo whom they had just reseated upon his throne besides he perceived in the treaty the end of his hopes of a descent upon florence which was the cause of all his labours so he rejected it  but valentinois had already got the orsini and pandolfo petrucci on his side and so the confederacy was divided another factor came to befriend the duke on november 2 he was visited by antonio galeazzo bentivogli sent by his father giovanni to propose a treaty with himthis state of affairs having been brought about by the mediation of ercole deste from the negotiations that followed it resulted that on the 13th the orsini had word from cesare that he had entered into an alliance with the bentivogliwhich definitely removed their main objection to bearing arms with him  it was resigning much on cesares part but the treaty after all was only for two years and might of course be broken before then as they understood these matters this treaty was signed at the vatican on the 23rd between borgia and bentivogli to guarantee the states of both the king of france the signory of florence and the duke of ferrara guaranteed the alliance  inter alia it was agreed between them that bologna should supply cesare with 100 lances and 200 light horse for one or two enterprises within the year and that the condotta of 100 lances which cesare held from bologna by the last treaty should be renewed the terms of the treaty were to be kept utterly secret for the next three months so that the affairs of urbino and camerino should not be prejudiced by their publication  the result was instantaneous on november 27 paolo orsini was back at imola with the other treaty which bore now the signatures of all the confederates vitelli finding himself isolated had swallowed his chagrin in the matter of florence and his scruples in the matter of urbino abandoning the unfortunate guidobaldo to his fate this came swiftly from imola paolo orsini rode to fano on the 29th and ordered his men to advance upon urbino and seize the city in the duke of valentinoiss name proclaiming a pardon for all rebels who would be submissive  guidobaldo and the illstarred lord of faenza were the two exceptions in romagnathe only two who had known how to win the affections of their subjects for guidobaldo there was nothing that the men of urbino would not have done they rallied to him now and the women of valbonelike the ladies of england to save coeurdelioncame with their jewels and trinkets offering them that he might have the means to levy troops and resist but this gentle kindly guidobaldo could not subject his country to further ravages of war and so he determined in his subjects interests as much as in his own to depart for the second time  early in december the orsini troops are in his territory and paolo halting them a few miles out of urbino sends to beg guidobaldos attendance in his camp guidobaldo crippled by gout and unable at the time to walk a step sends paolo his excuses and begs that he will come to urbino where he awaits him there guidobaldo makes formal surrender to him takes leave of his faithful friends enjoins fidelity to valentinois and trust in god and so on december 19 he departs into exile the one pathetic noble figure amid so many ignoble ones paolo taking possession of the duchy assumes the title of governor  the florentines had had their chance of an alliance with cesare and had deliberately neglected it early in november they had received letters from the king of france urging them to come to an accord with cesare and they had made known to the duke that they desired to reoccupy pisa and to assure themselves of vitelli but when he pressed that florence should give him a condotta macchiavellifollowing his instructions not to commit the republic in any wayhad answered that his excellency must not be considered as other lords but as a new potentate in italy with whom it is more seemly to make an alliance or a friendship than to grant him a condotta and as alliances are maintained by arms and that is the only power to compel their observance the signory could not perceive what security they would have when threequarters or threefifths of their arms would be in the dukes hands macchiavelli added diplomatically that he did not say this to impugn the dukes good faith but to show him that princes should be circumspect and never enter into anything that leaves a possibility of their being put at a disadvantage1     1  see the twentyfirst letter from macchiavelli on this legation   cesare answered him calmly senza segno dalterazione alcuna that without a condotta he didnt know what to make of a private friendship whose first principles were denied him and there the matter hung for macchiavellis legation had for only aim to ensure the immunity of tuscany and to safeguard florentine interests without conceding any advantages to cesareas the latter had perceived from the first  on december 10 cesare moved from imola with his entire army intent now upon the conquest of sinigaglia which state giuliano della rovere had been unable to save for his nephew as king and pope had alike turned a deaf ear upon the excuses he had sought to make for the prefetessa giovanna da montefeltrethe mother of the young prefectwho had aided her brother guidobaldo in the late war in urbino  on the morrow valentinois arrived in cesena and encamped his army there for christmas as in the previous year the country was beginning to feel the effects of this prolonged vast military occupation and although the duke with intent to relieve the people had done all that was possible to provision the troops and had purchased from venice 30000 bushels of wheat for the purpose yet all had been consumed the very stones have been eaten says macchiavelli  to account for this state of thingsand possibly for certain other mattersmesser ramiro de lorqua the governorgeneral was summoned from pesaro whilst to avert the threatened famine cesare ordered that the cereals in the private granaries of cesena should be sold at reduced prices and he further proceeded at heavy expense to procure grain from without another less farseeing than valentinois might have made capital out of urbinos late rebellion and pillaged the country to provide for pressing needs but that would have been opposed to cesares policy of fostering the goodwill of the people he subjected  on december 20 three of the companies of french lances that had been with cesare took their leave of him and returned to lombardy so that cesare was left with only one company there appears to be some confusion as to the reasons for this and it is stated by some that those companies were recalled to milan by the french governor macchiavelli ever inquisitive and inquiring questioned one of the french officers in the matter to be told that the lances were returning because the duke no longer needed them the inference being that this was in consequence of the return of the condottieri to their allegiance but the astute secretary did not at the time account this convincing arguing that the duke could not yet be said to be secure nor could he know for certain how far he might trust vitelli and the orsini presumably however he afterwards obtained more certain information for he says later that valentinois himself dismissed the french and that the dismissal was part of the stratagem he was preparing and had for object to reassure vitelli and the other confederates and to throw them off their guard by causing them to suppose him indifferently supported  but the departure of the french did not take place without much discussion being provoked and rumour making extremely busy whilst it was generally assumed that it would retard the sinigaglia conquest nevertheless the duke calmly pursued his preparations and proceeded now to send forward his artillery there was no real ground upon which to assume that he would adopt any other course cesare was now in considerable strength apart from french lances and even as these left him he was joined by a thousand swiss and another six hundred romagnuoli from the val di lamone moreover as far as the reduction of sinigaglia was concerned no resistance was to be expected for cardinal giuliano della rovere had written enjoining the people to surrender peacefully to the duke  what matters cesare may have found in cesena to justify the arrest of his governorgeneral we do not know to the full with absolute certainty on december 22 ramiro de lorqua coming from pesaro in response to his masters summons was arrested on his arrival and flung into prison his examination was to follow  macchiavelli reporting the arrest says it is thought he cesare may sacrifice him to the people who have a very great desire of it  ramiro had made himself detested in romagna by the ruthlessness of his rule and a ruthless servant reflects upon his master a matter which could nowise suit borgia to all who have read the prince it will be clear that upon that ground aloneof having brought valentinoiss justice into disrepute by the harshness which in valentinoiss name he practisedmacchiavelli would have approved the execution of ramiro he would have accounted it perfectly justifiable that ramiro should be sacrificed to the people for no better reason than because he had provoked their hatred since this sacrifice made for the dukes welfare he does as a matter of fact justify this execution but upon much fuller grounds than these still had the reasons been no better than are mentioned he would still have justified it upon those so much is clear and when so much is clear much more will be clear to you touching this strange epoch  there was however more than a matter of sacrificing the governorgeneral to the hatred of the people there was for one thing the matter of that wheat which had disappeared ramiro was charged with having fraudulently sold it to his own dishonest profit putting the duke to the heavy expense of importing fresh supplies for the nourishment of the people the seriousness of the charge will be appreciated when it is considered that had a famine resulted from this peculation grave disorder might have ensued and perhaps even a rebellion against a government which could provide no better  the duke published the news of the governors arrest throughout romagna he announced his displeasure and regret at the harshnesses and corrupt practices of ramiro de lorqua in spite of the most urgent admonishings that he should refrain from all undue exactions and the threat of grave punishment should he disobey these frauds corruption extortion and rapine practised by the governor were so grave continuous and general stated the duke in his manifesto that there is no city countryside or castle nor any place in all romagna nor officer or minister of the dukes who does not know of these abuses and amongst others the famine of wheat occasioned by the traffic which he held against our express prohibition sending out such quantities as would abundantly have sufficed for the people and the army  he concludes with assurances of his intention that in the future they shall be ruled with justice and integrity and he urges all who may have charges to prefer against the said governor to bring them forward immediately  it was freely rumoured that the charges against ramiro by no means ended there and in bolognaand from bologna the truth of such a matter might well transpire all things consideredit was openly said that ramiro had been in secret treaty with the bentivogli orsini and vitelli against the duke of valentinois aveva provixione da messer zoane bentivogli e da orsini e vitelozo contro el duca writes fileno della tuate who it will be borne in mind was no friend of the borgia and would be at no pains to find justification for the dukes deeds  but of that secret treaty there was for the moment no official mention later the rumour of it was to receive the fullest confirmation and together with that we shall give in the next chapter the dukes obvious reasons for having kept the matter secret at first matter enough and to spare was there already upon which to dispose of messer ramiro de lorqua and disposed of he was with the most summary justice  on the morning of december 26 the first folk to be astir in cesena beheld in the grey light of that wintry dawn the body of ramiro lying headless in the square it was richly dressed with all his ornaments upon it a scarlet cloak about it and the hands were gloved on a pike beside the body the blackbearded head was set up to view and so remained throughout that day a terrible display of the swift and pitiless justice of the duke  macchiavelli wrote the reason of his death is not properly known non si sa bene la cagione della sua morte beyond the fact that such was the pleasure of the prince who shows us that he can make and unmake men according to their deserts  the cronica civitas faventiae the diariurn caesenate and the cronache forlivese all express the peoples extreme satisfaction at the deed and endorse the charges of brutality against the man which are contained in cesares letter     chapter xvii the beautiful stratagem   cesare left cesena very early on the morning of december 26the morning of ramiros executionand by the 29th he was at fano where he received the envoys who came from ancona with protestations of loyalty as well as a messenger from vitellozzo vitelli who brought him news of the surrender of sinigaglia the citadel itself was still being held by andrea doriathe same who was afterwards to become so famous in genoa this it was stated was solely because doria desired to make surrender to the duke himself the prefectress giovanna da montefeltre had already departed from the city which she ruled as regent for her elevenyear old boy and had gone by sea to venice  the duke returned answer to vitelli that he would be in sinigaglia himself upon the morrow and he invited the condottieri to receive him there since he was decided to possess himself of the citadel at once whether doria chose to surrender it peacefully or not and that to provide for emergencies he would bring his artillery with him lastly vitelli was bidden to prepare quarters within the new town for the troops that would accompany cesare to do this it was necessary to dispose the soldiers of oliverotto da fermo in the borgo these were the only troops with the condottieri in sinigaglia the remainder of their forces were quartered in the strongholds of the territory at distances of from five to seven miles of the town  on the last day of that year 1502 cesare borgia appeared before sinigaglia to receive the homage of those men who had used him so treacherously and whomwith the exception of paolo orsinihe now met face to face for the first time since their rebellion here were francesco orsini duke of gravina with paolo and the latters son fabio here was oliverotto the ruffianly lord of fermo who had won his lordship by the coldblooded murder of his kinsman and concerning whom a rumour ran in rome that cesare had sworn to choke him with his own hands and here was vitellozzo vitelli the archtraitor of them all  gianpaolo baglioni was absent through illnessa matter less fatal to him than was their health to those who were presentand the cardinal and giulio orsini were in rome  were these captains mad to suppose that such a man as cesare borgia could so forget the wrong they had done him and forgive them in this easy fashion exacting no amends were they mad to suppose that after such proofs as they had given him of what manner of faith they kept he would trust them hereafter with their lives to work further mischief against him well might macchiavelli have marvelled when he beheld the terms of the treaty the duke had made with them were they mad to imagine that one so crafty as valentinois would so place himself into their handsthe hands of men who had sworn his ruin and death truly mad they must have beenrendered so by the gods who would destroy them  the tale of that happening is graphically told by the pen of the admiring macchiavelli who names the affair il bellissimo inganno that he so named it should suffice us and restrain us from criticisms of our own accepting that criticism of his to us judged from our modern standpoint the affair of sinigaglia is the last word in treachery and iscariotism but you are here concerned with the standpoint of the cinquecento and that standpoint macchiavelli gives you when he describes this business as the beautiful stratagem to offer judgment in despite of that is to commit a fatuity which too often already has been committed  here then is macchiavellis story of the event  on the morning of december 31 cesares army composed of 10000 foot and 3000 horse1 was drawn up on the banks of the river metaurosome five miles from sinigagliain accordance with his orders awaiting his arrival he came at daybreak and immediately ordered forward 200 lances under the command of don michele da corella he bade the foot to march after these and himself brought up the rear with the main body of the horse     1 this is macchiavellis report of the forces but it appears to be an exaggeration for upon leaving cesena cesare does not appear to have commanded more than 10000 men in all   in sinigaglia as we have seen the condottieri had only the troops of oliverotto1000 foot and 150 horsewhich had been quartered in the borgo and were now drawn up in the marketplace oliverotto at their head to do honour to the duke  as the horse under don michele gained the little river misa and the bridge that spanned it almost directly opposite to the gates of sinigaglia their captain halted them and drew them up into two files between which a lane was opened through this the foot went forward and straight into the town and after came cesare himself a graceful youthful figure resplendent in full armour at the head of his lances to meet him advanced now the three orsini and vitellozzo vitelli macchiavelli tells us of the latters uneasiness of his premonitions of evil and the farewells all of which macchiavelli had afterwards heard reported which he had taken of his family before coming to sinigaglia probably these are no more than the stories that grow up about such men after such an event as that which was about to happen  the condottieri came unarmed vitelli mounted on a mule wearing a cloak with a green lining in that group he is the only man deserving of any respect or pitya victim of his sense of duty to his family driven to his rebellion and faithlessness to valentinois by his consuming desire to avenge his brothers death upon the florentines the others were poor creatures incapable even of keeping faith with one another paolo orsini was actually said to be in secret concert with valentinois since his mission to him at imola and to have accepted heavy bribes from him oliverotto you have seen at work making a holocaust of his family and friends under the base spur of his cupidity whilst of the absent ones pandolfo petrucci alone was a man of any steadfastness and honesty  the dukes reception of them was invested with that gracious friendliness of which none knew the art better than did he intent upon showing them that the past was forgiven and their offences against himself forgotten as they turned and rode with him through the gates of sinigaglia some of the dukes gentlemen hemmed them about in the preconcerted manner lest even now they should be taken with alarm but it was all done unostentatiously and with every show of friendliness that no suspicions should be aroused  from the group cesare had missed oliverotto and as they now approached the marketsquare where the tyrant of fermo sat on his horse at the head of his troops cesare made a sign with his eyes to don michele the purport of which was plain to the captain he rode ahead to suggest to ohiverotto that this was no time to have his men under arms and out of their lodgings and to point out to him that if they were not dismissed they would be in danger of having their quarters snatched from them by the dukes men from which trouble might arise to this he added that the duke was expecting his lordship  oliverotto persuaded gave the order for the dismissal of his troops and the duke coming up at that moment called to him in response he went to greet him and fell in thereafter with the others who were riding with valentinois  in amiable conversation with them all and riding between vitelli and francesco orsini the duke passed from the borgo into the town itself and so to the palace where the condottieri disposed to take their leave of him but cesare was not for parting with them yet he bade them in with him and they perforce must accept his invitation besides his mood was so agreeable that surely there could be nought to fear  but scarce were they inside when his manner changed of a sudden and at a sign from him they were instantly overpowered and arrested by those gentlemen of his own who were of the party and who came to it well schooled in what they were to do  buonaccorsi compiled his diary carefully from the letters of macchiavelli to the ten in so far as this and other affairs are concerned and to buonaccorsi we must now turn for what immediately follows which is no doubt from macchiavellis second letter of december 31 in which the full details of the affair are given his first letter no more than briefly states the happening the second unfortunately is missing so that the above particularsand some yet to followare culled from the relations which he afterwards penned del modo tenuto etc edited however by the help of his dispatches at the time in regard to the causes which led to the affair between these and the actual relation there are some minor discrepancies unquestionably the dispatches are the more reliable so that where such discrepancies occur the version in the dispatches has been preferred  to turn for a moment to buonaccorsi he tells us that as the florentine envoy who was of course macchiavelli following the duke of valentinois entered the town later after the arrest of the condottieri and found all uproar and confusion he repaired straight to the palace to ascertain the truth as he approached he met the duke riding out in full armour to quell the rioting and restrain his men who were by now all out of hand and pillaging the city cesare perceiving the secretary reined in and called him  this he said is what i wanted to tell monsignor di volterra soderini when he came to urbino but i could not entrust him with the secret now that my opportunity has come i have known very well how to make use of it and i have done a great service to your masters  and with that cesare left him and calling his captains about him rode down into the town to put an end to the horrors that were being perpetrated there  immediately upon the arrest of the condottieri cesare had issued orders to attack the soldiers of vitelli and orsini and to dislodge them from the castles of the territory where they were quartered and similarly to dislodge oliverottos men and drive them out of sinigaglia this had been swiftly accomplished but the dukes men were not disposed to leave matters at that excited by the taste of battle that had been theirs they returned to wreak their fury upon the town and were proceeding to put it to sack directing particular attention to the wealthy quarter occupied by the venetian merchants which is said to have been plundered by them to the extent of some 20000 ducats they would have made an end of sinigaglia but for the sudden appearance amongst them of the duke himself he rode through the streets angrily ordering the pillage to cease and to show how much he was in earnest with his own hands he cut down some who were insolent or slow to obey him thus before dusk he had restored order and quiet  as for the condottieri vitelli and oliverotto were dealt with that very night there is a story that oliverotto seeing that all was lost drew a dagger and would have put it through his heart to save himself from dying at the hands of the hangman if it is true then that was his last show of spirit he turned craven at the end and protested tearfully to his judgesfor a trial was given themthat the fault of all the wrong wrought against the duke lay with his brotherinlaw vitellozzo more wonderful was it that the grim vitellis courage also should break down at the end and that he should beg that the pope be implored to grant him a plenary indulgence and that his answer be awaited  but at dawnthe night having been consumed in their trialthey were placed back to back and so strangled and their bodies were taken to the church of the misericordia hospital  the orsini were not dealt with just yet they were kept prisoners and valentinois would go no further until he should have heard from rome that giulio orsini and the powerful cardinal were also under arrest to put to death at present the men in his power might be to alarm and so lose the others they are right who say that his craft was devilish but what else was to be expected of the times  on the morrowjanuary 1 1503the duke issued dispatches to the powers of italy giving his account of the deed it set forth that the orsini and their confederates notwithstanding the pardon accorded them for their first betrayal and revolt upon learning of the departure of the french lancesand concluding that the duke was thereby weakened and left with only a few followers of no accounthad plotted a fresh and still greater treachery under pretence of assisting him in the taking of sinigaglia whither it was known that he was going they had assembled there in their full strength but displaying only onethird of it and concealing the remainder in the castles of the surrounding country they had then agreed with the castellan of sinigaglia that on that night they should attack him on every side of the new town which being small could contain as they knew but few of his people this treachery coming to his knowledge he had been able to forestall it and entering sinigaglia with all his troops he had seized the traitors and taken the forces of oliverotto by surprise he concluded by exhorting all to render thanks unto god that an end was set to the many calamities suffered in italy in consequence of those malignant ones1     1  see this letter in the documents appended to alvisis cesare borgia document 76   for once cesare borgia is heard giving his own side of an affair but are the particulars of his version true who shall say positively his statement is not by any means contrary to the known facts although it sets upon them an explanation rather different to that afforded us by macchiavelli but it is to be remembered that after all macchiavelli had to fall back upon the inferences which he drew from what he beheld and that there is no scrap of evidence directly to refute any one of cesares statements there is even confirmation of the statement that the condottieri conceived that he was weakened by the departure of the french lances and left with only a few followers of no account for macchiavelli himself dwells upon the artifice with which cesare broke up his forces and disposed of them in comparatively small numbers here and there to the end that his full strength should remain concealed and he admires the strategy of that proceeding  certainly the dukes narrative tends to increase his justification for acting as he did but at best it can only increase it for the actual justification was always there and by the light of his epoch it is difficult to see how he should be blamed these men had openly sworn to have his life and from what has been seen of them there is little reason to suppose they would not have kept their word had they but been given the opportunity  in connection with cesares version it is well to go back for a moment to the execution of ramiro de lorqua and to recall the alleged secret motives that led to it macchiavelli himself was not satisfied that all was disclosed and that the governors harshness and dishonesty had been the sole causes of the justice done upon him the reason of his death is not properly known wrote the florentine secretary another envoy of that day would have filled his dispatches with the rumours that were current with the matters that were being whispered at street corners but macchiavellis habit was to disregard rumours as a rule knowing their dangera circumstance which renders his evidence the most valuable which we possess  it is perhaps permissible to ask what dark secrets had the torture of the cord drawn from messer ramiro had these informed the duke of the true state of affairs at sinigaglia and had the knowledge brought him straight from cesena to deal with the matter  there is justification for these questions inasmuch as on january 4 the pope related to giustinianifor which see his dispatchesthat ramiro de lorqua being sentenced to death stated that he desired to inform the duke of certain matters and informed him that he had concerted with the orsini to give the latter the territory of cesena but that as this could not now be done in consequence of cesares treaty with the condottieri vitelli had arranged to kill the duke in which design he had the concurrence of oliverotto they had planned that a crossbowman should shoot the duke as he rode into sinigaglia in consequence of which the duke took great care of himself and never put off his armour until the affair was over vitellozzo the pope said had confessed before he died that all that ramiro had told the duke was true and at the consistory of january 6 when the sacred college begged for the release of the old cardinal orsiniwho had been taken with the archbishop of florence giacomo di santacroce and gianbattista da virginiothe pope answered by informing the cardinals of this plot against the dukes life  these statements by cesare and his father are perfectly consistent with each other and with the events yet for want of independent confirmation they are not to be insisted upon as affording the true versionas of course the pope may have urged what he did as a pretext to justify what was yet to follow  it is readily conceivable that ramiro under torture or in the hope perhaps of saving his life may have betrayed the alleged plot to murder cesare and it is perfectly consistent with cesares character and with his age that he should have entered into a bargain to learn what ramiro might have to disclose and then have repudiated it and given him to the executioner if cesare under such circumstances as these had learnt what was contemplated he would very naturally have kept silent on the score of it until he had dealt with the condottieri to do otherwise might be to forewarn them he was as macchiavelli says a secret man and the more dangerous for his closeness since he never let it be known what he intended until he had executed his designs  guicciardini of course has called the sinigaglia affair a villainy scelleragine whilst fabio orsini and a nephew of vitellis who escaped from sinigaglia and arrived two days later at perugia sought to engage sympathy by means of an extraordinary tale so alien to all the factsapart from their obvious reasons to lie and provoke resentment against cesareas not to be worth citing     chapter xviii the zenith   andrea doria did not remain to make formal surrender of the citadel of sinigaglia to the dukefor which purpose be it borne in mind had cesare been invited indirectly to come to sinigaglia he fled during the night that saw vitelli and oliverotto writhing their last in the stranglers hands and his flight adds colour to the versions of the affair that were afforded the world by cesare and his father andrea doria waiting to surrender his trust had nothing to fear from the duke no reason to do anything but remain andrea doria intriguing against the dukes life with the condottieri finding them seized by the duke and inferring that all was discovered had every reason to fly  the citadel made surrender on that new years morning when cesare summoned it to do so whilst the troops of the orsini and vitelli lodged in the castles of the territory being taken unawares were speedily disposed of so there being nothing more left to do in sinigaglia cesare once more marshalled his men and set out for città di castellothe tyranny of the vitelli which he found undefended and of which he took possession in the name of the church thence he rushed on towards perugia for he had word that guidobaldo of urbino fabio orsini annibale and venanzio varano and vitellis nephew were assembled there under the wing of gianpaolo baglioni who with a considerable condotta at his back was making big talk of resisting the duke of romagna and valentinois in this gianpaolo persevered most bravely until he had news that the duke was as near as gualdo when precipitately he fledleaving his guests to shift for themselves he had remembered perhaps at the last moment how narrow an escape he had had of it at sinigaglia and he repaired to siena to join pandolfo petrucci who had been equally fortunate in that connection  to meet the advancing and irresistible duke came ambassadors from perugia with smooth words of welcome the offer of the city and their thanks for his having delivered them of the tyrants that oppressed them and there is not the slightest cause to suppose that this was mere sycophancy for a more bloody murderous crew than these baglioniwhose feuds not only with the rival family of the oddi but among their very selves had more than once embrued the walls of that city in the hillsit would be difficult to find in italy or anywhere in europe the history of the baglioni is one record of slaughter under their rule in perugia human blood seems commonly to have flowed anywhere more freely than in human veins it is no matter for wonder that the people sent their ambassador to thank cesare for having delivered them from the yoke that had oppressed them  perugia having rendered him her oath of fealty the duke left her his secretary agabito gherardi as his commissioner whilst sending vincenzo calmeta to fermooliverottos tyrannyanother state which was very fervent in the thanks it expressed for this deliverance  scarcely was cesare gone from perugia when into the hands of his people fell the person of the lady panthasilea baglioni dalvianothe wife of the famous venetian condottiero bartolomeo dalvianoand they aware of the feelings prevailing between their lord and the government of venice bethought them that here was a valuable hostage so they shut her up in the castle of todi together with her children and the women who had been with her when she was taken  as in the case of dorotea caracciolo the rumour is instantly put about that it was cesare who had seized her that he had taken her to his camp and that this poor woman had fallen a prey to that lustful monster soand in some such wordsran the story and such a hold did it take upon folks credulity that we see piero di bibieno before the council of ten laying a more or less formal charge against the duke in rather broader terms than are here set down so much few of those who have repeated his story omit to tell you but for some reason not obviously apparent they do not think it worth while to add that the doge himselfbetter informed it is clear for he speaks with finality in the matterreproved him by denying the rumour and definitely stating that it was not true as you may read in the diary of marino sanuto that same diary shows you the husbanda person of great consequence in venicebefore the council clamouring for the enlargement of his lady yet never once does he mention the name of valentinois the council of ten sends an envoy to wait upon the pope and the pope expresses his profound regret and his esteem for alviano and informs the envoy that he is writing to valentinois to demand her instant releasein fact shows the envoy the letter  to that same letter the duke replied on january 29 that he had known nothing of the matter until this communication reached him that he has since ascertained that the lady was indeed captured and that she has since been detained in the castle of todi with all the consideration due to her rank and that immediately upon ascertaining this he had commanded that she should be set at liberty which was done  and so the lady panthasilea returned unharmed to her husband  in assisi cesare received the florentine ambassador salviati who came to congratulate the duke upon the affair of sinigaglia and to replace macchiavellithe latter having been ordered home again congratulations indeed were addressed to him by all those powers that had received his official intimation of the event amongst these were the felicitations of the beautiful and accomplished isabella deste marchioness of gonzagawhose relations with him were ever of the friendliest even when faenza by its bravery evoked her pityand with these she sent him for the coming carnival a present of a hundred masks of rare variety and singular beauty because she opined that after the fatigues he had suffered in these glorious enterprises he would desire to contrive for some recreation  here in assisi too he received the siennese envoys who came to wait upon him and he demanded that out of respect for the king of france they should drive out pandolfo petrucci from siena for to use his own words having deprived his enemies of their weapons he would now deprive them of their brain by which he paid petrucci the compliment of accounting him the brain of all that had been attempted against him to show the siennese how much he was in earnest he leaves all baggage and stores at assisi and unhampered makes one of his sudden swoops towards siena pausing on january 13 at castel della pieve to publish at last his treaty with bentivogli the latter being now sincere no doubt out of fear of the consequences of further insincerity at once sends cesare 30 lances and 100 arbalisters under the command of antonio della volta  it was there in assisi on the morning of striking his camp again that cesare completed the work that had been begun at sinigaglia by having paolo orsini and the duke of gravina strangled there was no cause to delay the matter longer he had word from rome of the capture of cardinal orsini of gianbattista da virginio of giacomo di santacroce and rinaldo orsini archbishop of florence  on january 27 pandolfo petrucci being still in siena and cesares patience exhausted he issued an ultimatum from his camp at sartiano in which he declared that if within twentyfour hours petrucci had not been expelled from the city he would loose his soldiers upon siena to devastate the territory and would treat every inhabitant as a pandolfo and an enemy  siena judged it well to bow before that threatening command and cesare seeing himself obeyed was free to depart to rome whither the pope had recalled him and where work awaited him he was required to make an end of the resistance of the barons a task which had been entrusted to his brother giuffredo but which the latter had been unable to carry out  in this matter cesare and his father are said to have violently disagreed and it is reported that high words flew between them for cesarewho looked ahead and had his own future to consider which should extend beyond the lifetime of alexander viwould not move against silvio savelli in palombara nor gian giordano in bracciano alleging as his reason for the latter forbearance that gian giordano being a knight of st michael like himself he was inhibited by the terms of that knighthood from levying war upon him to that he adhered whilst disposing however to lay siege to ceri where giulio and giovanni orsini had taken refuge  in the meantime the cardinal gianbattista orsini had breathed his last in the castle of sant angelo  soderini had written ironically to florence on february 15 cardinal orsini in prison shows signs of frenzy i leave your sublimities to conclude in your wisdom the judgment that is formed of such an illness  it was not however until a week lateron february 22that he succumbed when the cry of poison grew so loud and general that the pope ordered the cardinals body to be carried on a bier with the face exposed that all the world might see its calm and the absence of such stains as were believed usually to accompany venenation  nevertheless the opinion spread that he had been poisonedand the poisoning of cardinal orsini has been included in the long list of the crimes of the borgias with which we have been entertained that the rumour should have spread is not in the least wonderful considering in what bad odour were the orsini at the vatican just then andbe it rememberedwhat provocation they had given although valentinois dubbed pandolfo petrucci the brain of the conspiracy against him the real guiding spirit there can be little doubt was this cardinal orsini in whose stronghold at magione the diet had met to plot valentinoiss ruinthe ruin of the gonfalonier of the church and the fresh alienation from the holy see of the tyrannies which it claimed for its own and which at great cost had been recovered to it  against the pope considered as a temporal ruler that was treason in the highest degree and punishable by death and assuming that alexander did cause the death of cardinal orsini the only just censure that could fall upon him for the deed concerns the means employed yet even against that it might be urged that thus was the dignity of the purple saved the dishonouring touch of the hangmans hands  some six weeks lateron april 10died giovanni michieli cardinal of sant angelo and giustiniani the venetian ambassador wrote to his government that the cardinal had been ill for only two days and that his illness had been attended by violent sickness thisand the reticence of itwas no doubt intended to arouse the suspicion that the cardinal had been poisoned giustiniani adds that michielis house was stripped that very night by the pope who profited thereby to the extent of some 150000 ducats besides plate and other valuables and this was intended to show an indecent eagerness on the popes part to possess himself of that which by the cardinals death he inherited whereas in truth the measure would be one of wise precaution against the customary danger of pillage by the mob  but in march of the year 1504 under the pontificate of julius ii cardinal giuliano della rovere a subdeacon named asquino de colloredo was arrested for defaming the dead cardinal interfector bone memorie cardinalis s angeli1 what other suspicions were entertained against him what other revelations it was hoped to extract from him cannot be said but asquino was put to the question to the usual accompaniment of the torture of the cord and under this he confessed that he had poisoned cardinal michieli constrained to it by pope alexander vi and the duke of valentinois against his will and without reward verumtamen non voluisse et pecunias non habuisse     1  burchards diarium march 6 1504   now if asquino defamed the memory of cardinal michieli it seems to follow naturally that he had hated the cardinal and if we know that he hated him we need not marvel that out of that hatred he poisoned him but something must have been suspected as a motive for his arrest in addition to the slanders he was uttering otherwise how came the questions put to him to be directed so as to wring from him the confession that he had poisoned the cardinal if you choose to believe his further statement that he was constrained to it by pope alexander and the duke of valentinois you are of course at liberty to do so but you will do well first to determine precisely what degree of credit such a man might be worth when seeking to extenuate a fault admitted under pressure of the tortureand offering the extenuation likeliest to gain him the favour of the della rovere pope whose lifes taskas we shall seewas the defamation of the hated borgias you will also do well closely to examine the last part of his confessionthat he was constrained to it against his will and without reward would the deed have been so very much against the will of one who went about publishing his hatred of the dead cardinal by the slanders he emitted  upon such evidence as that the accusation of the popes murder of cardinal michieli has been definitely establishedand it must be admitted that it is if anything rather more evidence than is usually forthcoming of the vampirism and atrocities alleged against him  giustiniani writing to his government in the spring of 1503 informs the council of ten that it is the popes way to fatten his cardinals before disposing of themthat is to say enriching them before poisoning them that he may inherit their possessions it was a wild and sweeping statement dictated by political animus and it has since grown to proportions more monstrous than the original you may read usque ad nauseam of the pope and cesares constant practice of poisoning cardinals who had grown rich for the purpose of seizing their possessions and you are very naturally filled with horror at so much and such abominable turpitude in this matter assertioncoupled with whorling periods of vituperationhave ever been considered by the accusers all that was necessary to establish the accusations it has never for instance been considered necessary to cite the names of the cardinals composing that regiment of victims that of course would be to challenge easy refutation of the wholesale charge and refutation is not desired by those who prefer the sensational manner  the omission may in part at least be repaired by giving a list of the cardinals who died during the eleven years of the pontificate of alexander vi those deaths in eleven years number twentyonerepresenting incidentally a percentage that compares favourably with any other eleven years of any other pontificate or pontificates they are       ardicino della porta           in 1493 at rome      giovanni deconti             in 1493 at rome      domenico della rovere          in 1494 at rome      gonzalo de mendoza            in 1495 in spain      louis andré depinay

   federico casimir              in 1503 in poland  now search as you will not only such contemporary records as diaries chronicles and dispatches from ambassadors in rome during that period of eleven years but also subsequent writings compiled from them and you shall find no breath of scandal attaching to the death of seventeen of those cardinals no suggestion that they died other than natural deaths  four remain cardinals giovanni borgia giuniore gianbattista ferrari cardinal of modena gianbattista orsini and giovanni michieli all of whom the pope and cesare have more or less persistently been accused of poisoning  giovanni borgias death at fossombrone has been dealt with at length in its proper place and it has been shown how utterly malicious and groundless was the accusation  giovanni michielis is the case that has just been reviewed and touching which you may form your own conclusions  gianbattista orsinis also has been examined it rests upon rumour but even if that rumour be true it is unfair to consider the deed in any but the light of a political execution  there remains the case of the cardinal of modena a man who had amassed enormous wealth in the most questionable manner and who was universally execrated the epigrams upon his death in the form of epitaphs dealt most terribly with his ignominious memoryas burchard has it of these the master of ceremonies collected upwards of a score which he gives in his diarium let one suffice here as a fair example of the rest the one that has it that the earth has the cardinals body the bull ie the borgia his wealth and hell his soul       hac janus baptista jacet ferrarius urna      terra habuit corpus bos bona styx animam  the only absolutely contemporary suggestion of his having been poisoned emanated from the pen of that same giustiniani he wrote to the venetian senate to announce the cardinals death on july 20 in his letter he relates how his benefices were immediately distributed and how the lions share fell to the cardinals secretary sebastiano pinzone and that it was said é fama that this man had received them as the price of blood in premium sanguinis since it is held from many evident signs that the cardinal died from poison ex veneno  already on the 11th he had written the cardinal of modena lies ill with little hope of recovery poison is suspected si dubita di veleno  that was penned on the eighth day of the cardinals sickness for he was taken ill on the 3rdas burchard shows burchard further lays before us the whole course of the illness tells us how from the beginning the cardinal refused to be bled or to take medicine of any kind tells us explicitly and positively that the cardinal was suffering from a certain feverso prevalent and deadly in rome during the months of july and august he informs us that on the 11th the day on which giustiniani wrote the abovecited dispatch the fever abated to return on the 16th he was attended burchard continues by many able physicians who strove to induce him to take their medicines but he refused persistently until the following day when he accepted a small proportion of the doses proposed on july 20after an illness of seventeen dayshe finally expired  those entries in the diary of the master of ceremonies constitute an incontrovertible document an irrefutable testimony against the charges of poisoning when taken in conjunction with the evidence of fact afforded by the length of the illness  it is true that under date of november 20 1504 under the pontificate of julius ii there is the following entry  sentence was pronounced in the ruota against sebastiano pinzone apostolic scribe contumaciously absent and he was deprived of all benefices and offices in that he had caused the death of the cardinal of modena his patron who had raised him from the dust  but not even that can shake the conviction that must leap to every honest mind from following the entries in the diary contemporary with the cardinals decease they are too circumstantial and conclusive to be overthrown by this recorded sentence of the ruota two years later against a man who was not even present to defend himself besides it is necessary to discriminate burchard is not stating opinions of his own when he writes in that he caused the death of the cardinal of modena etc he is simplyand obviouslyrecording the finding of the tribunal of the ruota without comment of his own lastly it is as well to observe that in that verdict against pinzoneof doubtful justice as it isthere is no mention made of the borgias  the proceedings instituted against sebastiano pinzone were of a piece with those instituted against asquino de colloredo and others yet to be considered they were set on foot by giuliano della roverethat implacable enemy of the house of borgiawhen he became pope for the purpose of heaping ignominy upon the family of his predecessor but that shall be further dealt with presently  another instance of the unceasing growth of borgia history is afforded in connection with this sebastiano pinzone by dr jacob burckhardt in der cultur der renaissance in italien who in the course of the usual sweeping diatribe against cesare mentions michele da corella his strangler and sebastiano pinzone his poisoner it is an amazing statement for whilst obviously leaning upon giustinianis dispatch for the presumption that pinzone was a poisoner at all he ignores the statement contained in it that pinzone was the secretary and favourite of cardinal ferrari nor troubles to ascertain that the man was never in cesare borgias service at all nor is ever once mentioned anywhere as connected in any capacity whatever with the duke dr burckhardt felt no doubt the necessity of linking pinzone to the borgias that the alleged guilt of the former may recoil upon the latter and so he accomplished it in this facile and irresponsible manner  now notwithstanding the full and circumstantial evidence afforded by burchards diarium of the cardinal of modenas death of a tertian fever the german scholar gregorovius does not hesitate to write of this cardinals death it is certain that it was due to their the borgias infallible white powders  oh the art of writing history in sweeping statements to support a preconceived point of view oh that white powder of the borgias  giovio tells us all about it cantarella he calls itcantharides why cantarella possibly because it is a pleasing mellifluous word that will help a sentence hang together smoothly possibly because the notorious aphrodisiac properties of that drug suggested it to giovio as just the poison to be kept handy by folk addicted to the pursuits which he and others attribute to the borgias can you surmise any better reason for observe that giovio describes the cantarella for youa blunder of his which gives the lie to his statement a white powder of a faint and not unpleasing savour says he and that as you know is nothing like cantharides which is green intensely acrid and burning yet who cares for such discrepancies who will ever question anything that is uttered against a borgia cantarellaa white powder of a faint and not unpleasing savour answers excellently the steady purpose of supporting a defamation and pandering to the tastes of those who like sensations in their readingand so from pen to pen from book to book it leaps as unchallenged as it is impossible  whilst cesares troops were engaged in laying siege to ceri and by engines contrived by leonardo da vinci pressing the defenders so sorely that at the end of a months resistance they surrendered with safeconduct the inimical and everjealous venetians in the north were stirring up what trouble they could chafing under the restraint of france they but sought a pretext that should justify them in the eyes of louis for making war upon cesare and when presently envoys came to lay before the pope the grievance of the republic at the pillage by borgian soldiery of the venetian traders in sinigaglia cesare had no delusions concerning their disposition towards himself  growing uneasy lest they should make this a reason for assailing his frontiers he sent orders north recommending vigilance and instructing his officers to deal severely with all enemies of his state whilst he proceeded to complete the provisions for the government of the romagna to replace the governorgeneral he appointed four seneschals cristoforo della torre for forli faenza and imola hieronimo bonadies for cesena rimini and pesaro andrea cossa for fano sinigaglia fossombrone and pergola and pedro ramires for the duchy of urbino this last was to find a deal of work for his hands for urbino was not yet submissive majolo and s leo still holding for guidobaldo  ramires began by reducing majolo and then proceeded to lay siege to s leo but the castellanone lattanzioencouraged by the assurances given him that the venetians would render guidobaldo assistance to reconquer his dominions resisted stubbornly and was not brought to surrender until the end of june after having held the castle for six months  if venice was jealous and hostile in the north florence was scarcely less so in miditalythough perhaps with rather more justification for cesares growing power and boundless ambition kept the latter republic in perpetual fear of being absorbed into his dominionsinto that kingdom which it was his ultimate aim to found there can be little doubt that francesco da narni who appeared in tuscany early in the march of that year coming from the french court for the purpose of arranging a league of florence bologna siena and luccathe four states more or less under french protectionhad been besought by florence to the obvious end that these four states united might interdefend themselves against valentinois and florence even went so far as to avail herself of this to the extent of restoring pandolfo petrucci to the lordship of sienapreferring even this avowed enemy to the fearful valentinois thus came about petruccis restoration towards the end of march despite the fact that the siennese were divided on the subject of his return  with the single exception of camerino where disturbances still continued all was quiet in the states of the church by that summer of 1503  this desirable state of things had been achieved by cesares wise and liberal government which also sufficed to ensure its continuance  he had successfully combated the threatened famine by importing grain from sicily to sinigagliahis latest conquesthe had accorded as to the other subjected states the privilege of appointing her own native officials with of course the exception of the podestà who never could be a native of any place where he dispensed justice and the castellan in cesena a liberal justice was measured out by the tribunal of the ruota which cesare had instituted there equipping it with the best jurisconsults of the romagna  in rome he proceeded to a military organization on a new basis and with a thoroughness never before seen in italyor elsewhere for that matterbut which was thereafter the example all sought to copy we have seen him issuing an edict that every house in the romagna should furnish him one manatarms to serve him when necessary the men so levied were under obligation to repair to the marketplace of their native town when summoned thither by the ringing of the bells and it was estimated that this method of conscription would yield him six or seven thousand men who could be mobilized in a couple of days he increased the number of arquebusiers appreciating the power and value of a weapon whichalthough invented nearly a century earlierwas still regarded with suspicion he was also the inventor of the military uniform putting his soldiers into a livery of his own and causing his menatarms to wear over their armour a smock quartered red and yellow with the name cesare lettered on the breast and back whilst the gentlemen of his guard wore surcoats of his colours in gold brocade and crimson velvet  he continued to levy troops and to arm them and it is scarcely overstating the case to say that hardly a tyrant of the romagna would have dared to do so much for fear of the weapons being turned against himself cesare knew no such fear he enjoyed a loyalty from the people he had subjected which was almost unprecedented in italy the very officers he placed in command of the troops of his levying were for the most part natives of the romagna is there no inference concerning him to be drawn from that  for every man in his service cesare ordered a backandbreast and headpiece of steel and the armourers shops of brescia rang busily that summer with the clang of metal upon metal as that defensive armour for cesares troops was being forged at the same time the foundries were turning out fresh cannon in that season which saw cesare at the very height and zenith of his power although he himself may not have accounted that as yet he was further than at the beginning  but the catastrophe that was to hurl him irretrievably from the eminence to which in three short years he had climbed was approaching with stealthy relentless foot and was even now upon him     book iv the bull cadent  cesar borgia che era della gente per armi e per virtú tenuto un sole mancar dovendo andó dove andar sole phebo verso la sera al occidente  girolamo casioepitaffi     chapter i the death of alexander vi   unfortunate naples was a battlefield once more france and spain were engaged there in a war whose details belong elsewhere  to the aid of france which was hard beset and with whose arms things were going none too well cesare was summoned to fulfil the obligations under which he was placed by virtue of his treaty with king louis  rumours were rife that he was negotiating secretly with gonzalo de cordoba the great captain and the truth of whether or not he was guilty of so base a treachery has never been discovered these rumours had been abroad since may and if not arising out of they were certainly stimulated by an edict published by valentinois concerning the papal chamberlain francesco troche in this edict cesare enjoined all subjects of the holy see to arrest wherever found this man who had fled from rome and whose flight was concerned with something against the honour of the king of france  francesco troche had been alexanders confidential chamberlain and secretary he had been a diligent servant of the house of borgia and when in france had acted as a spy for valentinois keeping the duke supplied with valuable information at a critical time as we have seen  villari says of him that he was one of the borgias most trusted assassins that he has never been so much as alleged to have murdered anyone does not signify he was a servanta trusted servantof the borgias therefore the title of assassin is ipso facto to be bestowed upon him  the flight of a man holding such an intimate position as troches was naturally a subject of much speculation and gossip but a matter upon which there was no knowledge valentinois was ever secret in common with his fatherthough hardly in so marked a degree and if we except the case of the scurrilous letter to silvio savellihe showed a contemptuous indifference to public opinion on the whole which is invested almost with a certain greatness at least it is rarely other than with greatness that we find such an indifference associated it was not for him to take the world into his confidence in matters with which the world was not concerned let the scandalmongers draw what inferences they pleased it was a lofty and dignified procedure but one that was fraught with peril and the borgias have never ceased to pay the price of that excessive dignity of reserve for tongues must be wagging and where knowledge is lacking speculation will soon usurp its place and presently be invested with all the authority of fact  out of surmises touching that matter which concerned the honour of the king of france grew presentlyand contradictorilythe rumour that troche was gone to betray to france valentinoiss intention of going over to the spanish side a motive was certainly required to account for troches action but the invention of motives does not appear ever to have troubled the cinquecentist  it was now said that troche was enraged at having been omitted from the list of cardinals to be created at the forthcoming consistory it is all mystery even to the end he made for whereas some said that after being seized on board a ship that was bound for corsica troche in his despair threw himself overboard and was drowned others reported that he was brought back to rome and strangled in a prison in trastevere  the following questions crave answer  if it was troches design to betray such a treachery of the borgias against france what was he doing on board a vessel bound for corsica a fortnight after his flight from rome would not his proper goal have been the french camp in naples which he could have reached in a quarter of that time and where not only could he have vented his desire for vengeance by betraying alexander and valentinois but he could further have found complete protection from pursuit  it is idle and unprofitable to dwell further upon the end of francesco troche the matter is a complete mystery and whilst theory is very well as theory it is dangerous to cause it to fill the place of fact  troche was drowned or was strangled as a consequence of his having fled out of motives that were against the honour of the king of france and straightway the rumour spread of valentinoiss intended treachery and the rumour was kept alive and swelled by venice and florence in pursuit of their neverceasing policy of discrediting cesare with king louis to the end that they might encompass his expedient ruin  the lie was given to them to no small extent by the pope when in the consistory of july 28 he announced cesares departure to join the french army in naples with five hundred horse and two thousand foot assembled for the purpose  for this cesare made now his preparations and on the eve of departure he went with his fatheron the evening of august 5to sup at the villa of cardinal adriano corneto outside rome  once before we have seen him supping at a villa of the suburra on the eve of setting out for naples and we know the tragedy that followeda tragedy which he has been accused of having brought about here again in a villa of the suburra at a supper on the eve of setting out for naples death was the unseen guest  they stayed late at the vineyard of cardinal corneto enjoying the treacherous cool of the evening breathing the death that was omnipresent in rome that summer the pestilential fever which had smitten cardinal giovanni borgia seniore on the 1st of that month and of which men were dying every day in the most alarming numbers  on the morning of saturday 12 burchard tells us the pope felt ill and that evening he was taken with fever on the 15th burchard records that he was bled thirteen ounces of blood being taken from him it relieved him somewhat and seeking distraction he bade some of the cardinals to come and sit by his bed and play at cards  meanwhile cesare was also stricken and in him the fever raged so fierce and violently that he had himself immersed to the neck in a huge jar of icecold watera drastic treatment in consequence of which he came to shed all the skin from his body  on the 17th the pope was much worse and on the 18th the end being at hand he was confessed by the bishop of culm who administered extreme unction and that evening he died  that beyond all manner of question is the true story of the passing of alexander vi as revealed by the diarium of burchard by the testimony of the physician who attended him and by the dispatches of the venetian ferrarese and florentine ambassadors at this time of day it is accepted by all serious historians compelled to it by the burden of evidence  the ambassador of ferrara had written to duke ercole on august 14 that it was no wonder the pope and the duke were ill as nearly everybody in rome was ill as a consequence of the bad air per la mala condictione de aere  cardinal soderini was also stricken with the fever whilst corneto was taken ill on the day after that supperparty and like cesare is said to have shed all the skin of his body before he recovered  even villari and gregorovius so unrestrained when writing of the borgias discard the extraordinary and utterly unwarranted stories of guicciardini giovio and bembo which will presently be considered gregorovius does this with a reluctance that is almost amusing and with many a fond regretful backward glanceso very apparent in his mannerat the tale of villainy as told by guicciardini and the others which the german scholar would have adopted but that he dared not for his credits sake this is not stated on mere assumption it is obvious to any one who reads gregoroviuss histories  burchard tells usas certainly matter for commentthat during his last illness alexander never once asked for cesare nor ever once mentioned the name of lucrezia so far as cesare is concerned the pope knew no doubt that he was ill and bedridden for all that the gravity of the dukes condition would probably have been concealed from him that he should not have mentioned lucrezianor we suppose giuffredois remarkable did he with the hand of death already upon him reproach himself with this paternity which however usual and commonplace in priests of all degrees was none the less a scandal and the more scandalous in a measure as the rank of the offender was higher it may well be that in those last days that sinful worldly old man bethought him of the true scope and meaning of christs vicarship which he had so wantonly abused and dishonoured and considered that to that judge before whom he was summoned to appear the sins of his predecessors would be no justification or mitigation of his own it may well be that grown introspective upon his bed of death he tardily sought to thrust from his mind the worldly things that had so absorbed it until the spiritual were forgotten and had given rise to all the scandal concerning him that was spread through christendom to the shame and dishonour of the church whose champion he should have been  thus may it have come to pass that he summoned none of his children in his last hours nor suffered their names to cross his lips  when the news of his fathers death was brought to cesare the duke all feverracked as he was more dead than living considered his position and issued his orders to michele da corella that most faithful of all his captains who so richly shared with cesare the execration of the latters enemies  of tears for his father there is no record just as at no time are we allowed to see that stern spirit giving way to any emotion conceiving any affection or working ever for the good of any but himself besides in such an hour as this the consciousness of the danger in which he stood by virtue of the popes death and his own most inopportune sickness which disabled him from taking action to make his future secure must have concerned him to the exclusion of all else  meanwhile however rome was quiet held so in the iron grip of michele da corella and the ducal troops the popes death was being kept secret for the moment and was not announced to the people until nightfall by when corella had carried out his masters orders including the seizure of the popes treasure and burchard tells us how some of valentinoiss men entered the vaticanall the gates of which were held by the ducal troopsand seizing cardinal casanova they demanded with a dagger at his throat and a threat to fling his corpse from the windows if he refused them the popes keys these the cardinal surrendered and corella possessed himself of plate and jewels to the value of some 200000 ducats besides two caskets containing about 100000 ducats in gold thereafter the servants of the palace completed the pillage by ransacking the wardrobes and taking all they could find so that nothing was left in the papal apartments but the chairs a few cushions and the tapestries of the walls  all his life alexander had been the victim of the most ribald calumnies stories had ever sprung up and thriven like ill weeds about his name and reputation his sins great and scandalous in themselves were swelled by popular rumour under the spur of malice to monstrous and incredible proportions as they had exaggerated and lied about the manner of his life sowith a consistency worthy of better scopethey exaggerated and lied about the manner of his death and the age being a credulous one the stories were such that writers of more modern and less credulous times dare not insist upon them lest they should discreditas they dowhat else has been alleged against him  thus when in his last delirium the pope uttered some such words as i am coming i am coming it is just but wait a little and when those words were repeated it was straightway asserted that the devil was the being he thus addressed in that supreme hour the story grew in detail that is inevitable with such matter he had bargained with the devil it was said for a pontificate of twelve years and the time being completed the devil was come for him and presently we even have a description of messer the devil as he appeared on that occasionin the shape of a baboon the marquis gonzaga of mantua in all seriousness writes to relate this the chronicler sanuto receiving the now popularly current story from another source in all seriousness gives it place in his diarii thus  the devil was seen to leap out of the room in the shape of a baboon and a cardinal ran to seize him and having caught him would have presented him to the pope but the pope said let him go let him go it is the devil and that night he fell ill and died1     1  il diavolo sarebbe saltato fuori della camera in forma di babuino et un cardinale corso per piarlo e preso volendolo presentar al papa il papa disse lasolo lasolo ché ii diavolo e poi la notte si amaló e moritemarino sanuto diarii   that story transcending the things which this more practical age considers possible is universally rejected but it is of vast importance to the historical student for it is to be borne in mind that it finds a place in the pages of those same diarii upon the authority of which are accepted many defamatory stories without regard to their extreme improbability so long as they are within the bounds of bare possibility  after alexander was dead it was said that water boiled in his mouth and that steam issued from it as he lay in st peters and much else of the same sort which the known laws of physiology compel so many of us very reluctantly to account exaggerations but again remember that the source of these stories was the same as the source of many other exaggerations not at issue with physiological laws  the circumstances of alexanders funeral are in the highest degree scandalous and reflect the greatest discredit upon his age  on the morrow as the clergy were chanting the libera me domine in st peters where the body was exposed on a catafalque in full pontificals a riot occurred set on foot by the soldiers present for reasons which burchardwho records the eventdoes not make clear  the clerics fled for shelter to the sacristy the chants were cut short and the popes body almost entirely abandoned  but the most scandalous happening occurred twentyfour hours later the popes remains were removed to the chapel of santa maria delle febbre by six bearers who laughed and jested at the expense of the poor corpse which was in case to provoke the coarse mirth of the lower classes of an age which setting no value upon human life knew no respect for death by virtue of the malady that had killed him of his plethoric habit of body and of the sweltering august heat the corpse was decomposing rapidly so that the face had become almost black and assumed an aspect grotesquely horrible fully described by burchard  factus est sicut pannus vel morus nigerrimus livoris totus plenus nasus plenus os amplissimum lingua duplex in ore que labia tota implebat os apertum et adeo horribile quod nemo viderit unquam vel esse tale dixerit  two carpenters waited in the chapel with the coffin which they had brought but either through carelessness it had been made too narrow and too short or else the body owing to its swollen condition did not readily fit into this receptable whereupon removing the mitre for which there was no room they replaced it by a piece of old carpet and set themselves to force and pound the corpse into the coffin and this was done without candle or any light being burned in honour of the dead and without the presence of any priest or other person to care for the popes remains no explanation of this is forthcoming it was probably due to the panic earlier occasioned the clergy by the ducal menatarms  the story that he had been poisoned was already spreading like a conflagration through rome arising out of the appearance of the body which was such as was popularly associated with venenation  but a borgia in the rôle of a victim was altogether too unusual to be acceptable and too much opposed to the taste to which the public had been educated so the story must be edited and modified until suitable for popular consumption the supperparty at cardinal cornetos villa was remembered and upon that a tale was founded and trimmed by degrees into plausible shape  alexander had intended to poison cornetoso ran this talethat he might possess himself of the cardinals vast riches in the main a wellworn story by now to this end cesare had bribed a butler to pour wine for the cardinal from a flask which he entrusted to him exit cesare exit presently the butler carelessly leaving the poisoned wine upon a buffet the drama you will observe is perfectly mechanical full of authors interventions and elementary in its preparations enter the pope he thirsts and calls for wine a servant hastens takes up of course the poisoned flask in ignorance of its true quality and pours for his beatitude whilst the pope drinks reenters cesare also athirst and seating himself he joins the pope in the poisoned wine all unsuspicious and having taken no precautions to mark the flask poetic justice is done and down comes the curtain upon that preposterous tragifarce  such is the story which guicciardini and giovio and a host of other more or less eminent historians have had the audacity to lay before their readers as being the true circumstances of the death of alexander vi  it is a noteworthy matter that in all that concerns the history of the house of borgia and more particularly those incidents in it that are wrapped in mystery circumstantial elucidation has a habit of proceeding from the same quarters  you will remember for instance that the venetian paolo capello though not in rome at the time was one of those who was best informed in the matter of the murder of the duke of gandia and it was capello again who was possessed of the complete details of the scarcely less mysterious business of alfonso of aragon another who on the subject of the murder of gandia had no doubtsas he himself expressed itwas pietro martire danghiera in spain at the time whence he wrote to inform italy of the true circumstances of a case that had happened in italy  it is again pietro martire danghiera who on november 10 1503 writes from burgos in spain to inform rome of the true facts of alexanders deathfor it is in that letter of his that the tale of the flask of wine as here set down finds place for the first time  it is unprofitable to pursue the matter further since at this time of day even the most reluctant to reject anything that tells against a borgia have been compelled to admit that the burden of evidence is altogether too overwhelming in this instance and that it is proved to the hilt that alexander died of the tertian fever then ravaging rome  and just as the popes death was the subject of the wildest fictions which have survived until very recent days so too was cesares recovery  again it was the same pietro martire danghiera who from burgos wrote to inform rome of what was taking place in the privacy of the duke of valentinoiss apartments in the vatican under his facile and magic pen the jar of icecold water into which cesare was believed to have been plunged was transmuted into a mule which was ripped open that the feverstricken cesare might be packed into the pulsating entrails there to sweat the fever out of him  but so poor and sexless a beast as this seeming in the popular mind inadequate to a man of cesares mettle it presently improved upon and converted it into a bullso much more appropriate too as being the emblem of his house  nor does it seem that even then the story has gone far enough facilis inventis addere there comes a french writer with an essay on the borgias than whichsubmitted as sober factnothing more amazingly lurid has been written in this with a suggestive cleverness entirely gallic he causes us to gather an impression of cesare in the intestinal sudatorium of that eventrated bull as of one who is at once the hierophant and devotee of a monstrous foul and unclean rite of some unspeakable religiona rite by comparison with which the black mass of the abbé gribourg becomes a sweet and wholesome thing  but hear the man himself  cet homme de meurtres et dinceste incarné dans lanimal des hécatombes et des bestialités antiques en évoque les monstrueuses images je crois entendre le taureau de phalaris et le taureau de pasiphaë répondre de loin par deffrayants mugissements aux cris humains de ce bucentaure  that is the top note on this subject hereafter all must pale to anticlimax     chapter ii pius iii   the fever that racked cesare borgias body in those days can have been as nothing to the fever that racked his mind the despairing rage that must have whelmed his soul to see the unexpectedthe one contingency against which he had not providedcutting the very ground from underneath his feet  as he afterwards expressed himself to macchiavelli and as macchiavelli has left on record cesare had thought of everything had provided for everything that might happen on his fathers death save that in such a seasonwhen more than ever he should have need for all his strength of body and of mindhe should himself be lying at the point of death  scarce was alexanders body cold than the dukes enemies began to lift their heads already by the 20th of that monthtwo days after the pope had breathed his lastthe orsini were in arms and had led a rising in retort to which michele da corella fired their palace on montegiordano  venice and florence bethought them that the protection of france had been expressly for the church and not for cesare personally so the venetians at once supplied guidobaldo da montefeltre with troops wherewith to reconquer his dominions and by the 24th he was master of s leo in the city of urbino itself ramires the governor held out as long as possible then beat a retreat to cesena whilst valentinoiss partisans in urbino were mercilessly slaughtered and their houses pillaged  florence supported the baglioni in the conquest of magione from the borgias and they aided giacopo dappiano to repossess himself of piombino which had so gladly seen him depart out of it eighteen months ago  from magione gianpaolo baglioni marches his florentine troops to camerino to aid the only remaining varano to regain the tyranny of his fathers the vitelli are back in città di castello carrying a golden calf in triumph through the streets and so by the end of august within less than a fortnight all the appendages of the romagna are lost to cesare whilst at cesares very gates the orsini menatarms are clamouring with insistent menace  the dukes best friend in that crisis was his secretary agabito gherardi for it is eminently probableas alvisi opinesthat it was gherardi who urged his master to make an alliance with the colonna gherardi himself being related to that powerful family the alliance of these old enemiescolonna and borgiawas in their common interests that they might stand against their common enemy orsinithe old friends of the borgias  on august 22 prospero colonna came to rome and terms were made and cemented in the usual manner by a betrothalthat of the little rodrigolucrezias childto a daughter of the house of colonna on the same day the sacred college confirmed cesare in his office of captaingeneral and gonfalonier of the church pending the election of a new pope  meanwhile sick almost to the point of death and scarce able to stir hand or foot so weak in body had he been left by the heroic treatment to which he had submitted cesare continued mentally a miracle of energy and selfpossession he issued orders for the fortifying of the vatican and summoned from romagna 200 horse and 1000 foot to his aid in rome bidding remolino who brought these troops to quarter himself at orvieto and there await his further orders  considering that the colonna were fighting in naples under the banner of gonzalo de cordoba it was naturally enough supposed from cesares alliance with the former that this time he was resolved to go over to the side of spain of this m de trans came to protest to valentinois on behalf of louis xii to be answered by the dukes assurances that the alliance into which he had entered was strictly confined to the colonna that it entailed no treaty with spain nor had he entered into any that his loyalty to the king of france continued unimpaired and that he was ready to support king louis with the entire forces he disposed of whenever his majesty should desire him so to do in reply he was assured by the french ambassador and cardinal sanseverino of the continued protection of louis and that france would aid him to maintain his dominions in italy and reconquer any that might have seceded and of this declaration copies were sent to florence venice and bologna on september 1 as a warning to those powers not to engage in anything to the hurt of valentinois  thus sped the time of the novendialithe nine days obsequies of the dead popewhich were commenced on september 4  as during the conclave that was immediately to follow it was against the law for armed men to be in rome cesare was desired by the sacred college to withdraw his troops he did so on september 2 and himself went with them  cardinal sanseverino and the french ambassador escorted him out of rome and saw him take the road to nepia weak feverravaged emaciated man borne in a litter by a dozen of his halberdiers his youth his beauty his matchless strength of body all sapped from him by the insidious disease which had but grudgingly spared his very life  at nepi he was awaited by his brother giuffredo who had preceded him thither from rome a shadowy personage this giuffredo whose unimportant personality is tantalizingly elusive in the pages where mention is made of him his incontinent wife doña sancia had gone to naples under the escort of prospero colonna having left the castle of sant angelo where for some time she had been confined by order of her fatherinlaw the pope on account of the disorders of her frivolous life  and now the advices of the fresh treaty between cesare borgia and the king of france were producing their effect upon venice and florence who were given additional pause by the fierce jealousy of each other which was second only to their jealousy of the duke  from venicewith or without the sanction of his governmentbartolomeo dalviano had ridden south into the romagna with his condotta immediately upon receiving news of the death of alexander and finding pandolfaccio malatesta at ravenna he proceeded to accompany him back to that rimini which the tyrant had sold to cesare rimini however refused to receive him back and showed fight to the forces under dalviano so that for the moment nothing was accomplished whereupon the republic which at first had raised a feeble makebelieve protest at the action of her condottiero now deemed it as well to find a pretext for supporting him so venice alleged that a courier of hers had been stripped of a letter and with such an overwhelming cause as that for hostilities dispatched reinforcements to dalviano to the end that he might restore pandolfaccio to a dominion in which he was abhorred further dalviano was thereafter to proceed to do the like office for giovanni sforza who already had taken ship for pesaro and who was restored to his lordship on september 3  thence carrying the war into the romagna itself dalviano marched upon cesena but the romagna was staunch and loyal to her duke the governor had shut himself up in cesena with what troops he could muster including a thousand veterans under the valiant dionigio di naldo and there standing firm and resolute he awaited the onslaught of the venetians  dalviano advanced rapidly and cruelly a devastator laying waste the country in his passage until to check him came suddenly the borgia troops which had ventured upon a sally the venetians were routed and put to flight  on september 16 the restored tyrants of rimini pesaro castello perugia camerino urbino and sinigaglia entered into and signed at perugia a league whose chiefs were bartolomeo dalviano and gianpaolo baglioni for their common protection  florence was invited to join the allies intimidated however by france not only did the signory refuse to be included butin her usual manneractually went so far as to advise cesare borgia of that refusal and to offer him her services and help  on the same date the sacred college assembled in rome at the mass of the holy spirit to beseech the grace of inspiration in the election of the new pontiff the part usually played by the divine afflatus in these matters was so fully understood and appreciated that the venetian ambassador received instructions from the republic1 to order the venetian cardinals to vote for giuliano della rovere whilst the king of france sent a letterin his own handto the sacred college desiring it to elect his friend the cardinal damboise and spain at the same time sought to influence the election of carvajal     1  see sanutos diarrii   the chances of the lastnamed do not appear ever to have amounted to very much the three best supported candidates were della rovere damboise and ascanio sforzawho made his reappearance in rome released from his french prison at last in time to attend this conclave  none of these three factions was strong enough to ensure the election of its own candidate but any two were strong enough to prevent the election of the candidate of the third wherefore it happened that as a result of so much jealousy and competition recourse was had to temporizing by electing the oldest and feeblest cardinal in the college thus there should presently be another election and meantime the candidates would improve the time by making their arrangements and canvassing their supporters so as to control the votes of the college at that future conclave therefore francesco piccolomini cardinal of siena nephew of pius ii a feeble octogenarian tormented by an ulcer which in conjunction with an incompetent physician was to cut his life even shorter than they hoped was placed upon the throne of st peter and assumed with the pontificate the name of pius iii  the new pope was entirely favourable to cesare borgia and confirmed him in all his offices signifying his displeasure to venice at her attempt upon the romagna and issuing briefs to the allied tyrants commanding them to desist from their opposition to the will of the holy see  cesare returned to rome still weak on his legs and ghastly to behold and on october 6 he received in st peters his confirmation as captaingeneral and gonfalonier of the church  the venetians had meanwhile been checked by a letter from louis from lending further assistance to the allies the latter however continued their hostilities in spite of that they had captured sinigaglia and now they made an attempt on fano and fermo but were repulsed in both places by cesares loyal subjects at the same time the ordelaffiwho in the old days had been deposed from the tyranny of forli to make room for the riariideemed the opportunity a good one to attempt to regain their lordship but their attempt too was frustrated  cesare sat impotent in rome no doubt vexed by his own inaction he cannot have lacked the will to go to the romagna to support the subjects who showed him such loyalty but he lacked the means owing to the french and spanish dispute in naples his army had practically melted away the terms of his treaty with louis compelled him to send the bulk of it to the camp at garigliano to support the french who were in trouble the force that remolino had quartered at orvieto to await the dukes orders he had been unable to retain there growing uneasy at their position and finding it impossible either to advance or to retreat being threatened on the one side by the baglioni and on the other by the orsini these troops had steadily deserted whilst most of cesares spanish captains and their followers had gone to the aid of their compatriots under gonzalo de cordoba in response to that captains summons of every spaniard in the peninsula  thus did it come about that cesare had no force to afford his romagna subjects his commissioners in the north did what was possible to repair the damage effected by the allies and they sent dionigio di naldo with six hundred of his foot and further a condotta of two hundred horse against rimini this was captured by them in one day and almost without resistance pandolfaccio flying for his life to pesaro  next the allies by attempting to avenge the rout they had suffered at cesena afforded the ducal troops an opportunity of scoring another victory they prepared a second attack against cesares capital and with an army of considerable strength they advanced to the very walls of the stronghold laying the aqueduct in ruins and dismantling what other buildings they found in their way but in cesena the gallant pedro ramires lay in wait for them issuing to meet them he not only put them to flight and drove them for shelter into the fortress of montebello but laid siege to them there and broke them utterly with a loss as was reputed of some three hundred men in slain alone  the news of this came to cheer valentinois who moreover had now the pope and france to depend upon further and in view of that same protection the orsini were already treating with him for a reconciliation despite the fact that the orsini blood was scarce dry upon his hands but he had a resolute sly and desperate enemy in venice and on october 10 there arrived in rome bartolomeo dalviano and gianpaolo baglioni who repaired to the venetian ambassador and informed him that they were come in quest of the person of valentinois intending his death  to achieve their ends they united themselves to the orsini who were now in arms in rome their attempted reconciliation with cesare having aborted valentinoiss peril became imminent and from the vatican he withdrew for shelter to the castle of sant angelo going by way of the underground passage built by his father  thence he summoned michele da corella who was at rocca soriana with his foot and taddeo della volpe a valiant captain and a great fighter who had already lost an eye in cesares service and baldassare scipione who were in the neapolitan territory with their menatarms he was gathering his sinews for a spring when suddenly the entire face of affairs was altered and all plans were checked by the death of pius iii on october 18 after a reign of twentysix days  once more there was an end to cesares credit no man might say what the future held in store giustiniani indeed wrote to his government that cesare was about to withdraw to france and that he had besought a safeconduct of the orsiniwhich report is as true as many another communication from the same venetian pen ever ready to write what it hoped might be true and it is flatly contradicted by the betterinformed macchiavelli who was writing at the same time  the duke is in sant angelo and is more hopeful than ever of accomplishing great things presupposing a pope according to the wishes of his friends  but the romagna was stirred once more to the turbulence from which it had scarcely settled forli and rimini were lost almost at once the ordelaffi succeeding in capturing the former in this their second attempt whilst pandolfaccio once more sat in his palace at rimini having cut his way to it through a sturdy resistance against imola bentivogli dispatched a force of two thousand foot but this was beaten off  the authority of france appeared to have lost its weight and in vain did cardinal damboise thunder threats in the name of his friend king louis and send envoys to florence venice bologna and urbino to complain of the injuries that were being done to the duke of valentinois     chapter iii julius ii   giuliano della rovere cardinal of s pietro in vincoli had much in his character that was reminiscent of his terrible uncle sixtus iv like that uncle of his he had many failings highly unbecoming any christianlaic or ecclesiasticwhich no one has attempted to screen and incidentally he cultivated morality in his private life and observed his priestly vows of chastity as little as did any other churchman of his day for you may see him through the eyes of paride de grassi1 unable one good friday to remove his shoes for the adoration of the cross in consequence of his foots afflictionex morbo gallico but with one great and splendid virtue was he endowed in the eyes of the enemies of the house of borgiacontemporary and subsequent down to our timesa most profound unchristian and mordacious hatred of all borgias     1 burchards successor in the office of master of ceremonies   roderigo borgia had defeated him in the conclave of 1492 and for twelve years had kept him out of the coveted pontificate you have seen how he found expression for his furious jealousy at his rivals success you have seen him endeavouring to his utmost to accomplish the deposition of the borgia pope wielding to that end the lever of simony and seeking a fulcrum for it first in the king of france and later in ferdinand and isabella but failing hopelessly in both instances you have seen him when he realized the failure of an attempt which had made rome too dangerous for him and compelled him to remain in exile suddenly veering round to fawn and flatter and win the friendship of one whom his enmity could not touch  this man who as julius ii was presently to succeed pius iii has been accounted a shining light of virtue amid the dark turpitude of the church in the renaissance an ignis fatuus perhaps a jackolanthorn begotten of putrescence surely no more than that  dr jacob burckhardt in that able work of his to which reference already has been made follows the wellworn path of unrestrained invective against the borgias giving to the usual empty assertions the place which should be assigned to evidence and argument like his predecessors along that path he causes giuliano della rovere to shine heroically by contrasta foil to throw into greater relief the blackness of alexander but he carries assertion rather further than do others when he says of cardinal della rovere that he ascended the steps of st peters chair without simony and amid general applause and with him ceased at all events the undisguised traffic in the highest offices of the church  other writers in plenty have suggested this but none has quite so plainly and resoundingly thrown down the gauntlet which we will make bold to lift  that dr burckhardt wrote in other than good faith is not to be imputed it must therefore follow that an entry in the diarium of the caerimoniarius under date of october 29 1503 escaped him utterly in the course of his researches for the diarium informs us that on that day in the apostolic palace giuliano della rovere cardinal of s pietro in vincoli concluded the terms of an agreement with the duke of valentinois and the latters following of spanish cardinals by which he undertook that in consideration of his receiving the votes of these spanish cardinals and being elected pope he would confirm cesare in his office of gonfalonier and captaingeneral and would preserve him in the dominion of the romagna and in consideration of that undertaking the spanish cardinals on their side promised to give him their suffrages  here are the precise words in which burchard records the transaction  eadem die 29 octobris rmus d s petri ad vincula venit in palatio apostolico cum duce valentino et cardinalibus suis hispanis et concluserunt capitula eorum per que inter alia cardinalis s petri ad vincula postquam esset papa crearet confalonierium ecclesiae generalem ducem ac ei faveret et in statibus suis relinqueret et vice versa dux pape et promiserunt omnes cardinalis hispani dare votum pro cardinali s petri ad vincula ad papatum  if that does not entail simony and sacrilege then such things do not exist at all more you shall hunt in vain for any accusation so authoritative formal and complete regarding the simony practised by alexander vi on his election and this same julius moreover was the pope who later was to launch his famous bull de simoniaca electione to add another stain to the besmirched escutcheon of the borgia pontiff  his conciliation of cesare and his obtaining thus the support of the spanish cardinals who being alexanders creatures were now cesares very faithful servants ensured the election of della rovere for whilst those cardinals votes did not suffice to place him in st peters chair they would abundantly have sufficed to have kept him out of it had cesare so desired them  in coming to terms with cardinal della rovere cesare made the first great mistake of his career took the first step towards ruin he should have known better than to have trusted such a man he should have remembered the ancient bitter rancour should have recognized in the amity of later times the amity of the selfseeker and mistrusted it but della rovere had acquired a reputation for honesty and for being a man of his word how far he deserved it you may judge from what is presently to follow he had acquired it however and cesare to his undoing attached faith to that reputation he may to some extent have counted upon the fact that of cardinal della roveres bastard children only a daughterfelice della roveresurvived raffaele the last of his bastard boys had died a year ago thus cesare may have concluded that the cardinal having no sons whose fortunes he must advance would lack temptation to break faith with him  from all this it resulted that at the conclave of november 1 giuliano della rovere was elected pope and took the name of julius ii whilst valentinois confident now that his future was assured left the castle of sant angelo to take up his residence at the vatican in the belvedere with forty gentlemen constituting his suite  on november 3 julius ii issued briefs to the romagna ordering obedience to cesare with whom he was now in daily and friendliest intercourse  in the romagna meanwhile the disturbances had not only continued but they had taken a fresh turn venice having reseated malatesta on the throne now vented at last the covetousness she had ever herself manifested of that dominion and sent a force to drive him out again and conquer rimini for the republic  florence in a spasm of jealous anger at this inquired was the pope to become the chaplain of venice and dispatched macchiavelli to bear the tale of these doings to julius  under so much perpetual strife the strength of the romagna was gradually crumbling and cesare angry with florence for never going beyond lipservice expressed that anger to macchiavelli informing the ambassador that the signory could have saved the romagna for him with a hundred menatarms  the duke sent for giustiniani the ambassador of venice who however excused himself and did not go this within a week of the new popes election showing already how men discerned what was in store for valentinois giustiniani wrote to his government that he had not gone lest his going should give the duke importance in the eyes of others1 the pettiness and meanness of the man revealed in that dispatch will enable you to attach to giustiniani the label that belongs to him     1  per non dar materia ad altri che fazino un po di lui mazor estimazion di quel che fanno quando lo vedessero in parte alcuna favoritogiustiniani dispatch of november 6 1503   to cheer valentinois in those days of depression came news that his subjects of imola had successfully resisted an attack on the part of the venetians so stimulated was he that he prepared at once to go himself into the romagna and obtained from the pope from damboise and from soderini letters to florence desiring the signory to afford him safeconduct through tuscany for himself and his army  the pope expressed himself in his letter that he would count such safeconduct as a great favour to himself and urged the granting of it out of his love for cesare owing to the latters great virtues and shining merits2 yet on the morrow of dispatching that brief this man who was accounted honest straightforward and imbued with a love of truth informed giustinianior else giustiniani lied in his dispatchesthat he understood that the venetians were assailing the romagna not out of enmity to the church but to punish the demerits of cesare and he made it plain to giustiniani that if he complained of the conduct of the venetians it was on his own behalf and not on cesares as his aim was to preserve the romagna not for the duke but for the church     2  in quo nobis rem gratissimam facietis ducis enim ipsum propter ejus insignes virtutes et praeclara merita praecipuo affectur et caritate praecipua complectimurarchivio di stato firenze see alvisi doct 96   with the aim we have no quarrel it was laudable enough in a pontiff but it foreshadows cesares ruin in spite of the loveprotesting letter to florence in spite of the bargain struck by virtue of which julius had obtained the pontificate whether the pope went further in his treachery whether having dispatched that brief to florence he sent other communications to the signory is not ascertainable but the suspicion of some such secret action is inspired by what ensued  on november 13 cesare was ready to leave rome but no safeconduct had arrived out of all patience at this he begged the pope that the captain of the pontifical navy should prepare him five galleons at ostia by which he could take his foot to genoa and thence proceed into romagna by way of ferrara  macchiavelli at the same time was frenziedly importuning florence to grant the duke the desired safeconduct lest in despair cesare should make a treaty with veniceor with the deviland should go to pisa employing all his money strength and influence to vent his wrath upon the signory but the signory knew more perhaps than did macchiavelli for no attention was paid to his urgent advice  on the 19th cesare left rome to set out for genoa by way of ostia and his departure threw giustiniani into alarmfearing that the duke would now escape  but there was no occasion for his fears on the very day of cesares departure julius sent fresh briefs to the romagna different indeed from those of november 3 in these he now expressed his disapproval of alexanders having conferred the vicarship of the romagna upon cesare borgia and he exhorted all to range themselves under the banner of the church under whose protection he intended to keep them  events followed quickly upon that two days later news reached the pope that the venetians had captured faenza whereupon he sent a messenger after valentinois to suggest to the latter that he should surrender forli and the other fiefs into pontifical hands with this cesare refused to comply and as a result he was detained by the captain of the navy in obedience to the instructions from julius at the same time the pope broke the last link of the treaty with cesare by appointing a new governor of romagna in the person of giovanni sacchi bishop of ragusa he commanded the latter to take possession of the romagna in the name of the church and he issued another briefthe third within three weeksdemanding the states obedience to the new governor  on november 26 remolino who had been at ostia with cesar came to rome and throwing himself at the feet of the pontiff begged for mercy for his lord whom he now accounted lost he promised julius that cesare should give him the countersigns of the strongholds together with security for their surrender this being all that the pope could desire he issued orders that cesare be brought back to rome and in consistory advised the sacred collegeby way no doubt of exculpating himself to men who knew that he was refusing to pay the price at which he had bought the papacythat the venetians in the romagna were not moving against the church but against cesare himselfwherefore he had demanded of cesare the surrender of the towns he held that thus there might be an end to the war  it was speciouswhich is the best that can be said for it  as for putting an end to the war the papal brief was far indeed from achieving any such thing as was instantly plain from the reception it met with in the romagna which persisted in its loyalty to cesare in despite of the very pope himself when that brief was read in cesena a wild tumult ensued and the people ran through the streets clamouring angrily for their duke  it was very plain what short work would have been made of such men as the ordelaffi and the malatesta had cesare gone north but cesare was fast at the vatican treated by the pope with all outward friendliness and consideration but virtually a prisoner none the less julius continued to press for the surrender of the romagna strongholds which remolino had promised in his masters name but cesare persisted obstinately to refuse until the news reached him that michele da corella and della volpe who had gone north with seven hundred horse to support his romagnuoli had been cut to pieces in tuscany by the army of gianpaolo baglioni  cesare bore his burning grievance to the pope the pope sympathized with him most deeply then went to write a letter to the florentines to thank them for what had befallen and to beg them to send him michele da corella under a strong escortthat redoubtable captain having been taken prisoner together with della volpe  corella was known to be fully in the dukes confidence and there were rumours that he was accused of many things perpetrated on the dukes behalf julius bent now on cesares ruin desired to possess himself of this man in the hope of being able to put him upon his trial under charges which should reflect discredit upon cesare  at last the duke realized that he was betrayed and that all was lost and so he submitted to the inevitable and gave the pope the countersigns he craved with these julius at once dispatched an envoy into the romagna and knowing the temper of cesares captains he insisted that this envoy should be accompanied by piero dorvieto as cesares own commissioner to demand that surrender  but the intrepid pedro ramires who held cesena knowing the true facts of the case and conceiving how his duke had been constrained instead of making ready to yield proceeded further to fortify for resistance when the commissioners appeared before his gates he ordered the admission of piero dorvieto that done he declared that he desired to see his duke at liberty before he would surrender the citadel which he held for him and taking dorvieto he hanged him from the battlements as a traitor and a bad servant who did a thing which the duke had he been at liberty would never have had him do  moncalieri the papal envoy returned to rome with the news and this so inflamed the pope that the cardinals lodovico borgia and francesco remolino together with other borgia partisans instantly fled from rome where they no longer accounted themselves safe and sought refuge with gonzalo de cordoba in the spanish camp at naples imploring his protection at the same time for cesare  the popes anger first vented itself in the confiscation of the duke of valentinoiss property wherever possible to satisfy the claims of the riarii the popes nephews who demanded an indemnity of 50000 ducats of guidobaldo who demanded 200000 ducats and of the florentine republic which claimed the same the dukes ruin was by nowwithin six weeks of the election of julius iian accomplished fact and many were those who chose to fall with him rather than abandon him in his extremity they afford a spectacle of honour and loyalty that was exceedingly rare in the italy of the renaissance clinging to their duke even when the last ray of hope was quenched they lightened for him the tedium of those last days at the vatican during which he was no better than a prisoner of state  suddenly came news of gonzalo de cordobas splendid victory at gariglianoa victory which definitely broke the french and gave the throne of naples to spain naturally this set spanish influence once more and mightily in the ascendant and the spanish cardinals together with the ambassador of spain came to exert with the pope an influence suddenly grown weighty  as a consequence cesare escorted by carvajal cardinal of santa croce was permitted to depart to ostia whence he was to take ship for france leastways such was the understanding upon which he left the vatican but the pope was not minded even now to part with him so easily and his instructions to carvajal were that at ostia he should await further orders before sailing  but on december 26 news reaching the spanish cardinal that the romagna fortressespersuaded that cesare had been liberatedhad finally surrendered carvajal took it upon himself to allow cesare to depart upon receiving from him a written undertaking never to bear arms against pope julius ii  so the duke of valentinois at last regained his freedom whether in repairing straight to naples as he did he put a preconceived plan into execution or whether even now he mistrusted his enlargement and thought thus to make himself secure cannot be ascertained but straight to gonzalo de cordobas spanish camp he went equipped with a safeconduct from the great captain obtained for cesare by cardinal remolino  there he found a court of friends already awaiting him among whom were his brother giuffredo and the cardinal lodovico borgia and he received from gonzalo a very cordial welcome  spain was considering the invasion of tuscany with the ultimate object of assailing milan and driving the french out of the peninsula altogether piero demedicikilled at gariglianohad no doubt been serving spain with some such end in view as the conquest of florence and though piero was dead there was no reason why the plan should be abandoned rather all the more reason to carry it forward since now spain would more directly profit by it bartolomeo dalviano was to have commanded the army destined for that campaign but cesare by virtue of his friends and influence in pisa siena and piombino was so preferable a captain for such an expedition that gonzalo gave him charge of it within a few days of his arrival at the spanish camp  to cesare this would have been the thin end of a mighty edge here was a chance to begin all over again and beginning thus backed by spanish arms there was no saying how far he might have gone meanwhile what a beginning to avenge himself thus upon that florentine republic which under the protection of france had dared at every turn to flout him and had been the instrument of his ultimate ruin sweet to him would have been the poetic justice he would have administeredas sweet to him as it would have been terrible to florence upon which he would have descended like another scourge of god  briskly and with highrunning hopes he set about his preparations during that spring of 1504 what time the popes holiness in rome was seeking to justify his treachery by heaping odium upon the borgias thus he thought to show that if he had broken faith he had broken faith with knaves deserving none it was in pursuit of this that michele da corella was now pressed with questions which however yielded nothing and that asquino de colloredo the sometime servant of cardinal michaeli was tortured into confessing that he had poisoned his master at the instigation of alexander and cesareas has been seenwhich confession pope julius was very quick to publish  but in naples it may well be that cesare cared nought for these matters busy and hopeful as he was just then he dispatched baldassare da scipione to rome to enlist what lances he could find and scipione put it about that his lord would soon be returning to his own and giving his enemies something to think about  and then suddenly out of clearest heavens fell a thunderbolt to shiver this last hope  on the night of may 26 as cesare was leaving gonzalos quarters where he had supped an officer stepped forward to demand his sword he was under arrest  julius ii had outmanoeuvred him he had written to spain setting forth what was his agreement with valentinois in the matter of the romagnathe original agreement which was the price of the pontificate had of course been conveniently effaced from the pontifical memory he addressed passionate complaints to ferdinand and isabella that gonzalo de cordoba and cardinal carvajal between them were affording valentinois the means to break that agreement and to undertake matters that were hostile to the holy see and ferdinand and isabella had put it upon gonzalo de cordoba that most honourable and gallant captain to do this thing in gross violation of his safeconduct and plighted word to valentinois it was a deed under the shame of which the great captain confessedly laboured to the end of his days as his memory has laboured under it ever since for great captains are not afforded the immunity enjoyed by priests and popes jointly with other wearers of the petticoat from the consequences of falsehood and violated trust  fierce and bitter were valentinoiss reproaches of the great captain for this treacheryas fierce and bitter as they were unavailing on august 20 1504 cesare borgia took ship for spaina prisoner bound for a spanish dungeon thus at the early age of twentynine he passed from italy and the deeds that well might have filled a lifetime  conspicuous amid those he left behind him who remained loyal to their duke was baldassare scipione who published throughout christendom a cartel wherein he challenged to trial by combat any spaniard who dared deny that the duke of valentinois had been detained a prisoner in naples in spite of the safeconduct granted him in the name of ferdinand and isabella with great shame and infamy to their crown1     1  quoted by alvisi on the authority of a letter of luigi da porto march 16 1510 in lettere storiche   this challenge was never taken up  amongst other loyal ones was that fine soldier of fortune taddeo della volpe who in his florentine prison refused all offers to enter the service of the signory until he had learnt that his lord was gone from italy  fracassa and mirafuente had held forli until they received guarantees for cesares safety after he had left ostia to repair to the spanish camp they then rode out with the honours of war lance on thigh dionigio di naldo that hardy captain of foot entered the service of venice but to the end he wore the device of his dear lord and imposed the same upon all who served under his banner  don michele da corella was liberated by julius ii after an interrogatory which can have revealed nothing defamatory to cesare or his father as it is unthinkable that a pope who did all that man could do to ruin the house of borgia and to befoul its memory should have preserved silence touching any such revelations as were hoped for when corella was put to torture that most faithful of all cesares officersand sharer of the odium that has been heaped upon cesares nameentered the service of the signory of florence     chapter iv atropos   vain were the exertions put forth by the spanish cardinals to obtain cesares enlargement and vainer still the efforts of his sister lucrezia who wrote letter after letter to francesco gonzaga of mantuanow gonfalonier of the church and a man of influence at the vaticanimploring him to use his interest with the pope to the same end  julius ii remained unmoved fearing the power of cesare borgia and resolved that he should trouble italy no more on the score of that no blame attaches to the pope the states which borgia had conquered in the name of the church should remain adherent to the church upon that julius was resolved and the resolve was highly laudable he would have no duke who controlled such a following as did cesare using those states as steppingstones to greater dominions in which no doubt he would later have absorbed them alienating them so from the holy see  in all this julius ii was most fully justified the odious matter in his conduct however is the abominable treachery it entailed following as it did upon the undertaking by virtue of which he gained the tiara  for some months after his arrival in spain cesare was confined in the prison of chinchilla whenceas a result it is said of an attempt on his part to throw the governor bodily over the battlementshe was removed to the fortress of medina del campo and kept well guarded by orders of the pope  rumours that he had been liberated by the king of spain overran the romagna more than once and set the country in a ferment even reaching the vatican and shaking the stouthearted julius into alarm  one chance of regaining his ancient might and wreaking a sweet and terrific vengeance upon his betrayers came very close to him but passed him by this chance occurred in 1505 whenqueen isabella being deadking ferdinand discovered that gonzalo de cordoba was playing him false in naples the spanish king conceived a planaccording to the chronicles of zuritato employ cesare as a flail for the punishment of the great captain he proposed to liberate the duke set him at the head of an army and loose him upon naples trusting to the formidable alliance of cesares military talents with his hatred of gonzalowho had betrayed himto work the will of his catholic majesty  unfortunately for cesare there were difficulties ferdinands power was no longer absolute in castille now that isabella was dead he sought to overcome these difficulties but the process was a slow one and in the course of it spurred also by increased proofs of his lieutenants perfidy ferdinand lost patience and determinedthe case having grown urgentto go to naples in person to deal with gonzalo  plainly cesares good fortune which once had been proverbial had now utterly deserted him  he had received news of what was afoot and his hopes had run high once more only to suffer cruel frustration when he learnt that ferdinand had sailed himself for naples in his despair the duke roused himself to a last effort to win his freedom  his treatment in prison was fairly liberal such as is usually measured out to state prisoners of consideration he was allowed his own chaplain and several attendants and whilst closely guarded and confined to the homenaje tower of the fortress yet he was not oppressively restrained he was accorded certain privileges and liberties he enjoyed the faculty of corresponding with the outer world and even of receiving visits amongst his visitors was the count of benaventea powerful lord of the neighbourhood who coming under the spell of cesares fascination became so attached to him and so resolved to do his will and effect his liberation thatsays zuritahe was prepared even to go the length of accomplishing it by force of arms should no other way present itself1     1  sanuto confirms zurita in the main by letters received by the venetian senate   another way however did present itself and benavente and the duke hatched a plot of evasion in which they had the collaboration of the chaplain and a servant of the governors named garcia  one september night a cord was let down from the crenels of the tower and by this the duke was to descend from his window to the castle ditch where benaventes men awaited him garcia was to go with him since naturally it would not be safe for the servants to remain behind and garcia now let himself down that rope hand over hand from the terrible height of the dukes window it was only when he had reached the end of it that he discovered that the rope was not long enough and that below him there was still a chasm that might well have appalled even desperate men  to return was impossible the duke above was growing impatient garcia loosed his hold and dropped the remainder of the distance breaking both his legs in the fall groaning he lay there in the ditch whilst hand over hand now came the agile athletic duke unconscious of his predecessors fate and of what awaited him at the end he reached it and was dangling there perhaps undecided whether or not to take that daring leap when suddenly his doubts were resolved for him his evasion was already discovered the castle was in alarm and some one above him cut the rope and precipitated him into the ditch  benaventes menwe do not know how many of them were at handran to him instantly they found him seriously injured and that he too had broken bones is beyond doubt they lifted him up and bore him with all speed to the horses they contrived somehow to mount him upon one and holding him in the saddle they rode off as fast as was possible under the circumstances there was no time to go back for the unfortunate garcia the castle was all astir by now to stop the fugitives and to have returned would have been to suffer capture themselves as well as the duke without availing the servant  so poor garcia was left to his fate he was found by the governor where he had fallen and he was immediately put to death  if the people of medina organized a pursuit it availed them nothing for cesare was carried safely to benaventes stronghold at villalon  there he lay for some five or six weeks to recover from the hurts he had taken in escaping and to allow his handsthe bones of which were brokento become whole again at last being in the main recovered though with hands still bandaged he set out with two attendants and made for santander thence they took ship to castro urdiales cesare aiming now at reaching the kingdom of navarre and the protection of his brotherinlaw the king  at the inn at santander where weary and famished they sat down to dine after one of the grooms had made arrangements for a boat they had a near escape of capture the alcalde hearing of the presence of these strangers and his suspicions being aroused by the recklessly high price they had agreed to pay the owner of the vessel which they had engaged came to examine them but they had a tale ready that they were wheatmerchants in great haste to reach bernico that a cargo of wheat awaited them there and that they would suffer great loss by delay the tale was smooth enough to satisfy the alcalde and they were allowed to depart they reached castro urdiales safely but were delayed there for two days owing to the total lack of horses and they were forced in the end to proceed upon mules obtained from a neighbouring convent on these they rode to durango where they procured two fresh mules and a horse and so after further similar vicissitudes they arrived at pampeluna on december 3 1506 and cesare startled the court of his brotherinlaw king jean of navarre by suddenly appearing in itlike the devil  the news of his evasion had already spread to italy and set it in a ferment inspiring actual fear at the vatican the romagna was encouraged by it to break out into open and armed insurrection against the harsh rule of julius iiwho seems to have been rendered positively vindictive towards the romagnuoli by their fidelity to valentinois thus had the romagna fallen again into the old state of insufferable oppression from which cesare had once delivered it the hopes of the romagnuoli rose in a measure as the alarm spread among the enemies of cesarefor florence and venice shared now the anxiety of the vatican zurita commenting upon this state of things pays cesare the following compliment which the facts confirm as just  the duke was such that his very presence was enough to set all italy agog and he was greatly beloved not only by men of war but also by many people of tuscany and of the states of the church  cesares wifecharlotte dalbretwhom he had not seen since that september of 1499 was at bourges at the court of her friend the saintly repudiated first wife of louis xii it is to be supposed that she would be advised of her husbands presence at her brothers court but there is no information on this score nor do we know that they ever met  within four days of reaching pampeluna cesare dispatched his secretary federico into italy to bear the news of his escape to his sister lucrezia at ferrara and a letter to francesco gonzaga of mantua which was little more than one of introduction the more important matters to be conveyed to gonzaga going no doubt by word of mouth federico was arrested at bologna by order of julius ii after he had discharged his mission  france was now cesares only hope and he wrote to louis begging his royal leave to come to take his rank as a prince of that country and to serve her  you may justly have opined long since that the story here set down is one neverending record of treacheries and betrayals but you will find little to surpass the one to come the behaviour of louis at this juncture is contemptible beyond words obeying as it does the maxim of that age which had it that no inconvenient engagement should be observed if there was opportunity for breaking it  following this detestable maxim louis xii had actually gone the length of never paying to charlotte dalbret the dot of 100000 livres tournois to which he had engaged himself by written contract when cesare in prison at medina and in straits for money had solicited payment through his brotherinlaw of navarre his claim had been contemptuously disregarded  but there was worse to follow louis now answered cesares request for leave to come to france by a letter quoted in full by m yriarte from the archives des basses pyrénées in which his very christian majesty announces that the duchy of valentinois and the county of dyois have been restored to the crown of france as also the lordship of issoudun and then follows the pretext of whose basely paltry quality you shall judge for yourselves it runs  after the decease of the late pope alexander when our people and our army were seeking the recovery of the kingdom of naples he cesare went over to the side of our enemies serving favouring and assisting them at arms and otherwise against ourselves and our said people and army which resulted to us in great and irrecoverable loss  the climax is in the deliberate falsehood contained in the closing words poor cesare who had served france at her callin spite of what was rumoured of his intentionsas long as he had a manatarms to follow him had gone to naples only in the hour of his extreme need true he had gone to offer himself to spain as a condottiero when naught else was left to him but he took no army with himhe went alone a servant not an ally as that false letter pretends he had never come to draw his sword against france and certainly no loss had been suffered by france in consequence of any action of his louiss army was definitely routed at garigliano with cesares troops fighting in its ranks  but pope alexander was dead cesares might in in italy was dissipated his credit gone there lay no profit for louis in keeping faith with him there lay some profit in breaking it alas that a king should stain his honour with base and vulgar lies to minister to his cupidity and that he should set them down above his seal and signature to shame him through centuries still in the womb of time  cesare borgia landless without right to any title he that had held so many betrayed and abandoned on every side had now nothing to offer in the worlds market but his stout sword and his glad courage these went to the first bidder for them who happened to be his brotherinlaw king jean  navarre at the time was being snarled and quarrelled over by france and spain both menacing its independence each pretending to claims upon it which do not in themselves concern us  in addition the country itself was torn by two factionsthe beaumontes and the agramontesand it was entrusted to cesare to restore navarre to peace and unity at home before proceedingwith the aid upon which he depended from the emperor maximilianto deal with the enemies beyond her frontiers  the castle of viana was being held by louis de beaumontchief of the faction that bore his nameand refused to surrender to the king to reduce it and compel beaumont to obedience went cesare as captaingeneral of navarre early in february of 1507 he commanded a considerable force some 10000 strong and with this and his cannon he laid siege to the citadel  the natural strength of the place was such as might have defied any attempt to reduce it by force but victuals were running low and there was every likelihood of its being speedily starved into surrender to frustrate this beaumont conceived the daring plan of attempting to send in supplies from mendavia the attempt being made secretly by night and under a strong escort was entirely successful but in retreating the beaumontese were surprised in the dawn of that february morning by a troop of reinforcements coming to cesares camp these at sight of the rebels immediately gave the alarm  the most hopeless confusion ensued in the town where it was at once imagined that a surprise attack was being made upon the royalists and that they had to do with the entire rebel army  cesare being aroused by the din and the blare of trumpets calling men to arms sprang for his weapons armed himself in haste flung himself on a horse and without pausing so much as to issue a command to his waiting menatarms rode headlong down the street to the puerta del sol under the archway of the gate his horse stumbled and came down with him with an oath cesare wrenched the animal to its feet again gave it the spur and was away at a mad furious gallop in pursuit of the retreating beaumont rearguard  the citizens crowding to the walls of viana watched that last reckless ride of his with amazed uncomprehending eyes the peeping sun caught his glittering armour as he sped so that of a sudden he must have seemed to them a thing of firemeteoric as had been his whole lifes trajectory which was now swiftly dipping to its nadir  whether he was frenzied with the lust of battle riding in the reckless manner that was his wont confident that his men followed yet too selfcentred to ascertain or whetheras seems more likelyit was simply that his horse had bolted with him will never be known until all things are known  suddenly he was upon the rearguard of the fleeing rebels his sword flashed up and down again and again they may have caught the gleam of it from vianas walls as he smote the foe irresistible as a thunderbolt he clove himself a way through those beaumontese he was alone once more a flying dazzling figure of light away beyond that rearguard which he left scathed and disordered by his furious passage still his mad career continued and he bore down upon the main body of the escort  beaumont sat his horse to watch in such amazement as you may conceive the wild approach of this unknown rider  seeing him unsupported some of the counts men detached themselves to return and meet this single foe and oblige him with the death he so obviously appeared to seek  they hedged him aboutwe do not know their numberand engaging him they drew him from the road and down into the hollow space of a ravine  and so in the thirtysecond year of his age and in all the glory of his matchless strength his soul possessed of the lust of combat sword in hand warding off the attack that rains upon him and dealing death about him he meets his end from the walls of viana his resplendent armour renders him still discernible until like a sun to its setting he passes below the rim of that ravine and is lost to the watchers view  death awaited him amid the shadows of that hollow place  unhorsed by now he fought with no concern for the odds against him and did sore execution upon his assailants ere a sword could find an opening in his guard to combine with a gap in his armour and so drive home that blade had found maybe his lungs still he swung his sword swaying now upon his loosening knees his mouth was full of blood it was growing dark his hands began to fail him he reeled like a drunkard sapped of strength and then the end came quickly blows unwarded showered upon him now  he crashed down in all the glory of his rich armour which those brigandsoldiers already coveted and thus he diedmercifully maybe happily for he had no time in which to taste the bitterness of deaththat awful draught which he had forced upon so many  within a few moments of his falling this man who had been a living force whose word had carried law from the campagna to the bolognese was so much naked bloodsmeared carrionfor those human vultures stripped him to the skin his very shirt must they have and there a stark livid corpse of no more account than any dog that died last saturday they left cesare borgia of france duke of romagna and valentinois prince of andria and lord of a dozen tyrannies  the body was found there anon by those who so tardily rode after their leader and his dismayed troopers bore those poor remains to viana the king arriving there that very day horrorstricken at the news and sight that awaited him ordered cesare a magnificent funeral and so he was laid to rest before the high altar of sainte marie de viane  to rest may the soul of him rest at least for menchristian menhave refused to vouchsafe that privilege to his poor ashes  nearly two hundred years laterat the close of the seventeenth century a priest of god and a bishop one who preached a gospel of love and mercy so infinite that he dared believe by its lights no man to have been damned came to disturb the dust of cesare borgia this bishop of calahorralineal descendant in soul of that pharisee who exalted himself in gods house thrilled with titillations of delicious horror at the desecrating presence of the base publicanhad his pietists eyes offended by the slab that marked cesare borgias restingplace1     1  it bore the following legend       aqui yace en poca tierra      al que todo le temia      el que la paz y la guerra      en la sua mano tenia      oh tu que vas a buscar      cosas dignas de loar      si tu loas lo mas digno      aqui pare tu camino      no cures de mas andar  which more or less literally may be englished as follows here in a little earth lies one whom all did fear one whose hands dispensed both peace and war oh you that go in search of things deserving praise if you would praise the worthiest then let your journey end here nor trouble to go farther  the pious christian bishop had read of this manperhaps that life of him published by the apostate gregorio leti under the penname of tommaso tommasi which had lately seen the lightand he ordered the tombs removal from that holy place and thus it befell that the ashes of cesare borgia were scattered and lost  charlotte dalbret was bereft of her one friend queen jeanne in that same year of cesares death the duchess of valentinois withdrew to la motte­feuilly and for the seven years remaining of her life was never seen other than in mourning her very house was equipped with sombre funereal furniture and so maintained until her end which supports the view that she had conceived affection and respect for the husband of whom she had seen so little  on march 14 1514 that poor lady passed from a life which appears to have offered her few joys  louise de valentinoisa handsome damsel of the age of
