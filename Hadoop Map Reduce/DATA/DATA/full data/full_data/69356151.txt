69356151	abbotsford and newstead abbey  by  washington irving     contents    abbotsford   newstead abbey   arrival at the abbey   abbey garden   plough monday   old servants   superstitions of the abbey   annesley hall   the lake   robin hood and sherwood forest   rook cell   little white lady     abbotsford   by washington irving   i sit down to perform my promise of giving you an account of a visit made many years since to abbotsford i hope however that you do not expect much from me for the travelling notes taken at the time are so scanty and vague and my memory so extremely fallacious that i fear i shall disappoint you with the meagreness and crudeness of my details  late in the evening of august 29 1817 i arrived at the ancient little border town of selkirk where i put up for the night i had come down from edinburgh partly to visit melrose abbey and its vicinity but chiefly to get sight of the mighty minstrel of the north i had a letter of introduction to him from thomas campbell the poet and had reason to think from the interest he had taken in some of my earlier scribblings that a visit from me would not be deemed an intrusion  on the following morning after an early breakfast i set off in a postchaise for the abbey on the way thither i stopped at the gate of abbotsford and sent the postilion to the house with the letter of introduction and my card on which i had written that i was on my way to the ruins of melrose abbey and wished to know whether it would be agreeable to mr scott he had not yet been made a baronet to receive a visit from me in the course of the morning  while the postilion was on his errand i had time to survey the mansion it stood some short distance below the road on the side of a hill sweeping down to the tweed and was as yet but a snug gentlemans cottage with something rural and picturesque in its appearance the whole front was overrun with evergreens and immediately above the portal was a great pair of elk horns branching out from beneath the foliage and giving the cottage the look of a hunting lodge the huge baronial pile to which this modest mansion in a manner gave birth was just emerging into existence part of the walls surrounded by scaffolding already had risen to the height of the cottage and the courtyard in front was encumbered by masses of hewn stone  the noise of the chaise had disturbed the quiet of the establishment out sallied the warder of the castle a black greyhound and leaping on one of the blocks of stone began a furious barking his alarum brought out the whole garrison of dogs    both mongrel puppy whelp and hound   and curs of low degree  all openmouthed and vociferousi should correct my quotationnot a cur was to be seen on the premises scott was too true a sportsman and had too high a veneration for pure blood to tolerate a mongrel  in a little while the lord of the castle himself made his appearance i knew him at once by the descriptions i had read and heard and the likenesses that had been published of him he was tall and of a large and powerful frame his dress was simple and almost rustic an old green shootingcoat with a dogwhistle at the buttonhole brown linen pantaloons stout shoes that tied at the ankles and a white hat that had evidently seen service he came limping up the gravel walk aiding himself by a stout walkingstaff but moving rapidly and with vigor by his side jogged along a large irongray staghound of most grave demeanor who took no part in the clamor of the canine rabble but seemed to consider himself bound for the dignity of the house to give me a courteous reception  before scott had reached the gate he called out in a hearty tone welcoming me to abbotsford and asking news of campbell arrived at the door of the chaise he grasped me warmly by the hand come drive down drive down to the house said he yere just in time for breakfast and afterward ye shall see all the wonders of the abbey  i would have excused myself on the plea of having already made my breakfast hout man cried he a ride in the morning in the keen air of the scotch hills is warrant enough for a second breakfast  i was accordingly whirled to the portal of the cottage and in a few moments found myself seated at the breakfasttable there was no one present but the family which consisted of mrs scott her eldest daughter sophia then a fine girl about seventeen miss ann scott two or three years younger walter a wellgrown stripling and charles a lively boy eleven or twelve years of age i soon felt myself quite at home and my heart in a glow with the cordial welcome i experienced i had thought to make a mere morning visit but found i was not to be let off so lightly you must not think our neighborhood is to be read in a morning like a newspaper said scott it takes several days of study for an observant traveller that has a relish for auld world trumpery after breakfast you shall make your visit to melrose abbey i shall not be able to accompany you as i have some household affairs to attend to but i will put you in charge of my son charles who is very learned in all things touching the old ruin and the neighborhood it stands in and he and my friend johnny bower will tell you the whole truth about it with a good deal more that you are not called upon to believe unless you be a true and nothingdoubting antiquary when you come back ill take you out on a ramble about the neighborhood tomorrow we will take a look at the yarrow and the next day we will drive over to dryburgh abbey which is a fine old ruin well worth your seeingin a word before scott had got through his plan i found myself committed for a visit of several days and it seemed as if a little realm of romance was suddenly opened before me                                       after breakfast i accordingly set oft for the abbey with my little friend charles whom i found a most sprightly and entertaining companion he had an ample stock of anecdote about the neighborhood which he had learned from his father and many quaint remarks and sly jokes evidently derived from the same source all which were uttered with a scottish accent and a mixture of scottish phraseology that gave them additional flavor  on our way to the abbey he gave me some anecdotes of johnny bower to whom his father had alluded he was sexton of the parish and custodian of the ruin employed to keep it in order and show it to strangersa worthy little man not without ambition in his humble sphere the death of his predecessor had been mentioned in the newspapers so that his name had appeared in print throughout the land when johnny succeeded to the guardianship of the ruin he stipulated that on his death his name should receive like honorable blazon with this addition that it should be from the pen of scott the latter gravely pledged himself to pay this tribute to his memory and johnny now lived in the proud anticipation of a poetic immortality  i found johnny bower a decentlooking little old man in blue coat and red waistcoat he received us with much greeting and seemed delighted to see my young companion who was full of merriment and waggery drawing out his peculiarities for my amusement the old man was one of the most authentic and particular of cicerones he pointed out everything in the abbey that had been described by scott in his lay of the last minstrel and would repeat with broad scottish accent the passage which celebrated it  thus in passing through the cloisters he made me remark the beautiful carvings of leaves and flowers wrought in stone with the most exquisite delicacy and notwithstanding the lapse of centuries retaining their sharpness as if fresh from the chisel rivalling as scott has said the real objects of which they were imitations    nor herb nor flowret glistened there   but was carved in the cloister arches as fair  he pointed out also among the carved work a nuns head of much beauty which he said scott always stopped to admirefor the shirra had a wonderful eye for all sic matters  i would observe that scott seemed to derive more consequence in the neighborhood from being sheriff of the county than from being poet  in the interior of the abbey johnny bower conducted me to the identical stone on which stout william of deloraine and the monk took their seat on that memorable night when the wizards book was to be rescued from the grave nay johnny had even gone beyond scott in the minuteness of his antiquarian research for he had discovered the very tomb of the wizard the position of which had been left in doubt by the poet this he boasted to have ascertained by the position of the oriel window and the direction in which the moonbeams fell at night through the stained glass casting the shadow to the red cross on the spot as had all been specified in the poem i pointed out the whole to the shirra said he and he could na gainsay but it was varra clear i found afterward that scott used to amuse himself with the simplicity of the old man and his zeal in verifying every passage of the poem as though it had authentic history and that he always acquiesced in his deductions i subjoin the description of the wizards grave which called forth the antiquarian research of johnny bower    lo warrior now the cross of red   points to the grave of the mighty dead   slow moved the monk to the broad flagstone   which the bloody cross was traced upon   he pointed to a sacred nook   an iron bar the warrior took   and the monk made a sign with his withered hand   the graves huge portal to expand    it was by dint of passing strength   that he moved the massy stone at length   i would you had been there to see   how the light broke forth so gloriously   streamed upward to the chancel roof   and through the galleries far aloof     and issuing from the tomb   showed the monks cowl and visage pale   danced on the dark brown warriors mail     and kissed his waving plume    before their eyes the wizard lay   as if he had not been dead a day   his hoary beard in silver rolled   he seemed some seventy winters old   a palmers amice wrapped him round   with a wrought spanish baldrie bound     like a pilgrim from beyond the sea   his left hand held his book of might   a silver cross was in his right     the lamp was placed beside his knee  the fictions of scott had become facts with honest johnny bower from constantly living among the ruins of melrose abbey and pointing out the scenes of the poem the lay of the last minstrel had in a manner become interwoven with his whole existence and i doubt whether he did not now and then mix up his own identity with the personages of some of its cantos  he could not bear that any other production of the poet should be preferred to the lay of the last minstrel faith said he to me its just een as gude a thing as mr scott has writtenan if he were stannin there id tell him soan then hed lauff  he was loud in his praises of the affability of scott hell come here sometimes said he with great folks in his company an the first i know of it is his voice calling out johnnyjohnny bowerand when i go out i am sure to be greeted with a joke or a pleasant word hell stand and crack and lauff wi me just like an auld wifeand to think that of a man who has such an awfu knowledge o history  one of the ingenious devices on which the worthy little man prided himself was to place a visitor opposite to the abbey with his back to it and bid him bend down and look at it between his legs this he said gave an entire different aspect to the ruin folks admired the plan amazingly but as to the leddies they were dainty on the matter and contented themselves with looking from under their arms as johnny bower piqued himself upon showing everything laid down in the poem there was one passage that perplexed him sadly it was the opening of one of the cantos    if thou wouldst view fair melrose aright   go visit it by the pale moonlight   for the gay beams of lightsome day   gild but to flout the ruins gray etc  in consequence of this admonition many of the most devout pilgrims to the ruin could not be contented with a daylight inspection and insisted it could be nothing unless seen by the light of the moon now unfortunately the moon shines but for a part of the month and what is still more unfortunate is very apt in scotland to be obscured by clouds and mists johnny was sorely puzzled therefore how to accommodate his poetrystruck visitors with this indispensable moonshine at length in a lucky moment he devised a substitute this was a great double tallow candle stuck upon the end of a pole with which he could conduct his visitors about the ruins on dark nights so much to their satisfaction that at length he began to think it even preferable to the moon itself it does na light up a the abbey at since to be sure he would say but then you can shift it about and show the auld ruin bit by bit whiles the moon only shines on one side  honest johnny bower so many years have elapsed since the time i treat of that it is more than probable his simple head lies beneath the walls of his favorite abbey it is to be hoped his humble ambition has been gratified and his name recorded by the pen of the man he so loved and honored                                       after my return from melrose abbey scott proposed a ramble to show me something of the surrounding country as we sallied forth every dog in the establishment turned out to attend us there was the old staghound maida that i have already mentioned a noble animal and a great favorite of scotts and hamlet the black greyhound a wild thoughtless youngster not yet arrived to the years of discretion and finette a beautiful setter with soft silken hair long pendent ears and a mild eye the parlor favorite when in front of the house we were joined by a superannuated greyhound who came from the kitchen wagging his tail and was cheered by scott as an old friend and comrade  in our walks scott would frequently pause in conversation to notice his dogs and speak to them as if rational companions and indeed there appears to be a vast deal of rationality in these faithful attendants on man derived from their close intimacy with him maida deported himself with a gravity becoming his age and size and seemed to consider himself called upon to preserve a great degree of dignity and decorum in our society as he jogged along a little distance ahead of us the young dogs would gambol about him leap on his neck worry at his ears and endeavor to tease him into a frolic the old dog would keep on for a long time with imperturbable solemnity now and then seeming to rebuke the wantonness of his young companions at length he would make a sudden turn seize one of them and tumble him in the dust then giving a glance at us as much as to say you see gentlemen i cant help giving way to this nonsense would resume his gravity and jog on as before  scott amused himself with these peculiarities i make no doubt said he when maida is alone with these young dogs he throws gravity aside and plays the boy as much as any of them but he is ashamed to do so in our company and seems to say ha done with your nonsense youngsters what will the laird and that other gentleman think of me if i give way to such foolery  maida reminded him he said of a scene on board an armed yacht in which he made an excursion with his friend adam ferguson they had taken much notice of the boatswain who was a fine sturdy seaman and evidently felt flattered by their attention on one occasion the crew were piped to fun and the sailors were dancing and cutting all kinds of capers to the music of the ships band the boatswain looked on with a wistful eye as if he would like to join in but a glance at scott and ferguson showed that there was a struggle with his dignity fearing to lessen himself in their eyes at length one at his messmates came up and seizing him by the arm challenged him to a jig the boatswain continued scott after a little hesitation complied made an awkward gambol or two like our friend maida but soon gave it up its of no use said he jerking up his waistband and giving a side glance at us one cant dance always nouther  scott amused himself with the peculiarities of another of his dogs a little shamefaced terrier with large glassy eyes one of the most sensitive little bodies to insult and indignity in the world if ever he whipped him he said the little fellow would sneak off and hide himself from the light of day in a lumber garret whence there was no drawing him forth but by the sound of the choppingknife as if chopping up his victuals when he would steal forth with humble and downcast look but would skulk away again if any one regarded him  while we were discussing the humors and peculiarities of our canine companions some object provoked their spleen and produced a sharp and petulant barking from the smaller fry but it was some time before maida was sufficiently aroused to ramp forward two or three bounds and join in the chorus with a deepmouthed bowwow  it was but a transient outbreak and he returned instantly wagging his tail and looking up dubiously in his masters face uncertain whether he would censure or applaud  aye aye old boy cried scott you have done wonders you have shaken the eildon hills with your roaring you may now lay by your artillery for the rest of the day maida is like the great gun at constantinople continued he it takes so long to get it ready that the small guns can fire off a dozen times first but when it does go off it plays the very dl  these simple anecdotes may serve to show the delightful play of scotts humors and feelings in private life his domestic animals were his friends everything about him seemed to rejoice in the light of his countenance the face of the humblest dependent brightened at his approach as if he anticipated a cordial and cheering word i had occasion to observe this particularly in a visit which we paid to a quarry whence several men were cutting stone for the new edifice who all paused from their labor to have a pleasant crack wi the laird one of them was a burgess of selkirk with whom scott had some joke aboutthe old song    up with the souters o selkirk   and down with the earl of horne  another was precentor at the kirk and besides leading the psalmody on sunday taught the lads and lasses of the neighborhood dancing on week days in the winter time when outofdoor labor was scarce  among the rest was a tall straight old fellow with a healthful complexion and silver hair and a small roundcrowned white hat he had been about to shoulder a nod but paused and stood looking at scott with a slight sparkling of his blue eye as if waiting his turn for the old fellow knew himself to be a favorite  scott accosted him in an affable tone and asked for a pinch of snuff the old man drew forth a horn snuffbox hoot man said scott not that old mull wheres the bonnie french one that i brought you from paris troth your honor replied the old fellow sic a mull as that is nae for weekdays  on leaving the quarry scott informed me that when absent at paris he had purchased several trifling articles as presents for his dependents and among others the gay snuffbox in question which was so carefully reserved for sundays by the veteran it was not so much the value of the gifts said he that pleased them as the idea that the laird should think of them when so far away  the old man in question i found was a great favorite with scott if i recollect right he had been a soldier in early life and his straight erect person his ruddy yet rugged countenance his gray hair and an arch gleam in his blue eye reminded me of the description of edie ochiltree i find that the old fellow has since been introduced by wilkie in his picture of the scott family                                       we rambled on among scenes which had been familiar in scottish song and rendered classic by pastoral muse long before scott had thrown the rich mantle of his poetry over them what a thrill of pleasure did i feel when first i saw the broomcovered tops of the cowden knowes peeping above the gray hills of the tweed and what touching associations were called up by the sight of ettrick vale galla water and the braes of yarrow every turn brought to mind some household air some almost forgotten song of the nursery by which i had been lulled to sleep in my childhood and with them the looks and voices of those who had sung them and who were now no more it is these melodies chanted in our ears in the days of infancy and connected with the memory of those we have loved and who have passed away that clothe scottish landscape with such tender associations the scottish songs in general have something intrinsically melancholy in them owing in all probability to the pastoral and lonely life of those who composed them who were often mere shepherds tending their flocks in the solitary glens or folding them among the naked hills many of these rustic bards have passed away without leaving a name behind them nothing remains of them but their sweet and touching songs which live like echoes about the places they once inhabited most of these simple effusions of pastoral poets are linked with some favorite haunt of the poet and in this way not a mountain or valley a town or tower green shaw or running stream in scotland but has some popular air connected with it that makes its very name a keynote to a whole train of delicious fancies and feelings  let me step forward in time and mention how sensible i was to the power of these simple airs in a visit which i made to ayr the birthplace of robert burns i passed a whole morning about the banks and braes of bonnie doon with his tender little love verses running in my head i found a poor scotch carpenter at work among the ruins of kirk alloway which was to be converted into a schoolhouse finding the purpose of my visit he left his work sat down with me on a grassy grave close by where burns father was buried and talked of the poet whom he had known personally he said his songs were familiar to the poorest and most illiterate of the country folk and it seemed to him as if the country had grown more beautiful since burns had written his bonnie little songs about it  i found scott was quite an enthusiast on the subject of the popular songs of his country and he seemed gratified to find me so alive to them their effect in calling up in my mind the recollections of early times and scenes in which i had first heard them reminded him he said of the lines of his poor mend leyden to the scottish muse    in youths first morn alert and gay   ere rolling years had passed away     remembered like a morning dream   i heard the dulcet measures float   in many a liquid winding note     along the bank of teviots stream    sweet sounds that oft have soothed to rest   the sorrows of my guileless breast     and charmed away mine infant tears   fond memory shall your strains repeat   like distant echoes doubly sweet     that on the wild the traveller hears  scott went on to expatiate on the popular songs of scotland they are a part of our national inheritance said he and something that we may truly call our own they have no foreign taint they have the pure breath of the heather and the mountain breeze all genuine legitimate races that have descended from the ancient britons such as the scotch the welsh and the irish have national airs the english have none because they are not natives of the soil or at least are mongrels their music is all made up of foreign scraps like a harlequin jacket or a piece of mosaic even in scotland we have comparatively few national songs in the eastern part where we have had most influx of strangers a real old scottish song is a cairngorma gem of our own mountains or rather it is a precious relic of old times that bears the national character stamped upon itlike a cameo that shows what the national visage was in former days before the breed was crossed  while scott was thus discoursing we were passing up a narrow glen with the dogs beating about to right and left when suddenly a blackcock burst upon the wing  aha cried scott there will be a good shot for master walter we must send him this way with his gun when we go home walters the family sportsman now and keeps us in game i have pretty nigh resigned my gun to him for i find i cannot trudge about as briskly as formerly  our ramble took us on the hills commanding an extensive prospect now said scott i have brought you like the pilgrim in the pilgrims progress to the top of the delectable mountains that i may show you all the goodly regions hereabouts yonder is lammermuir and smalholme and there you have gallashiels and torwoodlie and gallawater and in that direction you see teviotdale and the braes of yarrow and ettrick stream winding along like a silver thread to throw itself into the tweed  he went on thus to call over names celebrated in scottish song and most of which had recently received a romantic interest from his own pen in fact i saw a great part of the border country spread out before me and could trace the scenes of those poems and romances which had in a manner bewitched the world i gazed about me for a time with mute surprise i may almost say with disappointment i beheld a mere succession of gray waving hills line beyond line as far as my eye could reach monotonous in their aspect and so destitute of trees that one could almost see a stout fly walking along their profile and the farfamed tweed appeared a naked stream flowing between bare hills without a tree or thicket on its banks and yet such had been the magic web of poetry and romance thrown over the whole that it had a greater charm for me than the richest scenery i beheld in england  i could not help giving utterance to my thoughts scott hummed for a moment to himself and looked grave he had no idea of having his muse complimented at the expense of his native hills it may be partiality said he at length but to my eye these gray bills and all this wild border country have beauties peculiar to themselves i like the very nakedness of the land it has something bold and stern and solitary about it when i have been for some time in the rich scenery about edinburgh which is like ornamented garden land i begin to wish myself back again among my own honest gray hills and if i did not see the heather at least once a year i think i should die  the last words were said with an honest warmth accompanied with a thump on the ground with his staff by way of emphasis that showed his heart was in his speech he vindicated the tweed too as a beautiful stream in itself and observed that he did not dislike it for being bare of trees probably from having been much of an angler in his time and an angler does not like to have a stream overhung by trees which embarrass him in the exercise of his rod and line  i took occasion to plead in like manner the associations of early life for my disappointment in respect to the surrounding scenery i had been so accustomed to hills crowned with forests and streams breaking their way through a wilderness of trees that all my ideas of romantic landscape were apt to be well wooded  aye and thats the great charm of your country cried scott you love the forest as i do the heatherbut i would not have you think i do not feel the glory of a great woodland prospect there is nothing i should like more than to be in the midst of one of your grand wild original forests with the idea of hundreds of miles of untrodden forest around me i once saw at leith an immense stick of timber just landed from america it must have been an enormous tree when it stood on its native soil at its full height and with all its branches i gazed at it with admiration it seemed like one of the gigantic obelisks which are now and then brought from egypt to shame the pigmy monuments of europe and in fact these vast aboriginal trees that have sheltered the indians before the intrusion of the white men are the monuments and antiquities of your country  the conversation here turned upon campbells poem of gertrude of wyoming as illustrative of the poetic materials furnished by american scenery scott spoke of it in that liberal style in which i always found him to speak of the writings of his contemporaries he cited several passages of it with great delight what a pity it is said he that campbell does not write more and oftener and give full sweep to his genius he has wings that would bear him to the skies and he does now and then spread them grandly but folds them up again and resumes his perch as if he was afraid to launch away he dont know or wont trust his own strength even when he has done a thing well he has often misgivings about it he left out several fine passages of his lochiel but i got him to restore some of them here scott repeated several passages in a magnificent style what a grand idea is that said he about prophetic boding or in common parlance second sight    coming events cast their shadows before  it is a noble thought and nobly expressed and theres that glorious little poem too of hohenlinden after he had written it he did not seem to think much of it but considered some of itdd drum and trumpet lines i got him to recite it to me and i believe that the delight i felt and expressed had an effect in inducing him to print it the fact is added he campbell is in a manner a bugbear to himself the brightness of his early success is a detriment to all his further efforts he is afraid of the shadow that his own fame casts before him  while we were thus chatting we heard the report of a gun among the hills thats walter i think said scott he has finished his mornings studies and is out with his gun i should not be surprised if he had met with the blackcock if so we shall have an addition to our larder for walter is a pretty sure shot i inquired into the nature of walters studies faith said scott i cant say much on that head i am not over bent upon making prodigies of any of my children as to walter i taught him while a boy to ride and shoot and speak the truth as to the other parts of his education i leave them to a very worthy young man the son of one of our clergymen who instructs all my children  i afterward became acquainted with the young man in question george thomson son of the minister of melrose and found him possessed of much learning intelligence and modest worth he used to come every day from his fathers residence at melrose to superintend the studies of the young folks and occasionally took his meals at abbotsford where he was highly esteemed nature had cut him out scott used to say for a stalwart soldier for he was tall vigorous active and fond of athletic exercises but accident had marred her work the loss of a limb in boyhood having reduced him to a wooden leg he was brought up therefore for the church whence he was occasionally called the dominie and is supposed by his mixture of learning simplicity and amiable eccentricity to have furnished many traits for the character of dominie sampson i believe he often acted as scotts amanuensis when composing his novels with him the young people were occupied in general during the early part of the day after which they took all kinds of healthful recreations in the open air for scott was as solicitous to strengthen their bodies as their minds  we had not walked much further before we saw the two miss scotts advancing along the hillside to meet us the morning studies being over they had set off to take a ramble on the hills and gather heather blossoms with which to decorate their hair for dinner as they came bounding lightly like young fawns and their dresses fluttering in the pure summer breeze i was reminded of scotts own description of his children in his introduction to one of the cantos of marmion    my imps though hardy bold and wild   as best befits the mountain child   their summer gambols tell and mourn   and anxious ask will spring return   and birds and lambs again be gay   and blossoms clothe the hawthorn spray    yes prattlers yes the daisys flower   again shall paint your summer bower   again the hawthorn shall supply   the garlands you delight to tie   the lambs upon the lea shall bound   the wild birds carol to the round   and while you frolic light as they   too short shall seem the summer day  as they approached the dogs all sprang forward and gambolled around them they played with them for a time and then joined us with countenances full of health and glee sophia the eldest was the most lively and joyous having much of her fathers varied spirit in conversation and seeming to catch excitement from his words and looks ann was of quieter mood rather silent owing in some measure no doubt to her being some years younger                                       at dinner scott had laid by his halfrustic dress and appeared clad in black the girls too in completing their toilet had twisted in their hair the sprigs of purple heather which they had gathered on the hillside and looked all fresh and blooming from their breezy walk  there was no guest at dinner but myself around the table were two or three dogs in attendance maida the old staghound took his seat at scotts elbow looking up wistfully in his masters eye while finette the pet spaniel placed herself near mrs scott by whom i soon perceived she was completely spoiled  the conversation happening to turn on the merits of his dogs scott spoke with great feeling and affection of his favorite camp who is depicted by his side in the earlier engravings of him he talked of him as of a real friend whom he had lost and sophia scott looking up archly in his face observed that papa shed a few tears when poor camp died i may here mention another testimonial of scotts fondness for his dogs and his humorous mode of showing it which i subsequently met with rambling with him one morning about the grounds adjacent to the house i observed a small antique monument on which was inscribed in gothic characters    cy git le preux percy here lies the brave percy  i paused supposing it to be the tomb of some stark warrior of the olden time but scott drew me on pooh cried he its nothing but one of the monuments of my nonsense of which youll find enough hereabouts i learnt afterward that it was the grave of a favorite greyhound among the other important and privileged members of the household who figured in attendance at the dinner was a large gray cat who i observed was regaled from time to time with titbits from the table this sage grimalkin was a favorite of both master and mistress and slept at night in their room and scott laughingly observed that one of the least wise parts of their establishment was that the window was left open at night for puss to go in and out the cat assumed a kind of ascendancy among the quadrupedssitting in state in scotts armchair and occasionally stationing himself on a chair beside the door as if to review his subjects as they passed giving each dog a cuff beside the ears as he went by this clapperclawing was always taken in good part it appeared to be in fact a mere act of sovereignty on the part of grimalkin to remind the others of their vassalage which they acknowledged by the most perfect acquiescence a general harmony prevailed between sovereign and subjects and they would all sleep together in the sunshine  scott was full of anecdote and conversation during dinner he made some admirable remarks upon the scottish character and spoke strongly in praise of the quiet orderly honest conduct of his neighbors which one would hardly expect said he from the descendants of moss troopers and borderers in a neighborhood famed in old times for brawl and feud and violence of all kinds he said he had in his official capacity of sheriff administered the laws for a number of years during which there had been very few trials the old feuds and local interests and rivalries and animosities of the scotch however still slept he said in their ashes and might easily be roused their hereditary feeling for names was still great it was not always safe to have even the game of football between villages the old clannish spirit was too apt to break out the scotch he said were more revengeful than the english they carried their resentments longer and would sometimes lay them by for years but would be sure to gratify them in the end  the ancient jealousy between the highlanders and the lowlanders still continued to a certain degree the former looking upon the latter as an inferior race less brave and hardy but at the same time suspecting them of a disposition to take airs upon themselves under the idea of superior refinement this made them techy and ticklish company for a stranger on his first coming among them ruffling up and putting themselves upon their mettle on the slightest occasion so that he had in a manner to quarrel and fight his way into their good graces  he instanced a case in point in a brother of mungo park who went to take up his residence in a wild neighborhood of the highlands he soon found himself considered as an intruder and that there was a disposition among these cocks of the hills to fix a quarrel on him trusting that being a lowlander he would show the white feather  for a time he bore their flings and taunts with great coolness until one presuming on his forbearance drew forth a dirk and holding it before him asked him if he had ever seen a weapon like that in his part of the country park who was a hercules in frame seized the dirk and with one blow drove it through an oaken tableyes replied he and tell your friends that a man from the lowlands drove it where the devil himself cannot draw it out again all persons were delighted with the feat and the words that accompanied it they drank with park to a better acquaintance and were staunch friends ever afterwards  after dinner we adjourned to the drawingroom which served also for study and library against the wall on one side was a long writing table with drawers surmounted by a small cabinet of polished wood with folding doors richly studded with brass ornaments within which scott kept his most valuable papers above the cabinet in a kind of niche was a complete corslet of glittering steel with a closed helmet and flanked by gauntlets and battleaxes around were hung trophies and relics of various kinds a cimeter of tippoo saib a highland broadsword from flodden field a pair of rippon spurs from bannockburn and above all a gun which had belonged to rob roy and bore his initials rmg an object of peculiar interest to me at the time as it was understood scott was actually engaged in printing a novel founded on the story of that famous outlaw  on each side of the cabinet were bookcases well stored with works of romantic fiction in various languages many of them rare and antiquated this however was merely his cottage library the principal part of his books being at edinburgh  from this little cabinet of curiosities scott drew forth a manuscript picked up on the field of waterloo containing copies of several songs popular at the time in france the paper was dabbled with bloodthe very lifeblood very possibly said scott of some gay young officer who had cherished these songs as a keepsake from some lady love in paris  he adverted in a mellow and delightful manner to the little halfgay halfmelancholy campaigning song said to have been composed by general wolfe and sung by him at the mess table on the eve of the storming of quebec in which he fell so gloriously    why soldiers why   should we be melancholy boys   why soldiers why   whose business tis to die   for should next campaign   send us to him who made us boys   were free from pain   but should we remain   a bottle and kind landlady   makes all well again  so added he the poor lad who fell at waterloo in all probability had been singing these songs in his tent the night before the battle and thinking of the fair dame who had taught him them and promising himself should he outlive the campaign to return to her all glorious from the wars  i find since that scott published translations of these songs among some of his smaller poems  the evening passed away delightfully in this quaintlooking apartment half study half drawingroom scott read several passages from the old romance of arthur with a fine deep sonorous voice and a gravity of tone that seemed to suit the antiquated blackletter volume it was a rich treat to hear such a work read by such a person and in such a place and his appearance as he sat reading in a large armed chair with his favorite hound maida at his feet and surrounded by books and relics and border trophies would have formed an admirable and most characteristic picture  while scott was reading the sage grimalkin already mentioned had taken his seat in a chair beside the fire and remained with fixed eye and grave demeanor as if listening to the reader i observed to scott that his cat seemed to have a blackletter taste in literature  ah said he these cats are a very mysterious kind of folk there is always more passing in their minds than we are aware of it comes no doubt from their being so familiar with witches and warlocks he went on to tell a little story about a gude man who was returning to his cottage one night when in a lonely outoftheway place he met with a funeral procession of cats all in mourning bearing one of their race to the grave in a coffin covered with a black velvet pall the worthy man astonished and halffrightened at so strange a pageant hastened home and told what he had seen to his wife and children scarce had he finished when a great black cat that sat beside the fire raised himself up exclaimed then i am king of the cats and vanished up the chimney the funeral seen by the gude man was one of the cat dynasty  our grimalkin here added scott sometimes reminds me of the story by the airs of sovereignty which he assumes and i am apt to treat him with respect from the idea that he may be a great prince incog and may some time or other come to the throne  in this way scott would make the habits and peculiarities of even the dumb animals about him subjects for humorous remark or whimsical story  our evening was enlivened also by an occasional song from sophia scott at the request of her father she never wanted to be asked twice but complied frankly and cheerfully her songs were all scotch sung without any accompaniment in a simple manner but with great spirit and expression and in their native dialects which gave them an additional charm it was delightful to hear her carol off in sprightly style and with an animated air some of those generousspirited old jacobite songs once current among the adherents of the pretender in scotland in which he is designated by the appellation of the young chevalier  these songs were much relished by scott notwithstanding his loyalty for the unfortunate chevalier has always been a hero of romance with him as he has with many other staunch adherents to the house of hanover now that the stuart line has lost all its terrors in speaking on the subject scott mentioned as a curious fact that among the papers of the chevalier which had been submitted by government to his inspection he had found a memorial to charles from some adherents in america dated 1778 proposing to set up his standard in the back settlements i regret that at the time i did not make more particular inquiries of scott on the subject the document in question however in all probability still exists among the pretenders papers which are in the possession of the british government in the course of the evening scott related the story of a whimsical picture hanging in the room which had been drawn for him by a lady of his acquaintance it represented the doleful perplexity of a wealthy and handsome young english knight of the olden time who in the course of a border foray had been captured and carried off to the castle of a hardheaded and highhanded old baron the unfortunate youth was thrown into a dungeon and a tall gallows erected before the castle gate for his execution when all was ready he was brought into the castle hall where the grim baron was seated in state with his warriors armed to the teeth around him and was given his choice either to swing on the gibbet or to marry the barons daughter the last may be thought an easy alternative but unfortunately the barons young lady was hideously ugly with a mouth from ear to ear so that not a suitor was to be had for her either for love or money and she was known throughout the border country by the name of mucklemouthed mag  the picture in question represented the unhappy dilemma of the handsome youth before him sat the grim baron with a face worthy of the father of such a daughter and looking daggers and ratsbane on one side of him was mucklemouthed mag with an amorous smile across the whole breadth of her countenance and a leer enough to turn a man to stone on the other side was the father confessor a sleek friar jogging the youths elbow and pointing to the gallows seen in perspective through the open portal  the story goes that after long laboring in mind between the altar and the halter the love of life prevailed and the youth resigned himself to the charms of mucklemouthed mag contrary to all the probabilities of romance the match proved a happy one the barons daughter if not beautiful was a most exemplary wife her husband was never troubled with any of those doubts and jealousies which sometimes mar the happiness of connubial life and was made the father of a fair and undoubtedly legitimate hue which still flourishes on the border  i give but a faint outline of the story from vague recollection it may perchance be more richly related elsewhere by some one who may retain something of the delightful humor with which scott recounted it  when i retired for the night i found it almost impossible to sleep the idea of being under the roof of scott of being on the borders of the tweed in the very centre of that region which had for some time past been the favorite scene of romantic fiction and above all the recollections of the ramble i had taken the company in which i had taken it and the conversation which had passed all fermented in my mind and nearly drove sleep from my pillow                                       on the following morning the sun darted his beams from over the hills through the low lattice window i rose at an early hour and looked out between the branches of eglantine which overhung the casement to my surprise scott was already up and forth seated on a fragment of stone and chatting with the workmen employed on the new building i had supposed after the time he had wasted upon me yesterday he would be closely occupied this morning but he appeared like a man of leisure who had nothing to do but bask in the sunshine and amuse himself  i soon dressed myself and joined him he talked about his proposed plans of abbotsford happy would it have been for him could he have contented himself with his delightful little vinecovered cottage and the simple yet hearty and hospitable style in which he lived at the time of my visit the great pile of abbotsford with the huge expense it entailed upon him of servants retainers guests and baronial style was a drain upon his purse a tax upon his exertions and a weight upon his mind that finally crushed him  as yet however all was in embryo and perspective and scott pleased himself with picturing out his future residence as he would one of the fanciful creations of his own romances it was one of his air castles he said which he was reducing to solid stone and mortar about the place were strewed various morsels from the ruins of melrose abbey which were to be incorporated in his mansion he had already constructed out of similar materials a kind of gothic shrine over a spring and had surmounted it by a small stone cross  among the relics from the abbey which lay scattered before us was a most quaint and antique little lion either of red stone or painted red which hit my fancy i forgot whose cognizance it was but i shall never forget the delightful observations concerning old melrose to which it accidentally gave rise the abbey was evidently a pile that called up all scotts poetic and romantic feelings and one to which he was enthusiastically attached by the most fanciful and delightful of his early associations he spoke of it i may say with affection there is no telling said he what treasures are hid in that glorious old pile it is a famous place for antiquarian plunder there are such rich bits of old time sculpture for the architect and old time story for the poet there is as rare picking in it as a stilton cheese and in the same tastethe mouldier the better  he went on to mention circumstances of mighty import connected with the abbey which had never been touched and which had even escaped the researches of johnny bower the heart of robert bruce the hero of scotland had been buried in it he dwelt on the beautiful story of bruces pious and chivalrous request in his dying hour that his heart might be carried to the holy land and placed in the holy sepulchre in fulfilment of a vow of pilgrimage and of the loyal expedition of sir james douglas to convey the glorious relic much might be made he said out of the adventures of sir james in that adventurous age of his fortunes in spain and his death in a crusade against the moors with the subsequent fortunes of the heart of robert bruce until it was brought back to its native land and enshrined within the holy walls of old melrose  as scott sat on a stone talking in this way and knocking with his staff against the little red lion which lay prostrate before him his gray eyes twinkled beneath his shagged eyebrows scenes images incidents kept breaking upon his mind as he proceeded mingled with touches of the mysterious and supernatural as connected with the heart of bruce it seemed as if a poem or romance were breaking vaguely on his imagination that he subsequently contemplated something of the kind as connected with this subject and with his favorite ruin of melrose is evident from his introduction to the monastery and it is a pity that he never succeeded in following out these shadowy but enthusiastic conceptions  a summons to breakfast broke off our conversation when i begged to recommend to scotts attention my friend the little red lion who had led to such an interesting topic and hoped he might receive some niche or station in the future castle worthy of his evident antiquity and apparent dignity scott assured me with comic gravity that the valiant little lion should be most honorably entertained i hope therefore that he still flourishes at abbotsford  before dismissing the theme of the relics from the abbey i will mention another illustrative of scotts varied humors this was a human skull which had probably belonged of yore to one of those jovial friars so honorably mentioned in the old border ballad    o the monks of melrose made gude kale   on fridays when they fasted   they wanted neither beef nor ale   as long as their neighbors lasted  this skull he had caused to be cleaned and varnished and placed it on a chest of drawers in his chamber immediately opposite his bed where i have seen it grinning most dismally it was an object of great awe and horror to the superstitious housemaids and scott used to amuse himself with their apprehensions sometimes in changing his dress he would leave his neckcloth coiled round it like a turban and none of the lasses dared to remove it it was a matter of great wonder and speculation among them that the laird should have such an awsome fancy for an auld girning skull  at breakfast that morning scott gave an amusing account of a little highlander called campbell of the north who had a lawsuit of many years standing with a nobleman in his neighborhood about the boundaries of their estates it was the leading object of the little mans life the running theme of all his conversations he used to detail all the circumstances at full length to everybody he met and to aid him in his description of the premises and make his story mair preceese he had a great map made of his estate a huge roll several feet long which he used to carry about on his shoulder campbell was a longbodied but short and bandylegged little man always clad in the highland garb and as he went about with this great roll on his shoulder and his little legs curving like a pair of parentheses below his kilt he was an odd figure to behold he was like little david shouldering the spear of goliath which was like unto a weavers beam  whenever sheepshearing was over campbell used to set out for edinburgh to attend to his lawsuit at the inns he paid double for all his meals and his nights lodgings telling the landlords to keep it in mind until his return so that he might come back that way at free cost for he knew he said that he would spend all his money among the lawyers at edinburgh so he thought it best to secure a retreat home again  on one of his visits he called upon his lawyer but was told he was not at home but his lady was its just the same thing said little campbell on being shown into the parlor he unrolled his map stated his case at full length and having gone through with his story gave her the customary fee she would have declined it but he insisted on her taking it i ha had just as much pleasure said he in telling the whole tale to you as i should have had in telling it to your husband and i believe full as much profit  the last time he saw scott he told him he believed he and the laird were near a settlement as they agreed to within a few miles of the boundary if i recollect right scott added that he advised the little man to consign his cause and his map to the care of slow willie mowbray of tedious memory an edinburgh worthy much employed by the country people for he tired out everybody in office by repeated visits and drawling endless prolixity and gained every suit by dint of boring  these little stories and anecdotes which abounded in scotts conversation rose naturally out of the subject arid were perfectly unforced though in thus relating them in a detached way without the observations or circumstances which led to them and which have passed from my recollection they want their setting to give them proper relief they will serve however to show the natural play of his mind in its familiar moods and its fecundity in graphic and characteristic detail  his daughter sophia and his son charles were those of his family who seemed most to feel and understand his humors and to take delight in his conversation mrs scott did not always pay the same attention and would now and then make a casual remark which would operate a little like a damper thus one morning at breakfast when dominie thomson the tutor was present scott was going on with great glee to relate an anecdote of the laird of macnab who poor fellow premised he is dead and gone why mr scott exclaimed the good lady macnabs not dead is he faith my dear replied scott with humorous gravity if hes not dead theyve done him great injusticefor theyve buried him  the joke passed harmless and unnoticed by mrs scott but hit the poor dominie just as he had raised a cup of tea to his lips causing a burst of laughter which sent half of the contents about the table after breakfast scott was occupied for some time correcting proofsheets which he had received by the mail the novel of rob roy as i have already observed was at that time in the press and i supposed them to be the proofsheets of that work the authorship of the waverley novels was still a matter of conjecture and uncertainty though few doubted their being principally written by scott one proof to me of his being the author was that he never adverted to them a man so fond of anything scottish and anything relating to national history or local legend could not have been mute respecting such productions had they been written by another he was fond of quoting the works of his contemporaries he was continually reciting scraps of border songs or relating anecdotes of border story with respect to his own poems and their merits however he was mute and while with him i observed a scrupulous silence on the subject  i may here mention a singular fact of which i was not aware at the time that scott was very reserved with his children respecting his own writings and was even disinclined to their reading his romantic poems i learnt this some time after from a passage in one of his letters to me adverting to a set of the american miniature edition of his poems which on my return to england i forwarded to one of the young ladies in my hurry writes he i have not thanked you in sophias name for the kind attention which furnished her with the american volumes i am not quite sure i can add my own since you have made her acquainted with much more of papas folly than she would otherwise have learned for i have taken special care they should never see any of these things during their earlier years  to return to the thread of my narrative when scott had got through his brief literary occupation we set out on a ramble the young ladies started to accompany us but they had not gone far when they met a poor old laborer and his distressed family and turned back to take them to the house and relieve them  on passing the bounds of abbotsford we came upon a bleaklooking farm with a forlorn crazy old manse or farmhouse standing in naked desolation this however scott told me was an ancient hereditary property called lauckend about as valuable as the patrimonial estate of don quixote and which in like manner conferred an hereditary dignity upon its proprietor who was a laird and though poor as a rat prided himself upon his ancient blood and the standing of his house he was accordingly called lauckend according to the scottish custom of naming a man after his family estate but he was more generally known through the country round by the name of lauckie long legs from the length of his limbs while scott was giving this account of him we saw him at a distance striding along one of his fields with his plaid fluttering about him and he seemed well to deserve his appellation for he looked all legs and tartan  lauckie knew nothing of the world beyond his neighborhood scott told me that on returning to abbotsford from his visit to france immediately after the war he was called on by his neighbors generally to inquire after foreign parts among the number came lauckie long legs and an old brother as ignorant as himself they had many inquiries to make about the french whom they seemed to consider some remote and semibarbarous hordeand what like are thae barbarians in their own country said lauckie can they writecan they cipher he was quite astonished to learn that they were nearly as much advanced in civilization as the gude folks of abbotsford  after living for a long time in single blessedness lauckie all at once and not long before my visit to the neighborhood took it into his head to get married the neighbors were all surprised but the family connection who were as proud as they were poor were grievously scandalized for they thought the young woman on whom he had set his mind quite beneath him it was in vain however that they remonstrated on the misalliance he was about to make he was not to be swayed from his determination arraying himself in his best and saddling a gaunt steed that might have rivalled rosinante and placing a pillion behind his saddle he departed to wed and bring home the humble lassie who was to be made mistress of the venerable hovel of lauckend and who lived in a village on the opposite side of the tweed  a small event of the kind makes a great stir in a little quiet country neighborhood the word soon circulated through the village of melrose and the cottages in its vicinity that lauckie long legs had gone over the tweed to fetch home his bride all the good folks assembled at the bridge to await his return lauckie however disappointed them for he crossed the river at a distant ford and conveyed his bride safe to his mansion without being perceived let me step forward in the course of events and relate the fate of poor lauckie as it was communicated to me a year or two afterward in letter by scott from the time of his marriage he had no longer any peace owing to the constant intermeddling of his relations who would not permit him to be happy in his own way but endeavored to set him at variance with his wife lauckie refused to credit any of their stories to her disadvantage but the incessant warfare he had to wage in defence of her good name wore out both flesh and spirit his last conflict was with his own brothers in front of his paternal mansion a furious scolding match took place between them lauckie made a vehement profession of faith in favor of her immaculate honesty and then fell dead at the threshold of his own door his person his character his name his story and his fate entitled him to be immortalized in one of scotts novels and i looked to recognize him in some of the succeeding works from his pen but i looked in vain                                       after passing by the domains of honest lauckie scott pointed out at a distance the eildon stone there in ancient days stood the eildon tree beneath which thomas the rhymer according to popular tradition dealt forth his prophecies some of which still exist in antiquated ballads    here we turned up a little glen with a small burn or brook whimpering and dashing along it making an occasional waterfall and overhung in some places with mountain ash and weeping birch we are now said scott treading classic or rather fairy ground this is the haunted glen of thomas the rhymer where he met with the queen of fairy land and this the bogle burn or goblin brook along which she rode on her dapplegray palfrey with silver bells ringing at the bridle  here said he pausing is huntley bank on which thomas the rhymer lay musing and sleeping when he saw or dreamt he saw the queen of elfland    true thomas lay on huntlie bank   a ferlie he spied wi his ee   and there he saw a ladye bright   come riding down by the eildon tree    her skirt was o the grassgreen silk   her mantle o the velvet fyne   at ilka tett of her horses mane   hung fifty siller bells and nine  here scott repeated several of the stanzas and recounted the circumstance of thomas the rhymers interview with the fairy and his being transported by her to fairy land    and til seven years were gone and past   true thomas on earth was never seen  its a fine old story said he and might be wrought up into a capital tale  scott continued on leading the way as usual and limping up the wizard glen talking as he went but as his back was toward me i could only hear the deep growling tones of his voice like the low breathing of an organ without distinguishing the words until pausing and turning his face toward me i found he was reciting some scrap of border minstrelsy about thomas the rhymer this was continually the case in my ramblings with him about this storied neighborhood his mind was fraught with the traditionary fictions connected with every object around him and he would breathe it forth as he went apparently as much for his own gratification as for that of his companion    nor hill nor brook we paced along    but had its legend or its song  his voice was deep and sonorous he spoke with a scottish accent and with somewhat of the northumbrian burr which to my mind gave a doric strength and simplicity to his elocution his recitation of poetry was at times magnificent  i think it was in the course of this ramble that my friend hamlet the black greyhound got into a bad scrape the dogs were beating about the glens and fields as usual and had been for some time out of sight when we heard a barking at some distance to the left shortly after we saw some sheep scampering on the hills with the dogs after them scott applied to his lips the ivory whistle always hanging at his button hole and soon called in the culprits excepting hamlet hastening up a bank which commanded a view along a fold or hollow of the hills we beheld the sable prince of denmark standing by the bleeding body of a sheep the carcass was still warm the throat bore marks of the fatal grip and hamlets muzzle was stained with blood never was culprit more completely caught in flagrante delicto i supposed the doom of poor hamlet to be sealed for no higher offence can be committed by a dog in a country abounding with sheepwalks scott however had a greater value for his dogs than for his sheep they were his companions and friends hamlet too though an irregular impertinent kind of youngster was evidently a favorite he would not for some time believe it could be he who had killed the sheep it must have been some cur of the neighborhood that had made off on our approach and left poor hamlet in the lurch proofs however were too strong and hamlet was generally condemned well well said scott its partly my own fault i have given up coursing for some time past and the poor dog has had no chance after game to take the fire edge off of him if he was put after a hare occasionally he never would meddle with sheep  i understood afterward that scott actually got a pony and went out now and then coursing with hamlet who in consequence showed no further inclination for mutton                                       a further stroll among the hills brought us to what scott pronounced the remains of a roman camp and as we sat upon a hillock which had once formed a part of the ramparts he pointed out the traces of the lines and bulwarks and the pratorium and showed a knowledge of castramatation that would not have disgraced the antiquarian oldbuck himself indeed various circumstances that i observed about scott during my visit concurred to persuade me that many of the antiquarian humors of monkbarns were taken from his own richly compounded character and that some of the scenes and personages of that admirable novel were furnished by his immediate neighborhood  he gave me several anecdotes of a noted pauper named andrew gemmells or gammel as it was pronounced who had once flourished on the banks of galla water immediately opposite abbotsford and whom he had seen and talked and joked with when a boy and i instantly recognized the likeness of that mirror of philosophic vagabonds and nestor of beggars edie ochiltree i was on the point of pronouncing the name and recognizing the portrait when i recollected the incognito observed by scott with respect to his novels and checked myself but it was one among many things that tended to convince me of his authorship  his picture of andrew gemmells exactly accorded with that of edie as to his height carriage and soldierlike air as well as his arch and sarcastic humor his home if home he had was at galashiels but he went daundering about the country along the green shaws and beside the burns and was a kind of walking chronicle throughout the valleys of the tweed the ettrick and the yarrow carrying the gossip from house to house commenting on the inhabitants and their concerns and never hesitating to give them a dry rub as to any of their faults or follies  a shrewd beggar like andrew gemmells scott added who could sing the old scotch airs tell stories and traditions and gossip away the long winter evenings was by no means an unwelcome visitor at a lonely manse or cottage the children would run to welcome him and place his stool in a warm corner of the ingle nook and the old folks would receive him as a privileged guest  as to andrew he looked upon them all as a parson does upon his parishioners and considered the alms he received as much his due as the other does his tithes i rather think added scott andrew considered himself more of a gentleman than those who toiled for a living and that he secretly looked down upon the painstaking peasants that fed and sheltered him  he had derived his aristocratical notions in some degree from being admitted occasionally to a precarious sociability with some of the small country gentry who were sometimes in want of company to help while away the time with these andrew would now and then play at cards and dice and he never lacked siller in pouch to stake on a game which he did with a perfect air of a man to whom money was a matter of little moment and no one could lose his money with more gentlemanlike coolness  among those who occasionally admitted him to this familiarity was old john scott of galla a man of family who inhabited his paternal mansion of torwoodlee some distinction of rank however was still kept up the laird sat on the inside of the window and the beggar on the outside and they played cards on the sill  andrew now and then told the laird a piece of his mind very freely especially on one occasion when he had sold some of his paternal lands to build himself a larger house with the proceeds the speech of honest andrew smacks of the shrewdness of edie ochiltree  its a varra weelits a varra weel torwoodlee said he but who would ha thought that your fathers son would ha sold two gude estates to build a shaws cuckoos nest on the side of a hill                                       that day there was an arrival at abbotsford of two english tourists one a gentleman of fortune and landed estate the other a young clergyman whom he appeared to have under his patronage and to have brought with him as a travelling companion  the patron was one of those wellbred commonplace gentlemen with which england is overrun he had great deference for scott and endeavored to acquit himself learnedly in his company aiming continually at abstract disquisitions for which scott had little relish the conversation of the latter as usual was studded with anecdotes and stories some of them of great pith and humor the wellbred gentleman was either too dull to feel their point or too decorous to indulge in hearty merriment the honest parson on the contrary who was not too refined to be happy laughed loud and long at every joke and enjoyed them with the zest of a man who has more merriment in his heart than coin in his pocket  after they were gone some comments were made upon their different deportments scott spoke very respectfully of the good breeding and measured manners of the man of wealth but with a kindlier feeling of the honest parson and the homely but hearty enjoyment with which he relished every pleasantry i doubt said he whether the parsons lot in life is not the best if he cannot command as many of the good things of this world by his own purse as his patron can he beats him all hollow in his enjoyment of them when set before him by others upon the whole added he i rather think i prefer the honest parsons good humor to his patrons good breeding i have a great regard for a hearty laugher  he went on to speak of the great influx of english travellers which of late years had inundated scotland and doubted whether they had not injured the oldfashioned scottish character formerly they came here occasionally as sportsmen said he to shoot moor game without any idea of looking at scenery and they moved about the country in hardy simple style coping with the country people in their own way but now they come rolling about in their equipages to see ruins and spend money and their lavish extravagance has played the vengeance with the common people it has made them rapacious in their dealings with strangers greedy after money and extortionate in their demands for the most trivial services formerly continued he the poorer classes of our people were comparatively disinterested they offered their services gratuitously in promoting the amusement or aiding the curiosity of strangers and were gratified by the smallest compensation but now they make a trade of showing rocks and ruins and are as greedy as italian cicerones they look upon the english as so many walking moneybags the more they are shaken and poked the more they will leave behind them  i told him that he had a great deal to answer for on that head since it was the romantic associations he had thrown by his writings over so many outoftheway places in scotland that had brought in the influx of curious travellers  scott laughed and said he believed i might be in some measure in the right as he recollected a circumstance in point being one time at glenross an old woman who kept a small inn which had but little custom was uncommonly officious in her attendance upon him and absolutely incommoded him with her civilities the secret at length came out as he was about to depart she addressed him with many curtsies and said she understood he was the gentleman that had written a bonnie book about loch katrine she begged him to write a little about their lake also for she understood his book had done the inn at loch katrine a muckle deal of good  on the following day i made an excursion with scott and the young ladies to dryburgh abbey we went in an open carriage drawn by two sleek old black horses for which scott seemed to have an affection as he had for every dumb animal that belonged to him our road lay through a variety of scenes rich in poetical and historical associations about most of which scott had something to relate in one part of the drive he pointed to an old border keep or fortress on the summit of a naked hill several miles off which he called smallholm tower and a rocky knoll on which it stood the sandy knowe crags it was a place he said peculiarly dear to him from the recollections of childhood his father had lived there in the old smallholm grange or farmhouse and he had been sent there when but two years old on account of his lameness that he might have the benefit of the pure air of the hills and be under the care of his grandmother and aunts in the introduction of one of the cantos of marmion he has depicted his grandfather and the fireside of the farmhouse and has given an amusing picture of himself in his boyish years    still with vain fondness could i trace   anew each kind familiar face   that brightened at our evening fire   from the thatched mansions grayhaired sire   wise without learning plain and good   and sprung of scotlands gentler blood   whose eye in age quick clear and keen   showed what in youth its glance had been   whose doom discording neighbors sought   content with equity unbought   to him the venerable priest   our frequent and familiar guest   whose life and manners well could paint   alike the student and the saint   alas whose speech too oft i broke   with gambol rude and timeless joke   for i was wayward bold and wild   a selfwilled imp a grandames child   but half a plague and half a jest   was still endured beloved carest  it was he said during his residence at smallholm crags that he first imbibed his passion for legendary tales border traditions and old national songs and ballads his grandmother and aunts were well versed in that kind of lore so current in scottish country life they used to recount them in long gloomy winter days and about the ingle nook at night in conclave with their gossip visitors and little walter would sit and listen with greedy ear thus taking into his infant mind the seeds of many a splendid fiction  there was an old shepherd he said in the service of the family who used to sit under the sunny wall and tell marvellous stories and recite old time ballads as he knitted stockings scott used to be wheeled out in his chair in fine weather and would sit beside the old man and listen to him for hours  the situation of sandy knowe was favorable both for storyteller and listener it commanded a wide view over all the border country with its feudal towers its haunted glens and wizard streams as the old shepherd told his tales he could point out the very scene of action thus before scott could walk he was made familiar with the scenes of his future stories they were all seen as through a magic medium and took that tinge of romance which they ever after retained in his imagination from the height of sandy knowe he may be said to have had the first lookout upon the promised land of his future glory  on referring to scotts works i find many of the circumstances related in this conversation about the old tower and the boyish scenes connected with it recorded in the introduction to marmion already cited this was frequently the case with scott incidents and feelings that had appeared in his writings were apt to be mingled up in his conversation for they had been taken from what he had witnessed and felt in real life and were connected with those scenes among which he lived and moved and had his being i make no scruple at quoting the passage relative to the tower though it repeats much of the foregone imagery and with vastly superior effect    thus while i ape the measure wild   of tales that charmed me yet a child   rude though they be still with the chime   return the thoughts of early time   and feelings roused in lifes first day   glow in the line and prompt the lay   then rise those crags that mountain tower   which charmed my fancys wakening hour   though no broad river swept along   to claim perchance heroic song   though sighed no groves in summer gale   to prompt of love a softer tale   though scarce a puny streamlets speed   claimed homage from a shepherds reed   yet was poetic impulse given   by the green hill and clear blue heaven   it was a barren scene and wild   where naked cliffs were rudely piled   but ever and anon between   lay velvet tufts of loveliest green   and well the lonely infant knew   recesses where the wallflower grew   and honeysuckle loved to crawl   up the low crag and ruined wall   i deemed such nooks the sweetest shade   the sun in all his round surveyed   and still i thought that shattered tower   the mightiest work of human power   and marvelld as the aged hind   with some strange tale bewitched my mind   of forayers who with headlong force   down from that strength had spurred their horse   their southern rapine to renew   far in the distant cheviots blue   and home returning filled the hall   with revel wassailrout and brawl   methought that still with tramp and clang   the gateways broken arches rang   methought grim features seamed with scars   glared through the windows rusty bars   and ever by the winter hearth   old tales i heard of woe or mirth   of lovers slights of ladies charms   of witches spells of warriors arms   of patriot battles won of old   by wallace wight and bruce the bold   of later fields of feud and fight   when pouring from the highland height   the scottish clans in headlong sway   had swept the scarlet ranks away   while stretched at length upon the floor   again i fought each combat oer   pebbles and shells in order laid   the mimic ranks of war displayed   and onward still the scottish lion bore   and still the scattered southron fled before  scott eyed the distant height of sandy knowe with an earnest gaze as we rode along and said he had often thought of buying the place repairing the old tower and making it his residence he has in some measure however paid off his early debt of gratitude in clothing it with poetic and romantic associations by his tale of the eve of st john it is to be hoped that those who actually possess so interesting a monument of scotts early days will preserve it from further dilapidation  not far from sandy knowe scott pointed out another old border hold standing on the summit of a hill which had been a kind of enchanted castle to him in his boyhood it was the tower of bemerside the baronial residence of the haigs or de hagas one of the oldest families of the border there had seemed to him he said almost a wizard spell hanging over it in consequence of a prophecy of thomas the rhymer in which in his young days he most potently believed    betide betide whateer betide   haig shall be haig of bemerside  scott added some particulars which showed that in the present instance the venerable thomas had not proved a false prophet for it was a noted fact that amid all the changes and chances of the border through all the feuds and forays and sackings and burnings which had reduced most of the castles to ruins and the proud families that once possessed them to poverty the tower of bemerside still remained unscathed and was still the stronghold of the ancient family of haig  prophecies however often insure their own fulfilment it is very probable that the prediction of thomas the rhymer has linked the haigs to their tower as their rock of safety and has induced them to cling to it almost superstitiously through hardships and inconveniences that would otherwise have caused its abandonment  i afterwards saw at dryburgh abbey the burying place of this predestinated and tenacious family the inscription of which showed the value they set upon their antiquity    locus sepultura antiquessima familia de haga de bemerside  in reverting to the days of his childhood scott observed that the lameness which had disabled him in infancy gradually decreased he soon acquired strength in his limbs and though he always limped he became even in boyhood a great walker he used frequently to stroll from home and wander about the country for days together picking up all kinds of local gossip and observing popular scenes and characters his father used to be vexed with him for this wandering propensity and shaking his head would say he fancied the boy would make nothing but a peddler as he grew older he became a keen sportsman and passed much of his time hunting and shooting his field sports led him into the most wild and unfrequented parts of the country and in this way he picked up much of that local knowledge which he has since evinced in his writings  his first visit to loch katrine he says was in his boyish days on a shooting excursion the island which he has made the romantic residence of the lady of the lake was then garrisoned by an old man and his wife their house was vacant they had put the key under the door and were absent fishing it was at that time a peaceful residence but became afterward a resort of smugglers until they were ferreted out  in after years when scott began to turn this local knowledge to literary account he revisited many of those scenes of his early ramblings and endeavored to secure the fugitive remains of the traditions and songs that had charmed his boyhood when collecting materials for his border minstrelsy he used he said to go from cottage to cottage and make the old wives repeat all they knew if but two lines and by putting these scraps together he retrieved many a fine characteristic old ballad or tradition from oblivion  i regret to say that i can scarce recollect anything of our visit to dryburgh abbey it is on the estate of the earl of buchan the religious edifice is a mere ruin rich in gothic antiquities but especially interesting to scott from containing the family vault and the tombs and monuments of his ancestors he appeared to feel much chagrin at their being in the possession and subject to the intermeddlings of the earl who was represented as a nobleman of an eccentric character the latter however set great value on these sepulchral relics and had expressed a lively anticipation of one day or other having the honor of burying scott and adding his monument to the collection which he intended should be worthy of the mighty minstrel of the northa prospective compliment which was by no means relished by the object of it one of my pleasant rambles with scott about the neighborhood of abbotsford was taken in company with mr william laidlaw the steward of his estate this was a gentleman for whom scott entertained a particular value he had been born to a competency had been well educated his mind was richly stored with varied information and he was a man of sterling moral worth having been reduced by misfortune scott had got him to take charge of his estate he lived at a small farm on the hillside above abbotsford and was treated by scott as a cherished and confidential friend rather than a dependent  as the day was showery scott was attended by one of his retainers named tommie purdie who carried his plaid and who deserves especial mention sophia scott used to call him her fathers grand vizier and she gave a playful account one evening as she was hanging on her fathers arm of the consultations which he and tommie used to have about matters relative to farming purdie was tenacious of his opinions and he and scott would have long disputes in front of the house as to something that was to be done on the estate until the latter fairly tired out would abandon the ground and the argument exclaiming well well tom have it your own way  after a time however purdie would present himself at the door of the parlor and observe i ha been thinking over the matter and upon the whole i think ill take your honors advice  scott laughed heartily when this anecdote was told of him it was with him and tom he said as it was with an old laird and a pet servant whom he had indulged until he was positive beyond all endurance this wont do cried the old laird in a passion we cant live together any longerwe must part an where the deil does your honor mean to go replied the other  i would moreover observe of tom purdie that he was a firm believer in ghosts and warlocks and all kinds of old wives fable he was a religious man too mingling a little degree of scottish pride in his devotion for though his salary was but twenty pounds a year he had managed to afford seven pounds for a family bible it is true he had one hundred pounds clear of the world and was looked up to by his comrades as a man of property  in the course of our mornings walk we stopped at a small house belonging to one of the laborers on the estate the object of scotts visit was to inspect a relic which had been digged up in a roman camp and which if i recollect right he pronounced to have been a tongs it was produced by the cottagers wife a ruddy healthylooking dame whom scott addressed by the name of ailie as he stood regarding the relic turning it round and round and making comments upon it half grave half comic with the cottage group around him all joining occasionally in the colloquy the inimitable character of monkbarns was again brought to mind and i seemed to see before me that prince of antiquarians and humorists holding forth to his unlearned and unbelieving neighbors  whenever scott touched in this way upon local antiquities and in all his familiar conversations about local traditions and superstitions there was always a sly and quiet humor running at the bottom of his discourse and playing about his countenance as if he sported with the subject it seemed to me as if he distrusted his own enthusiasm and was disposed to droll upon his own humors and peculiarities yet at the same time a poetic gleam in his eye would show that he really took a strong relish and interest in them it was a pity he said that antiquarians were generally so dry for the subjects they handled were rich in historical and poetical recollections in picturesque details in quaint and heroic characteristics and in all kinds of curious and obsolete ceremonials they are always groping among the rarest materials for poetry but they have no idea of turning them to poetic use now every fragment from old times has in some degree its story with it or gives an inkling of something characteristic of the circumstances and manners of its day and so sets the imagination at work  for my own part i never met with antiquarian so delightful either in his writings or his conversation and the quiet subacid humor that was prone to mingle in his disquisitions gave them to me a peculiar and an exquisite flavor but he seemed in fact to undervalue everything that concerned himself the play of his genius was so easy that he was unconscious of its mighty power and made light of those sports of intellect that shamed the efforts and labors of other minds  our ramble this morning took us again up the rhymers glen and by huntley bank and huntley wood and the silver waterfall overhung with weeping birches and mountain ashes those delicate and beautiful trees which grace the green shaws and burnsides of scotland the heather too that closely woven robe of scottish landscape which covers the nakedness of its hills and mountains tinted the neighborhood with soft and rich colors as we ascended the glen the prospects opened upon us melrose with its towers and pinnacles lay below beyond were the eildon hills the cowden knowes the tweed the galla water and all the storied vicinity the whole landscape varied by gleams of sunshine and driving showers  scott as usual took the lead limping along with great activity and in joyous mood giving scraps of border rhymes and border stories two or three times in the course of our walk there were drizzling showers which i supposed would put an end to our ramble but my companions trudged on as unconcernedly as if it had been fine weather  at length i asked whether we had not better seek some shelter true said scott i did not recollect that you were not accustomed to our scottish mists this is a lachrymose climate evermore showering we however are children of the mist and must not mind a little whimpering of the clouds any more than a man must mind the weeping of an hysterical wife as you are not accustomed to be wet through as a matter of course in a mornings walk we will bide a bit under the lee of this bank until the shower is over taking his seat under shelter of a thicket he called to his man george for his tartan then turning to me come said he come under my plaidy as the old song goes so making me nestle down beside him he wrapped a part of the plaid round me and took me as he said under his wing while we were thus nestled together he pointed to a hole in the opposite bank of the glen that he said was the hole of an old gray badger who was doubtless snugly housed in this bad weather sometimes he saw him at the entrance of his hole like a hermit at the door of his cell telling his beads or reading a homily he had a great respect for the venerable anchorite and would not suffer him to be disturbed he was a kind of successor to thomas the rhymer and perhaps might be thomas himself returned from fairy land but still under fairy spell  some accident turned the conversation upon hogg the poet in which laidlaw who was seated beside us took a part hogg had once been a shepherd in the service of his father and laidlaw gave many interesting anecdotes of him of which i now retain no recollection they used to tend the sheep together when laidlaw was a boy and hogg would recite the first struggling conceptions of his muse at night when laidlaw was quartered comfortably in bed in the farmhouse poor hogg would take to the shepherds hut in the field on the hillside and there lie awake for hours together and look at the stars and make poetry which he would repeat the next day to his companion  scott spoke in warm terms of hogg and repeated passages from his beautiful poem of kelmeny to which he gave great and wellmerited praise he gave also some amusing anecdotes of hogg and his publisher blackwood who was at that time just rising into the bibliographical importance which he has since enjoyed  hogg in one of his poems i believe the pilgrims of the sun had dabbled a little in metaphysics and like his heroes had got into the clouds blackwood who began to affect criticism argued stoutly with him as to the necessity of omitting or elucidating some obscure passage hogg was immovable  but man said blackwood i dinna ken what ye mean in this passage hout tout man replied hogg impatiently i dinna ken always what i mean mysel there is many a metaphysical poet in the same predicament with honest hogg  scott promised to invite the shepherd to abbotsford during my visit and i anticipated much gratification in meeting with him from the account i had received of his character and manners and the great pleasure i had derived from his works circumstances however prevented scott from performing his promise and to my great regret i left scotland without seeing one of its most original and national characters  when the weather held up we continued our walk until we came to a beautiful sheet of water in the bosom of the mountain called if i recollect right the lake of cauldshiel scott prided himself much upon this little mediterranean sea in his dominions and hoped i was not too much spoiled by our great lakes in america to relish it he proposed to take me out to the centre of it to a fine point of view for which purpose we embarked in a small boat which had been put on the lake by his neighbor lord somerville as i was about to step on board i observed in large letters on one of the benches search no 2 i paused for a moment and repeated the inscription aloud trying to recollect something i had heard or read to which it alluded pshaw cried scott it is only some of lord somervilles nonsenseget in in an instant scenes in the antiquary connected with search no 1 flashed upon my mind ah i remember now said i and with a laugh took my seat but adverted no more to the circumstance  we had a pleasant row about the lake which commanded some pretty scenery the most interesting circumstance connected with it however according to scott was that it was haunted by a bogle in the shape of a water bull which lived in the deep parts and now and then came forth upon dry land and made a tremendous roaring that shook the very hills this story had been current in the vicinity from time immemorialthere was a man living who declared he had seen the bull and he was believed by many of his simple neighbors i dont choose to contradict the tale said scott for i am willing to have my lake stocked with any fish flesh or fowl that my neighbors think proper to put into it and these old wives fables are a kind of property in scotland that belongs to the estates and goes with the soil our streams and lochs are like the rivers and pools in germany that have all their wasser nixe or water witches and i have a fancy for these kind of amphibious bogles and hobgoblins                                       scott went on after we had landed to make many remarks mingled with picturesque anecdotes concerning the fabulous beings with which the scotch were apt to people the wild streams and lochs that occur in the solemn and lonely scenes of their mountains and to compare them with similar superstitions among the northern nations of europe but scotland he said was above all other countries for this wild and vivid progeny of the fancy from the nature of the scenery the misty magnificence and vagueness of the climate the wild and gloomy events of its history the clannish divisions of its people their local feelings notions and prejudices the individuality of their dialect in which all kinds of odd and peculiar notions were incorporated by the secluded life of their mountaineers the lonely habits of their pastoral people much of whose time was passed on the solitary hillsides their traditional songs which clothed every rock and stream with old world stories handed down from age to age and generation to generation the scottish mind he said was made up of poetry and strong common sense and the very strength of the latter gave perpetuity and luxuriance to the former it was a strong tenacious soil into which when once a seed of poetry fell it struck deep root and brought forth abundantly you will never weed these popular stories and songs and superstitions out of scotland said he it is not so much that the people believe in them as that they delight in them they belong to the native hills and streams of which they are fond and to the history of their forefathers of which they are proud  it would do your heart good continued he to see a number of our poor country people seated round the ingle nook which is generally capacious enough and passing the long dark dreary winter nights listening to some old wife or strolling gaberlunzie dealing out auld world stories about bogles and warlocks or about raids and forays and border skirmishes or reciting some ballad stuck full of those fighting names that stir up a true scotchmans blood like the sound of a trumpet these traditional tales and ballads have lived for ages in mere oral circulation being passed from father to son or rather from grandam to grandchild and are a kind of hereditary property of the poor peasantry of which it would be hard to deprive them as they have not circulating libraries to supply them with works of fiction in their place  i do not pretend to give the precise words but as nearly as i can from scanty memorandums and vague recollections the leading ideas of scott i am constantly sensible however how far i fall short of his copiousness and richness  he went on to speak of the elves and sprites so frequent in scottish legend our fairies however said he though they dress in green and gambol by moonlight about the banks and shaws and burnsides are not such pleasant little folks as the english fairies but are apt to bear more of the warlock in their natures and to play spiteful tricks when i was a boy i used to look wistfully at the green hillocks that were said to be haunted by fairies and felt sometimes as if i should like to lie down by them and sleep and be carried off to fairy land only that i did not like some of the cantrips which used now and then to be played off upon visitors  here scott recounted in graphic style and with much humor a little story which used to be current in the neighborhood of an honest burgess of selkirk who being at work upon the hill of peatlaw fell asleep upon one of these fairy knowes or hillocks when he awoke he rubbed his eyes and gazed about him with astonishment for he was in the marketplace of a great city with a crowd of people bustling about him not one of whom he knew at length he accosted a bystander and asked him the name of the place hout man replied the other are ye in the heart o glasgow and speer the name of it the poor man was astonished and would not believe either ears or eyes he insisted that he had lain down to sleep but half an hour before on the peatlaw near selkirk he came wellnigh being taken up for a madman when fortunately a selkirk man came by who knew him and took charge of him and conducted him back to his native place here however he was likely to fare no better when he spoke of having been whisked in his sleep from the peatlaw to glasgow the truth of the matter at length came out his coat which he had taken off when at work on the peatlaw was found lying near a fairy knowe and his bonnet which was missing was discovered on the weathercock of lanark steeple so it was as clear as day that he had been carried through the air by the fairies while he was sleeping and his bonnet had been blown off by the way  i give this little story but meagrely from a scanty memorandum scott has related it in somewhat different style in a note to one of his poems but in narration these anecdotes derived their chief zest from the quiet but delightful humor the bonhomie with which he seasoned them and the sly glance of the eye from under his bushy eyebrows with which they were accompanied that day at dinner we had mr laidlaw and his wife and a female friend who accompanied them the latter was a very intelligent respectable person about the middle age and was treated with particular attention and courtesy by scott our dinner was a most agreeable one for the guests were evidently cherished visitors to the house and felt that they were appreciated  when they were gone scott spoke of them in the most cordial manner i wished to show you said he some of our really excellent plain scotch people not fine gentlemen and ladies for such you can meet everywhere and they are everywhere the same the character of a nation is not to be learnt from its fine folks  he then went on with a particular eulogium on the lady who had accompanied the laidlaws she was the daughter he said of a poor country clergyman who had died in debt and left her an orphan and destitute having had a good plain education she immediately set up a childs school and had soon a numerous flock under her care by which she earned a decent maintenance that however was not her main object her first care was to pay off her fathers debts that no ill word or ill will might rest upon his memory  this by dint of scottish economy backed by filial reverence and pride she accomplished though in the effort she subjected herself to every privation not content with this she in certain instances refused to take pay for the tuition of the children of some of her neighbors who had befriended her father in his need and had since fallen into poverty in a word added scott she is a fine old scotch girl and i delight in her more than in many a fine lady i have known and i have known many of the finest                                       it is time however to draw this rambling narrative to a close several days were passed by me in the way i have attempted to describe in almost constant familiar and joyous conversation with scott it was as if i were admitted to a social communion with shakespeare for it was with one of a kindred if not equal genius every night i retired with my mind filled with delightful recollections of the day and every morning i rose with the certainty of new enjoyment the days thus spent i shall ever look back to as among the very happiest of my life for i was conscious at the time of being happy the only sad moment that i experienced at abbotsford was that of my departure but it was cheered with the prospect of soon returning for i had promised after making a tour in the highlands to come and pass a few more days on the banks of the tweed when scott intended to invite hogg the poet to meet me i took a kind farewell of the family with each of whom i had been highly pleased if i have refrained from dwelling particularly on their several characters and giving anecdotes of them individually it is because i consider them shielded by the sanctity of domestic life scott on the contrary belongs to history as he accompanied me on foot however to a small gate on the confines of his premises i could not refrain from expressing the enjoyment i had experienced in his domestic circle and passing some warm eulogiums on the young folks from whom i had just parted i shall never forget his reply they have kind hearts said he and that is the main point as to human happiness they love one another poor things which is every thing in domestic life the best wish i can make you my friend added he laying his hand upon my shoulder is that when you return to your own country you may get married and have a family of young bairns about you if you are happy there they are to share your happinessand if you are otherwisethere they are to comfort you  by this time we had reached the gate when he halted and took my hand i will not say farewell said he for it is always a painful word but i will say come again when you have made your tour to the highlands come here and give me a few more daysbut come when you please you will always find abbotsford open to you and a hearty welcome                                       i have thus given in a rude style my main recollections of what occurred during my sojourn at abbotsford and i feel mortified that i can give but such meagre scattered and colorless details of what was so copious rich and varied during several days that i passed there scott was in admirable vein from early morn until dinner time he was rambling about showing me the neighborhood and during dinner and until late at night engaged in social conversation no time was reserved for himself he seemed as if his only occupation was to entertain me and yet i was almost an entire stranger to him one of whom he knew nothing but an idle book i had written and which some years before had amused him but such was scotthe appeared to have nothing to do but lavish his time attention and conversation on those around it was difficult to imagine what time he found to write those volumes that were incessantly issuing from the press all of which too were of a nature to require reading and research i could not find that his life was ever otherwise than a life of leisure and haphazard recreation such as it was during my visit he scarce ever balked a party of pleasure or a sporting excursion and rarely pleaded his own concerns as an excuse for rejecting those of others during my visit i heard of other visitors who had preceded me and who must have kept him occupied for many days and i have had an opportunity of knowing the course of his daily life for some time subsequently not long after my departure from abbotsford my friend wilkie arrived there to paint a picture of the scott family he found the house full of guests scotts whole time was taken up in riding and driving about the country or in social conversation at home all this time said wilkie to me i did not presume to ask mr scott to sit for his portrait for i saw he had not a moment to spare i waited for the guests to go away but as fast as one went another arrived and so it continued for several days and with each set he was completely occupied at length all went off and we were quiet i thought however mr scott will now shut himself up among his books and papers for he has to make up for lost time it wont do for me to ask him now to sit for his picture laidlaw who managed his estate came in and scott turned to him as i supposed to consult about business laidlaw said he tomorrow morning well go across the water and take the dogs with ustheres a place where i think we shall be able to find a hare  in short added wilkie i found that instead of business he was thinking only of amusement as if he had nothing in the world to occupy him so i no longer feared to intrude upon him  the conversation of scott was frank hearty picturesque and dramatic during the time of my visit he inclined to the comic rather than the grave in his anecdotes and stories and such i was told was his general inclination he relished a joke or a trait of humor in social intercourse and laughed with right good will he talked not for effect nor display but from the flow of his spirits the stores of his memory and the vigor of his imagination he had a natural turn for narration and his narratives and descriptions were without effort yet wonderfully graphic he placed the scene before you like a picture he gave the dialogue with the appropriate dialect or peculiarities and described the appearance and characters of his personages with that spirit and felicity evinced in his writings indeed his conversation reminded me continually of his novels and it seemed to me that during the whole time i was with him he talked enough to fill volumes and that they could not have been filled more delightfully  he was as good a listener as talker appreciating everything that others said however humble might be their rank or pretensions and was quick to testify his perception of any point in their discourse he arrogated nothing to himself but was perfectly unassuming and unpretending entering with heart and soul into the business or pleasure or i had almost said folly of the hour and the company no ones concerns no ones thoughts no ones opinions no ones tastes and pleasures seemed beneath him he made himself so thoroughly the companion of those with whom he happened to be that they forgot for a time his vast superiority and only recollected and wondered when all was over that it was scott with whom they had been on such familiar terms and in whose society they had felt so perfectly at their ease  it was delightful to observe the generous spirit in which he spoke of all his literary contemporaries quoting the beauties of their works and this too with respect to persons with whom he might have been supposed to be at variance in literature or politics jeffrey it was thought had ruffled his plumes in one of his reviews yet scott spoke of him in terms of high and warm eulogy both as an author and as a man  his humor in conversation as in his works was genial and free from all causticity he had a quick perception of faults and foibles but he looked upon poor human nature with an indulgent eye relishing what was good and pleasant tolerating what was frail and pitying what was evil it is this beneficent spirit which gives such an air of bonhomie to scotts humor throughout all his works he played with the foibles and errors of his fellow beings and presented them in a thousand whimsical and characteristic lights but the kindness and generosity of his nature would not allow him to be a satirist i do not recollect a sneer throughout his conversation any more than there is throughout his works  such is a rough sketch of scott as i saw him in private life not merely at the time of the visit here narrated but in the casual intercourse of subsequent years of his public character and merits all the world can judge his works have incorporated themselves with the thoughts and concerns of the whole civilized world for a quarter of a century and have had a controlling influence over the age in which he lived but when did a human being ever exercise an influence more salutary and benignant who is there that on looking back over a great portion of his life does not find the genius of scott administering to his pleasures beguiling his cares and soothing his lonely sorrows who does not still regard his works as a treasury of pure enjoyment an armory to which to resort in time of need to find weapons with which to fight off the evils and the griefs of life for my own part in periods of dejection i have hailed the announcement of a new work from his pen as an earnest of certain pleasure in store for me and have looked forward to it as a traveller in a waste looks to a green spot at a distance where he feels assured of solace and refreshment when i consider how much he has thus contributed to the better hours of my past existence and how independent his works still make me at times of all the world for my enjoyment i bless my stars that cast my lot in his days to be thus cheered and gladdened by the outpourings of his genius i consider it one of the greatest advantages that i have derived from my literary career that it has elevated me into genial communion with such a spirit and as a tribute of gratitude for his friendship and veneration for his memory i cast this humble stone upon his cairn which will soon i trust be piled aloft with the contributions of abler hands    newstead abbey  historical notice   being about to give a few sketches taken during a three weeks sojourn in the ancestral mansion of the late lord byron i think it proper to premise some brief particulars concerning its history  newstead abbey is one of the finest specimens in existence of those quaint and romantic piles half castle half convent which remain as monuments of the olden times of england it stands too in the midst of a legendary neighborhood being in the heart of sherwood forest and surrounded by the haunts of robin hood and his band of outlaws so famous in ancient ballad and nursery tale it is true the forest scarcely exists but in name and the tract of country over which it once extended its broad solitudes and shades is now an open and smiling region cultivated with parks and farms and enlivened with villages  newstead which probably once exerted a monastic sway over this region and controlled the consciences of the rude foresters was originally a priory founded in the latter part of the twelfth century by henry ii at the time when he sought by building of shrines and convents and by other acts of external piety to expiate the murder of thomas a becket the priory was dedicated to god and the virgin and was inhabited by a fraternity of canons regular of st augustine this order was originally simple and abstemious in its mode of living and exemplary in its conduct but it would seem that it gradually lapsed into those abuses which disgraced too many of the wealthy monastic establishments for there are documents among its archives which intimate the prevalence of gross misrule and dissolute sensuality among its members at the time of the dissolution of the convents during the reign of henry viii newstead underwent a sudden reverse being given with the neighboring manor and rectory of papelwick to sir john byron steward of manchester and rochdale and lieutenant of sherwood forest this ancient family worthy figures in the traditions of the abbey and in the ghost stories with which it abounds under the quaint and graphic appellation of sir john byron the little with the great beard he converted the saintly edifice into a castellated dwelling making it his favorite residence and the seat of his forest jurisdiction  the byron family being subsequently ennobled by a baronial title and enriched by various possessions maintained great style and retinue at newstead the proud edifice partook however of the vicissitudes of the times and lord byron in one of his poems represents it as alternately the scene of lordly wassailing and of civil war    hark how the hall resounding to the strain     shakes with the martial musics novel din   the heralds of a warriors haughty reign     high crested banners wave thy walls within    of changing sentinels the distant hum     the mirth of feasts the clang of burnishd arms   the braying trumpet and the hoarser drum     unite in concert with increased alarms  about the middle of the last century the abbey came into the possession of another noted character who makes no less figure in its shadowy traditions than sir john the little with the great beard this was the granduncle of the poet familiarly known among the gossiping chroniclers of the abbey as the wicked lord byron he is represented as a man of irritable passions and vindictive temper in the indulgence of which an incident occurred which gave a turn to his whole character and life and in some measure affected the fortunes of the abbey in his neighborhood lived his kinsman and friend mr chaworth proprietor of annesley hall being together in london in 1765 in a chamber of the star and garter tavern in pall mall a quarrel rose between them byron insisted upon settling it upon the spot by single combat they fought without seconds by the dim light of a candle and mr chaworth although the most expert swordsman received a mortal wound with his dying breath he related such particulars the contest as induced the coroners jury to return a verdict of wilful murder lord byron was sent to the tower and subsequently tried before the house of peers where an ultimate verdict was given of manslaughter  he retired after this to the abbey where he shut himself up to brood over his disgraces grew gloomy morose and fantastical and indulged in fits of passion and caprice that made him the theme of rural wonder and scandal no tale was too wild or too monstrous for vulgar belief like his successor the poet he was accused of all kinds of vagaries and wickedness it was said that he always went armed as if prepared to commit murder on the least provocation at one time when a gentleman of his neighborhood was to dine tete a tete with him it is said a brace of pistols were gravely laid with the knives and forks upon the table as part of the regular table furniture and implements that might be needed in the course of the repast another rumor states that being exasperated at his coachman for disobedience to orders he shot him on the spot threw his body into the coach where lady byron was seated and mounting the box officiated in his stead at another time according to the same vulgar rumors he threw her ladyship into the lake in front of the abbey where she would have been drowned but for the timely aid of the gardener these stories are doubtless exaggerations of trivial incidents which may have occurred but it is certain that the wayward passions of this unhappy man caused a separation from his wife and finally spread a solitude around him being displeased at the marriage of his son and heir he displayed an inveterate malignity toward him not being able to cut off his succession to the abbey estate which descended to him by entail he endeavored to injure it as much as possible so that it might come a mere wreck into his hands for this purpose he suffered the abbey to fall out of repair and everything to go to waste about it and cut down all the timber on the estate laying low many a tract of old sherwood forest so that the abbey lands lay stripped and bare of all their ancient honors he was baffled in his unnatural revenge by the premature death of his son and passed the remainder of his days in his deserted and dilapidated halls a gloomy misanthrope brooding amidst the scenes he had laid desolate  his wayward humors drove from him all neighborly society and for a part of the time he was almost without domestics in his misanthropic mood when at variance with all human kind he took to feeding crickets so that in process of time the abbey was overrun with them and its lonely halls made more lonely at night by their monotonous music tradition adds that at his death the crickets seemed aware that they had lost their patron and protector for they one and all packed up bag and baggage and left the abbey trooping across its courts and corridors in all directions  the death of the old lord or the wicked lord byron for he is known by both appellations occurred in 1798 and the abbey then passed into the possession of the poet the latter was but eleven years of age and living in humble style with his mother in scotland they came soon after to england to take possession moore gives a simple but striking anecdote of the first arrival of the poet at the domains of his ancestors  they had arrived at the newstead tollbar and saw the woods of the abbey stretching out to receive them when mrs byron affecting to be ignorant of the place asked the woman of the tollhouse to whom that seat belonged she was told that the owner of it lord byron had been some months dead and who is the next heir asked the proud and happy mother they say answered the old woman it is a little boy who lives at aberdeen and this is he bless him exclaimed the nurse no longer able to contain herself and turning to kiss with delight the young lord who was seated on her lap footnote moores life of lord byron  during lord byrons minority the abbey was let to lord grey de ruthen but the poet visited it occasionally during the harrow vacations when he resided with his mother at lodgings in nottingham it was treated little better by its present tenant than by the old lord who preceded him so that when in the autumn of 1808 lord byron took up his abode there it was in a ruinous condition the following lines from his own pen may give some idea of its condition    through thy battlements newstead the hollow winds whistle     thou the hall of my fathers art gone to decay    in thy once smiling garden the hemlock and thistle     have choked up the rose which once bloomed in the way    of the mailcovered barons who proudly to battle     led thy vassals from europe to palestines plain    the escutcheon and shield which with every wind rattle     are the only sad vestiges now that remain  footnote lines on leaving newstead abbey  in another poem he expresses the melancholy feeling with which he took possession of his ancestral mansion    newstead what saddening scene of change is thine     thy yawning arch betokens sure decay   the last and youngest of a noble line     now holds thy mouldering turrets in his sway    deserted now he scans thy grayworn towers     thy vaults where dead of feudal ages sleep   thy cloisters pervious to the wintry showers     thesethese he views and views them but to weep    yet he prefers thee to the gilded domes     or gewgaw grottoes of the vainly great   yet lingers mid thy damp and mossy tombs     nor breathes a murmur gainst the will of fate  footnote elegy on newstead abbey  lord byron had not fortune sufficient to put the pile in extensive repair nor to maintain anything like the state of his ancestors he restored some of the apartments so as to furnish his mother with a comfortable habitation and fitted up a quaint study for himself in which among books and busts and other library furniture were two skulls of the ancient friars grinning on each side of an antique cross one of his gay companions gives a picture of newstead when thus repaired and the picture is sufficiently desolate  there are two tiers of cloisters with a variety of cells and rooms about them which though not inhabited nor in an inhabitable state might easily be made so and many of the original rooms among which is a fine stone hall are still in use of the abbey church one end only remains and the old kitchen with a long range of apartments is reduced to a heap of rubbish leading from the abbey to the modern part of the habitation is a noble room seventy feet in length and twenty three in breadth but every part of the house displays neglect and decay save those which the present lord has lately fitted up footnote letter of the late charles skinner mathews esq  even the repairs thus made were but of transient benefit for the roof being left in its dilapidated state the rain soon penetrated into the apartments which lord byron had restored and decorated and in a few years rendered them almost as desolate as the rest of the abbey  still he felt a pride in the ruinous old edifice its very dreary and dismantled state addressed itself to his poetical imagination and to that love of the melancholy and the grand which is evinced in all his writings come what may said he in one of his letters newstead and i stand or fall together i have now lived on the spot i have fixed my heart upon it and no pressure present or future shall induce me to barter the last vestige of our inheritance i have that pride within me which will enable me to support difficulties could i obtain in exchange for newstead abbey the first fortune in the country i would reject the proposition  his residence at the abbey however was fitful and uncertain he passed occasional portions of time there sometimes studiously and alone oftener idly and recklessly and occasionally with young and gay companions in riot and revelry and the indulgence of all kinds of mad caprice the abbey was by no means benefited by these roystering inmates who sometimes played off monkish mummeries about the cloisters at other times turned the state chambers into schools for boxing and singlestick and shot pistols in the great hall the country people of the neighborhood were as much puzzled by these madcap vagaries of the new incumbent as by the gloomier habits of the old lord and began to think that madness was inherent in the byron race or that some wayward star ruled over the abbey  it is needless to enter into a detail of the circumstances which led his lordship to sell his ancestral estate notwithstanding the partial predilections and hereditary feeling which he had so eloquently expressed fortunately it fell into the hands of a man who possessed something of a poetical temperament and who cherished an enthusiastic admiration for lord byron colonel at that time major wildman had been a schoolmate of the poet and sat with him on the same form at harrow he had subsequently distinguished himself in the war of the peninsula and at the battle of waterloo and it was a great consolation to lord byron in parting with his family estate to know that it would be held by one capable of restoring its faded glories and who would respect and preserve all the monuments and memorials of his line footnote the following letter written in the course of the transfer of the estate has never been published  venice november 18 1818  my dear wildman  mr hanson is on the eve of his return so that i have only time to return a few inadequate thanks for your very kind letter i should regret to trouble you with any requests of mine in regard to the preservation of any signs of my family which may still exist at newstead and leave everything of that kind to your own feelings present or future upon the subject the portrait which you flatter me by desiring would not be worth to you your trouble and expense of such an expedition but you may rely upon having the very first that may be painted and which may seem worth your acceptance  i trust that newstead will being yours remain so and that it may see you as happy as i am very sure that you will make your dependents with regard to myself you may be sure that whether in the fourth or fifth or sixth form at harrow or in the fluctuations of after life i shall always remember with regard my old schoolfellowfellow monitor and friend and recognize with respect the gallant soldier who with all the advantages of fortune and allurements of youth to a life of pleasure devoted himself to duties of a nobler order and will receive his reward in the esteem and admiration of his country  ever yours most truly and affectionately   byron  the confidence of lord byron in the good feeling and good taste of colonel wildman has been justified by the event under his judicious eye and munificent hand the venerable and romantic pile has risen from its ruins in all its old monastic and baronial splendor and additions have been made to it in perfect conformity of style the groves and forests have been replanted the lakes and fishponds cleaned out and the gardens rescued from the hemlock and thistle and restored to their pristine and dignified formality  the farms on the estate have been put in complete order new farm houses built of stone in the picturesque and comfortable style of the old english granges the hereditary tenants secured in their paternal homes and treated with the most considerate indulgence everything in a word gives happy indications of a liberal and beneficent landlord  what most however will interest the visitors to the abbey in favor of its present occupant is the reverential care with which he has preserved and renovated every monument and relic of the byron family and every object in anywise connected with the memory of the poet eighty thousand pounds have already been expended upon the venerable pile yet the work is still going on and newstead promises to realize the hope faintly breathed by the poet when bidding it a melancholy farewell    haply thy sun emerging yet may shine     thee to irradiate with meridian ray   hours splendid as the past may still be thine     and bless thy future as thy former day     arrival at the abbey   i had been passing a merry christmas in the good old style at barlhoro hall a venerable family mansion in derbyshire and set off to finish the holidays with the hospitable proprietor of newstead abbey a drive of seventeen miles through a pleasant country part of it the storied region of sherwood forest brought me to the gate of newstead park the aspect of the park was by no means imposing the fine old trees that once adorned it having been laid low by lord byrons wayward predecessor  entering the gate the postchaise rolled heavily along a sandy road between naked declivities gradually descending into one of those gentle and sheltered valleys in which the sleek monks of old loved to nestle themselves here a sweep of the road round an angle of a garden wall brought us full in front of the venerable edifice embosomed in the valley with a beautiful sheet of water spreading out before it  the irregular gray pile of motley architecture answered to the description given by lord byron    an old old monastery once and now    still older mansion of a rich and rare    mixed gothic  one end was fortified by a castellated tower bespeaking the baronial and warlike days of the edifice the other end maintained its primitive monastic character a ruined chapel flanked by a solemn grove still reared its front entire it is true the threshold of the once frequented portal was grassgrown and the great lancet window once glorious with painted glass was now entwined and overhung with ivy but the old convent cross still braved both time and tempest on the pinnacle of the chapel and below the blessed effigies of the virgin and child sculptured in gray stone remained uninjured in their niche giving a sanctified aspect to the pile footnote    in a higher niche alone but crownd     the virgin mother of the godborn child   with her son in her blessed arms looked round     spared by some chance when all beside was spoild   she made the earth below seem holy grounddon juan canto iii  a flight of rooks tenants of the adjacent grove were hovering about the ruin and balancing themselves upon ever airy projection and looked down with curious eye and cawed as the postchaise rattled along below  the chamberlain of the abbey a most decorous personage dressed in black received us at the portal here too we encountered a memento of lord byron a great black and white newfoundland dog that had accompanied his remains from greece he was descended from the famous boatswain and inherited his generous qualities he was a cherished inmate of the abbey and honored and caressed by every visitor conducted by the chamberlain and followed by the dog who assisted in doing the honors of the house we passed through a long low vaulted hall supported by massive gothic arches and not a little resembling the crypt of a cathedral being the basement story of the abbey  from this we ascended a stone staircase at the head of which a pair of folding doors admitted us into a broad corridor that ran round the interior of the abbey the windows of the corridor looked into a quadrangular grassgrown court forming the hollow centre of the pile in the midst of it rose a lofty and fantastic fountain wrought of the same gray stone as the main edifice and which has been well described by lord byron    amidst the court a gothic fountain playd     symmetrical but deckd with carvings quaint   strange faces like to men in masquerade     and here perhaps a monster there a saint   the spring rushd through grim mouths of granite made     and sparkled into basins where it spent   its little torrent in a thousand bubbles   like mans vain glory and his vainer troubles  footnote don juan canto iii  around this quadrangle were low vaulted cloisters with gothic arches once the secluded walks of the monks the corridor along which we were passing was built above these cloisters and their hollow arches seemed to reverberate every footfall everything thus far had a solemn monastic air but on arriving at an angle of the corridor the eye glancing along a shadowy gallery caught a sight of two dark figures in plate armor with closed visors bucklers braced and swords drawn standing motionless against the wall they seemed two phantoms of the chivalrous era of the abbey  here the chamberlain throwing open a folding door ushered us at once into a spacious and lofty saloon which offered a brilliant contrast to the quaint and sombre apartments we had traversed it was elegantly furnished and the walls hung with paintings yet something of its original architecture had been preserved and blended with modern embellishments there were the stoneshafted casements and the deep bowwindow of former times the carved and panelled woodwork of the lofty ceiling had likewise been carefully restored and its gothic and grotesque devices painted and gilded in their ancient style  here too were emblems of the former and latter days of the abbey in the effigies of the first and last of the byron line that held sway over its destinies at the upper end of the saloon above the door the dark gothic portrait of sir john byron the little with the great beard looked grimly down from his canvas while at the opposite end a white marble bust of the genius loci the noble poet shone conspicuously from its pedestal  the whole air and style of the apartment partook more of the palace than the monastery and its windows looked forth on a suitable prospect composed of beautiful groves smooth verdant lawns and silver sheets of water below the windows was a small flowergarden inclosed by stone balustrades on which were stately peacocks sunning themselves and displaying their plumage about the grassplots in front were gay cock pheasants and plump partridges and nimblefooted water hens feeding almost in perfect security  such was the medley of objects presented to the eye on first visiting the abbey and i found the interior fully to answer the description of the poet    the mansions self was vast and venerable     with more of the monastic than has been   elsewhere preserved the cloisters still were stable     the cells too and refectory i ween   an exquisite small chapel had been able     still unimpaird to decorate the scene   the rest had been reformed replaced or sunk    and spoke more of the friar than the monk    huge halls long galleries spacious chambers joined     by no quite lawful marriage of the arts   might shock a connoisseur but when combined     formed a whole which irregular in parts   yet left a grand impression on the mind     at least of those whose eyes were in their hearts  it is not my intention to lay open the scenes of domestic life at the abbey nor to describe the festivities of which i was a partaker during my sojourn within its hospitable walls i wish merely to present a picture of the edifice itself and of those personages and circumstances about it connected with the memory of byron  i forbear therefore to dwell on my reception by my excellent and amiable host and hostess or to make my reader acquainted with the elegant inmates of the mansion that i met in the saloon and i shall pass on at once with him to the chamber allotted me and to which i was most respectfully conducted by the chamberlain  it was one of a magnificent suite of rooms extending between the court of the cloisters and the abbey garden the windows looking into the latter the whole suite formed the ancient state apartment and had fallen into decay during the neglected days of the abbey so as to be in a ruinous condition in the time of lord byron it had since been restored to its ancient splendor of which my chamber may be cited as a specimen it was lofty and well proportioned the lower part of the walls was panelled with ancient oak the upper part hung with gobelin tapestry representing oriental hunting scenes wherein the figures were of the size of life and of great vivacity of attitude and color  the furniture was antique dignified and cumbrous highbacked chairs curiously carved and wrought in needlework a massive clothespress of dark oak well polished and inlaid with landscapes of various tinted woods a bed of state ample and lofty so as only to be ascended by a movable flight of steps the huge posts supporting a high tester with a tuft of crimson plumes at each corner and rich curtains of crimson damask hanging in broad and heavy folds  a venerable mirror of plate glass stood on the toilet in which belles of former centuries may have contemplated and decorated their charms the floor of the chamber was of tesselated oak shining with wax and partly covered by a turkey carpet in the centre stood a massy oaken table waxed and polished as smooth as glass and furnished with a writingdesk of perfumed rosewood  a sober light was admitted into the room through gothic stoneshafted casements partly shaded by crimson curtains and partly overshadowed by the trees of the garden this solemnly tempered light added to the effect of the stately and antiquated interior  two portraits suspended over the doors were in keeping with the scene they were in ancient vandyke dresses one was a cavalier who may have occupied this apartment in days of yore the other was a lady with a black velvet mask in her hand who may once have arrayed herself for conquest at the very mirror i have described  the most curious relic of old times however in this quaint but richly dight apartment was a great chimneypiece of panelwork carved in high relief with niches or compartments each containing a human bust that protruded almost entirely from the wall some of the figures were in ancient gothic garb the most striking among them was a female who was earnestly regarded by a fierce saracen from an adjoining niche  this panelwork is among the mysteries of the abbey and causes as much wide speculation as the egyptian hieroglyphics some suppose it to illustrate an adventure in the holy land and that the lady in effigy had been rescued by some crusader of the family from the turbaned turk who watches her so earnestly what tends to give weight to these suppositions is that similar pieces of panelwork exist in other parts of the abbey in all of which are to be seen the christian lady and her saracen guardian or lover at the bottom of these sculptures are emblazoned the armorial bearings of the byrons  i shall not detain the reader however with any further description of my apartment or of the mysteries connected with it as he is to pass some days with me at the abbey we shall have time to examine the old edifice at our leisure and to make ourselves acquainted not merely with its interior but likewise with its environs     the abbey garden   the morning after my arrival i rose at an early hour the daylight was peering brightly between the window curtains and drawing them apart i gazed through the gothic casement upon a scene that accorded in character with the interior of the ancient mansion it was the old abbey garden but altered to suit the tastes of different times and occupants in one direction were shady walls and alleys broad terraces and lofty groves in another beneath a gray monasticlooking angle of the edifice overrun with ivy and surmounted by a cross lay a small french garden with formal flowerpots gravel walks and stately stone balustrades  the beauty of the morning and the quiet of the hour tempted me to an early stroll for it is pleasant to enjoy such oldtime places alone when one may indulge poetical reveries and spin cobweb fancies without interruption dressing myself therefore with all speed i descended a small flight of steps from the state apartment into the long corridor over the cloisters along which i passed to a door at the farther end here i emerged into the open air and descending another flight of stone steps found myself in the centre of what had once been the abbey chapel  nothing of the sacred edifice remained however but the gothic front with its deep portal and grand lancet window already described the nave the side walls the choir the sacristy all had disappeared the open sky was over my head a smooth shaven grassplot beneath my feet gravel walks and shrubberies had succeeded to the shadowy isles and stately trees to the clustering columns    where now the grass exhales a murky dew     the humid pall of lifeextinguished clay    in sainted fame the sacred fathers grew     nor raised their pious voices but to pray    where now the bats their wavering wings extend     soon as the gloaming spreads her warning shade    the choir did oft their mingling vespers blend     or matin orisons to mary paid  instead of the matin orisons of the monks however the ruined walls of the chapel now resounded to the cawing of innumerable rooks that were fluttering and hovering about the dark grove which they inhabited and preparing for their morning flight  my ramble led me along quiet alleys bordered by shrubbery where the solitary waterhen would now and then scud across my path and take refuge among the bushes from hence i entered upon a broad terraced walk once a favorite resort of the friars which extended the whole length of the old abbey garden passing along the ancient stone wall which bounded it in the centre of the garden lay one of the monkish fishpools an oblong sheet of water deep set like a mirror in green sloping banks of turf in its glassy bosom was reflected the dark mass of a neighboring grove one of the most important features of the garden this grove goes by the sinister name of the devils wood and enjoys but an equivocal character in the neighborhood it was planted by the wicked lord byron during the early part of his residence at the abbey before his fatal duel with mr chaworth having something of a foreign and classical taste he set up leaden statues of satyrs or fauns at each end of the grove the statues like everything else about the old lord fell under the suspicion and obloquy that overshadowed him in the latter part of his life the country people who knew nothing of heathen mythology and its sylvan deities looked with horror at idols invested with the diabolical attributes of horns and cloven feet they probably supposed them some object of secret worship of the gloomy and secluded misanthrope and reputed murderer and gave them the name of the old lords devils  i penetrated the recesses of the mystic grove there stood the ancient and much slandered statues overshadowed by tall larches and stained by dank green mold it is not a matter of surprise that strange figures thus behoofed and behorned and set up in a gloomy grove should perplex the minds of the simple and superstitious yeomanry there are many of the tastes and caprices of the rich that in the eyes of the uneducated must savor of insanity  i was attracted to this grove however by memorials of a more touching character it had been one of the favorite haunts of the late lord byron in his farewell visit to the abbey after he had parted with the possession of it he passed some time in this grove in company with his sister and as a last memento engraved their names on the bark of a tree  the feelings that agitated his bosom during this farewell visit when he beheld round him objects dear to his pride and dear to his juvenile recollections but of which the narrowness of his fortune would not permit him to retain possession may be gathered from a passage in a poetical epistle written to his sister in after years    i did remind you of our own dear lake     by the old hall which may be mine no more   lemans is fair but think not i forsake     the sweet remembrance of a dearer shore   sad havoc time must with my memory make     ere that or thou can fade these eyes before   though like all things which i have loved they are   resignd for ever or divided far   i feel almost at times as i have felt     in happy childhood trees and flowers and brooks   which do remember me of where i dwelt     ere my young mind was sacrificed to books   come as of yore upon me and can melt     my heart with recognition of their looks   and even at moments i would think i see   some living things i lovebut none like thee  i searched the grove for some time before i found the tree on which lord byron had left his frail memorial it was an elm of peculiar form having two trunks which sprang from the same root and after growing side by side mingled their branches together he had selected it doubtless as emblematical of his sister and himself the names of byron and augusta were still visible they had been deeply cut in the bark but the natural growth of the tree was gradually rendering them illegible and a few years hence strangers will seek in vain for this record of fraternal affection  leaving the grove i continued my ramble along a spacious terrace overlooking what had once been the kitchen garden of the abbey below me lay the monks stew or fish pond a dark pool overhung by gloomy cypresses with a solitary waterhen swimming about in it  a little farther on and the terrace looked down upon the stately scene on the south side of the abbey the flower garden with its stone balustrades and stately peacocks the lawn with its pheasants and partridges and the soft valley of newstead beyond  at a distance on the border of the lawn stood another memento of lord byron an oak planted by him in his boyhood on his first visit to the abbey with a superstitious feeling inherent in him he linked his own destiny with that of the tree as it fares said he so will fare my fortunes several years elapsed many of them passed in idleness and dissipation he returned to the abbey a youth scarce grown to manhood but as he thought with vices and follies beyond his years he found his emblem oak almost choked by weeds and brambles and took the lesson to himself    young oak when i planted thee deep in the ground     i hoped that thy days would be longer than mine   that thy dark waving branches would flourish around     and ivy thy trunk with its mantle entwine    such such was my hopewhen in infancys years     on the laud of my fathers i reared thee with pride   they are past and i water thy stem with my tears   thy decay not the weeds that surround thee can hide  i leaned over the stone balustrade of the terrace and gazed upon the valley of newstead with its silver sheets of water gleaming in the morning sun it was a sabbath morning which always seems to have a hallowed influence over the landscape probably from the quiet of the day and the cessation of all kinds of weekday labor as i mused upon the mild and beautiful scene and the wayward destinies of the man whose stormy temperament forced him from this tranquil paradise to battle with the passions and perils of the world the sweet chime of bells from a village a few miles distant came stealing up the valley every sight and sound this morning seemed calculated to summon up touching recollections of poor byron the chime was from the village spire of hucknall torkard beneath which his remains lie buried  i have since visited his tomb it is in an old gray country church venerable with the lapse of centuries he lies buried beneath the pavement at one end of the principal aisle a light falls on the spot through the stained glass of a gothic window and a tablet on the adjacent wall announces the family vault of the byrons it had been the wayward intention of the poet to be entombed with his faithful dog in the monument erected by him in the garden of newstead abbey his executors showed better judgment and feeling in consigning his ashes to the family sepulchre to mingle with those of his mother and his kindred here    after lifes fitful fever he sleeps well   malice domestic foreign levy nothing   can touch him further  how nearly did his dying hour realize the wish made by him but a few years previously in one of his fitful moods of melancholy and misanthropy    when time or soon or late shall bring     the dreamless sleep that lulls the dead   oblivion may thy languid wing     wave gently oer my dying bed    no band of friends or heirs be there     to weep or wish the coining blow   no maiden with dishevelled hair     to feel or fein decorous woe    but silent let me sink to earth     with no officious mourners near   i would not mar one hour of mirth     nor startle friendship with a tear  he died among strangers in a foreign land without a kindred hand to close his eyes yet he did not die unwept with all his faults and errors and passions and caprices he had the gift of attaching his humble dependents warmly to him one of them a poor greek accompanied his remains to england and followed them to the grave i am told that during the ceremony he stood holding on by a pew in an agony of grief and when all was over seemed as if he would have gone down into the tomb with the body of his mastera nature that could inspire such attachments must have been generous and beneficent     plough monday   sherwood forest is a region that still retains much of the quaint customs and holiday games of the olden time a day or two after my arrival at the abbey as i was walking in the cloisters i heard the sound of rustic music and now and then a burst of merriment proceeding from the interior of the mansion presently the chamberlain came and informed me that a party of country lads were in the servants hall performing plough monday antics and invited me to witness their mummery i gladly assented for i am somewhat curious about these relics of popular usages the servants hall was a fit place for the exhibition of an old gothic game it was a chamber of great extent which in monkish times had been the refectory of the abbey a row of massive columns extended lengthwise through the centre whence sprung gothic arches supporting the low vaulted ceiling here was a set of rustics dressed up in something of the style represented in the books concerning popular antiquities one was in a rough garb of frieze with his head muffled in bearskin and a bell dangling behind him that jingled at every movement he was the clown or fool of the party probably a traditional representative of the ancient satyr the rest were decorated with ribbons and armed with wooden swords the leader of the troop recited the old ballad of st george and the dragon which had been current among the country people for ages his companions accompanied the recitation with some rude attempt at acting while the clown cut all kinds of antics  to these succeeded a set of morrisdancers gayly dressed up with ribbons and hawksbells in this troop we had robin hood and maid marian the latter represented by a smoothfaced boy also beelzebub equipped with a broom and accompanied by his wife bessy a termagant old beldame these rude pageants are the lingering remains of the old customs of plough monday when bands of rustics fantastically dressed and furnished with pipe and tabor dragged what was called the fool plough from house to house singing ballads and performing antics for which they were rewarded with money and good cheer  but it is not in merry sherwood forest alone that these remnants of old times prevail they are to be met with in most of the counties north of the trent which classic stream seems to be the boundary line of primitive customs during my recent christmas sojourn at barlboro hall on the skirts of derbyshire and yorkshire i had witnessed many of the rustic festivities peculiar to that joyous season which have rashly been pronounced obsolete by those who draw their experience merely from city life i had seen the great yule log put on the fire on christmas eve and the wassail bowl sent round brimming with its spicy beverage i had heard carols beneath my window by the choristers of the neighboring village who went their rounds about the ancient hall at midnight according to immemorial custom we had mummers and mimers too with the story of st george and the dragon and other ballads and traditional dialogues together with the famous old interlude of the hobby horse all represented in the antechamber and servants hall by rustics who inherited the custom and the poetry from preceding generations the boars head crowned with rosemary had taken its honored station among the christmas cheer the festal board had been attended by glee singers and minstrels from the village to entertain the company with hereditary songs and catches during their repast and the old pyrrhic game of the sword dance handed down since the time of the romans was admirably performed in the courtyard of the mansion by a band of young men lithe and supple in their forms and graceful in their movements who i was told went the rounds of the villages and countryseats during the christmas holidays  i specify these rural pageants and ceremonials which i saw during my sojourn in this neighborhood because it has been deemed that some of the anecdotes of holiday customs given in my preceding writings related to usages which have entirely passed away critics who reside in cities have little idea of the primitive manners and observances which still prevail in remote and rural neighborhoods  in fact in crossing the trent one seems to step back into old times and in the villages of sherwood forest we are in a blackletter region the mossgreen cottages the lowly mansions of gray stone the gothic crosses at each end of the villages and the tall maypole in the centre transport us in imagination to foregone centuries everything has a quaint and antiquated air  the tenantry on the abbey estate partake of this primitive character some of the families have rented farms there for nearly three hundred years and notwithstanding that their mansions fell to decay and every thing about them partook of the general waste and misrule of the byron dynasty yet nothing could uproot them from their native soil i am happy to say that colonel wildman has taken these stanch loyal families under his peculiar care he has favored them in their rents repaired or rather rebuilt their farmhouses and has enabled families that had almost sunk into the class of mere rustic laborers once more to hold up their heads among the yeomanry of the land  i visited one of these renovated establishments that had but lately been a mere ruin and now was a substantial grange it was inhabited by a young couple the good woman showed every part of the establishment with decent pride exulting in its comfort and respectability her husband i understood had risen in consequence with the improvement of his mansion and now began to be known among his rustic neighbors by the appellation of the young squire     old servants   in an old timeworn and mysterious looking mansion like newstead abbey and one so haunted by monkish and feudal and poetical associations it is a prize to meet with some ancient crone who has passed a long life about the place so as to have become a living chronicle of its fortunes and vicissitudes such a one is nanny smith a worthy dame near seventy years of age who for a long time served as housekeeper to the byrons the abbey and its domains comprise her world beyond which she knows nothing but within which she has ever conducted herself with native shrewdness and oldfashioned honesty when lord byron sold the abbey her vocation was at an end still she lingered about the place having for it the local attachment of a cat abandoning her comfortable housekeepers apartment she took shelter in one of the rockhouses which are nothing more than a little neighborhood of cabins excavated in the perpendicular walls of a stone quarry at no great distance from the abbey three cells cut in the living rock formed her dwelling these she fitted up humbly but comfortably her son william labored in the neighborhood and aided to support her and nanny smith maintained a cheerful aspect and an independent spirit one of her gossips suggested to her that william should marry and bring home a young wife to help her and take care of her nay nay replied nanny tartly i want no young mistress in my house so much for the love of rulepoor nannys house was a hole in a rock  colonel wildman on taking possession of the abbey found nanny smith thus humbly nestled with that active benevolence which characterizes him he immediately set william up in a small farm on the estate where nanny smith has a comfortable mansion in her old days her pride is roused by her sons advancement she remarks with exultation that people treat william with much more respect now that he is a farmer than they did when he was a laborer a farmer of the neighborhood has even endeavored to make a match between him and his sister but nanny smith has grown fastidious and interfered the girl she said was too old for her son besides she did not see that he was in any need of a wife  no said william i ha no great mind to marry the wench but if the colonel and his lady wish it i am willing they have been so kind to me that i should think it my duty to please them the colonel and his lady however have not thought proper to put honest williams gratitude to so severe a test  another worthy whom colonel wildman found vegetating upon the place and who had lived there for at least sixty years was old joe murray he had come there when a mere boy in the train of the old lord about the middle of the last century and had continued with him until his death having been a cabin boy when very young joe always fancied himself a bit of a sailor and had charge of all the pleasureboats on the lake though he afterward rose to the dignity of butler in the latter days of the old lord byron when he shut himself up from all the world joe murray was the only servant retained by him excepting his housekeeper betty hardstaff who was reputed to have an undue sway over him and was derisively called lady betty among the country folk  when the abbey came into the possession of the late lord byron joe murray accompanied it as a fixture he was reinstated as butler in the abbey and high admiral on the lake and his sturdy honest mastiff qualities won so upon lord byron as even to rival his newfoundland dog in his affections often when dining he would pour out a bumper of choice madeira and hand it to joe as he stood behind his chair in fact when he built the monumental tomb which stands in the abbey garden he intended it for himself joe murray and the dog the two latter were to lie on each side of him boatswain died not long afterward and was regularly interred and the wellknown epitaph inscribed on one side of the monument lord byron departed for greece during his absence a gentleman to whom joe murray was showing the tomb observed well old boy you will take your place here some twenty years hence  i dont know that sir growled joe in reply if i was sure his lordship would come here i should like it well enough but i should not like to lie alone with the dog  joe murray was always extremely neat in his dress and attentive to his person and made a most respectable appearance a portrait of him still hangs in the abbey representing him a hale freshlooking fellow in a flaxen wig a blue coat and buff waistcoat with a pipe in his hand he discharged all the duties of his station with great fidelity unquestionable honesty and much outward decorum but if we may believe his contemporary nanny smith who as housekeeper shared the sway of the household with him he was very lax in his minor morals and used to sing loose and profane songs as he presided at the table in the servants hall or sat taking his ale and smoking his pipe by the evening fire joe had evidently derived his convivial notions from the race of english country squires who flourished in the days of his juvenility nanny smith was scandalized at his ribald songs but being above harm herself endured them in silence at length on his singing them before a young girl of sixteen she could contain herself no longer but read him a lecture that made his ears ring and then flounced off to bed the lecture seems by her account to have staggered joe for he told her the next morning that he had had a terrible dream in the night an evangelist stood at the foot of his bed with a great dutch bible which he held with the printed part toward him and after a while pushed it in his face nanny smith undertook to interpret the vision and read from it such a homily and deduced such awful warnings that joe became quite serious left off singing and took to reading good books for a month but after that continued nanny he relapsed and became as bad as ever and continued to sing loose and profane songs to his dying day  when colonel wildman became proprietor of the abbey he found joe murray flourishing in a green old age though upward of fourscore and continued him in his station as butler the old man was rejoiced at the extensive repairs that were immediately commenced and anticipated with pride the day when the abbey should rise out of its ruins with renovated splendor its gates be thronged with trains and equipages and its halls once more echo to the sound of joyous hospitality  what chiefly however concerned joes pride and ambition was a plan of the colonels to have the ancient refectory of the convent a great vaulted room supported by gothic columns converted into a servants hall here joe looked forward to rule the roast at the head of the servants table and to make the gothic arches ring with those hunting and harddrinking ditties which were the horror of the discreet nanny smith time however was fast wearing away with him and his great fear was that the hall would not be completed in his day in his eagerness to hasten the repairs he used to get up early in the morning and ring up the workmen notwithstanding his great age also he would turn out halfdressed in cold weather to cut sticks for the fire colonel wildman kindly remonstrated with him for thus risking his health as others would do the work for him  lord sir exclaimed the hale old fellow its my airbath im all the better for it  unluckily as he was thus employed one morning a splinter flew up and wounded one of his eyes an inflammation took place he lost the sight of that eye and subsequently of the other poor joe gradually pined away and grew melancholy colonel wildman kindly tried to cheer him upcome come old boy cried he be of good heart you will yet take your place in the servants hall  nay nay sir replied he i did hope once that i should live to see iti looked forward to it with pride i confess but it is all over with me nowi shall soon go home he died shortly afterward at the advanced age of eightysix seventy of which had been passed as an honest and faithful servant at the abbey colonel wildman had him decently interred in the church of hucknall torkard near the vault of lord byron     superstitions of the abbey   the anecdotes i had heard of the quondam housekeeper of lord byron rendered me desirous of paying her a visit i rode in company with colonel wildman therefore to the cottage of her son william where she resides and found her seated by her fireside with a favorite cat perched upon her shoulder and purring in her ear nanny smith is a large goodlooking woman a specimen of the oldfashioned country housewife combining antiquated notions and prejudices and very limited information with natural good sense she loves to gossip about the abbey and lord byron and was soon drawn into a course of anecdotes though mostly of an humble kind such as suited the meridian of the housekeepers room and servants hall she seemed to entertain a kind recollection of lord byron though she had evidently been much perplexed by some of his vagaries and especially by the means he adopted to counteract his tendency to corpulency he used various modes to sweat himself down sometimes he would lie for a long time in a warm bath sometimes he would walk up the hills in the park wrapped up and loaded with great coats a sad toil for the poor youth added nanny he being so lame  his meals were scanty and irregular consisting of dishes which nanny seemed to hold in great contempt such as pillau macaroni and light puddings  she contradicted the report of the licentious life which he was reported to lead at the abbey and of the paramours said to have been brought with him from london a great part of his time used to be passed lying on a sofa reading sometimes he had young gentlemen of his acquaintance with him and they played some mad pranks but nothing but what young gentlemen may do and no harm done  once it is true she added he had with him a beautiful boy as a page which the housemaids said was a girl for my part i know nothing about it poor soul he was so lame he could not go out much with the men all the comfort he had was to be a little with the lasses the housemaids however were very jealous one of them in particular took the matter in great dudgeon her name was lucy she was a great favorite with lord byron and had been much noticed by him and began to have high notions she had her fortune told by a man who squinted to whom she gave twoandsixpence he told her to hold up her head and look high for she would come to great things upon this added nanny the poor thing dreamt of nothing less than becoming a lady and mistress of the abbey and promised me if such luck should happen to her she would be a good friend to me ah welladay lucy never had the fine fortune she dreamt of but she had better than i thought for she is now married and keeps a public house at warwick  finding that we listened to her with great attention nanny smith went on with her gossiping one time said she lord byron took a notion that there was a deal of money buried about the abbey by the monks in old times and nothing would serve him but he must have the flagging taken up in the cloisters and they digged and digged but found nothing but stone coffins full of bones then he must needs have one of the coffins put in one end of the great hall so that the servants were afraid to go there of nights several of the skulls were cleaned and put in frames in his room i used to have to go into the room at night to shut the windows and if i glanced an eye at them they all seemed to grin which i believe skulls always do i cant say but i was glad to get out of the room  there was at one time and for that matter there is still a good deal said about ghosts haunting about the abbey the keepers wife said she saw two standing in a dark part of the cloisters just opposite the chapel and one in the garden by the lords well then there was a young lady a cousin of lord byron who was staying in the abbey and slept in the room next the clock and she told me that one night when she was lying in bed she saw a lady in white come out of the wall on one side of the room and go into the wall on the opposite side  lord byron one day said to me nanny what nonsense they tell about ghosts as if there ever were any such things i have never seen any thing of the kind about the abbey and i warrant you have not this was all done do you see to draw me out but i said nothing but shook my head however they say his lordship did once see something it was in the great hallsomething all black and hairy he said it was the devil  for my part continued nanny smith i never saw anything of the kindbut i heard something once i was one evening scrubbing the floor of the little diningroom at the end of the long gallery it was after dark i expected every moment to be called to tea but wished to finish what i was about all at once i heard heavy footsteps in the great hall they sounded like the tramp of a horse i took the light and went to see what it was i heard the steps come from the lower end of the hall to the fireplace in the centre where they stopped but i could see nothing i returned to my work and in a little time heard the same noise again i went again with the light the footsteps stopped by the fireplace as before still i could see nothing i returned to my work when i heard the steps for a third time i then went into the hall without a light but they stopped just the same by the fireplace half way up the hall i thought this rather odd but returned to my work when it was finished i took the light and went through the hall as that was my way to the kitchen i heard no more footsteps and thought no more of the matter when on coming to the lower end of the hall i found the door locked and then on one side of the door i saw the stone coffin with the skull and bones that had been digged up in the cloisters  here nanny paused i asked her if she believed that the mysterious footsteps had any connection with the skeleton in the coffin but she shook her head and would not commit herself we took our leave of the good old dame shortly after and the story she had related gave subject for conversation on our ride homeward it was evident she had spoken the truth as to what she had heard but had been deceived by some peculiar effect of sound noises are propagated about a huge irregular edifice of the kind in a very deceptive manner footsteps are prolonged and reverberated by the vaulted cloisters and echoing halls the creaking and slamming of distant gates the rushing of the blast through the groves and among the ruined arches of the chapel have all a strangely delusive effect at night colonel wildman gave an instance of the kind from his own experience not long after he had taken up his residence at the abbey he heard one moonlight night a noise as if a carriage was passing at a distance he opened the window and leaned out it then seemed as if the great iron roller was dragged along the gravel walks and terrace but there was nothing to be seen when he saw the gardener on the following morning he questioned him about working so late at night the gardener declared that no one had been at work and the roller was chained up he was sent to examine it and came back with a countenance full of surprise the roller had been moved in the night but he declared no mortal hand could have moved it well replied the colonel goodhumoredly i am glad to find i have a brownie to work for me  lord byron did much to foster and give currency to the superstitious tales connected with the abbey by believing or pretending to believe in them many have supposed that his mind was really tinged with superstition and that this innate infirmity was increased by passing much of his time in a lonely way about the empty halls and cloisters of the abbey then in a ruinous melancholy state and brooding over the skulls and effigies of its former inmates i should rather think that he found poetical enjoyment in these supernatural themes and that his imagination delighted to people this gloomy and romantic pile with all kinds of shadowy inhabitants certain it is the aspect of the mansion under the varying influence of twilight and moonlight and cloud and sunshine operating upon its halls and galleries and monkish cloisters is enough to breed all kinds of fancies in the minds of its inmates especially if poetically or superstitiously inclined  i have already mentioned some of the fabled visitants of the abbey the goblin friar however is the one to whom lord byron has given the greatest importance it walked the cloisters by night and sometimes glimpses of it were seen in other parts of the abbey its appearance was said to portend some impending evil to the master of the mansion lord byron pretended to have seen it about a month before he contracted his illstarred marriage with miss milbanke  he has embodied this tradition in the following ballad in which he represents the friar as one of the ancient inmates of the abbey maintaining by night a kind of spectral possession of it in right of the fraternity other traditions however represent him as one of the friars doomed to wander about the place in atonement for his crimes but to the ballad    beware beware of the black friar     who sitteth by norman stone   for he mutters his prayers in the midnight air     and his mass of the days that are gone   when the lord of the hill amundeville     made norman church his prey   and expelld the friars one friar still     would not be driven away    though he came in his might with king henrys right     to turn church lands to lay   with sword in hand and torch to light     their walls if they said nay   a monk remaind unchased unchaind     and he did not seem formd of clay   for hes seen in the porch and hes seen in the church     though he is not seen by day    and whether for good or whether for ill     it is not mine to say   but still to the house of amundeville     he abideth night and day   by the marriage bed of their lords tis said     he flits on the bridal eve   and tis held as faith to their bed of death     he comesbut not to grieve    when an heir is born he is heard to mourn     and when aught is to befall   that ancient line in the pale moonshine     he walks from hall to hall   his form you may trace but not his face     tis shadowd by his cowl   but his eyes may be seen from the folds between     and they seem of a parted soul    but beware beware of the black friar     he still retains his sway   for he is yet the churchs heir     whoever may be the lay   amundeville is lord by day     but the monk is lord by night   nor wine nor wassail could raise a vassal     to question that friars right    say nought to him as he walks the hall     and hell say nought to you   he sweeps along in his dusky pall     as oer the grass the dew   then gramercy for the black friar     heaven sain him fair or foul   and whatsoeer may be his prayer     let ours be for his soul  such is the story of the goblin friar which partly through old tradition and partly through the influence of lord byrons rhymes has become completely established in the abbey and threatens to hold possession so long as the old edifice shall endure various visitors have either fancied or pretended to have seen him and a cousin of lord byron miss sally parkins is even said to have made a sketch of him from memory as to the servants at the abbey they have become possessed with all kinds of superstitious fancies the long corridors and gothic halls with their ancient portraits and dark figures in armor are all haunted regions to them they even fear to sleep alone and will scarce venture at night on any distant errand about the abbey unless they go in couples  even the magnificent chamber in which i was lodged was subject to the supernatural influences which reigned over the abbey and was said to be haunted by sir john byron the little with the great beard the ancient blacklooking portrait of this family worthy which hangs over the door of the great saloon was said to descend occasionally at midnight from the frame and walk the rounds of the state apartments nay his visitations were not confined to the night for a young lady on a visit to the abbey some years since declared that on passing in broad day by the door of the identical chamber i have described which stood partly open she saw sir john byron the little seated by the fireplace reading out of a great blackletter book from this circumstance some have been led to suppose that the story of sir john byron may be in some measure connected with the mysterious sculptures of the chimneypiece already mentioned but this has no countenance from the most authentic antiquarians of the abbey  for my own part the moment i learned the wonderful stories and strange suppositions connected with my apartment it became an imaginary realm to me as i lay in bed at night and gazed at the mysterious panelwork where gothic knight and christian dame and paynim lover gazed upon me in effigy i used to weave a thousand fancies concerning them the great figures in the tapestry also were almost animated by the workings of my imagination and the vandyke portraits of the cavalier and lady that looked down with pale aspects from the wall had almost a spectral effect from their immovable gaze and silent companionship    for by dim lights the portraits of the dead     have something ghastly desolate and dread   their buried looks still wave     along the canvas their eyes glance like dreams   on ours as spars within some dusky cave     but death is mingled in their shadowy beams  in this way i used to conjure up fictions of the brain and clothe the objects around me with ideal interest and import until as the abbey clock tolled midnight i almost looked to see sir john byron the little with the long beard stalk into the room with his book under his arm and take his seat beside the mysterious chimneypiece     annesley hall   at about three miles distance from newstead abbey and contiguous to its lands is situated annesley hall the old family mansion of the chaworths the families like the estates of the byrons and chaworths were connected in former times until the fatal duel between their two representatives the feud however which prevailed for a time promised to be cancelled by the attachment of two youthful hearts while lord byron was yet a boy he beheld mary ann chaworth a beautiful girl and the sole heiress of annesley with that susceptibility to female charms which he evinced almost from childhood he became almost immediately enamored of her according to one of his biographers it would appear that at first their attachment was mutual yet clandestine the father of miss chaworth was then living and may have retained somewhat of the family hostility for we are told that the interviews of lord byron and the young lady were private at a gate which opened from her fathers grounds to those of newstead however they were so young at the time that these meetings could not have been regarded as of any importance they were little more than children in years but as lord byron says of himself his feelings were beyond his age  the passion thus early conceived was blown into a flame during a six weeks vacation which he passed with his mother at nottingham the father of miss chaworth was dead and she resided with her mother at the old hall of annesley during byrons minority the estate of newstead was let to lord grey de ruthen but its youthful lord was always a welcome guest at the abbey he would pass days at a time there and make frequent visits thence to annesley hall his visits were encouraged by miss chaworths mother she partook of none of the family feud and probably looked with complacency upon an attachment that might heal old differences and unite two neighboring estates  the six weeks vacation passed as a dream amongst the beautiful flowers of annesley byron was scarce fifteen years of age mary chaworth was two years older but his heart as i have said was beyond his age and his tenderness for her was deep and passionate these early loves like the first run of the uncrushed grape are the sweetest and strongest gushings of the heart and however they may be superseded by other attachments in after years the memory will continually recur to them and fondly dwell upon their recollections  his love for miss chaworth to use lord byrons own expression was the romance of the most romantic period of his life and i think we can trace the effect of it throughout the whole course of his writings coming up every now and then like some lurking theme which runs through a complicated piece of music and links it all in a pervading chain of melody  how tenderly and mournfully does he recall in after years the feelings awakened in his youthful and inexperienced bosom by this impassioned yet innocent attachment feelings he says lost or hardened in the intercourse of life    the love of better things and better days     the unbounded hope and heavenly ignorance   of what is called the world and the worlds ways     the moments when we gather from a glance   more joy than from all future pride or praise     which kindle manhood but can neer entrance   the heart in an existence of its own   of which anothers bosom is the zone  whether this love was really responded to by the object is uncertain byron sometimes speaks as if he had met with kindness in return at other times lie acknowledges that she never gave him reason to believe she loved him it is probable however that at first she experienced some flutterings of the heart she was of a susceptible age had as yet formed no other attachments her lover though boyish in years was a man in intellect a poet in imagination and had a countenance of remarkable beauty  with the six weeks vacation ended this brief romance byron returned to school deeply enamored but if he had really made any impression on miss chaworths heart it was too slight to stand the test of absence she was at that age when a female soon changes from the girl to a woman and leaves her boyish lovers far behind her while byron was pursuing his schoolboy studies she was mingling with society and met with a gentleman of the name of musters remarkable it is said for manly beauty a story is told of her having first seen him from the top of annesley hall as he dashed through the park with hound and horn taking the lead of the whole field in a fox chase and that she was struck by the spirit of his appearance and his admirable horsemanship under such favorable auspices he wooed and won her and when lord byron next met her he learned to his dismay that she was the affianced bride of another  with that pride of spiritwhich always distinguished him he controlled his feelings and maintained a serene countenance he even affected to speak calmly on the subject of her approaching nuptials the next time i see you said he i suppose you will be mrs chaworth for she was to retain her family name her reply was i hope so  i have given these brief details preparatory to a sketch of a visit which i made to the scene of this youthful romance annesley hall i understood was shut up neglected and almost in a state of desolation for mr musters rarely visited it residing with his family in the neighborhood of nottingham i set out for the hall on horseback in company with colonel wildman and followed by the great newfoundland dog boatswain in the course of our ride we visited a spot memorable in the love story i have cited it was the scene of this parting interview between byron and miss chaworth prior to her marriage a long ridge of upland advances into the valley of newstead like a promontory into a lake and was formerly crowned by a beautiful grove a landmark to the neighboring country the grove and promontory are graphically described by lord byron in his dream and an exquisite picture given of himself and the lovely object of his boyish idolatry    i saw two beings to the hues of youth   standing upon a hill a gentle hill   green and of mild declivity the last   as twere the cape of a long ridge of such   save that there was no sea to lave its base   but a most living landscape and the ware   of woods and cornfields and the abodes of men   scattered at intervals and wreathing smoke   arising from such rustic roofsthe hill   was crownd with a peculiar diadem   of trees in circular array so fixed   not by the sport of nature but of man   these two a maiden and a youth were there   gazingthe one on all that was beneath   fair as herselfbut the boy gazed on her   and both were fair and one was beautiful   and both were youngyet not alike in youth   as the sweet moon in the horizons verge   the maid was on the verge of womanhood   the boy had fewer summers but his heart   had far outgrown his years and to his eye   there was but one beloved face on earth   and that was shining on him  i stood upon the spot consecrated by this memorable interview below me extended the living landscape once contemplated by the loving pair the gentle valley of newstead diversified by woods and cornfields and village spires and gleams of water and the distant towers and pinnacles of the venerable abbey the diadem of trees however was gone the attention drawn to it by the poet and the romantic manner in which he had associated it with his early passion for mary chaworth had nettled the irritable feelings of her husband who but ill brooked the poetic celebrity conferred on his wife by the enamored verses of another the celebrated grove stood on his estate and in a fit of spleen he ordered it to be levelled with the dust at the time of my visit the mere roots of the trees were visible but the hand that laid them low is execrated by every poetical pilgrim  descending the bill we soon entered a part of what once was annesley park and rode among timeworn and tempestriven oaks and elms with ivy clambering about their trunks and rooks nests among their branches the park had been cut up by a postroad crossing which we came to the gatehouse of annesley hall it was an old brick building that might have served as an outpost or barbacan to the hall during the civil wars when every gentlemans house was liable to become a fortress loopholes were still visible in its walls but the peaceful ivy had mantled the sides overrun the roof and almost buried the ancient clock in front that still marked the waning hours of its decay  an arched way led through the centre of the gatehouse secured by grated doors of open iron work wrought into flowers and flourishes these being thrown open we entered a paved courtyard decorated with shrubs and antique flowerpots with a ruined stone fountain in the centre the whole approach resembled that of an old french chateau  on one side of the courtyard was a range of stables now tenantless but which bore traces of the foxhunting squire for there were stalls boxed up into which the hunters might be turned loose when they came home from the chase  at the lower end of the court and immediately opposite the gatehouse extended the hall itself a rambling irregular pile patched and pieced at various times and in various tastes with gable ends stone balustrades and enormous chimneys that strutted out like buttresses from the walls the whole front of the edifice was overrun with evergreens  we applied for admission at the front door which was under a heavy porch the portal was strongly barricaded and our knocking was echoed by waste and empty halls every thing bore an appearance of abandonment after a time however our knocking summoned a solitary tenant from some remote corner of the pile it was a decentlooking little dame who emerged from a side door at a distance and seemed a worthy inmate of the antiquated mansion she had in fact grown old with it her name she said was nanny marsden if she lived until next august she would be seventyone a great part of her life had been passed in the hall and when the family had removed to nottingham she had been left in charge of it the front of the house had been thus warily barricaded in consequence of the late riots at nottingham in the course of which the dwelling of her master had been sacked by the mob to guard against any attempt of the kind upon the hall she had put it in this state of defence though i rather think she and a superannuated gardener comprised the whole garrison you must be attached to the old building said i after having lived so long in it ah sir replied she i am getting in years and have a furnished cottage of my own in annesley wood and begin to feel as if i should like to go and live in my own home  guided by the worthy little custodian of the fortress we entered through the sally port by which she had issued forth and soon found ourselves in a spacious but somewhat gloomy hall where the light was partially admitted through square stoneshafted windows overhung with ivy everything around us had the air of an oldfashioned country squires establishment in the centre of the hall was a billiardtable find about the walls were hung portraits of racehorses hunters and favorite dogs mingled indiscriminately with family pictures  staircases led up from the hall to various apartments in one of the rooms we were shown a couple of buff jerkins and a pair of ancient jackboots of the time of the cavaliers relics which are often to be met with in the old english family mansions these however had peculiar value for the good little dame assured us that they had belonged to robin hood as we were in the midst of the region over which that famous outlaw once bore ruffian sway it was not for us to gainsay his claim to any of these venerable relics though we might have demurred that the articles of dress here shown were of a date much later than his time every antiquity however about sherwood forest is apt to be linked with the memory of robin hood and his gang  as we were strolling about the mansion our fourfooted attendant boatswain followed leisurely as if taking a survey of the premises i turned to rebuke him for his intrusion but the moment the old housekeeper understood he had belonged to lord byron her heart seemed to yearn toward him nay nay exclaimed she let him alone let him go where he pleases hes welcome ah dear me if he lived here i should take great care of himhe should want for nothingwell continued she fondling him who would have thought that i should see a dog of lord byron in annesley hall  i suppose then said i you recollect something of lord byron when he used to visit here ah bless him cried she that i do he used to ride over here and stay three days at a time and sleep in the blue room ah poor fellow he was very much taken with my young mistress he used to walk about the garden and the terraces with her and seemed to love the very ground she trod on he used to call her his bright morning star of annesley  i felt the beautiful poetic phrase thrill through me  you appear to like the memory of lord byron said i  ah sir why should not i he was always main good to me when he came here well well they say it is a pity he and my young lady did not make a match her mother would have liked it he was always a welcome guest and some think it would have been well for him to have had her but it was not to be he went away to school and then mr musters saw her and so things took their course  the simple soul now showed us into the favorite sittingroom of miss chaworth with a small flowergarden under the windows in which she had delighted in this room byron used to sit and listen to her as she played and sang gazing upon her with the passionate and almost painful devotion of a lovesick stripling he himself gives us a glowing picture of his mute idolatry    he bad no breath no being but in hers    she was his voice he did not speak to her    but trembled on her words she was his sight    for his eye followed hers and saw with hers    which colored all his objects he had ceased    to live within himself she was his life    the ocean to the river of his thoughts    which terminated all upon a tone    a touch of hers his blood would ebb and flow    and his cheek change tempestuouslyhis heart    unknowing of its cause of agony  there was a little welsh air call mary ann which from bearing her own name he associated with herself and often persuaded her to sing it over and over for him  the chamber like all the other parts of the house had a look of sadness and neglect the flowerpots beneath the window which once bloomed beneath the hand of mary chaworth were overrun with weeds and the piano which had once vibrated to her touch and thrilled the heart of her stripling lover was now unstrung and out of tune  we continued our stroll about the waste apartments of all shapes and sizes and without much elegance of decoration some of them were hung with family portraits among which was pointed out that of the mr chaworth who was killed by the wicked lord byron  these dismal looking portraits had a powerful effect upon the imagination of the stripling poet on his first visit to the hall as they gazed down from the wall he thought they scowled upon him as if they had taken a grudge against him on account of the duel of his ancestor he even gave this as a reason though probably in jest for not sleeping at the hall declaring that he feared they would come down from their frames at night to haunt him  a feeling of the kind he has embodied in one of his stanzas of don juan    the forms of the grim knights and pictured saints     look living in the moon and as you turn   backward and forward to the echoes faint     of your own footstepsvoices from the urn   appear to wake and shadows wild and quaint     start from the frames which fence their aspects stern   as if to ask you how you dare to keep   a vigil there where all but death should sleep  nor was the youthful poet singular in these fancies the hall like most old english mansions that have ancient family portraits hanging about their dusky galleries and waste apartments had its ghost story connected with these pale memorials of the dead our simplehearted conductor stopped before the portrait of a lady who had been a beauty in her time and inhabited the hall in the heyday of her charms something mysterious or melancholy was connected with her story she died young but continued for a long time to haunt the ancient mansion to the great dismay of the servants and the occasional disquiet of the visitors and it was with much difficulty her troubled spirit was conjured down and put to rest  from the rear of the hall we walked out into the garden about which byron used to stroll and loiter in company with miss chaworth it was laid out in the old french style there was a long terraced walk with heavy stone balustrades and sculptured urns overrun with ivy and evergreens a neglected shrubbery bordered one side of the terrace with a lofty grove inhabited by a venerable community of rooks great flights of steps led down from the terrace to a flower garden laid out in formal plots the rear of the hall which overlooked the garden had the weather stains of centuries and its stoneshafted casements and an ancient sundial against its walls carried back the mind to days of yore  the retired and quiet garden once a little sequestered world of love and romance was now all matted and wild yet was beautiful even in its decay its air of neglect and desolation was in unison with the fortune of the two beings who had once walked here in the freshness of youth and life and beauty the garden like their young hearts had gone to waste and ruin  returning to the hall we now visited a chamber built over the porch or grand entrance it was in a ruinous condition the ceiling having fallen in and the floor given way this however is a chamber rendered interesting by poetical associations it is supposed to be the oratory alluded to by lord byron in his dream wherein he pictures his departure from annesley after learning that mary chaworth was engaged to be married    there was an ancient mansion and before   its walls there was a steed caparisoned   within an antique oratory stood   the boy of whom i spakehe was alone   and pale and pacing to and fro anon   he sate him down and seized a pen and traced   words which i could not guess of then he leaned   his bowd head on his hands and shook as twere   with a convulsionthen arose again   and with his teeth and quivering hands did tear   what he had written but he shed no tears   and he did calm himself and fix his brow   into a kind of quiet as he paused   the lady of his love reentered there   she was serene and smiling then and yet   she knew she was by him belovedshe knew   for quickly comes such knowledge that his heart   was darkened with her shadow and she saw   that he was wretched but she saw not all   he rose and with a cold and gentle grasp   he took her hand a moment oer his face   a tablet of unutterable thoughts   was traced and then it faded as it came   he droppd the hand he held and with slow steps   returnd but not as bidding her adieu   for they did part with mutual smileshe passd   from out the massy gate of that old hall   and mounting on his steed he went his way   and neer repassed that hoary threshold more  in one of his journals lord byron describes his feelings after thus leaving the oratory arriving on the summit of a hill which commanded the last view of annesley he checked his horse and gazed back with mingled pain and fondness upon the groves which embowered the hall and thought upon the lovely being that dwelt there until his feelings were quite dissolved in tenderness the conviction at length recurred that she never could be his when rousing himself from his reverie he struck his spurs into his steed and dashed forward as if by rapid motion to leave reflection behind him  yet notwithstanding what he asserts in the verses last quoted he did pass the hoary threshold of annesley again it was however after the lapse of several years during which he had grown up to manhood and had passed through the ordeal of pleasures and tumultuous passions and had felt the influence of other charms miss chaworth too had become a wife and a mother and he dined at annesley hall at the invitation of her husband he thus met the object of his early idolatry in the very scene of his tender devotions which as he says her smiles had once made a heaven to him the scene was but little changed he was in the very chamber where he had so often listened entranced to the witchery of her voice there were the same instruments and music there lay her flower garden beneath the window and the walks through which he had wandered with her in the intoxication of youthful love can we wonder that amidst the tender recollections which every object around him was calculated to awaken the fond passion of his boyhood should rush back in full current to his heart he was himself surprised at this sudden revulsion of his feelings but he had acquired self possession and could command them his firmness however was doomed to undergo a further trial while seated by the object of his secret devotions with all these recollections throbbing in his bosom her infant daughter was brought into the room at sight of the child he started it dispelled the last lingerings of his dream and he afterward confessed that to repress his emotion at the moment was the severest part of his task  the conflict of feelings that raged within his bosom throughout this fond and tender yet painful and embarrassing visit are touchingly depicted in lines which he wrote immediately afterward and which though not addressed to her by name are evidently intended for the eye and the heart of the fair lady of annesley    well thou art happy and i feel     that i should thus be happy too   for still my heart regards thy weal     warmly as it was wont to do    thy husbands blestand twill impart     some pangs to view his happier lot   but let them passoh how my heart     would hate him if he loved thee not    when late i saw thy favorite child     i thought my jealous heart would break   but when the unconscious infant smiled     i kissd it for its mothers sake    i kissd it and repressd my sighs     its father in its face to see   but then it had its mothers eyes     and they were all to love and me    mary adieu i must away     while thou art blest ill not repine   but near thee i can never stay     my heart would soon again be thine    i deemd that time i deemd that pride     had quenchd at length my boyish flame   nor knew till seated by thy side     my heart in all save love the same    yet i was calm i knew the time     my breast would thrill before thy look   but now to tremble were a crime     we met and not a nerve was shook    i saw thee gaze upon my face     yet meet with no confusion there   one only feeling couldst thou trace     the sullen calmness of despair    away away my early dream     remembrance never must awake   oh where is lethes fabled stream     my foolish heart be still or break  the revival of this early passion and the melancholy associations which it spread over those scenes in the neighborhood of newstead which would necessarily be the places of his frequent resort while in england are alluded to by him as a principal cause of his first departure for the continent    when man expelld from edens bowers     a moment lingered near the gate   each scene recalled the vanishd hours     and bade him curse his future fate    but wandering on through distant climes     he learnt to bear his load of grief   just gave a sigh to other times     and found in busier scenes relief    thus mary must it be with me     and i must view thy charms no more   for while i linger near to thee     i sigh for all i knew before  it was in the subsequent june that he set off on his pilgrimage by sea and land which was to become the theme of his immortal poem that the image of mary chaworth as he saw and loved her in the days of his boyhood followed him to the very shore is shown in the glowing stanzas addressed to her on the eve of embarkation    tis doneand shivering in the gale     the bark unfurls her snowy sail   and whistling oer the bending mast     loud sings on high the freshning blast   and i must from this land be gone     because i cannot love but one    and i will cross the whitening foam     and i will seek a foreign home   till i forget a false fair face     i neer shall find a resting place   my own dark thoughts i cannot shun     but ever love and love but one    to think of every early scene     of what we are and what weve been   would whelm some softer hearts with woe     but mine alas has stood the blow   yet still beats on as it begun     and never truly loves but one    and who that dear loved one may be     is not for vulgar eyes to see   and why that early love was crossd     thou knowst the best i feel the most   but few that dwell beneath the sun     have loved so long and loved but one    ive tried anothers fetters too     with charms perchance as fair to view   and i would fain have loved as well     but some unconquerable spell   forbade my bleeding breast to own     a kindred care for aught but one    twould soothe to take one lingering view     and bless thee in my last adieu   yet wish i not those eyes to weep     for him who wanders oer the deep   his home his hope his youth are gone     yet still he loves and loves but one  the painful interview at annesley hall which revived with such intenseness his early passion remained stamped upon his memory with singular force and seems to have survived all his wandering through distant climes to which he trusted as an oblivious antidote upward of two years after that event when having made his famous pilgrimage he was once more an inmate of newstead abbey his vicinity to annesley hall brought the whole scene vividly before him and he thus recalls it in a poetic epistle to a friend    ive seen my bride anothers bride   have seen her seated by his side   have seen the infant which she bore   wear the sweet smile the mother wore   when she and i in youth have smiled   as fond and faultless as her child   have seen her eyes in cold disdain   ask if i felt no secret pain    and i have acted well my part   and made my cheek belie my heart   returned the freezing glance she gave   yet felt the while that womans slave   have kissd as if without design   the babe which ought to have been mine   and showd alas in each caress   time had not made me love the less  it was about the time says moore in his life of lord byron when he was thus bitterly feeling and expressing the blight which his heart had suffered from a real object of affection that his poems on an imaginary one thyrza were written he was at the same time grieving over the loss of several of his earliest and dearest friends the companions of his joyous schoolboy hours to recur to the beautiful language of moore who writes with the kindred and kindling sympathies of a true poet all these recollections of the young and the dead mingled themselves in his mind with the image of her who though living was for him as much lost as they and diffused that general feeling of sadness and fondness through his soul which found a vent in these poems it was the blending of the two affections in his memory and imagination that gave birth to an ideal object combining the best features of both and drew from him those saddest and tenderest of love poems in which we find all the depth and intensity of real feeling touched over with such a light as no reality ever wore  an early innocent and unfortunate passion however fruitful of pain it may be to the man is a lasting advantage to the poet it is a well of sweet and bitter fancies of refined and gentle sentiments of elevated and ennobling thoughts shut up in the deep recesses of the heart keeping it green amidst the withering blights of the world and by its casual gushings and overflowings recalling at times all the freshness and innocence and enthusiasm of youthful days lord byron was conscious of this effect and purposely cherished and brooded over the remembrance of his early passion and of all the scenes of annesley hall connected with it it was this remembrance that attuned his mind to some of its most elevated and virtuous strains and shed an inexpressible grace and pathos over his best productions  being thus put upon the traces of this little lovestory i cannot refrain from threading them out as they appear from time to time in various passages of lord byrons works during his subsequent rambles in the east when time and distance had softened away his early romance almost into the remembrance of a pleasing and tender dream he received accounts of the object of it which represented her still in her paternal hall among her native bowers of annesley surrounded by a blooming and beautiful family yet a prey to secret and withering melancholy    in her home   a thousand leagues from hisher native home   she dwelt begirt with growing infancy   daughters and sons of beauty butbehold   upon her face there was the tint of grief   the settled shadow of an inward strife   and an unquiet drooping of the eye   as if its lids were charged with unshed tears  for an instant the buried tenderness of early youth and the fluttering hopes which accompanied it seemed to have revived in his bosom and the idea to have flashed upon his mind that his image might be connected with her secret woesbut he rejected the thought almost as soon as formed    what could her grief beshe had all she loved   and he who had so loved her was not there   to trouble with bad hopes or evil wish   or ill repressd affection her pure thoughts   what could her grief beshe had loved him not   nor given him cause to deem himself beloved   nor could he be a part of that which preyd   upon her minda spectre of the past  the cause of her grief was a matter of rural comment in the neighborhood of newstead and annesley it was disconnected from all idea of lord byron but attributed to the harsh and capricious conduct of one to whose kindness and affection she had a sacred claim the domestic sorrows which had long preyed in secret on her heart at length affected her intellect and the bright morning star of annesley was eclipsed for ever    the lady of his loveoh she was changed   as by the sickness of the soul her mind   had wandered from its dwelling and her eyes   they had not their own lustre but the look   which is not of the earth she was become   the queen of a fantastic realm but her thoughts   were combinations of disjointed things   and forms impalpable and unperceived   of others sight familiar were to hers   and this the world calls frenzy  notwithstanding lapse of time change of place and a succession of splendid and spiritstirring scenes in various countries the quiet and gentle scene of his boyish love seems to have held a magic sway over the recollections of lord byron and the image of mary chaworth to have unexpectedly obtruded itself upon his mind like some supernatural visitation such was the fact on the occasion of his marriage with miss milbanke annesley hall and all its fond associations floated like a vision before his thoughts even when at the altar and on the point of pronouncing the nuptial vows the circumstance is related by him with a force and feeling that persuade us of its truth    a change came oer the spirit of my dream   the wanderer was returnedi saw him stand   before an altarwith a gentle bride   her face was fair but was not that which made   the starlight of his boyhoodas he stood   even at the altar oer his brow there came   the selfsame aspect and the quivering shock   that in the antique oratory shook   his bosom in its solitude and then   as in that houra moment oer his face   the tablet of unutterable thoughts   was tracedand then it faded as it came   and he stood calm and quiet and he spoke   the fitting vows but beard not his own words   and all things reeld around him he could see   not that which was nor that which should have been   but the old mansion and the accustomed hall   and the rememberd chambers and the place   the day the hour the sunshine and the shade   all things pertaining to that place and hour   and her who was his destiny came back   and thrust themselves between him and the light   what business had they there at such a time  the history of lord byrons union is too well known to need narration the errors and humiliations and heartburnings that followed upon it gave additional effect to the remembrance of his early passion and tormented him with the idea that had he been successful in his suit to the lovely heiress of annesley they might both have shared a happier destiny in one of his manuscripts written long after his marriage having accidentally mentioned miss chaworth as my m a c alas exclaims he with a sudden burst of feeling why do i say my our union would have healed feuds in which blood had been shed by our fathers it would have joined lands broad and rich it would have joined at least one heart and two persons not illmatched in yearsandandandwhat has been the result  but enough of annesley hall and the poetical themes connected with it i felt as if i could linger for hours about its ruined oratory and silent hall and neglected garden and spin reveries and dream dreams until all became an ideal world around me the day however was fast declining and the shadows of evening throwing deeper shades of melancholy about the place taking our leave of the worthy old housekeeper therefore with a small compensation and many thanks for her civilities we mounted our horses and pursued our way back to newstead abbey     the lake    before the mansion lay a lucid lake     broad as transparent deep and freshly fed   by a river which its softened way did take     in currents through the calmer water spread   around the wild fowl nestled in the brake     and sedges brooding in their liquid bed   the woods sloped downward to its brink and stood     with their green faces fixed upon the flood   such is lord byrons description of one of a series of beautiful sheets of water formed in old times by the monks by damming up the course of a small river here he used daily to enjoy his favorite recreations in swimming and sailing the wicked old lord in his scheme of rural devastation had cut down all the woods that once fringed the lake lord byron on coming of age endeavored to restore them and a beautiful young wood planted by him now sweeps up from the waters edge and clothes the hillside opposite to the abbey to this woody nook colonel wildman has given the appropriate title of the poets corner  the lake has inherited its share of the traditions and fables connected with everything in and about the abbey it was a petty mediterranean sea on which the wicked old lord used to gratify his nautical tastes and humors he had his mimic castles and fortresses along its shores and his mimic fleets upon its waters and used to get up mimic sea fights the remains of his petty fortifications still awaken the curious inquiries of visitors in one of his vagaries he caused a large vessel to be brought on wheels from the seacoast and launched in the lake the country people were surprised to see a ship thus sailing over dry land they called to mind a saying of mother shipton the famous prophet of the vulgar that whenever a ship freighted with ling should cross sherwood forest newstead would pass out of the byron family the country people who detested the old lord were anxious to verify the prophecy ling in the dialect of nottingham is the name for heather with this plant they heaped the fated bark as it passed so that it arrived full freighted at newstead  the most important stories about the lake however relate to the treasures that are supposed to lie buried in its bosom these may have taken their origin in a fact which actually occurred there was one time fished up from the deep part of the lake a great eagle of molten brass with expanded wings standing on a pedestal or perch of the same metal it had doubtless served as a stand or readingdesk in the abbey chapel to hold a folio bible or missal  the sacred relic was sent to a brazier to be cleaned as he was at work upon it he discovered that the pedestal was hollow and composed of several pieces unscrewing these he drew forth a number of parchment deeds and grants appertaining to the abbey and bearing the seals of edward iii and henry viii which had thus been concealed and ultimately sunk in the lake by the friars to substantiate their right and title to these domains at some future day  one of the parchment scrolls thus discovered throws rather an awkward light upon the kind of life led by the friars of newstead it is an indulgence granted to them for a certain number of months in which plenary pardon is assured in advance for all kinds of crimes among which several of the most gross and sensual are specifically mentioned and the weakness of the flesh to which they are prone  after inspecting these testimonials of monkish life in the regions of sherwood forest we cease to wonder at the virtuous indignation of robin hood and his outlaw crew at the sleek sensualists of the cloister    i never hurt the husbandman   that use to till the ground   nor spill their blood that range the wood   to follow hawk and hound    my chiefest spite to clergy is   who in these days bear sway   with friars and monks with their fine spunks   i make my chiefest preyold ballad of robin hood  the brazen eagle has been transferred to the parochial and collegiate church of southall about twenty miles from newstead where it may still be seen in the centre of the chancel supporting as of yore a ponderous bible as to the documents it contained they are carefully treasured up by colonel wildman among his other deeds and papers in an iron chest secured by a patent lock of nine bolts almost equal to a magic spell  the fishing up of this brazen relic as i have already hinted has given rise to the tales of treasure lying at the bottom of the lake thrown in there by the monks when they abandoned the abbey the favorite story is that there is a great iron chest there filled with gold and jewels and chalices and crucifixes nay that it has been seen when the water of the lake was unusually low there were large iron rings at each end but all attempts to move it were ineffectual either the gold it contained was too ponderous or what is more probable it was secured by one of those magic spells usually laid upon hidden treasure it remains therefore at the bottom of the lake to this day and it is to be hoped may one day or other be discovered by the present worthy proprietor     robin hood and sherwood forest   while at newstead abbey i took great delight in riding and rambling about the neighborhood studying out the traces of merry sherwood forest and visiting the haunts of robin hood the relics of the old forest are few and scattered but as to the bold outlaw who once held a kind of freebooting sway over it there is scarce a hill or dale a cliff or cavern a well or fountain in this part of the country that is not connected with his memory the very names of some of the tenants on the newstead estate such as beardall and hardstaff sound as if they may have been borne in old times by some of the stalwart fellows of the outlaw gang one of the earliest books that captivated my fancy when a child was a collection of robin hood ballads adorned with cuts which i bought of an old scotch pedler at the cost of all my holiday money how i devoured its pages and gazed upon its uncouth woodcuts for a time my mind was filled with picturings of merry sherwood and the exploits and revelling of the hold foresters and robin hood little john friar tuck and their doughty compeers were my heroes of romance  these early feelings were in some degree revived when i found myself in the very heart of the farfamed forest and as i said before i took a kind of schoolboy delight in hunting up all traces of old sherwood and its sylvan chivalry one of the first of my antiquarian rambles was on horseback in company with colonel wildman and his lady who undertook to guide me to borne of the moldering monuments of the forest one of these stands in front of the very gate of newstead park and is known throughout the country by the name of the pilgrim oak it is a venerable tree of great size overshadowing a wide arena of the road under its shade the rustics of the neighborhood have been accustomed to assemble on certain holidays and celebrate their rural festivals this custom had been handed down from father to son for several generations until the oak had acquired a kind of sacred character  the old lord byron however in whose eyes nothing was sacred when he laid his desolating hand on the groves and forests of newstead doomed likewise this traditional tree to the axe fortunately the good people of nottingham heard of the danger of their favorite oak and hastened to ransom it from destruction they afterward made a present of it to the poet when he came to the estate and the pilgrim oak is likely to continue a rural gathering place for many coming generations  from this magnificent and timehonored tree we continued on our sylvan research in quest of another oak of more ancient date and less flourishing condition a ride of two or three miles the latter part across open wastes once clothed with forest now bare and cheerless brought us to the tree in question it was the oak of ravenshead one of the last survivors of old sherwood and which had evidently once held a high head in the forest it was now a mere wreck crazed by time and blasted by lightning and standing alone on a naked waste like a ruined column in a desert    the scenes are desert now and bare   where flourished once a forest fair   when these waste glens with copse were lined   and peopled with the hart and hind   yon lonely oak would he could tell   the changes of his parent dell   since he so gray and stubborn now   waved in each breeze a sapling bough   would he could tell how deep the shade   a thousand mingled branches made   here in my shade methinks hed say   the mighty stag at noontide lay   while doe and roe and reddeer good   hare bounded by through gay greenwood  at no great distance from ravenshead oak is a small cave which goes by the name of robin hoods stable it is in the breast of a hill scooped out of brown freestone with rude attempt at columns and arches within are two niches which served it is said as stalls for the bold outlaws horses to this retreat he retired when hotly pursued by the law for the place was a secret even from his band the cave is overshadowed by an oak and alder and is hardly discoverable even at the present day but when the country was overrun with forest it must have been completely concealed  there was an agreeable wildness and loneliness in a great part of our ride our devious road wound down at one time among rocky dells by wandering streams and lonely pools haunted by shy waterfowl we passed through a skirt of woodland of more modern planting but considered a legitimate offspring of the ancient forest and commonly called jock of sherwood in riding through these quiet solitary scenes the partridge and pheasant would now and then burst upon the wing and the hare scud away before us  another of these rambling rides in quest of popular antiquities was to a chain of rocky cliffs called the kirkby crags which skirt the robin hood hills here leaving my horse at the foot of the crags i scaled their rugged sides and seated myself in a niche of the rocks called robin hoods chair it commands a wide prospect over the valley of newstead and here the bold outlaw is said to have taken his seat and kept a lookout upon the roads below watching for merchants and bishops and other wealthy travellers upon whom to pounce down like an eagle from his eyrie  descending from the cliffs and remounting my horse a ride of a mile or two further along a narrow robber path as it was called which wound up into the hills between perpendicular rocks led to an artificial cavern cut in the face of a cliff with a door and window wrought through the living stone this bears the name of friar tucks cell or hermitage where according to tradition that jovial anchorite used to make good cheer and boisterous revel with his freebooting comrades  such were some of the vestiges of old sherwood and its renowned yeomandrie which i visited in the neighborhood of newstead the worthy clergyman who officiated as chaplain at the abbey seeing my zeal in the cause informed me of a considerable tract of the ancient forest still in existence about ten miles distant there were many fine old oaks in it he said that had stood for centuries but were now shattered and stagheaded that is to say their upper branches were bare and blasted and straggling out like the antlers of a deer their trunks too were hollow and full of crows and jackdaws who made them their nestling places he occasionally rode over to the forest in the long summer evenings and pleased himself with loitering in the twilight about the green alleys and under the venerable trees  the description given by the chaplain made me anxious to visit this remnant of old sherwood and he kindly offered to be my guide and companion we accordingly sallied forth one morning on horseback on this sylvan expedition our ride took us through a part of the country where king john had once held a hunting seat the ruins of which are still to be seen at that time the whole neighbor hood was an open royal forest or frank chase as it was termed for king john was an enemy to parks and warrens and other inclosures by which game was fenced in for the private benefit and recreation of the nobles and the clergy  here on the brow of a gentle hill commanding an extensive prospect of what had once been forest stood another of those monumental trees which to my mind gave a peculiar interest to this neighborhood it was the parliament oak so called in memory of an assemblage of the kind held by king john beneath its shade the lapse of upward of six centuries had reduced this once mighty tree to a mere crumbling fragment yet like a gigantic torso in ancient statuary the grandeur of the mutilated trunk gave evidence of what it had been in the days of its glory in contemplating its mouldering remains the fancy busied itself in calling up the scene that must have been presented beneath its shade when this sunny hill swarmed with the pageantry of a warlike and hunting court when silken pavilions and warriortents decked its crest and royal standards and baronial banners and knightly pennons rolled out to the breeze when prelates and courtiers and steelclad chivalry thronged round the person of the monarch while at a distance loitered the foresters in green and all the rural and hunting train that waited upon his sylvan sports     a thousand vassals mustered round    with horse and hawk and horn and hound    and through the brake the rangers stalk    and falcners hold the ready hawk    and foresters in greenwood trim    lead in the leash the greyhound grim  such was the phantasmagoria that presented itself for a moment to my imagination peopling the silent place before me with empty shadows of the past the reverie however was transient king courtier and steel clad warrior and forester in green with horn and hawk and hound all faded again into oblivion and i awoke to all that remained of this once stirring scene of human pomp and powera mouldering oak and a tradition    we are such stuff as dreams are made of  a ride of a few miles farther brought us at length among the venerable and classic shades of sherwood here i was delighted to find myself in a genuine wild wood of primitive and natural growth so rarely to be met with in this thickly peopled and highly cultivated country it reminded me of the aboriginal forests of my native land i rode through natural alleys and greenwood groves carpeted with grass and shaded by lofty and beautiful birches what most interested me however was to behold around me the mighty trunks of veteran oaks old monumental trees the patriarchs of sherwood forest they were shattered hollow and mossgrown it is true and their leafy honors were nearly departed but like mouldering towers they were noble and picturesque in their decay and gave evidence even in their ruins of their ancient grandeur  as i gazed about me upon these vestiges of once merrie sherwood the picturings of my boyish fancy began to rise in my mind and robin hood and his men to stand before me     he clothed himself in scarlet then     his men were all in green    a finer show throughout the world     in no place could be seen    good lord it was a gallant sight     to see them all in a row   with every man a good broadsword     and eke a good yew bow  the horn of robin hood again seemed to resound through the forest i saw this sylvan chivalry half huntsmen half freebooters trooping across the distant glades or feasting and revelling beneath the trees i was going on to embody in this way all the ballad scenes that had delighted me when a boy when the distant sound of a woodcutters axe roused me from my daydream  the boding apprehensions which it awakened were too soon verified i had not ridden much farther when i came to an open space where the work of destruction was going on around me lay the prostrate trunks of venerable oaks once the towering and magnificent lords of the forest and a number of woodcutters were hacking and hewing at another gigantic tree just tottering to its fall  alas for old sherwood forest it had fallen into the possession of a noble agriculturist a modern utilitarian who had no feeling for poetry or forest scenery in a little while and this glorious woodland will be laid low its green glades be turned into sheepwalks its legendary bowers supplanted by turnipfields and merrie sherwood will exist but in ballad and tradition  o for the poetical superstitions thought i of the olden time that shed a sanctity over every grove that gave to each tree its tutelar genius or nymph and threatened disaster to all who should molest the hamadryads in their leafy abodes alas for the sordid propensities of modern days when everything is coined into gold and this once holiday planet of ours is turned into a mere workingday world  my cobweb fancies put to flight and my feelings out of tune i left the forest in a far different mood from that in which i had entered it and rode silently along until on reaching the summit of a gentle eminence the chime of evening bells came on the breeze across the heath from a distant village  i paused to listen  they are merely the evening bells of mansfield said my companion  of mansfield here was another of the legendary names of this storied neighborhood that called up early and pleasant associations the famous old ballad of the king and the miller of mansfield came at once to mind and the chime of the bells put me again in good humor  a little farther on and we were again on the traces of robin hood here was fountain dale where he had his encounter with that stalwart shaveling friar tuck who was a kind of saint militant alternately wearing the casque and the cowl     the curtal fryar kept fountain dale     seven long years and more    there was neither lord knight or earl     could make him yield before  the moat is still shown which is said to have surrounded the stronghold of this jovial and fighting friar and the place where he and robin hood had their sturdy trial of strength and prowess in the memorable conflict which lasted     from ten oclock that very day    until four in the afternoon  and ended in the treaty of fellowship as to the hardy feats both of sword and trencher performed by this curtal fryar behold are they not recorded at length in the ancient ballads and in the magic pages of ivanhoe  the evening was fast coming on and the twilight thickening as we rode through these haunts famous in outlaw story a melancholy seemed to gather over the landscape as we proceeded for our course lay by shadowy woods and across naked heaths and along lonely roads marked by some of those sinister names by which the country people in england are apt to make dreary places still more dreary the horrors of thieves wood and the murderers stone and the hag nook had all to be encountered in the gathering gloom of evening and threatened to beset our path with more than mortal peril happily however we passed these ominous places unharmed and arrived in safety at the portal of newstead abbey highly satisfied with our greenwood foray     the rook cell   in the course of my sojourn at the abbey i changed my quarters from the magnificent old state apartment haunted by sir john byron the little to another in a remote corner of the ancient edifice immediately adjoining the ruined chapel it possessed still more interest in my eyes from having been the sleeping apartment of lord byron during his residence at the abbey the furniture remained the same here was the bed in which he slept and which he had brought with him from college its gilded posts surmounted by coronets giving evidence of his aristocratical feelings here was likewise his college sofa and about the walls were the portraits of his favorite butler old joe murray of his fancy acquaintance jackson the pugilist together with pictures of harrow school and the college at cambridge at which he was educated the bedchamber goes by the name of the book cell from its vicinity to the rookery which since time immemorial has maintained possession of a solemn grove adjacent to the chapel this venerable community afforded me much food for speculation during my residence in this apartment in the morning i used to hear them gradually waking and seeming to call each other up after a time the whole fraternity would be in a flutter some balancing and swinging on the tree tops others perched on the pinnacle of the abbey church or wheeling and hovering about in the air and the ruined walls would reverberate with their incessant cawings in this way they would linger about the rookery and its vicinity for the early part of the morning when having apparently mustered all their forces called over the roll and determined upon their line of march they one and all would sail off in a long straggling flight to maraud the distant fields they would forage the country for miles and remain absent all day excepting now and then a scout would come home as if to see that all was well toward night the whole host might be seen like a dark cloud in the distance winging their way homeward they came as it were with whoop and halloo wheeling high in the air above the abbey making various evolutions before they alighted and then keeping up an incessant cawing in the tree tops until they gradually fell asleep  it is remarked at the abbey that the rooks though they sally forth on forays throughout the week yet keep about the venerable edifice on sundays as if they had inherited a reverence for the day from their ancient confreres the monks indeed a believer in the metempsychosis might easily imagine these gothiclooking birds to be the embodied souls of the ancient friars still hovering about their sanctified abode  i dislike to disturb any point of popular and poetic faith and was loath therefore to question the authenticity of this mysterious reverence for the sabbath on the part of the newstead rooks but certainly in the course of my sojourn in the rook cell i detected them in a flagrant outbreak and foray on a bright sunday morning  beside the occasional clamor of the rookery this remote apartment was often greeted with sounds of a different kind from the neighboring ruins the great lancet window in front of the chapel adjoins the very wall of the chamber and the mysterious sounds from it at night have been well described by lord byron  now loud now frantic   the gale sweeps through its fretwork and oft sings   the owl his anthem when the silent quire   lie with their hallelujahs quenched like fire    but on the noontide of the moon and when     the wind is winged from one point of heaven   there moans a strange unearthly sound which then     is musicala dying accent driven   through the huge arch which soars and sinks again     some deem it but the distant echo given   back to the night wind by the waterfall   and harmonized by the old choral wall    others that some original shape or form     shaped by decay perchance hath given the power   to this gray ruin with a voice to charm     sad but serene it sweeps oer tree or tower   the cause i know not nor can solve but such   the factive heard itonce perhaps too much  never was a traveller in quest of the romantic in greater luck i had in sooth got lodged in another haunted apartment of the abbey for in this chamber lord byron declared he had more than once been harassed at midnight by a mysterious visitor a black shapeless form would sit cowering upon his bed and after gazing at him for a time with glaring eyes would roll off and disappear the same uncouth apparition is said to have disturbed the slumbers of a newly married couple that once passed their honeymoon in this apartment  i would observe that the access to the rook cell is by a spiral stone staircase leading up into it as into a turret from the long shadowy corridor over the cloisters one of the midnight walks of the goblin friar indeed to the fancies engendered in his brain in this remote and lonely apartment incorporated with the floating superstitions of the abbey we are no doubt indebted for the spectral scene in don juan    then as the night was clear though cold he threw     his chamber door wide openand went forth   into a gallery of sombre hue     long furnishd with old pictures of great worth   of knights and dames heroic and chaste too     as doubtless should be people of high birth    no sound except the echo of his sigh     or step ran sadly through that antique house   when suddenly he heard or thought so nigh     a supernatural agentor a mouse   whose little nibbling rustle will embarrass   most people as it plays along the arras    it was no mouse but lo a monk arrayed     in cowl and beads and dusky garb appeared   now in the moonlight and now lapsed in shade     with steps that trod as heavy yet unheard   his garments only a slight murmur made     he moved as shadowy as the sisters weird   but slowly and as he passed juan by   glared without pausing on him a bright eye    juan was petrified he had heard a hint     of such a spirit in these halls of old   but thought like most men there was nothing int     beyond the rumor which such spots unfold   coind from surviving superstitions mint     which passes ghosts in currency like gold   but rarely seen like gold compared with paper   and did he see this or was it a vapor    once twice thrice passd repassdthe thing of air     or earth beneath or heaven or tother place   and juan gazed upon it with a stare     yet could not speak or move but on its base   as stauds a statue stood he felt his hair     twine like a knot of snakes around his face   he taxd his tongue for words which were not granted   to ask the reverend person what he wanted    the third time after a still longer pause     the shadow passd awaybut where the hall   was long and thus far there was no great cause     to think its vanishing unnatural   doors there were many through which by the laws     of physics bodies whether short or tall   might come or go but juan could not state   through which the spectre seemd to evaporate    he stood how long he knew not but it seemd     an ageexpectant powerless with his eyes   straind on the spot where first the figure gleamd     then by degrees recalld his energies   and would have passd the whole off as a dream     but could not wake he was he did surmise   waking already and returnd at length   back to his chamber shorn of half his strength  as i have already observed it is difficult to determine whether lord byron was really subject to the superstitious fancies which have been imputed to him or whether he merely amused himself by giving currency to them among his domestics and dependents he certainly never scrupled to express a belief in supernatural visitations both verbally and in his correspondence if such were his foible the rook cell was an admirable place to engender these delusions as i have lain awake at night i have heard all kinds of mysterious and sighing sounds from the neighboring ruin distant footsteps too and the closing of doors in remote parts of the abbey would send hollow reverberations and echoes along the corridor and up the spiral staircase once in fact i was roused by a strange sound at the very door of my chamber i threw it open and a form black and shapeless with glaring eyes stood before me it proved however neither ghost nor goblin but my friend boatswain the great newfoundland dog who had conceived a companionable liking for me and occasionally sought me in my apartment to the hauntings of even such a visitant as honest boatswain may we attribute some of the marvellous stories about the goblin friar     the little white lady   in the course of a mornings ride with colonel wildman about the abbey lands we found ourselves in one of the prettiest little wild woods imaginable the road to it had led us among rocky ravines overhung with thickets and now wound through birchen dingles and among beautiful groves and clumps of elms and beeches a limpid rill of sparkling water winding and doubling in perplexed mazes crossed our path repeatedly so as to give the wood the appearance of being watered by numerous rivulets the solitary and romantic look of this piece of woodland and the frequent recurrence of its mazy stream put him in mind colonel wildman said of the little german fairy tale of undine in which is recorded the adventures of a knight who had married a waternymph as he rode with his bride through her native woods every stream claimed her as a relative one was a brother another an uncle another a cousin we rode on amusing ourselves with applying this fanciful tale to the charming scenery around us until we came to a lowly graystone farmhouse of ancient date situated in a solitary glen on the margin of the brook and overshadowed by venerable trees it went by the name as i was told of the weir mill farmhouse with this rustic mansion was connected a little tale of real life some circumstances of which were related to me on the spot and others i collected in the course of my sojourn at the abbey  not long after colonel wildman had purchased the estate of newstead he made it a visit for the purpose of planning repairs and alterations as he was rambling one evening about dusk in company with his architect through this little piece of woodland he was struck with its peculiar characteristics and then for the first time compared it to the haunted wood of undine while he was making the remark a small female figure in white flitted by without speaking a word or indeed appearing to notice them her step was scarcely heard as she passed and her form was indistinct in the twilight  what a figure for a fairy or sprite exclaimed colonel wildman how much a poet or a romance writer would make of such an apparition at such a time and in such a place  he began to congratulate himself upon having some elfin inhabitant for his haunted wood when on proceeding a few paces he found a white frill lying in the path which had evidently fallen from the figure that had just passed  well said he after all this is neither sprite nor fairy but a being of flesh and blood and muslin  continuing on he came to where the road passed by an old mill in front of the abbey the people of the mill were at the door he paused and inquired whether any visitor had been at the abbey but was answered in the negative  has nobody passed by here  no one sir  thats strange surely i met a female in white who must have passed along this path  oh sir you mean the little white ladyoh yes she passed by here not long since  the little white lady and pray who is the little white lady  why sir that nobody knows she lives in the weir mill farmhouse down in the skirts of the wood she comes to the abbey every morning keeps about it all day and goes away at night she speaks to nobody and we are rather shy of her for we dont know what to make of her  colonel wildman now concluded that it was some artist or amateur employed in making sketches of the abbey and thought no more about the matter he went to london and was absent for some time in the interim his sister who was newly married came with her husband to pass the honeymoon at the abbey the little white lady still resided in the weir mill farmhouse on the border of the haunted wood and continued her visits daily to the abbey her dress was always the same a white gown with a little black spencer or bodice and a white hat with a short veil that screened the upper part of her countenance her habits were shy lonely and silent she spoke to no one and sought no companionship excepting with the newfoundland dog that had belonged to lord byron his friendship she secured by caressing him and occasionally bringing him food and he became the companion of her solitary walks she avoided all strangers and wandered about the retired parts of the garden sometimes sitting for hours by the tree on which lord byron had carved his name or at the foot of the monument which he had erected among the ruins of the chapel sometimes she read sometimes she wrote with a pencil on a small slate which she carried with her but much of her time was passed in a kind of reverie  the people about the place gradually became accustomed to her and suffered her to wander about unmolested their distrust of her subsided on discovering that most of her peculiar and lonely habits arose from the misfortune of being deaf and dumb still she was regarded with some degree of shyness for it was the common opinion that she was not exactly in her right mind  colonel wildmans sister was informed of all these circumstances by the servants of the abbey among whom the little white lady was a theme of frequent discussion the abbey and its monastic environs being haunted ground it was natural that a mysterious visitant of the kind and one supposed to be under the influence of mental hallucination should inspire awe in a person unaccustomed to the place as colonel wildmans sister was one day walking along abroad terrace of the garden she suddenly beheld the little white lady coming toward her and in the surprise and agitation of the moment turned and ran into the house day after day now elapsed and nothing more was seen of this singular personage colonel wildman at length arrived at the abbey and his sister mentioned to him her encounter and fright in the garden it brought to mind his own adventure with the little white lady in the wood of undine and he was surprised to find that she still continued her mysterious wanderings about the abbey the mystery was soon explained immediately after his arrival he received a letter written in the most minute and delicate female hand and in elegant and even eloquent language it was from the little white lady she had noticed and been shocked by the abrupt retreat of colonel wildmans sister on seeing her in the garden walk and expressed her unhappiness at being an object of alarm to any of his family she explained the motives of her frequent and long visits to the abbey which proved to be a singularly enthusiastic idolatry of the genius of lord byron and a solitary and passionate delight in haunting the scenes he had once inhabited she hinted at the infirmities which cut her off from all social communion with her fellow beings and at her situation in life as desolate and bereaved and concluded by hoping that he would not deprive her of her only comfort the permission of visiting the abbey occasionally and lingering about the walks and gardens  colonel wildman now made further inquiries concerning her and found that she was a great favorite with the people of the farmhouse where she boarded from the gentleness quietude and innocence of her manners when at home she passed the greater part of her time in a small sittingroom reading and writing colonel wildman immediately called on her at the farmhouse she received him with some agitation and embarrassment but his frankness and urbanity soon put her at her ease she was past the bloom of youth a pale nervous little being and apparently deficient in most of her physical organs for in addition to being deaf and dumb she saw but imperfectly they carried on a communication by means of a small slate which she drew out of her reticule and on which they wrote their questions and replies in writing or reading she always approached her eyes close to the written characters  this defective organization was accompanied by a morbid sensibility almost amounting to disease she had not been born deaf and dumb but had lost her hearing in a fit of sickness and with it the power of distinct articulation her life had evidently been checkered and unhappy she was apparently without family or friend a lonely desolate being cut off from society by her infirmities  i am always among strangers she said as much so in my native country as i could be in the remotest parts of the world by all i am considered as a stranger and an alien no one will acknowledge any connection with me i seem not to belong to the human species  such were the circumstances that colonel wildman was able to draw forth in the course of his conversation and they strongly interested him in favor of this poor enthusiast he was too devout an admirer of lord byron himself not to sympathize in this extraordinary zeal of one of his votaries and he entreated her to renew her visits at the abbey assuring her that the edifice and its grounds should always be open to her  the little white lady now resumed her daily walks in the monks garden and her occasional seat at the foot of the monument she was shy and diffident however and evidently fearful of intruding if any persons were walking in the garden she would avoid them and seek the most remote parts and was seen like a sprite only by gleams and glimpses as she glided among the groves and thickets many of her feelings and fancies during these lonely rambles were embodied in verse noted down on her tablet and transferred to paper in the evening on her return to the farmhouse some of these verses now lie before me written with considerable harmony of versification but chiefly curious as being illustrative of that singular and enthusiastic idolatry with which she almost worshipped the genius of byron or rather the romantic image of him formed by her imagination  two or three extracts may not be unacceptable the following are from a long rhapsody addressed to lord byron    by what dread charm thou rulest the mind     it is not given for us to know   we glow with feelings undefined     nor can explain from whence they flow    not that fond love which passion breathes     and youthful hearts inflame   the soul a nobler homage gives     and bows to thy great name    oft have we ownd the muses skill     and proved the power of song   but sweeter notes neer woke the thrill     that solely to thy verse belong    thisbut far more for thee we prove     something that bears a holier name   than the pure dream of early love     or friendships nobler flame    something divineoh what it is     thy muse alone can tell   so sweet but so profound the bliss     we dread to break the spell  this singular and romantic infatuation for such it might truly be called was entirely spiritual and ideal for as she herself declares in another of her rhapsodies she had never beheld lord byron he was to her a mere phantom of the brain    i neer have drunk thy glancethy form     my earthly eye has never seen   though oft when fancys visions warm     it greets me in some blissful dream    greets me as greets the sainted seer     some radiant visitant from high   when heavens own strains break on his ear     and wrap his soul in ecstasy  her poetical wanderings and musings were not confined to the abbey grounds but extended to all parts of the neighborhood connected with the memory of lord byron and among the rest to the groves and gardens of annesley hall the seat of his early passion for miss chaworth one of her poetical effusions mentions her having seen from howets hill in annesley park a sylphlike form in a car drawn by milkwhite horses passing by the foot of the hill who proved to be the favorite child seen by lord byron in his memorable interview with miss chaworth after her marriage that favorite child was now a blooming girl approaching to womanhood and seems to have understood something of the character and story of this singular visitant and to have treated her with gentle sympathy the little white lady expresses in touching terms in a note to her verses her sense of this gentle courtesy the benevolent condescension says she of that amiable and interesting young lady to the unfortunate writer of these simple lines will remain engraved upon a grateful memory till the vital spark that now animates a heart that too sensibly feels and too seldom experiences such kindness is forever extinct  in the mean time colonel wildman in occasional interviews had obtained further particulars of the story of the stranger and found that poverty was added to the other evils of her forlorn and isolated state her name was sophia hyatt she was the daughter of a country bookseller but both her parents had died several years before at their death her sole dependence was upon her brother who allowed her a small annuity on her share of the property left by their father and which remained in his hands her brother who was a captain of a merchant vessel removed with his family to america leaving her almost alone in the world for she had no other relative in england but a cousin of whom she knew almost nothing she received her annuity regularly for a time but unfortunately her brother died in the west indies leaving his affairs in confusion and his estate overhung by several commercial claims which threatened to swallow up the whole under these disastrous circumstances her annuity suddenly ceased she had in vain tried to obtain a renewal of it from the widow or even an account of the state of her brothers affairs her letters for three years past had remained unanswered and she would have been exposed to the horrors of the most abject want but for a pittance quarterly doled out to her by her cousin in england  colonel wildman entered with characteristic benevolence into the story of her troubles he saw that she was a helpless unprotected being unable from her infirmities and her ignorance of the world to prosecute her just claims he obtained from her the address of her relations in america and of the commercial connection of her brother promised through the medium of his own agents in liverpool to institute an inquiry into the situation of her brothers affairs and to forward any letters she might write so as to insure their reaching their place of destination  inspired with some faint hopes the little white lady continued her wanderings about the abbey and its neighborhood the delicacy and timidity of her deportment increased the interest already felt for her by mrs wildman that lady with her wonted kindness sought to make acquaintance with her and inspire her with confidence she invited her into the abbey treated her with the most delicate attention and seeing that she had a great turn for reading offered her the loan of any books in her possession she borrowed a few particularly the works of sir walter scott but soon returned them the writings of lord byron seemed to form the only study in which she delighted and when not occupied in reading those her time was passed in passionate meditations on his genius her enthusiasm spread an ideal world around her in which she moved and existed as in a dream forgetful at times of the real miseries which beset her in her mortal state  one of her rhapsodies is however of a very melancholy cast anticipating her own death which her fragile frame and growing infirmities rendered but too probable it is headed by the following paragraph  written beneath the tree on crowholt hill where it is my wish to be interred if i should die in newstead  i subjoin a few of the stanzas they are addressed to lord byron    thou while thou standst beneath this tree     while by thy foot this earth is pressd   think here the wanderers ashes be     and wilt thou say sweet be thy rest    twould add even to a seraphs bliss     whose sacred charge thou then may be   to guideto guardyes byron yes     that glory is reserved for me    if woes below may plead above     a frail hearts errors mine forgiven   to that high world i soar where love     surviving forms the bliss of heaven    o wheresoeer in realms above     assignd my spirits new abode   twill watch thee with a seraphs love     till thou too soarst to meet thy god    and here beneath this lonely tree     beneath the earth thy feet have pressd   my dust shall sleeponce dear to thee     these sceneshere may the wanderer rest  in the midst of her reveries and rhapsodies tidings reached newstead of the untimely death of lord byron how they were received by this humble but passionate devotee i could not ascertain her life was too obscure and lonely to furnish much personal anecdote but among her poetical effusions are several written in a broken and irregular manner and evidently under great agitation  the following sonnet is the most coherent and most descriptive of her peculiar state of mind    well thou art gonebut what wert thou to me     i never saw theenever heard thy voice   yet my soul seemed to claim affiance with thee     the roman bard has sung of fields elysian   where the soul sojourns ere she visits earth     sure it was there my spirit knew thee byron   thine image haunted me like a past vision     it hath enshrined itself in my hearts core   tis my souls soulit fills the whole creation     for i do live but in that world ideal   which the muse peopled with her bright fancies     and of that world thou art a monarch real   nor ever earthly sceptre ruled a kingdom     with sway so potent as thy lyre the minds dominion  taking all the circumstances here adduced into consideration it is evident that this strong excitement and exclusive occupation of the mind upon one subject operating upon a system in a high state of morbid irritability was in danger of producing that species of mental derangement called monomania the poor little being was aware herself of the dangers of her case and alluded to it in the following passage of a letter to colonel wildman which presents one of the most lamentable pictures of anticipated evil ever conjured up by the human mind  i have long writes she too sensibly felt the decay of my mental faculties which i consider as the certain indication of that dreaded calamity which i anticipate with such terror a strange idea has long haunted my mind that swifts dreadful fate will be mine it is not ordinary insanity i so much apprehend but something worseabsolute idiotism  o sir think what i must suffer from such an idea without an earthly friend to look up to for protection in such a wretched stateexposed to the indecent insults which such spectacles always excite but i dare not dwell upon the thought it would facilitate the event i so much dread and contemplate with horror yet i cannot help thinking from peoples behavior to me at times and from after reflections upon my conduct that symptoms of the disease are already apparent  five months passed away but the letters written by her and forwarded by colonel wildman to america relative to her brothers affairs remained unanswered the inquiries instituted by the colonel had as yet proved equally fruitless a deeper gloom and despondency now seemed to gather upon her mind she began to talk of leaving newstead and repairing to london in the vague hope of obtaining relief or redress by instituting some legal process to ascertain and enforce the will of her deceased brother weeks elapsed however before she could summon up sufficient resolution to tear herself away from the scene of poetical fascination the following simple stanzas selected from a number written about the time express in humble rhymes the melancholy that preyed upon her spirits    farewell to thee newstead thy timeriven towers     shall meet the fond gaze of the pilgrim no more   no more may she roam through thy walks and thy bowers     nor muse in thy cloisters at eves pensive hour    oh how shall i leave you ye hills and ye dales     when lost in sad musing though sad not unblest   a lone pilgrim i strayah in these lonely vales     i hoped vainly hoped that the pilgrim might rest    yet rest is far distantin the dark vale of death     alone i shall find it an outcast forlorn   but hence vain complaints though by fortune bereft     of all that could solace in lifes early morn    is not man from his birth doomed a pilgrim to roam     oer the worlds dreary wilds whence by fortunes rude gust   in his path if some flowret of joy chanced to bloom     it is torn and its foliage laid low in the dust  at length she fixed upon a day for her departure on the day previous she paid a farewell visit to the abbey wandering over every part of the grounds and garden pausing and lingering at every place particularly associated with the recollection of lord byron and passing a long time seated at the foot of the monument which she used to call her altar seeking mrs wildman she placed in her hands a sealed packet with an earnest request that she would not open it until after her departure from the neighborhood this done she took an affectionate leave of her and with many bitter tears bade farewell to the abbey  on retiring to her room that evening mrs wildman could not refrain from inspecting the legacy of this singular being on opening the packet she found a number of fugitive poems written in a most delicate and minute hand and evidently the fruits of her reveries and meditations during her lonely rambles from these the foregoing extracts have been made these were accompanied by a voluminous letter written with the pathos and eloquence of genuine feeling and depicting her peculiar situation and singular state of mind in dark but painful colors  the last time says she that i had the pleasure of seeing you in the garden you asked me why i leave newstead when i told you my circumstances obliged me the expression of concern which i fancied i observed in your look and manner would have encouraged me to have been explicit at the time but from my inability of expressing myself verbally  she then goes on to detail precisely her pecuniary circumstances by which it appears that her whole dependence for subsistence was on an allowance of thirteen pounds a year from her cousin who bestowed it through a feeling of pride lest his relative should come upon the parish during two years this pittance had been augmented from other sources to twentythree pounds but the last year it had shrunk within its original bounds and was yielded so grudgingly that she could not feel sure of its continuance from one quarter to another more than once it had been withheld on slight pretences and she was in constant dread lest it should be entirely withdrawn  it is with extreme reluctance observed she that i have so far exposed my unfortunate situation but i thought you expected to know something more of it and i feared that colonel wildman deceived by appearances might think that i am in no immediate want and that the delay of a few weeks or months respecting the inquiry can be of no material consequence it is absolutely necessary to the success of the business that colonel wildman should know the exact state of my circumstances without reserve that he may be enabled to make a correct representation of them to any gentleman whom he intends to interest who i presume if they are not of america themselves have some connections there through whom my friends may be convinced of the reality of my distress if they pretend to doubt it as i suppose they do but to be more explicit is impossible it would be too humiliating to particularize the circumstances of the embarrassment in which i am unhappily involvedmy utter destitution to disclose all might too be liable to an inference which i hope i am not so void of delicacy of natural pride as to endure the thought of pardon me madam for thus giving trouble where i have no right to docompelled to throw myself upon colonel wildmans humanity to entreat his earnest exertions in my behalf for it is now my only resource yet do not too much despise me for thus submitting to imperious necessityit is not love of life believe me it is not nor anxiety for its preservation i cannot say there are things that make the world dear to mefor in the world there is not an object to make me wish to linger here another hour could i find that rest and peace in the grave which i have never found on earth and i fear will be denied me there  another part of her letter develops more completely the dark despondency hinted at in the conclusion of the foregoing extractand presents a lamentable instance of a mind diseased which sought in vain amidst sorrow and calamity the sweet consolations of religious faith  that my existence has hitherto been prolonged says she often beyond what i have thought to have been its destined period is astonishing to myself often when my situation has been as desperate as hopeless or more so if possible than it is at present some unexpected interposition of providence has rescued me from a fate that has appeared inevitable i do not particularly allude to recent circumstances or latter years for from my earlier years i have been the child of providencethen why should i distrust its care now i do not distrust itneither do i trust it i feel perfectly unanxious unconcerned and indifferent as to the future but this is not trust in providencenot that trust which alone claims it protections i know this is a blamable indifferenceit is morefor it reaches to the interminable future it turns almost with disgust from the bright prospects which religion offers for the consolation and support of the wretched and to which i was early taught by an almost adored mother to look forward with hope and joy but to me they can afford no consolation not that i doubt the sacred truths that religion inculcates i cannot doubtthough i confess i have sometimes tried to do so because i no longer wish for that immortality of which it assures us my only wish now is for rest and peaceendless rest for restbut not to feel tis rest but i cannot delude myself with the hope that such rest will be my lot i feel an internal evidence stronger than any arguments that reason or religion can enforce that i have that within me which is imperishable that drew not its origin from the clod of the valley with this conviction but without a hope to brighten the prospect of that dread future  i dare not look beyond the tomb yet cannot hope for peace before such an unhappy frame of mind i am sure madam must excite your commiseration it is perhaps owing in part at least to the solitude in which i have lived i may say even in the midst of society when i have mixed in it as my infirmities entirely exclude me from that sweet intercourse of kindred spiritsthat sweet solace of refined conversation the little intercourse i have at any time with those around me cannot be termed conversationthey are not kindred spirits and even where circumstances have associated me but rarely indeed with superior and cultivated minds who have not disdained to admit me to their society they could not by all their generous efforts even in early youth lure from my dark soul the thoughts that loved to lie buried there nor inspire me with the courage to attempt their disclosure and yet of all the pleasures of polished life which fancy has often pictured to me in such vivid colors there is not one that i have so ardently coveted as that sweep reciprocation of ideas the supreme bliss of enlightened minds in the hour of social converse but this i knew was not decreed for me    yet this was in my nature  but since the loss of my hearing i have always been incapable of verbal conversation i need not however inform you madam of this at the first interview with which you favored me you quickly discovered my peculiar unhappiness in this respect you perceived from my manner that any attempt to draw me into conversation would be in vainhad it been otherwise perhaps you would not have disdained now and then to have soothed the lonely wanderer with yours i have sometimes fancied when i have seen you in the walk that you seemed to wish to encourage me to throw myself in your way pardon me if my imagination too apt to beguile me with such dear illusions has deceived me into too presumptuous an idea here you must have observed that i generally endeavored to avoid both you and colonel wildman it was to spare your generous hearts the pain of witnessing distress you could not alleviate thus cut off as it were from all human society i have been compelled to live in a world of my own and certainly with the beings with which my world is peopled i am at no loss to converse but though i love solitude and am never in want of subjects to amuse my fancy yet solitude too much indulged in must necessarily have an unhappy effect upon the mind which when left to seek for resources wholly within itself will unavoidably in hours of gloom and despondency brood over corroding thoughts that prey upon the spirits and sometimes terminate in confirmed misanthropyespecially with those who from constitution or early misfortunes are inclined to melancholy and to view human nature in its dark shades and have i not cause for gloomy reflections the utter loneliness of my lot would alone have rendered existence a curse to one whom nature has formed glowing with all the warmth of social affection yet without an object on which to place itwithout one natural connection one earthly friend to appeal to to shield me from the contempt indignities and insults to which my deserted situation continually exposed me  i am giving long extracts from this letter yet i cannot refrain from subjoining another letter which depicts her feelings with respect to newstead  permit me madame again to request your and colonel wildmans acceptance of these acknowledgments which i cannot too often repeat for your unexampled goodness to a rude stranger i know i ought not to have taken advantage of your extreme good nature so frequently as i have i should have absented myself from your garden during the stay of the company at the abbey but as i knew i must be gone long before they would leave it i could not deny myself the indulgence as you so freely gave me your permission to continue my walks but now they are at an end i have taken my last farewell of every dear and interesting spot which i now never hope to see again unless my disembodied spirit may be permitted to revisit themyet o if providence should enable me again to support myself with any degree of respectability and you should grant me some little humble shed with what joy shall i return and renew my delightful rambles but dear as newstead is to me i will never again come under the same unhappy circumstances as i have this last timenever without the means of at least securing myself from contempt how dear how very dear newstead is to me how unconquerable the infatuation that possesses me i am now going to give a too convincing proof in offering to your acceptance the worthless trifles that will accompany this i hope you will believe that i have no view to your amusement i dare not hope that the consideration of their being the products of your own garden and most of them written there in my little tablet while sitting at the foot of my altari could not i cannot resist the earnest desire of leaving this memorial of the many happy hours i have there enjoyed oh do not reject them madam suffer them to remain with you and if you should deign to honor them with a perusal when you read them repress if you can the smile that i know will too naturally arise when you recollect the appearance of the wretched being who has dared to devote her whole soul to the contemplation of such more than human excellence yet ridiculous as such devotion may appear to some i must take leave to say that if the sentiments which i have entertained for that exalted being could be duly appreciated i trust they would be found to be of such a nature as is no dishonor even for him to have inspired  i am now coming to take a last last view of scenes too deeply impressed upon my memory ever to be effaced even by madness itself o madam may you never know nor be able to conceive the agony i endure in tearing myself from all that the world contains of dear and sacred to me the only spot on earth where i can ever hope for peace or comfort may every blessing the world has to bestow attend you or rather may you long long live in the enjoyment of the delights of your own paradise in secret seclusion from a world that has no real blessings to bestow now i gobut o might i dare to hope that when you are enjoying these blissful scenes a thought of the unhappy wanderer might sometimes cross your mind how soothing would such an idea be if i dared to indulge itcould you see my heart at this moment how needless would it be to assure you of the respectful gratitude the affectionate esteem this heart must ever bear you both  the effect of this letter upon the sensitive heart of mrs wildman may be more readily conceived than expressed her first impulse was to give a home to this poor homeless being and to fix her in the midst of those scenes which formed her earthly paradise she communicated her wishes to colonel wildman and they met with an immediate response in his generous bosom it was settled on the spot that an apartment should be fitted up for the little white lady in one of the new farmhouses and every arrangement made for her comfortable and permanent maintenance on the estate with a womans prompt benevolence mrs wildman before she laid her head upon her pillow wrote the following letter to the destitute stranger  newstead abbey   tuesday night september 20 1825  on retiring to my bedchamber this evening i have opened your letter and cannot lose a moment in expressing to you the strong interest which it has excited both in colonel wildman and myself from the details of your peculiar situation and the delicate and let me add elegant language in which they are conveyed i am anxious that my note should reach you previous to your departure from this neighborhood and should be truly happy if by any arrangement for your accommodation i could prevent the necessity of your undertaking the journey colonel wildman begs me to assure you that he will use his best exertions in the investigation of those matters which you have confided to him and should you remain here at present or return again after a short absence i trust we shall find means to become better acquainted and to convince you of the interest i feel and the real satisfaction it would afford me to contribute in any way to your comfort and happiness i will only now add my thanks for the little packet which i received with your letter and i must confess that the letter has so entirely engaged my attention that i have not as yet had time for the attentive perusal of its companion  believe me dear madam with sincere good wishes    yours truly     louisa wildman  early the next morning a servant was dispatched with the letter to the weir mill farm but returned with the information that the little white lady had set off before his arrival in company with the farmers wife in a cart for nottingham to take her place in the coach for london mrs wildman ordered him to mount horse instantly follow with all speed and deliver the letter into her hand before the departure of the coach  the bearer of good tidings spared neither whip nor spur and arrived at nottingham on a gallop on entering the town a crowd obstructed him in the principal street he checked his horse to make his way through it quietly as the crowd opened to the right and left he beheld a human body lying on the pavementit was the corpse of the little white lady  it seems that on arriving in town and dismounting from the cart the farmers wife had parted with her to go on an errand and the white lady continued on toward the coachoffice in crossing a street a cart came along driven at a rapid rate the driver called out to her but she was too deaf to hear his voice or the rattling of his cart in an instant she was knocked down by the horse and the wheels passed over her body and she died without a groan
