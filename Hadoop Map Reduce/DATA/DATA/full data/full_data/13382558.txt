13382558	a short history of the world illustrated  by  h g wells    j j little  ives company  new york  1922  copyright 1922 by h g wells    v  preface  this short history of the world is meant to be read straightforwardly almost as a novel is read  it gives in the most general way an account of our present knowledge of history shorn of elaborations and complications  it has been amply illustrated and everything has been done to make it vivid and clear  from it the reader should be able to get that general view of history which is so necessary a framework for the study of it particular period or the history of a particular country  it may be found useful as a preparatory excursion before the reading of the authors much fuller and more explicit outline of history is undertaken  but its especial end is to meet the needs of the busy general reader too driven to study the maps and time charts of that outline in detail who wishes to refresh and repair his faded or fragmentary conceptions of the great adventure of mankind  it is not an abstract or condensation of that former work  within its aim the outline admits of no further condensation  this is a much more generalized history planned and written afresh  vii     contents    chapter                                                        page   i       the world in space                                       1   ii

years ago men possessed the history of little more than the last three thousand years  what happened before that time was a matter of legend and speculation  over a large part of the civilized world it was believed and taught that the world had been created suddenly in 4004 bc though authorities differed as to whether this had occurred in the spring or autumn of that year this fantastically precise misconception was based upon a too literal interpretation of the hebrew bible and upon rather arbitrary theological assumptions connected therewith  such ideas have long since been abandoned by religious teachers and it is universally recognized that the universe in which we live has to all appearances existed for an enormous period of time and possibly for endless time  of course there may be deception in these appearances as a room may be made to seem endless by putting mirrors facing each other at either end  but that the universe in which we live has existed only for six or seven thousand years may be regarded as an altogether exploded idea  the earth as everybody knows nowadays is a spheroid a sphere slightly compressed orange fashion with a diameter of nearly 8000 miles  its spherical shape has been known at least to a limited number of intelligent people for nearly 2500 years but before that time it was supposed to be flat and various ideas which now seem fantastic were entertained about its relations to the sky and the stars and planets  we know now that it rotates upon its 2 axis which is about 24 miles shorter than its equatorial diameter every twentyfour hours and that this is the cause of the alternations of day and night that it circles about the sun in a slightly distorted and slowly variable oval path in a year its distance from the sun varies between ninetyone and a half millions at its nearest and ninetyfour and a half million miles  illustration luminous spiral clouds of matter  about the earth circles a smaller sphere the moon at an average distance of 239000 miles earth and moon are not the only bodies to travel round the sun  there are also the planets mercury and venus at distances of thirtysix and sixtyseven millions of miles and beyond the circle of the earth and disregarding a belt of numerous smaller bodies the planetoids there are mars jupiter saturn uranus and neptune at mean distances of 141 483 886 1782 and 1793 millions of miles respectively  these figures in 3 millions of miles are very difficult for the mind to grasp  it may help the readers imagination if we reduce the sun and planets to a smaller more conceivable scale  illustration the nebula seen edge on  if then we represent our earth as a little ball of one inch diameter the sun would be a big globe nine feet across and 323 yards away that is about a fifth of a mile four or five minutes walking  the moon would be a small pea two feet and a half from the world  between earth and sun there would be the two inner planets mercury and venus at distances of one hundred and twentyfive and two hundred and fifty yards from the sun all round and about these bodies there would be emptiness until you came to mars a hundred and seventyfive feet beyond the earth jupiter 4 nearly a mile away a foot in diameter saturn a little smaller two miles off uranus four miles off and neptune six miles off  then nothingness and nothingness except for small particles and drifting scraps of attenuated vapour for thousands of miles the nearest star to earth on this scale would be 40000 miles away  these figures will serve perhaps to give one some conception of the immense emptiness of space in which the drama of life goes on  for in all this enormous vacancy of space we know certainly of life only upon the surface of our earth it does not penetrate much more than three miles down into the 4000 miles that separate us from the centre of our globe and it does not reach more than five miles above its surface  apparently all the limitlessness of space is otherwise empty and dead  the deepest ocean dredgings go down to five miles the highest recorded flight of an aeroplane is little more than four miles men have reached to seven miles up in balloons but at a cost of great suffering  no bird can fly so high as five miles and small birds and insects which have been carried up by aeroplanes drop off insensible far below that level     5  ii  the world in time   in the last fifty years there has been much very fine and interesting speculation on the part of scientific men upon the age and origin of our earth  here we cannot pretend to give even a summary of such speculations because they involve the most subtle mathematical and physical considerations  the truth is that the physical and astronomical sciences are still too undeveloped as yet to make anything of the sort more than an illustrative guesswork  the general tendency has been to make the estimated age of our globe longer and longer  it now seems probable that the earth has had an independent existence as a spinning planet flying round and round the sun for a longer period than 2000000000 years  it may have been much longer than that this is a length of time that absolutely overpowers the imagination  before that vast period of separate existence the sun and earth and the other planets that circulate round the sun may have been a great swirl of diffused matter in space  the telescope reveals to us in various parts of the heavens luminous spiral clouds of matter the spiral nebulæ which appear to be in rotation about a centre  it is supposed by many astronomers that the sun and its planets were once such a spiral and that their matter has undergone concentration into its present form through majestic æons that concentration went on until in that vast remoteness of the past for which we have given figures the world and its moon were distinguishable  they were spinning then much faster than they are spinning now they were at a lesser distance from the sun they travelled round it very much faster and they were probably incandescent or molten at the surface  the sun itself was a much greater blaze in the heavens  6  illustration the great spiral nebula  if we could go back through that infinitude of time and see the earth in this earlier stage of its history we should behold a scene more like the interior of a blast furnace or the surface of a lava flow before it cools and cakes over than any other contemporary scene  no water would be visible because all the water there was would still be superheated steam in a stormy atmosphere of sulphurous and metallic vapours  beneath this would swirl and boil an ocean of molten rock substance  across a sky of fiery clouds the glare of the hurrying sun and moon would sweep swiftly like hot breaths of flame    7  illustration  a dark nebula    slowly by degrees as one million of years followed another this 8 fiery scene would lose its eruptive incandescence  the vapours in the sky would rain down and become less dense overhead great slaggy cakes of solidifying rock would appear upon the surface of the molten sea and sink under it to be replaced by other floating masses  the sun and moon growing now each more distant and each smaller would rush with diminishing swiftness across the heavens the moon now because of its smaller size would be already cooled far below incandescence and would be alternately obstructing and reflecting the sunlight in a series of eclipses and full moons  illustration another spiral nebula  and so with a tremendous slowness through the vastness of time the earth would grow more and more like the earth on which we live until at last an age would come when in the cooling air steam would begin to condense into clouds and the first rain would fall hissing upon the first rocks below  for endless millenia the greater part of the earths water would still be vaporized in the atmosphere but there would now be hot streams running over the crystallizing 9 rocks below and pools and lakes into which these streams would be carrying detritus and depositing sediment  illustration landscape before life  at last a condition of things must have been attained in which a man might have stood up on earth and looked about him and lived if we could have visited the earth at that time we should have stood on great lavalike masses of rock without a trace of soil or touch of living vegetation under a stormrent sky  hot and violent winds exceeding the fiercest tornado that ever blows and downpours of rain such as our milder slower earth today knows nothing of might have assailed us  the water of the downpour would have rushed by us muddy with the spoils of the rocks coming together into torrents cutting deep gorges and canyons as they hurried past to deposit their sediment in the earliest seas through the clouds we should have glimpsed a great sun moving visibly across the sky and in its wake and in the wake of the moon would have come a diurnal tide of earthquake and upheaval and 10 the moon which nowadays keeps one constant face to earth would then have been rotating visibly and showing the side it now hides so inexorably  the earth aged  one million years followed another and the day lengthened the sun grew more distant and milder the moons pace in the sky slackened the intensity of rain and storm diminished and the water in the first seas increased and ran together into the ocean garment our planet henceforth wore  but there was no life as yet upon the earth the seas were lifeless and the rocks were barren     11  iii  the beginnings of life   as everybody knows nowadays the knowledge we possess of life before the beginnings of human memory and tradition is derived from the markings and fossils of living things in the stratified rocks we find preserved in shale and slate limestone and sandstone bones shells fibres stems fruits footmarks scratchings and the like side by side with the ripple marks of the earliest tides and the pittings of the earliest rainfalls it is by the sedulous examination of this record of the rocks that the past history of the earths life has been pieced together that much nearly everybody knows today  the sedimentary rocks do not lie neatly stratum above stratum they have been crumpled bent thrust about distorted and mixed together like the leaves of a library that has been repeatedly looted and burnt and it is only as a result of many devoted lifetimes of work that the record has been put into order and read  the whole compass of time represented by the record of the rocks is now estimated as 1600000000 years  the earliest rocks in the record are called by geologists the azoic rocks because they show no traces of life  great areas of these azoic rocks lie uncovered in north america and they are of such a thickness that geologists consider that they represent a period of at least half of the 1600000000 which they assign to the whole geological record  let me repeat this profoundly significant fact  half the great interval of time since land and sea were first distinguishable on earth has left us no traces of life  there are ripplings and rain marks still to be found in these rocks but no marks nor vestiges of any living thing    12  illustration marine life in the cambrian period    then as we come up the record signs of past life appear and increase  the age of the worlds history in which we find these past 13 traces is called by geologists the lower palæozoic age the first indications that life was astir are vestiges of comparatively simple and lowly things the shells of small shellfish the stems and flowerlike heads of zoophytes seaweeds and the tracks and remains of sea worms and crustacea  very early appear certain creatures rather like plantlice crawling creatures which could roll themselves up into balls as the plantlice do the trilobites  later by a few million years or so come certain sea scorpions more mobile and powerful creatures than the world had ever seen before  illustration fossil trilobite slightly magnified  none of these creatures were of very great size  among the largest were certain of the sea scorpions which measured nine feet in length  there are no signs whatever of land life of any sort plant or animal there are no fishes nor any vertebrated creatures in this part of the record  essentially all the plants and creatures which have left us their traces from this period of the earths history are shallowwater and intertidal beings  if we wished to parallel the flora and fauna of the lower palæozoic rocks on the earth today we should do it best except in the matter of size by taking a drop of water from a rock pool or scummy ditch and examining it under a microscope  the little crustacea the small shellfish the zoophytes and algæ we should find there would display a quite striking resemblance to these clumsier larger prototypes that once were the crown of life upon our planet  illustration early palÆolithic fossils of various species of lingula  it is well however to bear in mind that the lower palæozoic rocks probably do not give us anything at all representative of the first beginnings of life on our planet unless a creature has bones 14 or other hard parts unless it wears a shell or is big enough and heavy enough to make characteristic footprints and trails in mud it is unlikely to leave any fossilized traces of its existence behind  today there are hundreds of thousands of species of small softbodied creatures in our world which it is inconceivable can ever leave any mark for future geologists to discover  in the worlds past millions of millions of species of such creatures may have lived and multiplied and flourished and passed away without a trace remaining  the waters of the warm and shallow lakes and seas of the socalled azoic period may have teemed with an infinite variety 15 of lowly jellylike shellless and boneless creatures and a multitude of green scummy plants may have spread over the sunlit intertidal rocks and beaches  the record of the rocks is no more a complete record of life in the past than the books of a bank are a record of the existence of everybody in the neighbourhood  it is only when a species begins to secrete a shell or a spicule or a carapace or a limesupported stem and so put by something for the future that it goes upon the record  but in rocks of an age prior to those which bear any fossil traces graphite a form of uncombined carbon is sometimes found and some authorities consider that it may have been separated out from combination through the vital activities of unknown living things  illustration fossilized footprints of a labyrinthodont cheirotherium     16  iv  the age of fishes   in the days when the world was supposed to have endured for only a few thousand years it was supposed that the different species of plants and animals were fixed and final they had all been created exactly as they are today each species by itself  but as men began to discover and study the record of the rocks this belief gave place to the suspicion that many species had changed and developed slowly through the course of ages and this again expanded into a belief in what is called organic evolution a belief that all species of life upon earth animal and vegetable alike are descended by slow continuous processes of change from some very simple ancestral form of life some almost structureless living substance far back in the socalled azoic seas  this question of organic evolution like the question of the age of the earth has in the past been the subject of much bitter controversy  there was a time when a belief in organic evolution was for rather obscure reasons supposed to be incompatible with sound christian jewish and moslem doctrine  that time has passed and the men of the most orthodox catholic protestant jewish and mohammedan belief are now free to accept this newer and broader view of a common origin of all living things  no life seems to have happened suddenly upon earth  life grew and grows age by age through gulfs of time at which imagination reels life has been growing from a mere stirring in the intertidal slime towards freedom power and consciousness  life consists of individuals these individuals are definite things they are not like the lumps and masses nor even the limitless and motionless crystals of nonliving matter and they have two characteristics no dead matter possesses  they can assimilate other matter into themselves and make it part of themselves and 17 they can reproduce themselves  they eat and they breed  they can give rise to other individuals for the most part like themselves but always also a little different from themselves  there is a specific and family resemblance between an individual and its offspring and there is an individual difference between every parent and every offspring it produces and this is true in every species and at every stage of life  illustration specimen of the pterichthys milleri or sea scorpion showing body armour  now scientific men are not able to explain to us either why offspring should resemble nor why they should differ from their parents  but seeing that offspring do at once resemble and differ it is a matter rather of common sense than of scientific knowledge that if the conditions under which a species live are changed the species should undergo some correlated changes because in any generation of the species there must be a number of individuals whose individual differences make them better adapted to the new conditions under which the species has to live and a number whose individuals whose individual differences make it rather harder for them to live  and on the whole the former sort will live longer bear more offspring and reproduce themselves more abundantly than the latter and so generation by generation the average of the species will change in the favourable direction  this process which is called natural selection is not so much a scientific theory as a necessary deduction 18 from the facts of reproduction and individual difference  there may be many forces at work varying destroying and preserving species about which science may still be unaware or undecided but the man who can deny the operation of this process of natural selection upon life since its beginning must be either ignorant of the elementary facts of life or incapable of ordinary thought  many scientific men have speculated about the first beginning of life and their speculations are often of great interest but there is absolutely no definite knowledge and no convincing guess yet of the way in which life began  but nearly all authorities are agreed that it probably began upon mud or sand in warm sunlit shallow brackish water and that it spread up the beaches to the intertidal lines and out to the open waters  illustration fossil of the cladoselache a devonian shark  that early world was a world of strong tides and currents  an incessant destruction of individuals must have been going on through their being swept up the beaches and dried or by their being swept out to sea and sinking down out of reach of air and sun  early conditions favoured the development of every tendency to root and hold on every tendency to form an outer skin and casing to protect the stranded individual from immediate desiccation  from the very earliest any tendency to sensitiveness to taste would turn the individual in the direction of food and any sensitiveness to light would assist it to struggle back out of the darkness of the sea deeps and caverns or to wriggle back out of the excessive glare of the dangerous shallows  probably the first shells and body armour of living things were protections against drying rather than against active enemies but tooth and claw come early into our earthly history  we have already noted the size of the earlier water scorpions for long ages such creatures were the supreme lords of life then 19 in a division of these palæozoic rocks called the silurian division which many geologists now suppose to be as old as five hundred million years there appears a new type of being equipped with eyes and teeth and swimming powers of an altogether more powerful kind  these were the first known backboned animals the earliest fishes the first known vertebrata  illustration sharks and ganoids of the devonian period  these fishes increase greatly in the next division of rocks the rocks known as the devonian system  they are so prevalent that this period of the record of the rocks has been called the age of 20 fishes  fishes of a pattern now gone from the earth and fishes allied to the sharks and sturgeons of today rushed through the waters leapt in the air browsed among the seaweeds pursued and preyed upon one another and gave a new liveliness to the waters of the world  none of these were excessively big by our present standards  few of them were more than two or three feet long but there were exceptional forms which were as long as twenty feet  we know nothing from geology of the ancestors of these fishes they do not appear to be related to any of the forms that preceded them  zoologists have the most interesting views of their ancestry but these they derive from the study of the development of the eggs of their still living relations and from other sources  apparently the ancestors of the vertebrata were softbodied and perhaps quite small swimming creatures who began first to develop hard parts as teeth round and about their mouths  the teeth of a skate or dogfish cover the roof and floor of its mouth and pass at the lip into the flattened toothlike scales that encase most of its body  as the fishes develop these teeth scales in the geological record they swim out of the hidden darkness of the past into the light the first vertebrated animals visible in the record     21  v  the age of the coal swamps   the land during this age of fishes was apparently quite lifeless crags and uplands of barren rock lay under the sun and rain there was no real soilfor as yet there were no earthworms which help to make a soil and no plants to break up the rock particles into mould there was no trace of moss or lichen  life was still only in the sea  over this world of barren rock played great changes of climate the causes of these changes of climate were very complex and they have still to be properly estimated  the changing shape of the earths orbit the gradual shifting of the poles of rotation changes in the shapes of the continents probably even fluctuations in the warmth of the sun now conspired to plunge great areas of the earths surface into long periods of cold and ice and now again for millions of years spread a warm or equable climate over this planet  there seem to have been phases of great internal activity in the worlds history when in the course of a few million years accumulated upthrusts would break out in lines of volcanic eruption and upheaval and rearrange the mountain and continental outlines of the globe increasing the depth of the sea and the height of the mountains and exaggerating the extremes of climate  and these would be followed by vast ages of comparative quiescence when frost rain and river would wear down the mountain heights and carry great masses of silt to fill and raise the sea bottoms and spread the seas ever shallower and wider over more and more of the land  there have been high and deep ages in the worlds history and low and level ages  the reader must dismiss from his mind any idea that the surface of the earth has been growing steadily cooler since its crust grew solid after that much cooling had been achieved the internal temperature ceased to affect surface 22 conditions there are traces of periods of superabundant ice and snow of glacial ages that is even in the azoic period  it was only towards the close of the age of fishes in a period of extensive shallow seas and lagoons that life spread itself out in any effectual way from the waters on to the land  no doubt the earlier types of the forms that now begin to appear in great abundance had already been developing in a rare and obscure manner for many scores of millions of years  but now came their opportunity  illustration a carboniferous swamp  plants no doubt preceded animal forms in this invasion of the land but the animals probably followed up the plant emigration 23 very closely  the first problem that the plant had to solve was the problem of some sustaining stiff support to hold up its fronds to the sunlight when the buoyant water was withdrawn the second was the problem of getting water from the swampy ground below to the tissues of the plant now that it was no longer close at hand  the two problems were solved by the development of woody tissue which both sustained the plant and acted as water carrier to the leaves  the record of the rocks is suddenly crowded by a vast variety of woody swamp plants many of them of great size big tree mosses tree ferns gigantic horsetails and the like and with these age by age there crawled out of the water a great variety of animal forms  there were centipedes and millipedes there were the first primitive insects there were creatures related to the ancient king crabs and sea scorpions which became the earliest spiders and land scorpions and presently there were vertebrated animals  illustration skull of a labyrinthodont capitosaurus  some of the earlier insects were very large there were dragon flies in this period with wings that spread out to twentynine inches  in various ways these new orders and genera had adapted themselves to breathing air  hitherto all animals had breathed air dissolved in water and that indeed is what all animals still have to do but now in divers fashions the animal kingdom was acquiring the power of supplying its own moisture where it was needed  a man with a perfectly dry lung would suffocate today 24 his lung surfaces must be moist in order that air may pass through them into his blood  the adaptation to air breathing consists in all cases either in the development of a cover to the oldfashioned gills to stop evaporation or in the development of tubes or other new breathing organs lying deep inside the body and moistened by a watery secretion  the old gills with which the ancestral fish of the vertebrated line had breathed were inadaptable to breathing upon land and in the case of this division of the animal kingdom it is the swimming bladder of the fish which becomes a new deepseated breathing organ the lung  the kind of animals known as amphibia the frogs and newts of today begin their lives in the water and breathe by gills and subsequently the lung developing in the same way as the swimming bladder of many fishes do as a baglike outgrowth from the throat takes over the business of breathing the animal comes out on land and the gills dwindle and the gill slits disappear  all except an outgrowth of one gill slit which becomes the passage of the ear and eardrum  the animal can now live only in the air but it must return at least to the edge of the water to lay its eggs and reproduce its kind  illustration skeleton of a labyrinthodont the eryops  all the airbreathing vertebrata of this age of swamps and plants belonged to the class amphibia  they were nearly all of them forms related to the newts of today and some of them attained a considerable size  they were land animals it is true but they were land animals needing to live in and near moist and swampy places and all the great trees of this period were equally 25 amphibious in their habits  none of them had yet developed fruits and seeds of a kind that could fall on land and develop with the help only of such moisture as dew and rain could bring  they all had to shed their spores in water it would seem if they were to germinate  it is one of the most beautiful interests of that beautiful science comparative anatomy to trace the complex and wonderful adaptations of living things to the necessities of existence in air  all living things plants and animals alike are primarily water things  for example all the higher vertebrated animals above the fishes up to and including man pass through a stage in their development in the egg or before birth in which they have gill slits which are obliterated before the young emerge  the bare waterwashed eye of the fish is protected in the higher forms from drying up by eyelids and glands which secrete moisture the weaker sound vibrations of air necessitate an eardrum  in nearly every organ of the body similar modifications and adaptations are to be detected similar patchingsup to meet aerial conditions  this carboniferous age this age of the amphibia was an age of life in the swamps and lagoons and on the low banks among these waters  thus far life had now extended  the hills and high lands were still quite barren and lifeless  life had learnt to breathe air indeed but it still had its roots in its native water it still had to return to the water to reproduce its kind     26  vi  the age of reptiles   the abundant life of the carboniferous period was succeeded by a vast cycle of dry and bitter ages  they are represented in the record of the rocks by thick deposits of sandstones and the like in which fossils are comparatively few  the temperature of the world fluctuated widely and there were long periods of glacial cold  over great areas the former profusion of swamp vegetation ceased and overlaid by these newer deposits it began that process of compression and mineralization that gave the world most of the coal deposits of today  but it is during periods of change that life undergoes its most rapid modifications and under hardship that it learns its hardest lessons  as conditions revert towards warmth and moisture again we find a new series of animal and plant forms established  we find in the record the remains of vertebrated animals that laid eggs which instead of hatching out tadpoles which needed to live for a time in water carried on their development before hatching to a stage so nearly like the adult form that the young could live in air from the first moment of independent existence  gills had been cut out altogether and the gill slits only appeared as an embryonic phase  these new creatures without a tadpole stage were the reptiles concurrently there had been a development of seedbearing trees which could spread their seed independently of swamp or lakes there were now palmlike cycads and many tropical conifers though as yet there were no flowering plants and no grasses  there was a great number of ferns  and there was now also an increased variety of insects  there were beetles though bees and butterflies had yet to come  but all the fundamental forms of a new real land fauna and flora had been laid down during these vast ages of severity  27 this new land life needed only the opportunity of favourable conditions to flourish and prevail  illustration a fossil ichthyosaurus a mesozoic fishlizard  age by age and with abundant fluctuations that mitigation came the still incalculable movements of the earths crust the changes in its orbit the increase and diminution of the mutual inclination of orbit and pole worked together to produce a great spell of widely diffused warm conditions  the period lasted altogether it is now supposed upwards of two hundred million years  it is called the mesozoic period to distinguish it from the altogether vaster palæozoic and azoic periods together fourteen hundred millions that preceded it and from the cainozoic or new life period that intervened between its close and the present time and it is also called the age of reptiles because of the astonishing predominance and variety of this form of life  it came to an end some eighty million  years ago  in the world today the genera of reptiles are comparatively few and their distribution is very limited  they are more various it is true than are the few surviving members of the order of the amphibia which once in the carboniferous period ruled the world we still have the snakes the turtles and tortoises the chelonia 28 the alligators and crocodiles and the lizards without exception they are creatures requiring warmth all the year round they cannot stand exposure to cold and it is probable that all the reptilian beings of the mesozoic suffered under the same limitation  it was a hothouse fauna living amidst a hothouse flora  it endured no frosts  but the world had at least attained a real dry land fauna and flora as distinguished from the mud and swamp fauna and flora of the previous heyday of life upon earth  illustration a pterodactyl  all the sorts of reptile we know now were much more abundantly represented then great turtles and tortoises big crocodiles and many lizards and snakes but in addition there was a number of series of wonderful creatures that have now vanished altogether from the earth  there was a vast variety of beings called the dinosaurs  vegetation was now spreading over the lower levels of the world reeds brakes of fern and the like and browsing upon this abundance came a multitude of herbivorous reptiles which increased in size as the mesozoic period rose to its climax  some of these beasts exceeded in size any other land animals that have ever lived they were as large as whales  the diplodocus carnegii for example measured eightyfour feet from snout to tail the gigantosaurus was even greater it measured a hundred feet  living upon these monsters was a swarm of carnivorous dinosaurs of a corresponding size  one of these the tyrannosaurus is figured and described in many books as the last word in reptilian frightfulness  29  illustration a big swampinhabiting dinosaur the diplodocus over eighty feet from snout to tailtip  while these great creatures pastured and pursued amidst the fronds and evergreens of the mesozoic jungles another now vanished tribe of reptiles with a batlike development of the fore limbs pursued insects and one another first leapt and parachuted and presently flew amidst the fronds and branches of the forest trees these were the pterodactyls these were the first flying creatures with backbones they mark a new achievement in the growing powers of vertebrated life  moreover some of the reptiles were returning to the sea waters three groups of big swimming beings had invaded the sea from which their ancestors had come the mososaurs the plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs  some of these again approached the proportions of our present whales  the ichthyosaurs seem to have been quite seagoing creatures but the plesiosaurs were a type of animal that has no cognate form today  the body was stout and big with paddles adapted either for swimming or crawling through marshes or along the bottom of shallow waters  the comparatively small 30 head was poised on a vast snake of neck altogether outdoing the neck of the swan  either the plesiosaur swam and searched for food under the water and fed as the swan will do or it lurked under water and snatched at passing fish or beast  such was the predominant land life throughout the mesozoic age it was by our human standards an advance upon anything that had preceded it  it had produced land animals greater in size range power and activity more vital as people say than anything the world had seen before  in the seas there had been no such advance but a great proliferation of new forms of life  an enormous variety of squidlike creatures with chambered shells for the most part coiled had appeared in the shallow seas the ammonites they had had predecessors in the palæozoic seas but now was their age of glory  today they have left no survivors at all their nearest relation is the pearly nautilus an inhabitant of tropical waters  and a new and more prolific type of fish with lighter finer scales than the platelike and toothlike coverings that had hitherto prevailed became and has since remained predominant in the seas and rivers     31  vii  the first birds and the first mammals   in a few paragraphs a picture of the lush vegetation and swarming reptiles of that first great summer of life the mesozoic period has been sketched  but while the dinosaurs lorded it over the hot selvas and marshy plains and the pterodactyls filled the forests with their flutterings and possibly with shrieks and croakings as they pursued the humming insect life of the still flowerless shrubs and trees some less conspicuous and less abundant forms upon the margins of this abounding life were acquiring certain powers and learning certain lessons of endurance that were to be of the utmost value to their race when at last the smiling generosity of sun and earth began to fade  a group of tribes and genera of hopping reptiles small creatures of the dinosaur type seem to have been pushed by competition and the pursuit of their enemies towards the alternatives of extinction or adaptation to colder conditions in the higher hills or by the sea  among these distressed tribes there was developed a new type of scalescales that were elongated into quilllike forms and that presently branched into the crude beginnings of feathers  these quilllike scales layover one another and formed a heatretaining covering more efficient than any reptilian covering that had hitherto existed  so they permitted an invasion of colder regions that were otherwise uninhabited  perhaps simultaneously with these changes there arose in these creatures a greater solicitude for their eggs  most reptiles are apparently quite careless about their eggs which are left for sun and season to hatch  but some of the varieties upon this new branch of the tree of life were acquiring a habit of guarding their eggs and keeping them warm with the warmth of their bodies  with these adaptations to cold other internal modifications 32 were going on that made these creatures the primitive birds warmblooded and independent of basking  the very earliest birds seem to have been seabirds living upon fish and their fore limbs were not wings but paddles rather after the penguin type  that peculiarly primitive bird the new zealand kiwi has feathers of a very simple sort and neither flies nor appears to be descended from flying ancestors  in the development of the birds feathers came before wings  but once the feather was developed the possibility of making a light spread of feathers led inevitably to the wing  we know of the fossil remains of one bird at least which had reptilian teeth in its jaw and a long reptilian tail but which also had a true birds wing and which certainly flew and held its own among the pterodactyls of the mesozoic time nevertheless birds were neither varied nor abundant in mesozoic times  if a man could go back to typical mesozoic country he might walk for days and never see or hear such a thing as a bird though he would see a great abundance of pterodactyls and insects among the fronds and reeds  illustration fossil of the archeopteryx one of the earliest birds  and another thing he would probably never see and that would be any sign of a mammal  probably the first mammals were in 33 existence millions of years before the first thing one could call a bird but they were altogether too small and obscure and remote for attention  illustration hesperornis in its native seas  the earliest mammals like the earliest birds were creatures driven by competition and pursuit into a life of hardship and adaptation to cold  with them also the scale became quilllike and was developed into a heatretaining covering and they too underwent modifications similar in kind though different in detail to become warmblooded and independent of basking instead of feathers they developed hairs and instead of guarding and incubating their eggs they kept them warm and safe by retaining them inside their bodies until they were almost mature most of them became altogether vivaparous and brought their young into the world alive  and even after their young were born they tended to maintain a protective and nutritive association with them  most 34 but not all mammals today have mammæ and suckle their young  two mammals still live which lay eggs and which have not proper mammæ though they nourish their young by a nutritive secretion of the under skin these are the duckbilled platypus and the echidna  the echidna lays leathery eggs and then puts them into a pouch under its belly and so carries them about warm and safe until they hatch  but just as a visitor to the mesozoic world might have searched for days and weeks before finding a bird so unless he knew exactly where to go and look he might have searched in vain for any traces of a mammal  both birds and mammals would have seemed very eccentric and secondary and unimportant creatures in mesozoic times  illustration the kiwi apteryx still found in new zealand    35  illustration slab of lower pliocene marl    the age of reptiles lasted it is now guessed eighty million years  had any quasihuman intelligence been watching the world through that inconceivable length of time how safe and eternal the sunshine and abundance must have seemed how assured the wallowing prosperity of the dinosaurs and the flapping abundance of the flying lizards  and then the mysterious rhythms and accumulating forces of the universe began to turn against that quasieternal stability  that run of luck 36 for life was running out  age by age myriad of years after myriad of years with halts no doubt and retrogressions came a change towards hardship and extreme conditions came great alterations of level and great redistributions of mountain and sea  we find one thing in the record of the rocks during the decadence of the long mesozoic age of prosperity that is very significant of steadily sustained changes of condition and that is a violent fluctuation of living forms and the appearance of new and strange species under the gathering threat of extinction the older orders and genera are displaying their utmost capacity for variation and adaptation  the ammonites for example in these last pages of the mesozoic chapter exhibit a multitude of fantastic forms  under settled conditions there is no encouragement for novelties they do not develop they are suppressed what is best adapted is already there  under novel conditions it is the ordinary type that suffers and the novelty that may have a better chance to survive and establish itself  there comes a break in the record of the rocks that may represent several million years  there is a veil here still over even the outline of the history of life  when it lifts again the age of reptiles is at an end the dinosaurs the plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs the pterodactyls the innumerable genera and species of ammonite have all gone absolutely  in all their stupendous variety they have died out and left no descendants  the cold has killed them  all their final variations were insufficient they had never hit upon survival conditions  the world had passed through a phase of extreme conditions beyond their powers of endurance a slow and complete massacre of mesozoic life has occurred and we find now a new scene a new and hardier flora and a new and hardier fauna in possession of the world  it is still a bleak and impoverished scene with which this new volume of the book of life begins the cycads and tropical conifers have given place very largely to trees that shed their leaves to avoid destruction by the snows of winter and to flowering plants and shrubs and where there was formerly a profusion of reptiles an increasing variety of birds and mammals is entering into their inheritance     37  viii  the age of mammals   the opening of the next great period in the life of the earth the cainozoic period was a period of upheaval and extreme volcanic activity  now it was that the vast masses of the alps and himalayas and the mountain backbone of the rockies and andes were thrust up and that the rude outlines of our present oceans and continents appeared  the map of the world begins to display a first dim resemblance to the map of today  it is estimated now that between forty and eighty million years have elapsed from the beginnings of the cainozoic period to the present time  at the outset of the cainozoic period the climate of the world was austere  it grew generally warmer until a fresh phase of great abundance was reached after which conditions grew hard again and the earth passed into a series of extremely cold cycles the glacial ages from which apparently it is now slowly emerging  but we do not know sufficient of the causes of climatic change at present to forecast the possible fluctuations of climatic conditions that lie before us  we may be moving towards increasing sunshine or lapsing towards another glacial age volcanic activity and the upheaval of mountain masses may be increasing or diminishing we do not know we lack sufficient science  with the opening of this period the grasses appear for the first time there is pasture in the world and with the full development of the once obscure mammalian type appear a number of interesting grazing animals and of carnivorous types which prey upon these  at first these early mammals seem to differ only in a few characters from the great herbivorous and carnivorous reptiles that ages before had flourished and then vanished from the earth a 38 careless observer might suppose that in this second long age of warmth and plenty that was now beginning nature was merely repeating the first with herbivorous and carnivorous mammals to parallel the herbivorous and carnivorous dinosaurs with birds replacing pterodactyls and so on  but this would be an altogether superficial comparison  the variety of the universe is infinite and incessant it progresses eternally history never repeats itself and no parallels are precisely true  the differences between the life of the cainozoic and mesozoic periods are far profounder than the resemblances   illustration a mammal of the early cainozoic period  the most fundamental of all these differences lies in the mental life of the two periods  it arises essentially out of the continuing contact of parent and offspring which distinguishes mammalian and in a lesser degree bird life from the life of the reptile  with very few exceptions the reptile abandons its egg to hatch alone  the young reptile has no knowledge whatever of its parent its mental life such as it is begins and ends with its own experiences  39 it may tolerate the existence of its fellows but it has no communication with them it never imitates never learns from them is incapable of concerted action with them  its life is that of an isolated individual  but with the suckling and cherishing of young which was distinctive of the new mammalian and avian strains arose the possibility of learning by imitation of communication by warning cries and other concerted action of mutual control and instruction  a teachable type of life had come into the world  the earliest mammals of the cainozoic period are but little superior in brain size to the more active carnivorous dinosaurs but as we read on through the record towards modern times we find in every tribe and race of the mammalian animals a steady universal increase in brain capacity  for instance we find at a comparatively early stage that rhinoceroslike beasts appear there is a creature the titanotherium which lived in the earliest division of this period  it was probably very like a modern rhinoceros in its habits and needs  but its brain capacity was not one tenth that of its living successor  the earlier mammals probably parted from their offspring as soon as suckling was over but once the capacity for mutual understanding has arisen the advantages of continuing the association are very great and we presently find a number of mammalian species displaying the beginnings of a true social life and keeping together in herds packs and flocks watching each other imitating each other taking warning from each others acts and cries  this is something that the world had not seen before among vertebrated animals   reptiles and fish may no doubt be found ill swarms and shoals they have been hatched in quantities and similar conditions have kept them together but in the case of the social and gregarious mammals the association arises not simply from a community of external forces it is sustained by an inner impulse  they are not merely like one another and so found in the same places at the same times they like one another and so they keep together    40  illustration stenomylus hitchcockia giraffecamel  illustration skeleton of protohippus venticolusearly horse    this difference between the reptile world and the world of our human minds is one our sympathies seem unable to pass  we cannot conceive in ourselves the swift uncomplicated urgency of a reptiles instinctive motives its appetites fears and hates  we 41 cannot understand them in their simplicity because all our motives are complicated ours are balances and resultants and not simple urgencies  but the mammals and birds have selfrestraint and consideration for other individuals a social appeal a selfcontrol that is at its lower level after our own fashion  we can in consequence establish relations with almost all sorts of them  when they suffer they utter cries and make movements that rouse our feelings  we can make understanding pets of them with a mutual recognition  they can be tamed to selfrestraint towards us domesticated and taught  illustration comparative sizes of brains of rhinoceros and dinoceras  that unusual growth of brain which is the central fact of cainozoic times marks a new communication and interdependence of individuals  it foreshadows the development of human societies of which we shall soon be telling  as the cainozoic period unrolled the resemblance of its flora and fauna to the plants and animals that inhabit the world today 42 increased  the big clumsy uintatheres and titanotheres the entelodonts and hyracodons big clumsy brutes like nothing living disappeared  on the other hand a series of forms led up by steady degrees from grotesque and clumsy predecessors to the giraffes camels horses elephants deer dogs and lions and tigers of the existing world  the evolution of the horse is particularly legible upon the geological record  we have a fairly complete series of forms from a small tapirlike ancestor in the early cainozoic  another line of development that has now been pieced together with some precision is that of the llamas and camels     43  ix  monkeys apes and submen   naturalists divide the class mammalia into a number of orders at the head of these is the order primates which includes the lemurs the monkeys apes and man  their classification was based originally upon anatomical resemblances and took no account of any mental qualities  now the past history of the primates is one very difficult to decipher in the geological record  they are for the most part animals which live in forests like the lemurs and monkeys or in bare rocky places like the baboons  they are rarely drowned and covered up by sediment nor are most of them very numerous species and so they do not figure so largely among the fossils as the ancestors of the horses camels and so forth do  but we know that quite early in the cainozoic period that is to say some forty million years ago or so primitive monkeys and lemuroid creatures had appeared poorer in brain and not so specialized as their later successors  the great world summer of the middle cainozoic period drew at last to an end  it was to follow those other two great summers in the history of life the summer of the coal swamps and the vast summer of the age of reptiles  once more the earth spun towards an ice age  the world chilled grew milder for a time and chilled again in the warm past hippopotami had wallowed through a lush subtropical vegetation and a tremendous tiger with fangs like sabres the sabretoothed tiger had hunted its prey where now the journalists of fleet street go to and fro  now came a bleaker age and still bleaker ages  a great weeding and extinction of species occurred  a woolly rhinoceros adapted to a cold climate and the mammoth a big woolly cousin of the elephants the arctic musk ox and the reindeer passed across the scene  then century by century the arctic ice cap the wintry death of the great ice age crept 44 southward  in england it came almost down to the thames in america it reached ohio  there would be warmer spells of a few thousand years and relapses towards a bitterer cold  illustration a mammoth  geologists talk of these wintry phases as the first second third and fourth glacial ages and of the interludes as interglacial periods  we live today in a world that is still impoverished and scarred by that terrible winter  the first glacial age was coming on 600000 years ago the fourth glacial age reached its bitterest some fifty thousand years ago  and it was amidst the snows of this long universal winter that the first manlike beings lived upon our planet  by the middle cainozoic period there have appeared various apes with many quasihuman attributes of the jaws and leg bones but it is only as we approach these glacial ages that we find traces of creatures that we can speak of as almost human  these traces are not bones but implements  in europe in deposits of this period between half a million and a million years old we find flints 45 and stones that have evidently been chipped intentionally by some handy creature desirous of hammering scraping or fighting with the sharpened edge  these things have been called eoliths dawn stones  in europe there are no bones nor other remains of the creature which made these objects simply the objects themselves  for all the certainty we have it may have been some entirely unhuman but intelligent monkey  but at trinil in java in accumulations of this age a piece of a skull and various teeth and bones have been found of a sort of ape man with a brain case bigger than that of any living apes which seems to have walked erect  this creature is now called pithecanthropus erectus the walking ape man and the little trayful of its bones is the only help our imaginations have as yet in figuring to ourselves the makers of the eoliths  illustration flint implements found in piltdown region  it is not until we come to sands that are almost a quarter of a million years old that we find any other particle of a subhuman being  but there are plenty of implements and they are steadily improving in quality as we read on through the record  they are no longer clumsy eoliths they are now shapely instruments made with considerable skill  and they are much bigger than the similar implements afterwards made by true man then in a sandpit at heidelberg appears a single quasihuman jawbone a clumsy jawbone absolutely chinless far heavier than a true human jawbone and narrower so that it is improbable the creatures tongue could have moved about for articulate speech on the strength of this jawbone scientific men suppose this creature to have been a heavy almost human monster possibly with huge limbs and hands possibly with a thick felt of hair and they call it the heidelberg man  46  this jawbone is i think one of the most tormenting objects in the world to our human curiosity  to see it is like looking through a defective glass into the past and catching just one blurred and tantalizing glimpse of this thing shambling through the bleak wilderness clambering to avoid the sabretoothed tiger watching the woolly rhinoceros in the woods  then before we can scrutinize the monster he vanishes  yet the soil is littered abundantly with the indestructible implements he chipped out for his uses  illustration a theoretical restoration of the pithecanthropus erectus by prof rutot  illustration the heidelberg man  still more fascinatingly enigmatical are the remains of a creature found at piltdown in sussex in a deposit that may indicate an age between a hundred and a hundred and fifty thousand years ago though some authorities would put these particular remains back in time to before the heidelberg jawbone  here there 47 are the remains of a thick subhuman skull much larger than any existing apes and a chimpanzeelike jawbone which may or may not belong to it and in addition a batshaped piece of elephant bone evidently carefully manufactured through which a hole had apparently been bored  there is also the thighbone of a deer with cuts upon it like a tally  that is all  illustration the piltdown skull as reconstructed from original fragment  what sort of beast was this creature which sat and bored holes in bones  scientific men have named him eoanthropus the dawn man  he stands apart from his kindred a very different being either from the heidelberg creature or from any living ape  no other vestige like him is known  but the gravels and deposits of from one hundred thousand years onward are increasingly rich in implements of flint and similar stone  and these implements are no longer rude eoliths the archæologists are presently able to distinguish scrapers borers knives darts throwing stones and hand axes   we are drawing very near to man  in our next section we shall have to describe the strangest of all these precursors of humanity the neanderthalers the men who were almost but not quite true men  but it may be well perhaps to state quite clearly here that no scientific man supposes either of these creatures the heidelberg man or eoanthropus to be direct ancestors of the men of today these are at the closest related forms     48  x  the neanderthaler and the rhodesian man   about fifty or sixty thousand years ago before the climax of the fourth glacial age there lived a creature on earth so like a man that until a few years ago its remains were considered to be altogether human  we have skulls and bones of it and a great accumulation of the large implements it made and used  it made fires  it sheltered in caves from the cold  it probably dressed skins roughly and wore them  it was righthanded as men are  yet now the ethnologists tell us these creatures were not true men  they were of a different species of the same genus  they had heavy protruding jaws and great brow ridges above the eyes and very low foreheads  their thumbs were not opposable to the fingers as mens are their necks were so poised that they could not turn back their heads and look up to the sky  they probably slouched along head down and forward  their chinless jawbones resemble the heidelberg jawbone and are markedly unlike human jawbones  and there were great differences from the human pattern in their teeth  their cheek teeth were more complicated in structure than ours more complicated and not less so they had not the long fangs of our cheek teeth and also these quasimen had not the marked canines dog teeth of an ordinary human being the capacity of their skulls was quite human but the brain was bigger behind and lower in front than the human brain  their intellectual faculties were differently arranged  they were not ancestral to the human line mentally and physically they were upon a different line from the human line  skulls and bones of this extinct species of man were found at neanderthal 49 among other places and from that place these strange protomen have been christened neanderthal men or neanderthalers they must have endured in europe for many hundreds or even thousands of years  illustration the neanderthaler according to prof rutot  at that time the climate and geography of our world was very different from what they are at the present time europe for example was covered with ice reaching as far south as the thames and into central germany and russia there was no channel separating britain from france the mediterranean and the red sea were great valleys with perhaps a chain of lakes in their deeper portions and a great inland sea spread from the present black sea across south russia and far into central asia  spain and all of europe not actually under ice consisted of bleak uplands under a harder climate than that of labrador and it was only when north africa was reached that one would have found a temperate climate across the cold steppes of southern europe with its sparse arctic vegetation drifted such hardy creatures as the woolly mammoth and woolly rhinoceros great oxen and reindeer no doubt following the vegetation northward in spring and southward in autumn  50  map possible outline of europe and western asia at the maximum of the fourth ice age about 50000 years ago  such was the scene through which the neanderthaler wandered gathering such subsistence as he could from small game or fruits and berries and roots  possibly he was mainly a vegetarian chewing twigs and roots  his level elaborate teeth suggest a largely vegetarian dietary  but we also find the long marrow bones of great animals in his caves cracked to extract the marrow  his weapons could not have been of much avail in open conflict with great beasts but it is supposed that he attacked them with spears at difficult river crossings and even constructed pitfalls for them  possibly he followed the herds and preyed upon any dead that were killed in fights and perhaps he played the part of jackal to the sabretoothed tiger which still survived in his day  possibly in the bitter hardships of the glacial ages this creature had taken to attacking animals after long ages of vegetarian adaptation  we cannot guess what this neanderthal man looked like he may have been very hairy and very unhumanlooking indeed  it is even doubtful if he went erect  he may have used his knuckles as well as his feet to hold himself up probably he went about 51 alone or in small family groups  it is inferred from the structure of his jaw that he was incapable of speech as we understand it  for thousands of years these neanderthalers were the highest animals that the european area had ever seen and then some thirty or thirtyfive thousand years ago as the climate grew warmer a race of kindred beings more intelligent knowing more talking and cooperating together came drifting into the neanderthalers world from the south  they ousted the neanderthalers from their caves and squatting places they hunted the same food they probably made war upon their grisly predecessors and killed them off  these newcomers from the south or the eastfor at present we do not know their region of originwho at last drove the neanderthalers out of existence altogether were beings of our own blood and kin the first true men  their braincases and thumbs and necks and teeth were anatomically the same as our own  in a cave at cromagnon and in another at grimaldi a number of skeletons have been found the earliest truly human remains that are so far known  so it is our race comes into the record of the rocks and the story of mankind begins  illustration comparison of 1 modern skull and 2 rhodesian skull  the world was growing liker our own in those days though the climate was still austere  the glaciers of the ice age were receding in europe the reindeer of france and spain presently gave way to great herds of horses as grass increased upon the steppes and the 52 mammoth became more and more rare in southern europe and finally receded northward altogether   we do not know where the true men first originated  but in the summer of 1921 an extremely interesting skull was found together with pieces of a skeleton at broken hill in south africa which seems to be a relic of a third sort of man intermediate in its characteristics between the neanderthaler and the human being the braincase indicates a brain bigger in front and smaller behind than the neanderthalers and the skull was poised erect upon the backbone in a quite human way  the teeth also and the bones are quite human  but the face must have been apelike with enormous brow ridges and a ridge along the middle of the skull the creature was indeed a true man so to speak with an apelike neanderthaler face  this rhodesian man is evidently still closer to real men than the neanderthal man  this rhodesian skull is probably only the second of what in the end may prove to be a long list of finds of subhuman species which lived on the earth in the vast interval of time between the beginnings of the ice age and the appearance of their common heir and perhaps their common exterminator the true man  the rhodesian skull itself may not be very ancient  up to the time of publishing this book there has been no exact determination of its probable age it may be that this subhuman creature survived in south africa until quite recent times     53  xi  the first true men   the earliest signs and traces at present known to science of a humanity which is indisputably kindred with ourselves have been found in western europe and particularly in france and spain bones weapons scratchings upon bone and rock carved fragments of bone and paintings in caves and upon rock surfaces dating it is supposed from 30000 years ago or more have been discovered in both these countries spain is at present the richest country in the world in these first relics of our real human ancestors  of course our present collections of these things are the merest beginnings of the accumulations we may hope for in the future when there are searchers enough to make a thorough examination of all possible sources and when other countries in the world now inaccessible to archæologists have been explored in some detail the greater part of africa and asia has never even been traversed yet by a trained observer interested in these matters and free to explore and we must be very careful therefore not to conclude that the early true men were distinctively inhabitants of western europe or that they first appeared in that region  in asia or africa or submerged beneath the sea of today there may be richer and much earlier deposits of real human remains than anything that has yet come to light  i write in asia or africa and i do not mention america because so far there have been no finds at all of any of the higher primates either of great apes submen neanderthalers nor early true men  this development of life seems to have been an exclusively old world development and it was only apparently at the end of the old stone age that human beings first made their way across the land connexion that is now cut by behring straits into the american continent  54  illustration one of the marvellous cave paintings of altamira north spain  these first real human beings we know of in europe appear already to have belonged to one or other of at least two very distinct races one of these races was of a very high type indeed it was tall and big brained  one of the womens skulls found exceeds in capacity that of the average man of today  one of the mens skeletons is over six feet in height  the physical type resembled that of the north american indian  from the cromagnon cave in which the first skeletons were found these people have been called cromagnards  they were savages but savages of a high order the second race the race of the grimaldi cave remains was distinctly negroid in its characters  its nearest living affinities are the bushmen and hottentots of south africa  it is interesting to find at the very outset of the known human story that mankind was already racially divided into at least two main varieties and one is tempted to such unwarrantable guesses as that the former race was probably brownish rather than black and that it came from the east or north and that the latter was blackish rather than brown and came from the equatorial south  55  illustration bone carvings of the palÆolithic period  56  and these savages of perhaps forty thousand years ago were so human that they pierced shells to make necklaces painted themselves carved images of bone and stone scratched figures on rocks and bones and painted rude but often very able sketches of beasts and the like upon the smooth walls of caves and upon inviting rock surfaces  they made a great variety of implements much smaller in scale and finer than those of the neanderthal men we have now in our museums great quantities of their implements their statuettes their rock drawings and the like  the earliest of them were hunters  their chief pursuit was the wild horse the little bearded pony of that time  they followed it as it moved after pasture  and also they followed the bison they knew the mammoth because they have left us strikingly effective pictures of that creature  to judge by one rather ambiguous drawing they trapped and killed it  they hunted with spears and throwing stones  they do not seem to have had the bow and it is doubtful if they had yet learnt to tame any animals  they had no dogs  there is one carving of a horses head and one or two drawings that suggest a bridled horse with a twisted skin or tendon round it  but the little horses of that age and region could not have carried a man and if the horse was domesticated it was used as a led horse  it is doubtful and improbable that they had yet learnt the rather unnatural use of animals milk as food  they do not seem to have erected any buildings though they may have had tents of skins and though they made clay figures they never rose to the making of pottery  since they had no cooking implements their cookery must have been rudimentary or nonexistent  they knew nothing of cultivation and nothing of any sort of basket work or woven cloth except for their robes of skin or fur they were naked painted savages  these earliest known men hunted the open steppes of europe for a hundred centuries perhaps and then slowly drifted and changed before a change of climate  europe century by century was growing milder and damper reindeer receded northward and eastward and bison and horse followed  the steppes gave way to forests and red deer took the place of horse and bison there is a 57 change in the character of the implements with this change in their application  river and lake fishing becomes of great importance to men and fine implements of bone increased  the bone needles of this age says de mortillet are much superior to those of later even historical times down to the renaissance the romans for example never had needles comparable to those of this epoch  illustration the rutot bust of a cromagnon man  almost fifteen or twelve thousand years ago a fresh people drifted into the south of spain and left very remarkable drawings of themselves upon exposed rock faces there  these were the azilians named from the mas dazil cave  they had the bow they seem to have worn feather headdresses they drew vividly but also they had reduced their drawings to a sort of symbolisma man for instance would be represented by a vertical dab with two or three horizontal dabsthat suggest the dawn of the writing idea against hunting sketches there are often marks like tallies  one drawing shows two men smoking out a bees nest  58  illustration fight of bowmen  59  these are the latest of the men that we call palæolithic old stone age because they had only chipped implements  by ten or twelve thousand years a new sort of life has dawned in europe men have learnt not only to chip but to polish and grind stone implements and they have begun cultivation  the neolithic age new stone age was beginning  it is interesting to note that less than a century ago there still survived in a remote part of the world in tasmania a race of human beings at a lower level of physical and intellectual development than any of these earliest races of mankind who have left traces in europe  these people had long ago been cut off by geographical changes from the rest of the species and from stimulation and improvement  they seem to have degenerated rather than developed  they lived a base life subsisting upon shellfish and small game  they had no habitations but only squatting places  they were real men of our species but they had neither the manual dexterity nor the artistic powers of the first true men     60  xii  primitive thought   and now let us indulge in a very interesting speculation how did it feel to be a man in those early days of the human adventure how did men think and what did they think in those remote days of hunting and wandering four hundred centuries ago before seed time and harvest began  those were days long before the written record of any human impressions and we are left almost entirely to inference and guesswork in our answers to these questions  the sources to which scientific men have gone in their attempts to reconstruct that primitive mentality are very various  recently the science of psychoanalysis which analyzes the way in which the egotistic and passionate impulses of the child are restrained suppressed modified or overlaid to adapt them to the needs of social life seems to have thrown a considerable amount of light upon the history of primitive society and another fruitful source of suggestion has been the study of the ideas and customs of such contemporary savages as still survive  again there is a sort of mental fossilization which we find in folklore and the deeplying irrational superstitions and prejudices that still survive among modern civilized people  and finally we have in the increasingly numerous pictures statues carvings symbols and the like as we draw near to our own time clearer and clearer indications of what man found interesting and worthy of record and representation  primitive man probably thought very much as a child thinks that is to say in a series of imaginative pictures  he conjured up images or images presented themselves to his mind and he acted in accordance with the emotions they aroused  so a child or an uneducated person does today  systematic thinking is apparently a comparatively late development in human experience it has not 61 played any great part in human life until within the last three thousand years  and even today those who really control and order their thoughts are but a small minority of mankind most of the world still lives by imagination and passion  probably the earliest human societies in the opening stages of the true human story were small family groups  just as the flocks and herds of the earlier mammals arose out of families which remained together and multiplied so probably did the earliest tribes  but before this could happen a certain restraint upon the primitive egotisms of the individual had to be established  the fear of the father and respect for the mother had to be extended into adult life and the natural jealousy of the old man of the group for the younger males as they grew up had to be mitigated  the mother on the other hand was the natural adviser and protector of the young  human social life grew up out of the reaction between the crude instinct of the young to go off and pair by themselves as they grew up on the one hand and the dangers and disadvantages of separation on the other  an anthropological writer of great genius j j atkinson in his primal law has shown how much of the customary law of savages the tabus that are so remarkable a fact in tribal life can be ascribed to such a mental adjustment of the needs of the primitive human animal to a developing social life and the later work of the psychoanalysts has done much to confirm his interpretation of these possibilities  some speculative writers would have us believe that respect and fear of the old man and the emotional reaction of the primitive savage to older protective women exaggerated in dreams and enriched by fanciful mental play played a large part in the beginnings of primitive religion and in the conception of gods and goddesses  associated with this respect for powerful or helpful personalities was a dread and exaltation of such personages after their deaths due to their reappearance in dreams  it was easy to believe they were not truly dead but only fantastically transferred to a remoteness of greater power  the dreams imaginations and fears of a child are far more vivid and real than those of a modern adult and primitive man was always something of a child he was nearer to the animals 62 also and he could suppose them to have motives and reactions like his own  he could imagine animal helpers animal enemies animal gods  one needs to have been an imaginative child oneself to realize again how important significant portentous or friendly strangely shaped rocks lumps of wood exceptional trees or the like may have appeared to the men of the old stone age and how dream and fancy would create stories and legends about such things that would become credible as they told them  some of these stories would be good enough to remember and tell again  the women would tell them to the children and so establish a tradition  to this day most imaginative children invent long stories in which some favourite doll or animal or some fantastic semihuman being figures as the hero and primitive man probably did the samewith a much stronger disposition to believe his hero real  illustration relics of the stone age  for the very earliest of the true men that we know of were probably quite talkative beings  in that way they have differed from the neanderthalers and had an advantage over them  the neanderthaler may have been a dumb animal of course the primitive 63 human speech was probably a very scanty collection of names and may have been eked out with gestures and signs  there is no sort of savage so low as not to have a kind of science of cause and effect  but primitive man was not very critical in his associations of cause with effect he very easily connected an effect with something quite wrong as its cause you do so and so he said and so and so happens  you give a child a poisonous berry and it dies  you eat the heart of a valiant enemy and you become strong  there we have two bits of cause and effect association one true one false  we call the system of cause and effect in the mind of a savage fetish but fetish is simply savage science  it differs from modern science in that it is totally unsystematic and uncritical and so more frequently wrong  illustration widespread similarity of men of the stone age  in many cases it is not difficult to link cause and effect in 64 many others erroneous ideas were soon corrected by experience but there was a large series of issues of very great importance to primitive man where he sought persistently for causes and found explanations that were wrong but not sufficiently wrong nor so obviously wrong as to be detected  it was a matter of great importance to him that game should be abundant or fish plentiful and easily caught and no doubt he tried and believed in a thousand charms incantations and omens to determine these desirable results  another great concern of his was illness and death  occasionally infections crept through the land and men died of them  occasionally men were stricken by illness and died or were enfeebled without any manifest cause  this too must have given the hasty emotional mind of primitive man much feverish exercise  dreams and fantastic guesses made him blame this or appeal for help to that man or beast or thing  he had the childs aptitude for fear and panic  quite early in the little human tribe older steadier minds sharing the fears sharing the imaginations but a little more forceful than the others must have asserted themselves to advise to prescribe to command this they declared unpropitious and that imperative this an omen of good and that an omen of evil  the expert in fetish the medicine man was the first priest  he exhorted he interpreted dreams he warned he performed the complicated hocus pocus that brought luck or averted calamity  primitive religion was not so much what we now call religion as practice and observance and the early priest dictated what was indeed an arbitrary primitive practical science     65  xiii  the beginnings of cultivation   we are still very ignorant about the beginnings of cultivation and settlement in the world although a vast amount of research and speculation has been given to these matters in the last fifty years  all that we can say with any confidence at present is that somewhen about 15000 and 12000 bc while the azilian people were in the south of spain and while the remnants of the earlier hunters were drifting northward and eastward somewhere in north africa or western asia or in that great mediterranean valley that is now submerged under the waters of the mediterranean sea there were people who age by age were working out two vitally important things they were beginning cultivation and they were domesticating animals  they were also beginning to make in addition to the chipped implements of their hunter forebears implements of polished stone  they had discovered the possibility of basketwork and roughly woven textiles of plant fibre and they were beginning to make a rudely modelled pottery  they were entering upon a new phase in human culture the neolithic phase new stone age as distinguished from the palæolithic old stone phase of the cromagnards the grimaldi people the azilians and their like  1  slowly these neolithic people spread over the warmer parts of the world and the arts they had mastered the plants and animals they had learnt to use spread by imitation and acquisition even more widely than they did  by 10000 bc most of mankind was at the neolithic level  66  now the ploughing of land the sowing of seed the reaping of harvest threshing and grinding may seem the most obviously reasonable steps to a modern mind just as to a modern mind it is a commonplace that the world is round  what else could you do people will ask  what else can it be  but to the primitive man of twenty thousand years ago neither of the systems of action and reasoning that seem so sure and manifest to us today were at all obvious  he felt his way to effectual practice through a multitude of trials and misconceptions with fantastic and unnecessary elaborations and false interpretations at every turn somewhere in the mediterranean region wheat grew wild and man may have learnt to pound and then grind up its seeds for food long before he learnt to sow  he reaped before he sowed  and it is a very remarkable thing that throughout the world wherever there is sowing and harvesting there is still traceable the vestiges of a strong primitive association of the idea of sowing with the idea of a blood sacrifice and primarily of the sacrifice of a human being  the study of the original entanglement of these two things is a profoundly attractive one to the curious mind the interested reader will find it very fully developed in that monumental work sir j g frazers golden bough  it was an entanglement we must remember in the childish dreaming mythmaking primitive mind no reasoned process will explain it  but in that world of 12000 to 20000 years ago it would seem that whenever seed time came round to the neolithic peoples there was a human sacrifice  and it was not the sacrifice of any mean or outcast person it was the sacrifice usually of a chosen youth or maiden a youth more often who was treated with profound deference and even worship up to the moment of his immolation  he was a sort of sacrificial godking and all the details of his killing had become a ritual directed by the old knowing men and sanctioned by the accumulated usage of ages    67  illustration neolithic flint implements    at first primitive men with only a very rough idea of the seasons must have found great difficulty in determining when was the propitious moment for the seedtime sacrifice and the sowing there is some reason for supposing that there was an early stage in human experience when men had no idea of a year the first 68 chronology was in lunar months it is supposed that the years of the biblical patriarchs are really moons and the babylonian calendar shows distinct traces of an attempt to reckon seed time by taking thirteen lunar months to see it round this lunar influence upon the calendar reaches down to our own days if usage did not dull our sense of its strangeness we should think it a very remarkable thing indeed that the christian church does not commemorate the crucifixion and resurrection of christ on the proper anniversaries but on dates that vary year by year with the phases of the moon  illustration neolithicism of today  it may be doubted whether the first agriculturalists made any observation of the stars  it is more likely that stars were first observed by migratory herdsmen who found them a convenient mark of direction  but once their use in determining seasons was realized their importance to agriculture became very great  the seedtime sacrifice was linked up with the southing or northing of some prominent star  a myth and worship of that star was for primitive man an almost inevitable consequence  it is easy to see how important the man of knowledge and experience the man who knew about the blood sacrifice and the stars became in this early neolithic world  the fear of uncleanness and pollution and the methods of cleansing that were advisable constituted another source of power for the knowledgeable men and women for there have always been witches as well as wizards and priestesses as well as priests the early priest was really not so much a 69 religious man as a man of applied science  his science was generally empirical and often bad he kept it secret from the generality of men very jealously but that does not alter the fact that his primary function was knowledge and that his primary use was a practical use  illustration specimen of neolithic pottery  twelve or fifteen thousand years ago in all the warm and fairly wellwatered parts of the old world these neolithic human communities with their class and tradition of priests and priestesses and their cultivated fields and their development of villages and little walled cities were spreading  age by age a drift and exchange of ideas went on between these communities eliot smith and rivers have used the term heliolithic culture for the culture of these first agricultural peoples heliolithic sun and stone is not perhaps the best possible word to use for this but until scientific men give us a better one we shall have to use it  originating somewhere in the mediterranean and western asiatic area it spread age by age eastward and from island to island across the pacific until it may even have reached america and mingled with the more primitive ways of living of the mongoloid immigrants coming down from the north  wherever the brownish people with the heliolithic culture went they took with them all or most of a certain group of curious ideas and practices  some of them are such queer ideas that they call for the explanation of the mental expert  they made pyramids 70 and great mounds and set up great circles of big stones perhaps to facilitate the astronomical observation of the priests they made mummies of some or all of their dead they tattooed and circumcized they had the old custom known as the couvade of sending the father to bed and rest when a child was born and they had as a luck symbol the wellknown swastika  if we were to make a map of the world with dots to show how far these group practices have left their traces we should make a belt along the temperate and subtropical coasts of the world from stonehenge and spain across the world to mexico and peru  but africa below the equator north central europe and north asia would show none of these dottings there lived races who were developing along practically independent lines  1 the term palæolithic we may note is also used to cover the neanderthaler and even the eolithic implements  the prehuman age is called the older palæolithic the age of true men using unpolished stones in the newer palæolithic     71  xiv  primitive neolithic civilizations   about 10000 bc the geography of the world was very similar in its general outline to that of the world today  it is probable that by that time the great barrier across the straits of gibraltar that had hitherto banked back the ocean waters from the mediterranean valley had been eaten through and that the mediterranean was a sea following much the same coastlines as it does now  the caspian sea was probably still far more extensive than it is at present and it may have been continuous with the black sea to the north of the caucasus mountains  about this great central asian sea lands that are now steppes and deserts were fertile and habitable  generally it was a moister and more fertile world  european russia was much more a land of swamp and lake than it is now and there may still have been a land connexion between asia and america at behring straits  it would have been already possible at that time to have distinguished the main racial divisions of mankind as we know them today  across the warm temperate regions of this rather warmer and betterwooded world and along the coasts stretched the brownish peoples of the heliolithic culture the ancestors of the bulk of the living inhabitants of the mediterranean world of the berbers the egyptians and of much of the population of south and eastern asia  this great race had of course a number of varieties  the iberian or mediterranean or darkwhite race of the atlantic and mediterranean coast the hamitic peoples which include the berbers and egyptians the dravidians the darker people of india a multitude of east indian people many polynesian races and the maoris are all divisions of various value of this great main mass of humanity  its western varieties are whiter than its eastern  in the forests of central and northern europe a more blonde variety 72 of men with blue eyes was becoming distinguishable branching off from the main mass of brownish people a variety which many people now speak of as the nordic race  in the more open regions of northeastern asia was another differentiation of this brownish humanity in the direction of a type with more oblique eyes high cheekbones a yellowish skin and very straight black hair the mongolian peoples  in south africa australia in many tropical islands in the south of asia were remains of the early negroid peoples the central parts of africa were already a region of racial intermixture  nearly all the coloured races of africa today seem to be blends of the brownish peoples of the north with a negroid substratum  illustration a diagrammatic summary of current ideas of the relationship of human races  we have to remember that human races can all interbreed freely and that they separate mingle and reunite as clouds do  human races do not branch out like trees with branches that never come together again  it is a thing we need to bear constantly in mind this remingling of races at any opportunity  it will save us from many cruel delusions and prejudices if we do so  people will use such a word as race in the loosest manner and base the most preposterous generalizations upon it  they will speak of a british 73 race or of a european race  but nearly all the european nations are confused mixtures of brownish darkwhite white and mongolian elements  illustration a maya stele  it was at the neolithic phase of human development that peoples of the mongolian breed first made their way into america  apparently they came by way of behring straits and spread southward  they found caribou the american reindeer in the north and great 74 herds of bison in the south  when they reached south america there were still living the glyptodon a gigantic armadillo and the megatherium a monstrous clumsy sloth as high as an elephant they probably exterminated the latter beast which was as helpless as it was big  the greater portion of these american tribes never rose above a hunting nomadic neolithic life  they never discovered the use of iron and their chief metal possessions were native gold and copper  but in mexico yucatan and peru conditions existed favourable to settled cultivation and here about 1000 bc or so arose very interesting civilizations of a parallel but different type from the oldworld civilization  like the much earlier primitive civilizations of the old world these communities displayed a great development of human sacrifice about the processes of seed time and harvest but while in the old world as we shall see these primary ideas were ultimately mitigated complicated and overlaid by others in america they developed and were elaborated to a very high degree of intensity  these american civilized countries were essentially priestruled countries their war chiefs and rulers were under a rigorous rule of law and omen  these priests carried astronomical science to a high level of accuracy  they knew their year better than the babylonians of whom we shall presently tell  in yucatan they had a kind of writing the maya writing of the most curious and elaborate character  so far as we have been able to decipher it it was used mainly for keeping the exact and complicated calendars upon which the priests expended their intelligence  the art of the maya civilization came to a climax about 700 or 800 ad  the sculptured work of these people amazes the modern observer by its great plastic power and its frequent beauty and perplexes him by a grotesqueness and by a sort of insane conventionality and intricacy outside the circle of his ideas  there is nothing quite like it in the old world  the nearest approach and that is a remote one is found in archaic indian carvings  everywhere there are woven feathers and serpents twine in and out  many maya inscriptions resemble a certain sort of elaborate drawing made by lunatics in european asylums more than any other oldworld work  it is as if the maya mind 75 had developed upon a different line from the oldworld mind had a different twist to its ideas was not by oldworld standards a rational mind at all  this linking of these aberrant american civilizations to the idea of a general mental aberration finds support in their extraordinary obsession by the shedding of human blood  the mexican civilization in particular ran blood it offered thousands of human victims yearly  the cutting open of living victims the tearing out of the still beating heart was an act that dominated the minds and lives of these strange priesthoods  the public life the national festivities all turned on this fantastically horrible act  illustration neolithic warrior  the ordinary existence of the common people in these communities was very like the ordinary existence of any other barbaric peasantry  their pottery weaving and dyeing was very good  the maya writing was not only carven on stone but written and painted upon skins and the like  the european and american museums contain many enigmatical maya manuscripts of which at present little has been deciphered except the dates  in peru there were beginnings of a similar writing but they were superseded by a method of keeping records by knotting 76 cords  a similar method of mnemonics was in use in china thousands of years ago  in the old world before 4000 or 5000 bc that is to say three or four thousand years earlier there were primitive civilizations not unlike these american civilizations civilizations based upon a temple having a vast quantity of blood sacrifices and with an intensely astronomical priesthood  but in the old world the primitive civilizations reacted upon one another and developed towards the conditions of our own world  in america these primitive civilizations never progressed beyond this primitive stage  each of them was in a little world of its own  mexico it seems knew little or nothing of peru until the europeans came to america  the potato which was the principal food stuff in peru was unknown in mexico  age by age these peoples lived and marvelled at their gods and made their sacrifices and died  maya art rose to high levels of decorative beauty  men made love and tribes made war  drought and plenty pestilence and health followed one another  the priests elaborated their calendar and their sacrificial ritual through long centuries but made little progress in other directions     77  xv  sumeria early egypt and writing   the old world is a wider more varied stage than the new  by 6000 or 7000 bc there were already quasicivilized communities almost at the peruvian level appearing in various fertile regions of asia and in the nile valley  at that time north persia and western turkestan and south arabia were all more fertile than they are now and there are traces of very early communities in these regions  it is in lower mesopotamia however and in egypt that there first appear cities temples systematic irrigation and evidences of a social organization rising above the level of a mere barbaric villagetown  in those days the euphrates and tigris flowed by separate mouths into the persian gulf and it was in the country between them that the sumerians built their first cities  about the same time for chronology is still vague the great history of egypt was beginning  these sumerians appear to have been a brownish people with prominent noses  they employed a sort of writing that has been deciphered and their language is now known  they had discovered the use of bronze and they built great towerlike temples of sundried brick the clay of this country is very fine they used it to write upon and so it is that their inscriptions have been preserved to us  they had cattle sheep goats and asses but no horses  they fought on foot in close formation carrying spears and shields of skin  their clothing was of wool and they shaved their heads  each of the sumerian cities seems generally to have been an independent state with a god of its own and priests of its own but sometimes one city would establish an ascendancy over others and exact tribute from their population  a very ancient inscription 78at nippur records the empire the first recorded empire of the sumerian city of erech  its god and its priestking claimed an authority from the persian gulf to the red sea  illustration brick of hammurabi king of babylon about 2200 bc  at first writing was merely an abbreviated method of pictorial record  even before neolithic times men were beginning to write the azilian rock pictures to which we have already referred show the beginning of the process  many of them record hunts and expeditions and in most of these the human figures are plainly drawn  but in some the painter would not bother with head and limbs he just indicated men by a vertical and one or two transverse strokes  from this to a conventional condensed picture writing was an easy transition  in sumeria where the writing was done on clay with a stick the dabs of the characters soon became unrecognizably unlike the things they stood for but in egypt where men painted on walls and on strips of the papyrus reed the first paper the likeness to the thing imitated remained  from the fact that the wooden styles used in sumeria made wedgeshaped marks the sumerian writing is called cuneiform  wedgeshaped  79  illustration ebony cylinder seals of first egyptian dynasty  an important step towards writing was made when pictures were used to indicate not the thing represented but some similar thing  in the rebus dear to children of a suitable age this is still done today  we draw a camp with tents and a bell and the child is delighted to guess that this is the scotch name campbell  the sumerian language was a language made up of accumulated syllables rather like some contemporary amerindian languages and it lent itself very readily to this syllabic method of writing words expressing ideas that could not be conveyed by pictures directly egyptian writing underwent parallel developments  later on when foreign peoples with less distinctly syllabled methods of speech were to learn and use these picture scripts they were to make those further modifications and simplifications that developed at last into alphabetical writing  all the true alphabets of the later world derived from a mixture of the sumerian cuneiform and the egyptian hieroglyphic priest writing  later in china there was to develop a conventionalized picture writing but in china it never got to the alphabetical stage  80  the invention of writing was of very great importance in the development of human societies  it put agreements laws commandments on record  it made the growth of states larger than the old city states possible  it made a continuous historical consciousness possible  the command of the priest or king and his seal could go far beyond his sight and voice and could survive his death  it is interesting to note that in ancient sumeria seals were greatly used  a king or a nobleman or a merchant would have his seal often very artistically carved and would impress it on any clay document he wished to authorize  so close had civilization got to printing six thousand years ago  then the clay was dried hard and became permanent  for the reader must remember that in the land of mesopotamia for countless years letters records and accounts were all written on comparatively indestructible tiles  to that fact we owe a great wealth of recovered knowledge  illustration the sakhara pyramids  bronze copper gold silver and as a precious rarity meteoric iron were known in both sumeria and egypt at a very early stage    81  illustration view from the summit of the great pyramid of cheops    82  illustration the temple of hathor at dendereh    daily life in those first city lands of the old world must have been 83 very similar in both egypt and sumeria  and except for the asses and cattle in the streets it must have been not unlike the life in the maya cities of america three or four thousand years later  most of the people in peace time were busy with irrigation and cultivationexcept on days of religious festivity they had no money and no need for it  they managed their small occasional trades by barter  the princes and rulers who alone had more than a few possessions used gold and silver bars and precious stones for any incidental act of trade  the temple dominated life in sumeria it was a great towering temple that went up to a roof from which the stars were observed in egypt it was a massive building with only a ground floor in sumeria the priest ruler was the greatest most splendid of beings  in egypt however there was one who was raised above the priests he was the living incarnation of the chief god of the land the pharaoh the god king  there were few changes in the world in those days mens days were sunny toilsome and conventional  few strangers came into the land and such as did fared uncomfortably  the priest directed life according to immemorial rules and watched the stars for seed time and marked the omens of the sacrifices and interpreted the warnings of dreams  men worked and loved and died not unhappily forgetful of the savage past of their race and heedless of its future  sometimes the ruler was benign  such was pepi ii who reigned in egypt for ninety years  sometimes he was ambitious and took mens sons to be soldiers and sent them against neighbouring city states to war and plunder or he made them toil to build great buildings  such were cheops and chephren and mycerinus who built those vast sepulchral piles the pyramids at gizeh  the largest of these is 450 feet high and the weight of stone in it is 4883000 tons  all this was brought down the nile in boats and lugged into place chiefly by human muscle  its erection must have exhausted egypt more than a great war would have done    84  xvi  primitive nomadic peoples   it was not only in mesopotamia and the nile valley that men were settling down to agriculture and the formation of city states in the centuries between 6000 and 8000 bc  wherever there were possibilities of irrigation and a steady alltheyearround food supply men were exchanging the uncertainties and hardships of hunting and wandering for the routines of settlement  on the upper tigris a people called the assyrians were founding cities in the valleys of asia minor and on the mediterranean shores and islands there were small communities growing up to civilization possibly parallel developments of human life were already going on in favourable regions of india and china  in many parts of europe where there were lakes well stocked with fish little communities of men had long settled in dwellings built on piles over the water and were eking out agriculture by fishing and hunting but over much larger areas of the old world no such settlement was possible  the land was too harsh too thickly wooded or too arid or the seasons too uncertain for mankind with only the implements and science of that age to take root  for settlement under the conditions of the primitive civilizations men needed a constant water supply and warmth and sunshine  where these needs were not satisfied man could live as a transient as a hunter following his game as a herdsman following the seasonal grass but he could not settle  the transition from the hunting to the herding life may have been very gradual  from following herds of wild cattle or in asia wild horses men may have come to an idea of property in them have learnt to pen them into valleys have fought for them against wolves wild dogs and other predatory beasts  85  illustration pottery and implements of the lake dwellers  86  illustration a contemporary lake village  so while the primitive civilizations of the cultivators were growing up chiefly in the great river valleys a different way of living the nomadic life a life in constant movement to and fro from winter pasture to summer pasture was also growing up  the nomadic peoples were on the whole hardier than the agriculturalists they were less prolific and numerous they had no permanent temples and no highly organized priesthood they had less gear but the reader must not suppose that theirs was necessarily a less highly developed way of living on that account in many ways this free life was a fuller life than that of the tillers of the soil  the individual was more selfreliant less of a unit in a crowd  the leader was more important the medicine man perhaps less so  illustration nomads in egypt  87  moving over large stretches of country the nomad took a wider view of life  he touched on the confines of this settled land and that  he was used to the sight of strange faces  he had to scheme and treat for pasture with competing tribes  he knew more of minerals than the folk upon the plough lands because he went over mountain passes and into rocky places  he may have been a better metallurgist  possibly bronze and much more probably iron smelting were nomadic discoveries  some of the earliest implements of iron reduced from its ores have been found in central europe far away from the early civilizations  illustration flint knives of 4500 bc  illustration nomads in egypt  on the other hand the settled folk had their textiles and their pottery and made many desirable things  it was inevitable that as the two sorts of life the agricultural and the nomadic differentiated a certain amount of looting and trading should develop between the two  in sumeria particularly which had deserts and seasonal 88 country on either hand it must have been usual to have the nomads camping close to the cultivated fields trading and stealing and perhaps tinkering as gipsies do to this day  but hens they would not steal because the domestic fowlan indian jungle fowl originally was not domesticated by man until about 1000 bc  they would bring precious stones and things of metal and leather  if they were hunters they would bring skins they would get in exchange pottery and beads and glass garments and suchlike manufactured things  illustration egypt peasants going to work  three main regions and three main kinds of wandering and imperfectly settled people there were in those remote days of the first civilizations in sumeria and early egypt  away in the forests of europe were the blonde nordic peoples hunters and herdsmen a lowly race  the primitive civilizations saw very little of this race before 1500 bc  away on the steppes of eastern asia various mongolian tribes the hunnish peoples were domesticating the horse and developing a very wide sweeping habit of seasonal movement between their summer and winter camping places  possibly the nordic and hunnish peoples were still separated from one another by the swamps of russia and the greater caspian sea of that time  for very much of russia there was swamp and lake  in the deserts which were growing more arid now of syria and arabia tribes of a dark white or brownish people the semitic tribes were driving flocks of sheep and goats and asses from pasture to pasture  it was these semitic shepherds and certain more negroid people from southern persia the elamites who were the first nomads to come into close contact with the early civilizations  they came 90 as traders and as raiders finally there arose leaders among them with bolder imaginations and they became conquerors    89  illustration stele glorifying king naram sin of akkad    about 2750 bc a great semitic leader sargon had conquered the whole sumerian land and was master of all the world from the persian gulf to the mediterranean sea  he was an illiterate barbarian and his people the akkadians learnt the sumerian writing and adopted the sumerian language as the speech of the officials and the learned  the empire he founded decayed after two centuries and after one inundation of elamites a fresh semitic people the amorites by degrees established their rule over sumeria  they made their capital in what had hitherto been a small upriver town babylon and their empire is called the first babylonian empire  it was consolidated by a great king called hammurabi circa 2100 bc who made the earliest code of laws yet known to history  the narrow valley of the nile lies less open to nomadic invasion than mesopotamia but about the time of hammurabi occurred a successful semitic invasion of egypt and a line of pharaohs was set up the hyksos or shepherd kings which lasted for several centuries  these semitic conquerors never assimilated themselves with the egyptians they were always regarded with hostility as foreigners and barbarians and they were at last expelled by a popular uprising about 1600 bc  but the semites had come into sumeria for good and all the two races assimilated and the babylonian empire became semitic in its language and character     91  xvii  the first seagoing peoples   the earliest boats and ships must have come into use some twentyfive or thirty thousand years ago  man was probably paddling about on the water with a log of wood or an inflated skin to assist him at latest in the beginnings of the neolithic period  a basketwork boat covered with skin and caulked was used in egypt and sumeria from the beginnings of our knowledge  such boats are still used there  they are used to this day in ireland and wales and in alaska sealskin boats still make the crossing of behring straits  the hollow log followed as tools improved  the building of boats and then ships came in a natural succession  perhaps the legend of noahs ark preserves the memory of some early exploit in shipbuilding just as the story of the flood so widely distributed among the peoples of the world may be the tradition of the flooding of the mediterranean basin  there were ships upon the red sea long before the pyramids were built and there were ships on the mediterranean and persian gulf by 7000 bc  mostly these were the ships of fishermen but some were already trading and pirate shipsfor knowing what we do of mankind we may guess pretty safely that the first sailors plundered where they could and traded where they had to do so  the seas on which these first ships adventured were inland seas on which the wind blew fitfully and which were often at a dead calm for days together so that sailing did not develop beyond an accessory use  it is only in the last four hundred years that the wellrigged oceangoing sailing ship has developed  the ships of the ancient world were essentially rowing ships which hugged the shore and went into harbour at the first sign of rough weather  as ships grew into big galleys they caused a demand for war captives as galley slaves  we have already noted the appearance of the semitic people as wanderers and nomads in the region of syria and arabia and how they conquered sumeria and set up first the akkadian and then the first babylonian empire  in the west these same semitic peoples 92 were taking to the sea  they set up a string of harbour towns along the eastern coast of the mediterranean of which tyre and sidon were the chief and by the time of hammurabi in babylon they had spread as traders wanderers and colonizers over the whole mediterranean basin  these sea semites were called the phoenicians they settled largely in spain pushing back the old iberian basque population and sending coasting expeditions through the straits of gibraltar and they set up colonies upon the north coast of africa  of carthage one of these phoenician cities we shall have much more to tell later  but the phoenicians were not the first people to have galleys in the mediterranean waters  there was already a series of towns and cities among the islands and coasts of that sea belonging to a race or races apparently connected by blood and language with the basques to the west and the berbers and egyptians to the south the Ægean peoples  these peoples must not be confused with the greeks who come much later into our story they were pregreek but they had cities in greece and asia minor mycenæ and troy for example and they had a great and prosperous establishment at cnossos in crete  it is only in the last half century that the industry of excavating archæologists has brought the extent and civilization of the Ægean peoples to our knowledge  cnossos has been most thoroughly explored it was happily not succeeded by any city big enough to destroy its ruins and so it is our chief source of information about this once almost forgotten civilization  the history of cnossos goes back as far as the history of egypt the two countries were trading actively across the sea by 4000 bc  by 2500 bc that is between the time of sargon i and hammurabi cretan civilization was at its zenith  cnossos was not so much a town as a great palace for the cretan monarch and his people  it was not even fortified  it was only fortified later as the phoenicians grew strong and as a new and more terrible breed of pirates the greeks came upon the sea from the north  the monarch was called minos as the egyptian monarch was called pharaoh and he kept his state in a palace fitted with running water with bathrooms and the like conveniences such as we know of in no other ancient remains  there he held great festivals and shows  there was bullfighting singularly like the bullfighting that 93 still survives in spain there was resemblance even in the costumes of the bullfighters and there were gymnastic displays  the womens clothes were remarkably modern in spirit they wore corsets and flounced dresses  the pottery the textile manufactures the sculpture painting jewellery ivory metal and inlay work of these 94 cretans was often astonishingly beautiful  and they had a system of writing but that still remains to be deciphered  illustration the treasure house at mycenÆ  this happy and sunny and civilized life lasted for some score of centuries  about 2000 bc cnossos and babylon abounded in comfortable and cultivated people who probably led very pleasant lives  they had shows and they had religious festivals they had domestic slaves to look after them and industrial slaves to make a profit for them  life must have seemed very secure in cnossos for such people sunlit and girdled by the blue sea  egypt of course must have appeared rather a declining country in those days under the rule of her halfbarbaric shepherd kings and if one took an interest in politics one must have noticed how the semitic people seemed to be getting everywhere ruling egypt ruling distant babylon building nineveh on the upper tigris sailing west to the pillars of hercules the straits of gibraltar and setting up their colonies on those distant coasts  there were some active arid curious minds in cnossos because later on the greeks told legends of a certain skilful cretan artificer dædalus who attempted to make some sort of flying machine perhaps a glider which collapsed and fell into the sea  it is interesting to note some of the differences as well as the resemblances between the life of cnossos and our own  to a cretan gentleman of 2500 bc iron was a rare metal which fell out of the sky and was curious rather than usefulfor as yet only meteoric iron was known iron had not been obtained from its ores  compare that with our modern state of affairs pervaded by iron everywhere the horse again would be a quite legendary creature to our cretan a sort of superass which lived in the bleak northern lands far away beyond the black sea  civilization for him dwelt chiefly in Ægean greece and asia minor where lydians and carians and trojans lived a life and probably spoke languages like his own  there were phoenicians and Ægeans settled in spain and north africa but those were very remote regions to his imagination  italy was still a desolate land covered with dense forests the brownskinned etruscans had not yet gone there from asia minor  and one day perhaps this cretan gentleman went down to the harbour and saw a captive who attracted his attention because he was very faircomplexioned 95 and had blue eyes  perhaps our cretan tried to talk to him and was answered in an unintelligible gibberish  this creature came from somewhere beyond the black sea and seemed to be an altogether benighted savage  but indeed he was an aryan tribesman of a race and culture of which we shall soon have much to tell and the strange gibberish he spoke was to differentiate some day into sanskrit persian greek latin german english and most of the chief languages of the world  illustration the palace at cnossos  such was cnossos at its zenith intelligent enterprising bright and happy  but about 1400 bc disaster came perhaps very suddenly upon its prosperity  the palace of minos was destroyed and its ruins have never been rebuilt or inhabited from that day to this  we do not know how this disaster occurred  the excavators note what appears to be scattered plunder and the marks of the fire  but the traces of a very destructive earthquake have also been found  nature alone may have destroyed cnossos or the greeks may have finished what the earthquake began     96  xviii  egypt babylon and assyria   the egyptians had never submitted very willingly to the rule of their semitic shepherd kings and about 1600 ad a vigorous patriotic movement expelled these foreigners  followed a new phase or revival for egypt a period known to egyptologists as the new empire  egypt which had not been closely consolidated before the hyksos invasion was now a united country and the phase of subjugation and insurrection left her full of military spirit the pharaohs became aggressive conquerors  they had now acquired the war horse and the war chariot which the hyksos had brought to them  under thothmes iii and amenophis iii egypt had extended her rule into asia as far as the euphrates  we are entering now upon a thousand years of warfare between the once quite separated civilizations of mesopotamia and the nile at first egypt was ascendant  the great dynasties the seventeenth dynasty which included thothmes iii and amenophis iii and iv and a great queen hatasu and the nineteenth when rameses ii supposed by some to have been the pharaoh of moses reigned for sixtyseven years raised egypt to high levels of prosperity in between there were phases of depression for egypt conquest by the syrians and later conquest by the ethiopians from the south in mesopotamia babylon ruled then the hittites and the syrians of damascus rose to a transitory predominance at one time the syrians conquered egypt the fortunes of the assyrians of nineveh ebbed and flowed sometimes the city was a conquered city sometimes the assyrians ruled in babylon and assailed egypt  our space is too limited here to tell of the comings and goings of the armies of the egyptians and of the various semitic powers of asia minor syria and mesopotamia  they were armies now provided with vast droves of war chariots for the horsestill used only for 97 war and gloryhad spread by this time into the old civilizations from central asia  illustration temple at abu simbel  great conquerors appear in the dim light of that distant time and pass tushratta king of mitanni who captured nineveh tiglath pileser i of assyria who conquered babylon  at last the assyrians became the greatest military power of the time tiglath pileser iii conquered babylon in 745 bc and founded what historians call the new assyrian empire  iron had also come now into civilization out of the north the hittites the precursors of the armenians had it first and communicated its use to the assyrians and an assyrian usurper sargon ii armed his troops with it  assyria became the first power to expound the doctrine of blood and iron sargons son sennacherib led an army to the borders of egypt and was defeated not by military strength but by the plague sennacheribs grandson assurbanipal who is also known in history 98 by his greek name of sardanapalus did actually conquer egypt in 670 bc  but egypt was already a conquered country then under an ethiopian dynasty  sardanapalus simply replaced one conqueror by another  illustration avenue of sphinxes  if one had a series of political maps of this long period of history this interval of ten centuries we should have egypt expanding and contracting like an amoeba under a microscope and we should see these various semitic states of the babylonians the assyrians the hittites and the syrians coming and going eating each other up and disgorging each other again  to the west of asia minor there would be little Ægean states like lydia whose capital was sardis and caria  but after about 1200 bc and perhaps earlier a new set of names would come into the map of the ancient world from 100 the northeast and from the northwest these would be the names of certain barbaric tribes armed with iron weapons and using horsechariots who were becoming a great affliction to the Ægean and semitic civilizations on the northern borders  they all spoke variants of what once must have been the same language aryan    99  illustration the great hypostyle hall at karnak    round the northeast of the black and caspian seas were coming the medes and persians  confused with these in the records of the time were scythians and samatians  from northeast or northwest came the armenians from the northwest of the seabarrier through the balkan peninsula came cimmerians phrygians and the hellenic tribes whom now we call the greeks they were raiders and robbers and plunderers of cities these ayrans east and west alike  they were all kindred and similar peoples hardy herdsmen who had taken to plunder  in the east they were still only borderers and raiders but in the west they were taking cities and driving out the civilized Ægean populations  the Ægean peoples were so pressed that they were seeking new homes in lands beyond the aryan range  some were seeking a settlement in the delta of the nile and being repulsed by the egyptians some the etruscans seem to have sailed from asia minor to found a state in the forest wildernesses of middle italy some built themselves cities upon the southeast coasts of the mediterranean and became later that people known in history as the philistines  of these aryans who came thus rudely upon the scene of the ancient civilizations we will tell more fully in a later section  here we note simply all this stir and emigration amidst the area of the ancient civilizations that was set up by the swirl of the gradual and continuous advance of these aryan barbarians out of the northern forests and wildernesses between 1600 and 600 bc  and in a section to follow we must tell also of a little semitic people the hebrews in the hills behind the phoenician and philistine coasts who began to be of significance in the world towards the end of this period  they produced a literature of very great importance in subsequent history a collection of books histories poems books of wisdom and prophetic works the hebrew bible  in mesopotamia and egypt the coming of the aryans did not cause fundamental changes until after 600 bc the flight of 101 the Ægeans before the greeks and even the destruction of cnossos must have seemed a very remote disturbance to both the citizens of egypt and of babylon  dynasties came and went in these cradle states of civilization but the main tenor of human life went on with a slow increase in refinement and complexity age by age  in egypt the accumulated monuments of more ancient timesthe pyramids were already in their third thousand of years and a show for visitors just as they are todaywere supplemented by fresh and splendid buildings more particularly in the time of the seventeenth and nineteenth dynasties  the great temples at karnak and luxor date from this time  all the chief monuments of nineveh the great temples the winged bulls with human heads the reliefs of kings and chariots and lion hunts were done in these centuries between 1600 and 600 bc and this period also covers most of the splendours of babylon  illustration frieze showing egyptian female slaves carrying luxurious foods  both from mesopotamia and egypt we now have abundant public records business accounts stories poetry and private correspondence  we know that life for prosperous and influential people in such cities as babylon and the egyptian thebes was already almost as refined and as luxurious as that of comfortable and prosperous people today  such people lived an orderly and ceremonious life in beautiful and beautifully furnished and decorated houses wore richly decorated clothing and lovely jewels they had feasts and festivals entertained one another with music and dancing were waited upon by highly trained servants were cared for by doctors and dentists  they did not travel very much or very far but boating 102 excursions were a common summer pleasure both on the nile and on the euphrates  the beast of burthen was the ass the horse was still used only in chariots for war and upon occasions of state  the mule was still novel and the camel though it was known in mesopotamia had not been brought into egypt  and there were few utensils of iron copper and bronze remained the prevailing metals  fine linen and cotton fabrics were known as well as wool  but there was no silk yet  glass was known and beautifully coloured but glass things were usually small  there was no clear glass and no optical use of glass  people had gold stoppings in their teeth but no spectacles on their noses  one odd contrast between the life of old thebes or babylon and modern life was the absence of coined money  most trade was still done by barter  babylon was financially far ahead of egypt  gold and silver were used for exchange and kept in ingots and there were bankers before coinage who stamped their names and the weight on these lumps of precious metal  a merchant or traveller would carry precious stones to sell to pay for his necessities most servants and workers were slaves who were paid not money but in kind  as money came in slavery declined  a modern visitor to these crowning cities of the ancient world would have missed two very important articles of diet there were no hens and no eggs  a french cook would have found small joy in babylon  these things came from the east somewhere about the time of the last assyrian empire  religion like everything else had undergone great refinement human sacrifice for instance had long since disappeared animals or bread dummies had been substituted for the victim  but the phoenicians and especially the citizens of carthage their greatest settlement in africa were accused later of immolating human beings  when a great chief had died in the ancient days it had been customary to sacrifice his wives and slaves and break spear and bow at his tomb so that he should not go unattended and unarmed in the spirit world  in egypt there survived of this dark tradition the pleasant custom of burying small models of house and shop and servants and cattle with the dead models that give us today the liveliest realization of the safe and cultivated life of these ancient people three thousand years and more ago  103  illustration the temple of horus at edfu  such was the ancient world before the coming of the aryans out of the northern forests and plains  in india and china there were parallel developments  in the great valleys of both these regions agricultural city states of brownish peoples were growing up but in india they do not seem to have advanced or coalesced so rapidly as the city states of mesopotamia or egypt  they were nearer the level of the ancient sumerians or of the maya civilization of america  chinese history has still to be modernized by chinese scholars and cleared of much legendary matter  probably china at this time was in advance of india  contemporary with the seventeenth dynasty in egypt there was a dynasty of emperors in china the shang dynasty priest emperors over a looseknit empire of subordinate kings  the chief duty of these early emperors was to perform the seasonal sacrifices  beautiful bronze vessels from the time of the shang dynasty still exist and their beauty and workmanship compel us to recognize that many centuries of civilization must have preceded their manufacture     104  xix  the primitive aryans   four thousand years ago that is to say about 2000 bc central and southeastern europe and central asia were probably warmer moister and better wooded than they are now  in these regions of the earth wandered a group of tribes mainly of the fair and blueeyed nordic race sufficiently in touch with one another to speak merely variations of one common language from the rhine to the caspian sea  at that time they may not have been a very numerous people and their existence was unsuspected by the babylonians to whom hammurabi was giving laws or by the already ancient and cultivated land of egypt which was tasting in those days for the first time the bitterness of foreign conquest  these nordic people were destined to play a very important part indeed in the worlds history  they were a people of the parklands and the forest clearings they had no horses at first but they had cattle when they wandered they put their tents and other gear on rough ox waggons when they settled for a time they may have made huts of wattle and mud  they burnt their important dead they did not bury them ceremoniously as the brunette peoples did  they put the ashes of their greater leaders in urns and then made a great circular mound about them  these mounds are the round barrows that occur all over north europe  the brunette people their predecessors did not burn their dead but buried them in a sitting position in elongated mounds the long barrows  the aryans raised crops of wheat ploughing with oxen but they did not settle down by their crops they would reap and move on they had bronze and somewhen about 1500 bc they acquired iron they may have been the discoverers of iron smelting  and somewhen vaguely about that time they also got the horsewhich to begin with they used only for draught purposes  their social life did not centre upon a temple like that of the more settled people round the mediterranean and their chief men were leaders rather than priests  they had an aristocratic social order rather than a 106 divine and regal order from a very early stage they distinguished certain families as leaderly and noble    105  illustration a beautiful archaic amphora    they were a very vocal people  they enlivened their wanderings by feasts at which there was much drunkenness and at which a special sort of man the bards would sing and recite  they had no writing until they had come into contact with civilization and the memories of these bards were their living literature  this use of recited language as an entertainment did much to make it a fine and beautiful instrument of expression and to that no doubt the subsequent predominance of the languages derived from aryan is in part to be ascribed  every aryan people had its legendary history crystallized in bardic recitations epics sagas and vedas as they were variously called  the social life of these people centred about the households of their leading men  the hall of the chief where they settled for a time was often a very capacious timber building  there were no doubt huts for herds and outlying farm buildings but with most of the aryan peoples this hall was the general centre everyone went there to feast and hear the bards and take part in games and discussions  cowsheds and stabling surrounded it  the chief and his wife and so forth would sleep on a dais or in an upper gallery the commoner sort slept about anywhere as people still do in indian households  except for weapons ornaments tools and suchlike personal possessions there was a sort of patriarchal communism in the tribe  the chief owned the cattle and grazing lands in the common interest forest and rivers were the wild  this was the fashion of the people who were increasing and multiplying over the great spaces of central europe and west central asia during the growth of the great civilization of mesopotamia and the nile and whom we find pressing upon the heliolithic peoples everywhere in the second millennium before christ  they were coming into france and britain and into spain they pushed westward in two waves  the first of these people who reached britain and ireland were armed with bronze weapons  they exterminated or subjugated the people who had made the great stone monuments of carnac in brittany and stonehenge and avebury in england  they reached ireland they are called the goidelic celts  the 107 second wave of a closely kindred people perhaps intermixed with other racial elements brought iron with it into great britain and is known as the wave of brythonic celts  from them the welsh derive their language  illustration the mound of nippur  kindred celtic peoples were pressing southward into spain and coming into contact not only with the heliolithic basque people who still occupied the country but with the semitic phoenician colonies of the sea coast  a closely allied series of tribes the italians were making their way down the still wild and wooded italian peninsula  they did not always conquer  in the eighth century bc rome appears in history a trading town on the tiber inhabited by aryan latins but under the rule of etruscan nobles and kings  at the other extremity of the aryan range there was a similar progress southward of similar tribes  aryan peoples speaking sanskrit had come down through the western passes into north 108 india long before 1000 bc  there they came into contact with a primordial brunette civilization the dravidian civilization and learnt much from it  other aryan tribes seem to have spread over the mountain masses of central asia far to the east of the present range of such peoples  in eastern turkestan there are still fair blueeyed nordic tribes but now they speak mongolian tongues  between the black and caspian seas the ancient hittites had been submerged and aryanized by the armenians before 1000 bc and the assyrians and babylonians were already aware of a new and formidable fighting barbarism on the northeastern frontiers a group of tribes amidst which the scythians the medes and the persians remain as outstanding names  but it was through the balkan peninsula that aryan tribes made their first heavy thrust into the heart of the oldworld civilization  they were already coming southward and crossing into asia minor many centuries before 1000 bc  first came a group of tribes of whom the phrygians were the most conspicuous and then in succession the Æolic the ionic and the dorian greeks by 1000 bc they had wiped out the ancient Ægean civilization both in the mainland of greece and in most of the greek islands the cities of mycenæ and tiryns were obliterated and cnossos was nearly forgotten  the greeks had taken to the sea before 1000 ad they had settled in crete and rhodes and they were founding colonies in sicily and the south of italy after the fashion of the phoenician trading cities that were dotted along the mediterranean coasts  so it was while tiglath pileser iii and sargon ii and sardanapalus were ruling in assyria and fighting with babylonia and syria and egypt the aryan peoples were learning the methods of civilization and making it over for their own purposes in italy and greece and north persia  the theme of history from the ninth century bc onward for six centuries is the story of how these aryan peoples grew to power and enterprise and how at last they subjugated the whole ancient world semitic Ægean and egyptian alike  in form the aryan peoples were altogether victorious but the struggle of aryan semitic and egyptian ideas and methods was continued long after the sceptre was in aryan hands  it is indeed a struggle that goes on through all the rest of history and still in a manner continues to this day     109  xx  the last babylonian empire and the empire of darius i   we have already mentioned how assyria became a great military power under tiglath pileser iii and under the usurper sargon ii sargon was not this mans original name he adopted it to flatter the conquered babylonians by reminding them of that ancient founder of the akkadian empire sargon i two thousand years before his time  babylon for all that it was a conquered city was of greater population and importance than nineveh and its great god bel marduk and its traders and priests had to be treated politely  in mesopotamia in the eighth century bc we are already far beyond the barbaric days when the capture of a town meant loot and massacre  conquerors sought to propitiate and win the conquered  for a century and a half after sargon the new assyrian empire endured and as we have noted assurbanipal sardanapalus held at least lower egypt  but the power and solidarity of assyria waned rapidly  egypt by an effort threw off the foreigner under a pharoah psammetichus i and under necho ii attempted a war of conquest in syria  by that time assyria was grappling with foes nearer at hand and could make but a poor resistance  a semitic people from southeast mesopotamia the chaldeans combined with aryan medes and persians from the northeast against nineveh and in 606 bcfor now we are coming down to exact chronologytook that city  there was a division of the spoils of assyria  a median empire was set up in the north under cyaxares   it included nineveh and its capital was ecbatana  eastward it reached to the borders of india  to the south of this in a great crescent was a new chaldean empire the second babylonian empire which rose to a very great degree of wealth and power under the rule of nebuchadnezzar the great the nebuchadnezzar of the bible the last great days the 110 greatest days of all for babylon began  for a time the two empires remained at peace and the daughter of nebuchadnezzar was married to cyaxares  meanwhile necho ii was pursuing his easy conquests in syria  he had defeated and slain king josiah of judah a small country of which there is more to tell presently at the battle of megiddo in 608 bc and he pushed on to the euphrates to encounter not a decadent assyria but a renascent babylonia  the chaldeans dealt very vigorously with the egyptians  necho was routed and driven back to egypt and the babylonian frontier pushed down to the ancient egyptian boundaries  from 606 until 589 bc the second babylonian empire flourished insecurely  it flourished so long as it kept the peace with the stronger hardier median empire to the north  and during these sixtyseven years not only life but learning flourished in the ancient city  map map showing the relation of the median and second babylonian chaldæan empires in the reign of nebuchadnezzar the great  map the empire of darius tributepaying countries at its greatest extent  even under the assyrian monarchs and especially under sardanapalus babylon had been a scene of great intellectual activity  111 sardanapalus though an assyrian had been quite babylonized  he made a library a library not of paper but of the clay tablets that were used for writing in mesopotamia since early sumerian days  his collection has been unearthed and is perhaps the most precious store of historical material in the world  the last of the chaldean line of babylonian monarchs nabonidus had even keener literary tastes  he patronized antiquarian researches and when a date was worked out by his investigators for the accession of sargon i he commemorated the fact by inscriptions  but there were many signs of disunion in his empire and he sought to centralize it by bringing a number of the various local gods to babylon and setting up temples to them there  this device was to be practised quite successfully by the romans in later times but in babylon it roused the jealousy of the powerful priesthood of bel marduk the dominant god of the babylonians  they cast about for a possible alternative to nabonidus and found it in cyrus the persian the ruler of the adjacent median empire  cyrus had already distinguished himself by conquering croesus the rich king of lydia in eastern asia minor  112 he came up against babylon there was a battle outside the walls and the gates of the city were opened to him 538 bc  his soldiers entered the city without fighting  the crown prince belshazzar the son of nabonidus was feasting the bible relates when a hand appeared and wrote in letters of fire upon the wall these mystical words mene mene tekel upharsin which was interpreted by the prophet daniel whom he summoned to read the riddle as god has numbered thy kingdom and finished it thou art weighed in the balance and found wanting and thy kingdom is given to the medes and persians  possibly the priests of bel marduk knew something about that writing on the wall  belshazzar was killed that night says the bible nabonidus was taken prisoner and the occupation of the city was so peaceful that the services of bel marduk continued without intermission  illustration persian monarch  thus it was the babylonian and median empires were united cambyses the son of cyrus subjugated egypt  cambyses went mad and was accidentally killed and was presently succeeded by darius the mede darius i the son of hystaspes one of the chief councillors of cyrus    113  illustration the ruins of persepolis  illustration the great porch of xerxes at persepolis    the persian empire of darius i the first of the new aryan empires in the seat of the old civilizations was the greatest empire the world had hitherto seen  it included all asia minor and syria all the old assyrian and babylonian empires egypt the caucasus and caspian regions media persia and it extended into india as far as the indus  such an empire was possible because the horse and rider and the chariot and the maderoad had now been brought into the world  hitherto the ass and ox and the camel for desert use had afforded the swiftest method of 114 transport  great arterial roads were made by the persian rulers to hold their new empire and post horses were always in waiting for the imperial messenger or the traveller with an official permit  moreover the world was now beginning to use coined money which greatly facilitated trade and intercourse  but the capital of this vast empire was no longer babylon  in the long run the priesthood of bel marduk gained nothing by their treason  babylon though still important was now a declining city and the great cities of the new empire were persepolis and susa and ecbatana  the capital was susa  nineveh was already abandoned and sinking into ruins     115  xxi  the early history of the jews   and now we can tell of the hebrews a semitic people not so important in their own time as in their influence upon the later history of the world  they were settled in judea long before 1000 bc and their capital city after that time was jerusalem  their story is interwoven with that of the great empires on either side of them egypt to the south and the changing empires of syria assyria and babylon to the north  their country was an inevitable high road between these latter powers and egypt  their importance in the world is due to the fact that they produced a written literature a world history a collection of laws chronicles psalms books of wisdom poetry and fiction and political utterances which became at last what christians know as the old testament the hebrew bible  this literature appears in history in the fourth or fifth century bc  probably this literature was first put together in babylon  we have already told how the pharaoh necho ii invaded the assyrian empire while assyria was fighting for life against medes persians and chaldeans  josiah king of judah opposed him and was defeated and slain at megiddo 608 bc  judah became a tributary to egypt and when nebuchadnezzar the great the new chaldean king in babylon rolled back necho into egypt he attempted to manage judah by setting up puppet kings in jerusalem  the experiment failed the people massacred his babylonian officials and he then determined to break up this little state altogether which had long been playing off egypt against the northern empire jerusalem was sacked and burnt and the remnant of the people was carried off captive to babylon  116  there they remained until cyrus took babylon 538 bc  he then collected them together and sent them back to resettle their country and rebuild the walls and temple of jerusalem  before that time the jews do not seem to have been a very civilized or united people  probably only a very few of them could read or write  in their own history one never hears of the early books of the bible being read the first mention of a book is in the time of josiah  the babylonian captivity civilized them and consolidated them  they returned aware of their own literature an acutely selfconscious and political people  their bible at that time seems to have consisted only of the pentateuch that is to say the first five books of the old testament as we know it  in addition as separate books they already had many of the other books that have since been incorporated with the pentateuch into the present hebrew bible chronicles the psalms and proverbs for example  the accounts of the creation of the world of adam and eve and of the flood with which the bible begins run closely parallel with similar babylonian legends they seem to have been part of the common beliefs of all the semitic peoples so too the stories of moses and of samson have sumerian and babylonian parallels  but with the story of abraham and onward begins something more special to the jewish race  abraham may have lived as early as the days of hammurabi in babylon  he was a patriarchal semitic nomad  to the book of genesis the reader must go for the story of his wanderings and for the stories of his sons and grandchildren and how they became captive in the land of egypt  he travelled through canaan and the god of abraham says the bible story promised this smiling land of prosperous cities to him and to his children  and after a long sojourn in egypt and after fifty years of wandering in the wilderness under the leadership of moses the children of abraham grown now to a host of twelve tribes invaded the land of canaan from the arabian deserts to the east  they may have done this somewhen between 1600 bc and 1300 bc there are no egyptian records of moses nor of canaan at this time to help out the story  but at any rate they did not succeed in conquering any 117 more than the hilly backgrounds of the promised land the coast was now in the hands not of the canaanites but of newcomers those Ægean peoples the philistines and their cities gaza gath ashdod ascalon and joppa successfully withstood the hebrew attack  for many generations the children of abraham remained an obscure people of the hilly back country engaged in incessant bickerings with the philistines and with the kindred tribes about them the moabites the midianites and so forth  the reader will find in the book of judges a record of their struggles and disasters during this period  for very largely it is a record of disasters and failures frankly told  map the land of the hebrews  118  for most of this period the hebrews were ruled so far as there was any rule among them by priestly judges selected by the elders of the people but at last somewhen towards 1000 bc they chose themselves a king saul to lead them in battle  but sauls leading was no great improvement upon the leading of the judges he perished under the hail of philistine arrows at the battle of mount gilboa his armour went into the temple of the philistine venus and his body was nailed to the walls of bethshan  illustration mound at babylon  his successor david was more successful and more politic  with david dawned the only period of prosperity the hebrew peoples were ever to know  it was based on a close alliance with the phoenician city of tyre whose king hiram seems to have been a man of very great intelligence and enterprise  he wished to secure a trade route to the red sea through the hebrew hill country normally phoenician trade went to the red sea by egypt but egypt was in a state of profound disorder at this 119 time there may have been other obstructions to phoenician trade along this line and at any rate hiram established the very closest relations both with david and with his son and successor solomon  under hirams auspices the walls palace and temple of jerusalem arose and in return hiram built and launched his ships on the red sea  a very considerable trade passed northward and southward through jerusalem  and solomon achieved a prosperity and magnificence unprecedented in the experience of his people  he was even given a daughter of pharaoh in marriage  but it is well to keep the proportion of things in mind  at the climax of his glories solomon was only a little subordinate king in a little city  his power was so transitory that within a few years of his death shishak the first pharaoh of the twentysecond dynasty had taken jerusalem and looted most of its splendours the account of solomons magnificence given in the books of kings and chronicles is questioned by many critics  they say that it was added to and exaggerated by the patriotic pride of later writers  but the bible account read carefully is not so overwhelming as it appears at the first reading  solomons temple if one works out the measurements would go inside a small suburban church and his fourteen hundred chariots cease to impress us when we learn from an assyrian monument that his successor ahab sent a contingent of two thousand to the assyrian army  it is also plainly manifest from the bible narrative that solomon spent himself in display and overtaxed and overworked his people  at his death the northern part of his kingdom broke off from jerusalem and became the independent kingdom of israel jerusalem remained the capital city of judah  the prosperity of the hebrew people was shortlived  hiram died and the help of tyre ceased to strengthen jerusalem  egypt grew strong again  the history of the kings of israel and the kings of judah becomes a history of two little states ground between first syria then assyria and then babylon to the north and egypt to the south  it is a tale of disasters and of deliverances that only delayed disaster  it is a tale of barbaric kings ruling a barbaric people in 721 bc the kingdom of israel was swept away into captivity by the assyrians and its people utterly lost to history  judah struggled 121 on until in 604 bc as we have told it shared the fate of israel  there may be details open to criticism in the bible story of hebrew history from the days of the judges onward but on the whole it is evidently a true story which squares with all that has been learnt in the excavation of egypt and assyria and babylon during the past century    120  illustration the ishtar gateway babylon    it was in babylon that the hebrew people got their history together and evolved their tradition  the people who came back to jerusalem at the command of cyrus were a very different people in spirit and knowledge from those who had gone into captivity  they had learnt civilization  in the development of their peculiar character a very great part was played by certain men a new sort of men the prophets to whom we must now direct our attention these prophets mark the appearance of new and remarkable forces in the steady development of human society     122  xxii  priests and prophets in judea   the fall of assyria and babylon were only the first of a series of disasters that were to happen to the semitic peoples  in the seventh century bc it would have seemed as though the whole civilized world was to be dominated by semitic rulers  they ruled the great assyrian empire and they had conquered egypt assyria babylon syria were all semitic speaking languages that were mutually intelligible  the trade of the world was in semitic hands  tyre sidon the great mother cities of the phoenician coast had thrown out colonies that grew at last to even greater proportion in spain sicily and africa  carthage founded before 800 bc had risen to a population of more than a million  it was for a time the greatest city on earth  its ships went to britain and out into the atlantic  they may have reached madeira we have already noted how hiram cooperated with solomon to build ships on the red sea for the arabian and perhaps for the indian trade  in the time of the pharaoh necho a phoenician expedition sailed completely round africa  at that time the aryan peoples were still barbarians  only the greeks were reconstructing a new civilization of the ruins of the one they had destroyed and the medes were becoming formidable as an assyrian inscription calls them in central asia  in 800 bc no one could have prophesied that before the third century bc every trace of semitic dominion would be wiped out by aryanspeaking conquerors and that everywhere the semitic peoples would be subjects or tributaries or scattered altogether everywhere except in the northern deserts of arabia where the bedouin adhered steadily to the nomadic way of life the ancient way of life of the semites before sargon i and his akkadians went down to conquer sumeria  but the arab bedouin were never conquered by aryan masters  123  now of all these civilized semites who were beaten and overrun in these five eventful centuries one people only held together and clung to its ancient traditions and that was this little people the jews who were sent back to build their city of jerusalem by cyrus the persian  and they were able to do this because they had got together this literature of theirs their bible in babylon  it is not so much the jews who made the bible as the bible which made the jews  running through this bible were certain ideas different from the ideas of the people about them very stimulating and sustaining ideas to which they were destined to cling through five and twenty centuries of hardship adventure and oppression  foremost of these jewish ideas was this that their god was invisible and remote an invisible god in a temple not made with hands a lord of righteousness throughout the earth  all other peoples had national gods embodied in images that lived in temples  if the image was smashed and the temple razed presently that god died out  but this was a new idea this god of the jews in the heavens high above priests and sacrifices  and this god of abraham the jews believed had chosen them to be his peculiar people to restore jerusalem and make it the capital of righteousness in the world  they were a people exalted by their sense of a common destiny  this belief saturated them all when they returned to jerusalem after the captivity in babylon  is it any miracle that in their days of overthrow and subjugation many babylonians and syrians and so forth and later on many phoenicians speaking practically the same language and having endless customs habits tastes and traditions in common should be attracted by this inspiring cult and should seek to share in its fellowship and its promise  after the fall of tyre sidon carthage and the spanish phoenician cities the phoenicians suddenly vanish from history and as suddenly we find not simply in jerusalem but in spain africa egypt arabia the east wherever the phoenicians had set their feet communities of jews and they were all held together by the bible and by the reading of the bible  jerusalem was from the first only their nominal capital their real city was this book of books  this is a new sort of thing in history  it is something of which the seeds were sown long before when the sumerians 124 and egyptians began to turn their hieroglyphics into writing  the jews were a new thing a people without a king and presently without a temple for as we shall tell jerusalem itself was broken up in 70 ad held together and consolidated out of heterogeneous elements by nothing but the power of the written word  and this mental welding of the jews was neither planned nor foreseen nor done by either priests or statesmen  not only a new kind of community but a new kind of man comes into history with the development of the jews  in the days of solomon the hebrews looked like becoming a little people just like any other little people of that time clustering around court and temple ruled by the wisdom of the priest and led by the ambition of the king  but already the reader may learn from the bible this new sort of man of which we speak the prophet was in evidence  as troubles thicken round the divided hebrews the importance of these prophets increases  illustration the black obelisk of shalmaneser ii  what were these prophets  they were men of the most diverse origins  the prophet ezekiel was of the priestly caste and the prophet amos wore the goatskin mantle of a shepherd but all had this in common that they gave allegiance to no one but to the god of righteousness and that they spoke directly to the people  they 125 came without licence or consecration  now the word of the lord came unto me that was the formula  they were intensely political  they exhorted the people against egypt that broken reed or against assyria or babylon they denounced the indolence of the priestly order or the flagrant sins of the king  some of them turned their attention to what we should now call social reform  the rich were grinding the faces of the poor the luxurious were consuming the childrens bread wealthy people made friends with and imitated the splendours and vices of foreigners and this was hateful to jehovah the god of abraham who would certainly punish this land  illustration another panel of the black obelisk  these fulminations were written down and preserved and studied they went wherever the jews went and wherever they went they spread a new religious spirit  they carried the common man past priest and temple past court and king and brought him face to face with the rule of righteousness  that is their supreme importance in the history of mankind  in the great utterances of isaiah the prophetic voice rises to a pitch of splendid anticipation and foreshadows the whole earth united and at peace under one god  therein the jewish prophecies culminate  all the prophets did not speak in this fashion and the intelligent reader of the prophetic books will find much hate in them much prejudice and much that will remind him of the propaganda pamphlets 126of the present time  nevertheless it is the hebrew prophets of the period round and about the babylonian captivity who mark the appearance of a new power in the world the power of individual moral appeal of an appeal to the free conscience of mankind against the fetish sacrifices and slavish loyalties that had hitherto bridled and harnessed our race     127  xxiii  the greeks   now while after solomon whose reign was probably about 960 bc the divided kingdoms of israel and judah were suffering destruction and deportation and while the jewish people were developing their tradition in captivity in babylon another great power over the human mind the greek tradition was also arising while the hebrew prophets were working out a new sense of direct moral responsibility between the people and an eternal and universal god of right the greek philosophers were training the human mind in a new method and spirit of intellectual adventure  the greek tribes as we have told were a branch of the aryanspeaking stem they had come down among the Ægean cities and islands some centuries before 1000 bc  they were probably already in southward movement before the pharaoh thothmes hunted his first elephants beyond the conquered euphrates  for in those days there were elephants in mesopotamia and lions in greece  it is possible that it was a greek raid that burnt cnossos but there are no greek legends of such a victory though there are stories of minos and his palace the labyrinth and of the skill of the cretan artificers    128  illustration statue of meleager    like most of the aryans these greeks had singers and reciters whose performances were an important social link and these handed down from the barbaric beginnings of their people two great epics the iliad telling how a league of greek tribes besieged and took and sacked the town of troy in asia minor and the odyssey being a long adventure story of the return of the sage captain odysseus from troy to his own island  these epics were written down somewhen in the eighth or seventh century bc when the greeks had acquired the use of an alphabet from their more civilized neighbours but they 129 are supposed to have been in existence very much earlier  formerly they were ascribed to a particular blind bard homer who was supposed to have sat down and composed them as milton composed paradise lost  whether there really was such a poet whether he composed or only wrote down and polished these epics and so forth is a favourite quarrelling ground for the erudite  we need not concern ourselves with such bickerings here  the thing that matters from our point of view is that the greeks were in possession of their epics in the eighth century bc and that they were a common possession and a link between their various tribes giving them a sense of fellowship as against the outer barbarians  they were a group of kindred peoples linked by the spoken and afterwards by the written word and sharing common ideals of courage and behaviour  the epics showed the greeks a barbaric people without iron without writing and still not living in cities  they seem to have lived at first in open villages of huts around the halls of their chiefs outside the ruins of the Ægean cities they had destroyed  then they began to wall their cities and to adopt the idea of temples from the people they had conquered  it has been said that the cities of the primitive civilizations grew up about the altar of some tribal god and that the wall was added in the cities of the greeks the wall preceded the temple  they began to trade and send out colonies  by the seventh century bc a new series of cities had grown up in the valleys and islands of greece forgetful of the Ægean cities and civilization that had preceded them athens sparta corinth thebes samos miletus among the chief  there were already greek settlements along the coast of the black sea and in italy and sicily  the heel and toe of italy was called magna græcia  marseilles was a greek town established on the site of an earlier phoenician colony  now countries which are great plains or which have as a chief means of transport some great river like the euphrates or nile tend to become united under some common rule  the cities of egypt and the cities of sumeria for example ran together under one system of government but the greek peoples were cut up among islands and mountain valleys both greece and magna græcia are very mountainous and the tendency was all the other way  when the 130 greeks come into history they are divided up into a number of little states which showed no signs of coalescence they are different even in race  some consist chiefly of citizens of this or that greek tribe ionic Æolian or doric some have a mingled population of greeks and descendants of the pregreek mediterranean folk some have an unmixed free citizenship of greeks lording it over an enslaved conquered population like the helots in sparta  in some the old leaderly aryan families have become a close aristocracy in some there is a democracy of all the aryan citizens in some there are elected or even hereditary kings in some usurpers or tyrants  illustration ruins of the great temple of zeus at olympia  and the same geographical conditions that kept the greek states divided and various kept them small  the largest states were smaller than many english counties and it is doubtful if the population of any of their cities ever exceeded a third of a million  few came up even to 50000  there were unions of interest and sympathy but no coalescences  cities made leagues and alliances as 131 trade increased and small cities put themselves under the protection of great ones  yet all greece was held together in a certain community of feeling by two things by the epics and by the custom of taking part every fourth year in the athletic contests at olympia  this did not prevent wars and feuds but it mitigated something of the savagery of war between them and a truce protected all travellers to and from the games as time went on the sentiment of a common heritage grew and the number of states participating in the olympic games increased until at last not only greeks but competitors from the closely kindred countries of epirus and macedonia to the north were admitted  the greek cities grew in trade and importance and the quality of their civilization rose steadily in the seventh and sixth centuries bc  their social life differed in many interesting points from the social life of the Ægean and river valley civilizations  they had splendid temples but the priesthood was not the great traditional body it was in the cities of the older world therepository of all knowledge the storehouse of ideas they had leaders and noble families but no quasidivine monarch surrounded by an elaborately organized court  rather their organization was aristocratic with leading families which kept each other in order  even their socalled democracies were aristocratic every citizen had a share in public affairs and came to the assembly in a democracy but everybody was not a citizen the greek democracies were not like our modern democracies in which everyone has a vote  many of the greek democracies had a few hundred or a few thousand citizens and then many thousands of slaves freedmen and so forth with no share in public affairs generally in greece affairs were in the hands of a community of substantial men  their kings and their tyrants alike were just men set in front of other men or usurping a leadership they were not quasidivine overmen like pharaoh or minos or the monarchs of mesopotamia  both thought and government therefore had a freedom under greek conditions such as they had known in none of the older civilizations  the greeks had brought down into cities the individualism the personal initiative of the wandering life of the northern parklands  they were the first republicans of importance in history  132  illustration the temple of neptune poseidon pÆstum sicily  and we find that as they emerge from a condition of barbaric warfare a new thing becomes apparent in their intellectual life we find men who are not priests seeking and recording knowledge and enquiring into the mysteries of life and being in a way that has hitherto been the sublime privilege of priesthood or the presumptuous amusement of kings  we find already in the sixth century bcperhaps while isaiah was still prophesying in babylonsuch men as thales and anaximander of miletus and heraclitus of ephesus who were what we should now call independent gentlemen giving their minds to shrewd questionings of the world in which we live asking what its real nature was whence it came and what its destiny might be and refusing all readymade or evasive answers  of these questionings of the universe by the greek mind we shall have more to say a little later in this history  these greek enquirers 133 who begin to be remarkable in the sixth century bc are the first philosophers the first wisdomlovers in the world  and it may be noted here how important a century this sixth century bc was in the history of humanity  for not only were these greek philosophers beginning the research for clear ideas about this universe and mans place in it and isaiah carrying jewish prophecy to its sublimest levels but as we shall tell later gautama buddha was then teaching in india and confucius and lao tse in china  from athens to the pacific the human mind was astir     134  xxiv  the wars of the greeks and persians   while the greeks in the cities in greece south italy and asia minor were embarking upon free intellectual enquiry and while in babylon and jerusalem the last of the hebrew prophets were creating a free conscience for mankind two adventurous aryan peoples the medes and the persians were in possession of the civilization of the ancient world and were making a great empire the persian empire which was far larger in extent than any empire the world had seen hitherto  under cyrus babylon and the rich and ancient civilization of lydia had been added to the persian rule the phoenician cities of the levant and all the greek cities in asia minor had been made tributary cambyses had subjected egypt and darius i the mede the third of the persian rulers 521 bc found himself monarch as it seemed of all the world his couriers rode with his decrees from the dardanelles to the indus and from upper egypt to central asia  the greeks in europe it is true italy carthage sicily and the spanish phoenician settlements were not under the persian peace but they treated it with respect and the only people who gave any serious trouble were the old parent hordes of nordic people in south russia and central asia the scythians who raided the northern and northeastern borders  of course the population of this great persian empire was not a population of persians the persians were only the small conquering minority of this enormous realm  the rest of the population was what it had been before the persians came from time immemorial only that persian was the administrative language trade and finance were still largely semitic tyre and sidon as of old were the great mediterranean ports and semitic shipping plied upon the seas  but many of these semitic merchants and business people as 135 they went from place to place already found a sympathetic and convenient common history in the hebrew tradition and the hebrew scriptures  a new element which was increasing rapidly in this empire was the greek element  the greeks were becoming serious rivals to the semites upon the sea and their detached and vigorous intelligence made them useful and unprejudiced officials  illustration fine piece of athenian pottery  it was on account of the scythians that darius i invaded europe he wanted to reach south russia the homeland of the scythian horsemen  he crossed the bosphorus with a great army and marched through bulgaria to the danube crossed this by a bridge of boats and pushed far northward  his army suffered terribly  it was largely an infantry force and the mounted scythians rode all round it cut off its supplies destroyed any stragglers and never came to a pitched battle  darius was forced into an inglorious retreat  he returned himself to susa but he left an army in thrace and macedonia and macedonia submitted to darius  insurrections of the greek cities in asia followed this failure and the european greeks were drawn into the contest  darius resolved upon the subjugation of the greeks in europe  with the phoenician fleet at his disposal he was able to subdue one island after another and finally in 490 bc he made his main attack upon athens  a considerable armada sailed from the ports of asia minor and the eastern mediterranean and the expedition landed its troops at marathon to the north of athens  there they were met and signally defeated by the athenians  136  an extraordinary thing happened at this time  the bitterest rival of athens in greece was sparta but now athens appealed to sparta sending a herald a swift runner imploring the spartans not to let greeks become slaves to barbarians  this runner the prototype of all marathon runners did over a hundred miles of broken country in less than two days  the spartans responded promptly and generously but when in three days the spartan force reached athens there was nothing for it to do but to view the battlefield and the bodies of the defeated persian soldiers the persian fleet had returned to asia  so ended the first persian attack on greece  the next was much more impressive  darius died soon after the news of his defeat at marathon reached him and for four years his son and successor xerxes prepared a host to crush the greeks for a time terror united all the greeks  the army of xerxes was certainly the greatest that had hitherto been assembled in the world  it was a huge assembly of discordant elements  it crossed the dardanelles 480 bc by a bridge of boats and along the coast as it advanced moved an equally miscellaneous fleet carrying supplies  at the narrow pass of thermopylæ a small force of 1400 men under the spartan leonidas resisted this multitude and after a fight of unsurpassed heroism was completely destroyed  every man was killed  but the losses they inflicted upon the persians were enormous and the army of xerxes pushed on to thebes and athens in a chastened mood  thebes surrendered and made terms the athenians abandoned their city and it was burnt    137  illustration all that remains of the great temple of corinth    greece seemed in the hands of the conqueror but again came victory against the odds and all expectations  the greek fleet though not a third the size of the persian assailed it in the bay of salamis and destroyed it  xerxes found himself and his immense army cut off from supplies and his heart failed him  he retreated to asia with one half of his army leaving the rest to be defeated at platea 479 bc what time the remnants of the persian fleet were hunted down by the greeks and destroyed at mycalæ in asia minor  the persian danger was at an end  most of the greek cities in asia became free  all this is told in great detail and with much picturesqueness in the first of written histories the history of 138 herodotus  this herodotus was born about 484 bc in the ionian city of halicarnassus in asia minor and he visited babylon and egypt in his search for exact particulars  from mycalæ onward persia sank into a confusion of dynastic troubles  xerxes was murdered in 465 bc and rebellions in egypt syria and media broke up the brief order of that mighty realm  the history of herodotus lays stress on the weakness of persia  this history is indeed what we should now call propagandapropaganda for greece to unite and conquer persia  herodotus makes one character aristagoras go to the spartans with a map of the known world and say to them these barbarians are not valiant in fight  you on the other hand have now attained the utmost skill in war  no other nations in the world have what they possess gold silver bronze embroidered garments beasts and slaves  all this you might have for yourselves if you so desired  illustration the temple of neptune poseidon at cape sunium     139  xxv  the splendour of greece   the century and a half that followed the defeat of persia was one of very great splendour for the greek civilization  true that greece was torn by a desperate struggle for ascendancy between athens sparta and other states the peloponnesian war 431 to 404 bc and that in 338 bc the macedonians became virtually masters of greece nevertheless during this period the thought and the creative and artistic impulse of the greeks rose to levels that made their achievement a lamp to mankind for all the rest of history  the head and centre of this mental activity was athens  for over thirty years 466 to 428 bc athens was dominated by a man of great vigour and liberality of mind pericles who set himself to rebuild the city from the ashes to which the persians had reduced it the beautiful ruins that still glorify athens today are chiefly the remains of this great effort  and he did not simply rebuild a material athens  he rebuilt athens intellectually  he gathered about him not only architects and sculptors but poets dramatists philosophers and teachers  herodotus came to athens to recite his history 438 bc anaxagoras came with the beginnings of a scientific description of the sun and stars Æschylus sophocles and euripides one after the other carried the greek drama to its highest levels or beauty and nobility  the impetus pericles gave to the intellectual life of athens lived on after his death and in spite of the fact that the peace of greece was now broken by the peloponnesian war and a long and wasteful struggle for ascendancy was beginning  indeed the darkling of the political horizon seems for a time to have quickened rather than discouraged mens minds  already long before the time of pericles the peculiar freedom of greek institutions had given great importance to skill in discussion  140 decision rested neither with king nor with priest but in the assemblies of the people or of leading men eloquence and able argument became very desirable accomplishments therefore and a class of teachers arose the sophists who undertook to strengthen young men in these arts  but one cannot reason without matter and knowledge followed in the wake of speech  the activities and rivalries of these sophists led very naturally to an acute examination of style of methods of thought and of the validity of arguments  when pericles died a certain socrates was becoming prominent as an able and destructive critic of bad argumentand much of the teaching of the sophists was bad argument  a group of brilliant young men gathered about socrates in the end socrates was executed for disturbing peoples minds 399 bc he was condemned after the dignified fashion of the athens of those days to drink in his own house and among his own friends a poisonous draught made from hemlock but the disturbance of peoples minds went on in spite of his condemnation his young men carried on his teaching  illustration part of the famous frieze of the parthenon athens    141  illustration the acropolis athens  illustration the theatre at epidauros greece    chief among these young men was plato 427 to 347 bc who presently began to teach philosophy in the grove of the academy his teaching fell into two main divisions an examination of the foundations and methods of human thinking and an examination of political institutions  he was the first man to write a utopia that is to say the plan of a community different from and better than any 142 existing community  this shows an altogether unprecedented boldness in the human mind which had hitherto accepted social traditions and usages with scarcely a question plato said plainly to mankind most of the social and political ills from which you suffer are under your control given only the will and courage to change them  you can live in another and a wiser fashion if you choose to think it out and work it out  you are not awake to your own power  that is a high adventurous teaching that has still to soak in to the common intelligence of our race  one of his earliest works was the republic a dream of a communist aristocracy his last unfinished work was the laws a scheme of regulation for another such utopian state  illustration the caryatides of the erechtheum  the criticism of methods of thinking and methods of government was carried on after platos death by aristotle who had been his pupil and who taught in the lyceum  aristotle came from the city of stagira in macedonia and his father was court physician to the macedonian king  for a time aristotle was tutor to alexander 144 the kings son who was destined to achieve very great things of which we shall soon be telling  aristotles work upon methods of thinking carried the science of logic to a level at which it remained for fifteen hundred years or more until the mediæval schoolmen took up the ancient questions again  he made no utopias  before man could really control his destiny as plato taught aristotle perceived that he needed far more knowledge and far more accurate knowledge than he possessed  and so aristotle began that systematic collection of knowledge which nowadays we call science  he sent out explorers to collect facts  he was the father of natural history  he was the founder of political science  his students at the lyceum examined and compared the constitutions of 158 different states   143  illustration athene of the parthenon  here in the fourth century bc we find men who are practically modern thinkers  the childlike dreamlike methods of primitive thought had given way to a disciplined and critical attack upon the problems of life  the weird and monstrous symbolism and imagery of the gods and god monsters and all the taboos and awes and restraints that have hitherto encumbered thinking are here completely set aside  free exact and systematic thinking has begun  the fresh and unencumbered mind of these newcomers out of the northern forests has thrust itself into the mysteries of the temple and let the daylight in     145  xxvi  the empire of alexander the great   from 431 to 404 bc the peloponnesian war wasted greece meanwhile to the north of greece the kindred country of macedonia was rising slowly to power and civilization  the macedonians spoke a language closely akin to greek and on several occasions macedonian competitors had taken part in the olympic games  in 359 bc a man of very great abilities and ambition became king of this little countryphilip  philip had previously been a hostage in greece he had had a thoroughly greek education and he was probably aware of the ideas of herodotuswhich had also been developed by the philosopher isocratesof a possible conquest of asia by a consolidated greece  he set himself first to extend and organize his own realm and to remodel his army  for a thousand years now the charging horsechariot had been the decisive factor in battles that and the closefighting infantry  mounted horsemen had also fought but as a cloud of skirmishers individually and without discipline  philip made his infantry fight in a closely packed mass the macedonian phalanx and he trained his mounted gentlemen the knights or companions to fight in formation and so invented cavalry  the master move in most of his battles and in the battles of his son alexander was a cavalry charge  the phalanx held the enemy infantry in front while the cavalry swept away the enemy horse on his wings and poured in on the flank and rear of his infantry  chariots were disabled by bowmen who shot the horses  with this new army philip extended his frontiers through thessaly to greece and the battle of chæronia 338 bc fought against athens and her allies put all greece at his feet  at last the dream of herodotus was bearing fruit  a congress of all the greek states appointed philip captaingeneral of the græcomacedonian confederacy 146 against persia and in 336 bc his advanced guard crossed into asia upon this long premeditated adventure but he never followed it  he was assassinated it is believed at the instigation of his queen olympias alexanders mother  she was jealous because philip had married a second wife  but philip had taken unusual pains with his sons education  he had not only secured aristotle the greatest philosopher in the world as this boys tutor but he had shared his ideas with him and thrust military experience upon him  at chæronia alexander who was then only eighteen years old had been in command of the cavalry  and so it was possible for this young man who was still only twenty years old at the time of his accession to take up his fathers task at once and to proceed successfully with the persian adventure  illustration bust of alexander the great  in 334 bcfor two years were needed to establish and confirm his position in macedonia and greecehe crossed into asia defeated a not very much bigger persian army at the battle of the granicus and captured a number of cities in asia minor  he kept along the seacoast  it was necessary for him to reduce and garrison all the coast towns as he advanced because the persians had control of the fleets of tyre and sidon and so had command of the sea  147 had he left a hostile port in his rear the persians might have landed forces to raid his communications and cut him off at  issus 333 bc he met and smashed a vast conglomerate host under darius iii  like the host of xerxes that had crossed the dardanelles a century and a half before it was an incoherent accumulation of contingents and it was encumbered with a multitude of court officials the harem of darius and many camp followers  sidon surrendered to alexander but tyre resisted obstinately  finally that great city was stormed and plundered and destroyed  gaza also was stormed and towards the end of 332 bc the conqueror entered egypt and took over its rule from the persians  illustration alexanders victory over the persians at issus  at alexandretta and at alexandria in egypt he built great cities accessible from the land and so incapable of revolt  to these the trade of the phoenician cities was diverted  the phoenicians of the western mediterranean suddenly disappear from historyand as immediately the jews of alexandria and the other new trading cities created by alexander appear  in 331 bc alexander marched out of egypt upon babylon as thothmes and rameses and necho had done before him  but he marched by way of tyre  at arbela near the ruins of nineveh 148 which was already a forgotten city he met darius and fought the decisive battle of the war  the persian chariot charge failed a macedonian cavalry charge broke up the great composite host and the phalanx completed the victory  darius led the retreat  he made no further attempt to resist the invader but fled northward into the country of the medes  alexander marched on to babylon still prosperous and important and then to susa and persepolis  there after a drunken festival he burnt down the palace of darius the king of kings  illustration the apollo belvedere  thence alexander presently made a military parade of central asia going to the utmost bounds of the persian empire  at first he turned northward  darius was pursued and he was overtaken at dawn dying in his chariot having been murdered by his own people he was still living when the foremost greeks reached him alexander came up to find him dead  alexander skirted the caspian sea he went up into the mountains of western turkestan he came down by herat which he founded and cabul and the khyber pass into 149 india  he fought a great battle on the indus with an indian king porus and here the macedonian troops met elephants for the first time and defeated them  finally he built himself ships sailed down to the mouth of the indus and marched back by the coast of beluchistan reaching susa again in 324 bc after an absence of six years  he then prepared to consolidate and organize this vast empire he had won  he sought to win over his new subjects  he assumed the robes and tiara of a persian monarch and this roused the jealousy of his macedonian commanders  he had much trouble with them  he arranged a number of marriages between these macedonian officers and persian and babylonian women the marriage of the east and west  he never lived to effect the consolidation he had planned  a fever seized him after a drinking bout in babylon and he died in 323 bc  immediately this vast dominion fell to pieces  one of his generals seleucus retained most of the old persian empire from the indus to ephesus another ptolemy seized egypt and antigonus secured macedonia  the rest of the empire remained unstable passing under the control of a succession of local adventurers  barbarian raids began from the north and grew in scope and intensity  until at last as we shall tell a new power the power of the roman republic came out of the west to subjugate one fragment after another and weld them together into a new and more enduring empire     150  xxvii  the museum and library at alexandria   before the time of alexander greeks had already been spreading as merchants artists officials mercenary soldiers over most of the persian dominions  in the dynastic disputes that followed the death of xerxes a band of ten thousand greek mercenaries played a part under the leadership of xenophon  their return to asiatic greece from babylon is described in his retreat of the ten thousand one of the first war stories that was ever written by a general in command  but the conquests of alexander and the division of his brief empire among his subordinate generals greatly stimulated this permeation of the ancient world by the greeks and their language and fashions and culture  traces of this greek dissemination are to be found far away in central asia and in northwest india  their influence upon the development of indian art was profound  for many centuries athens retained her prestige as a centre of art and culture her schools went on indeed to 529 ad that is to say for nearly a thousand years but the leadership in the intellectual activity of the world passed presently across the mediterranean to alexandria the new trading city that alexander had founded  here the macedonian general ptolemy had become pharaoh with a court that spoke greek  he had become an intimate of alexander before he became king and he was deeply saturated with the ideas of aristotle  he set himself with great energy and capacity to organize knowledge and investigation  he also wrote a history of alexanders campaigns which unhappily is lost to the world  alexander had already devoted considerable sums to finance the enquiries of aristotle but ptolemy i was the first person to make a permanent endowment of science  he set up a foundation in alexandria which was formerly dedicated to the muses the museum 151 of alexandria  for two or three generations the scientific work done at alexandria was extraordinarily good  euclid eratosthenes who measured the size of the earth and came within fifty miles of its true diameter apollonius who wrote on conic sections hipparchus who made the first star map and catalogue and hero who devised the first steam engine are among the greater stars of an extraordinary constellation of scientific pioneers archimedes came from syracuse to alexandria to study and was a frequent correspondent of the museum  herophilus was one of the greatest of greek anatomists and is said to have practised vivisection  for a generation or so during the reigns of ptolemy i and ptolemy ii there was such a blaze of knowledge and discovery at alexandria as the world was not to see again until the sixteenth century ad but it did not continue  there may have been several causes of this decline  chief among them the late professor mahaffy suggested was the fact that the museum was a royal college and all its professors and fellows were appointed and paid by pharaoh this was all very well when pharaoh was ptolemy i the pupil and friend of aristotle  but as the dynasty of the ptolemies went on they became egyptianized they fell under the sway of egyptian priests and egyptian religious developments they ceased to follow the work that was done and their control stifled the spirit of enquiry altogether  the museum produced little good work after its first century of activity  ptolemy i not only sought in the most modern spirit to organize the finding of fresh knowledge  he tried also to set up an encyclopædic storehouse of wisdom in the library of alexandria it was not simply a storehouse it was also a bookcopying and bookselling organization  a great army of copyists was set to work perpetually multiplying copies of books  here then we have the definite first opening up of the intellectual process in which we live today here we have the systematic gathering and distribution of knowledge  the foundation of this museum and library marks one of the great epochs in the history of mankind  it is the true beginning of modern history  152  illustration aristotle  both the work of research and the work of dissemination went on under serious handicaps  one of these was the great social gap that separated the philosopher who was a gentleman from the trader and the artisan  there were glass workers and metal workers in abundance in those days but they were not in mental contact with the thinkers  the glass worker was making the most beautifully coloured beads and phials and so forth but he never made a florentine flask or a lens  clear glass does not seem to have interested him  the metal worker made weapons and jewellery but he never made a chemical balance  the philosopher speculated loftily about atoms and the nature of things but he had no practical experience of enamels and pigments and philters and so forth  he was not interested in substances  so alexandria in its brief day of opportunity produced no microscopes and no chemistry  and though hero invented a steam engine it was never set either to pump or drive a boat or do any useful thing  there were few practical applications of science except in the realm of medicine and the progress of science was not stimulated and sustained by the interest and excitement of practical applications  there was nothing to keep the work going therefore when the intellectual curiosity of ptolemy i and ptolemy ii 153 was withdrawn  the discoveries of the museum went on record in obscure manuscripts and never until the revival of scientific curiosity at the renascence reached out to the mass of mankind  illustration statuette of maitreya the buddha to come  nor did the library produce any improvements in book making  that ancient world had no paper made in definite sizes from rag pulp paper was a chinese invention and it did not reach the western world until the ninth century ad  the only book materials were parchment and strips of the papyrus reed joined edge to edge these strips were kept on rolls which were very unwieldy to wind to and fro and read and very inconvenient for reference  it was these things that prevented the development of paged and printed books  printing itself was known in the world it would seem as early as the old stone age there were seals in ancient sumeria but without abundant paper there was little advantage in printing books an improvement that may further have been resisted by trades unionism on the part of the copyists employed  alexandria produced abundant books but not cheap books and it never spread knowledge into the population of the ancient world below the level of a wealthy and influential class  so it was that this blaze of intellectual enterprise never reached beyond a small circle of people in touch with the group of philosophers collected by the first two ptolemies  it was like the light in a dark lantern which is shut off from the world at large  within the blaze may be blindingly bright but nevertheless it is unseen  the rest of the world went on its old ways unaware that the seed of scientific knowledge that was one day to revolutionize it altogether had been sown  presently a darkness of bigotry fell even upon 154 alexandria thereafter for a thousand years of darkness the seed that aristotle had sown lay hidden  then it stirred and began to germinate  in a few centuries it had become that widespread growth of knowledge and clear ideas that is now changing the whole of human life  illustration the death of buddha  alexandria was not the only centre of greek intellectual activity in the third century bc  there were many other cities that displayed a brilliant intellectual life amidst the disintegrating fragments of the brief empire of alexander  there was for example the greek city of syracuse in sicily where thought and science flourished for two centuries there was pergamum in asia minor which also had a great library  but this brilliant hellenic world was now stricken by invasion from the north  new nordic barbarians the gauls were striking down along the tracks that had once been followed by the ancestors of the greeks and phrygians and macedonians  they raided shattered and destroyed and in the wake of the gauls came a new conquering people out of italy the romans who gradually subjugated all the western half of the vast realm of darius and alexander  they were an able but unimaginative people preferring law and profit to either science or art  155 new invaders were also coming down out of central asia to shatter and subdue the seleucid empire and to cut off the western world again from india  these were the parthians hosts of mounted bowmen who treated the græcopersian empire of persepolis and susa in the third century bc in much the same fashion that the medes and persians had treated it in the seventh and sixth  and there were now other nomadic peoples also coming out of the northeast peoples who were not fair and nordic and aryanspeaking but yellowskinned and blackhaired and with a mongolian speech  but of these latter people we shall tell more in a subsequent chapter     156  xxviii  the life of gautama buddha   but now we must go back three centuries in our story to tell of a great teacher who came near to revolutionizing the religious thought and feeling of all asia  this was gautama buddha who taught his disciples at benares in india about the same time that isaiah was prophesying among the jews in babylon and heraclitus was carrying on his speculative enquiries into the nature of things at ephesus  all these men were in the world at the same time in the sixth century bcunaware of one another  this sixth century bc was indeed one of the most remarkable in all history  everywherefor as we shall tell it was also the case in chinamens minds were displaying a new boldness everywhere they were waking up out of the traditions of kingships and priests and blood sacrifices and asking the most penetrating questions  it is as if the race had reached a stage of adolescenceafter a childhood of twenty thousand years  the early history of india is still very obscure  somewhen perhaps about 2000 bc an aryanspeaking people came down from the northwest into india either in one invasion or in a series of invasions and was able to spread its language and traditions over most of north india  its peculiar variety of aryan speech was the sanskrit  they found a brunette people with a more elaborate civilization and less vigour of will in possession of the country of the indus and ganges  but they do not seem to have mingled with their predecessors as freely as did the greeks and persians they remained aloof  when the past of india becomes dimly visible to the historian indian society is already stratified into several layers with a variable number of subdivisions which do not eat together nor intermarry nor associate freely  and throughout history this 157 stratification into castes continues  this makes the indian population something different from the simple freely interbreeding european or mongolian communities  it is really a community of communities  siddhattha gautama was the son of an aristocratic family which ruled a small district on the himalayan slopes  he was married at nineteen to a beautiful cousin  he hunted and played and went about in his sunny world of gardens and groves and irrigated ricefields  and it was amidst this life that a great discontent fell upon him  it was the unhappiness of a fine brain that seeks employment  he felt that the existence he was leading was not the reality of life but a holidaya holiday that had gone on too long  the sense of disease and mortality the insecurity and the unsatisfactoriness of all happiness descended upon the mind of gautama  while he was in this mood he met one of those wandering ascetics who already existed in great numbers in india  these men lived under severe rules spending much time in meditation and in religious discussion  they were supposed to be seeking some deeper reality in life and a passionate desire to do likewise took possession of gautama  he was meditating upon this project says the story when the news was brought to him that his wife had been delivered of his firstborn son this is another tie to break said gautama  he returned to the village amidst the rejoicings of his fellow clansmen  there was a great feast and a nautch dance to celebrate the birth of this new tie and in the night gautama awoke in a great agony of spirit like a man who is told that his house is on fire  he resolved to leave his happy aimless life forthwith he went softly to the threshold of his wifes chamber and saw her by the light of a little oil lamp sleeping sweetly surrounded by flowers with his infant son in her arms  he felt a great craving to take up the child in one first and last embrace before he departed but the fear of waking his wife prevented him and at last he turned away and went out into the bright indian moonshine and mounted his horse and rode off into the world  158  illustration tibetan buddha  very far he rode that night and in the morning he stopped outside 159 the lands of his clan and dismounted beside a sandy river there he cut off his flowing locks with his sword removed all his ornaments and sent them and his horse and sword back to his house going on he presently met a ragged man and exchanged clothes with him and so having divested himself of all worldly entanglements he was free to pursue his search after wisdom  he made his way southward to a resort of hermits and teachers in a hilly spur of the vindhya mountains  there lived a number of wise men in a warren of caves going into the town for their simple supplies and imparting their knowledge by word of mouth to such as cared to come to them  gautama became versed in all the metaphysics of his age  but his acute intelligence was dissatisfied with the solutions offered him  illustration a burmese buddha  the indian mind has always been disposed to believe that power and knowledge may be obtained by extreme asceticism by fasting sleeplessness and selftorment and these ideas gautama now put to the test  he betook himself with five disciple companions to the jungle and there he gave himself up to fasting and terrible penances  his fame spread like the sound of a great 160 bell hung in the canopy of the skies  but it brought him no sense of truth achieved  one day he was walking up and down trying to think in spite of his enfeebled state  suddenly he fell unconscious  when he recovered the preposterousness of these semimagical ways to wisdom was plain to him  illustration the dhamÊkh tower  he horrified his companions by demanding ordinary food and refusing to continue his mortifications  he had realized that whatever truth a man may reach is reached best by a nourished brain in a healthy body  such a conception was absolutely foreign to the ideas of the land and age  his disciples deserted him and went off in a melancholy state to benares  gautama wandered alone  when the mind grapples with a great and intricate problem it makes its advances step by step with but little realization of the gains it has made until suddenly with an effect of abrupt illumination it realizes its victory  so it happened to gautama he had seated himself under a great tree by the side of a river to eat when this sense of clear vision came to him  it seemed to him that he saw life plain  he is said to have sat all day and all night in profound thought and then he rose up to impart his vision to the world  he went on to benares and there he sought out and won back his lost disciples to his new teaching  in the kings deer park at benares they built themselves huts and set up a sort of school to which came many who were seeking after wisdom  the starting point of his teaching was his own question as a fortunate 161 young man why am i not completely happy  it was an introspective question  it was a question very different in quality from the frank and selfforgetful externalized curiosity with which thales and heraclitus were attacking the problems of the universe or the equally selfforgetful burthen of moral obligation that the culminating prophets were imposing upon the hebrew mind  the indian teacher did not forget self he concentrated upon self and sought to destroy it  all suffering he taught was due to the greedy desires of the individual  until man has conquered his personal cravings his life is trouble and his end sorrow  there were three principal forms that the craving for life took and they were all evil  the first was the desire of the appetites greed and all forms of sensuousness the second was the desire for a personal and egotistic immortality the third was the craving for personal success worldliness avarice and the like  all these forms of desire had to be overcome to escape from the distresses and chagrins of life  when they were overcome when self had vanished altogether then serenity of soul nirvana the highest good was attained  this was the gist of his teaching a very subtle and metaphysical teaching indeed not nearly so easy to understand as the greek injunction to see and know fearlessly and rightly and the hebrew command to fear god and accomplish righteousness  it was a teaching much beyond the understanding of even gautamas immediate disciples and it is no wonder that so soon as his personal influence was withdrawn it became corrupted and coarsened  there was a widespread belief in india at that time that at long intervals wisdom came to earth and was incarnate in some chosen person who was known as the buddha  gautamas disciples declared that he was a buddha the latest of the buddhas though there is no evidence that he himself ever accepted the title  before he was well dead a cycle of fantastic legends began to be woven about him  the human heart has always preferred a wonder story to a moral effort and gautama buddha became very wonderful  yet there remained a substantial gain in the world  if nirvana was too high and subtle for most mens imaginations if the mythmaking impulse in the race was too strong for the simple facts of gautamas life they could at least grasp something of the intention 162 of what gautama called the eightfold way the aryan or noble path in life  in this there was an insistence upon mental uprightness upon right aims and speech right conduct and honest livelihood  there was a quickening of the conscience and an appeal to generous and selfforgetful ends     163  xxix  king asoka   for some generations after the death of gautama these high and noble buddhist teachings this first plain teaching that the highest good for man is the subjugation of self made comparatively little headway in the world  then they conquered the imagination of one of the greatest monarchs the world has ever seen  we have already mentioned how alexander the great came down into india and fought with porus upon the indus  it is related by the greek historians that a certain chandragupta maurya came into alexanders camp and tried to persuade him to go on to the ganges and conquer all india  alexander could not do this because of the refusal of his macedonians to go further into what was for them an unknown world and later on 303 bc chandragupta was able to secure the help or various hill tribes and realize his dream without greek help  he built up an empire in north india and was presently 303 bc able to attack seleucus i in the punjab and drive the last vestige of greek power out of india  his son extended this new empire  his grandson asoka the monarch of whom we now have to tell found himself in 264 bc ruling from afghanistan to madras  asoka was at first disposed to follow the example of his father and grandfather and complete the conquest of the indian peninsula he invaded kalinga 255 bc a country on the east coast of madras he was successful in his military operations andalone among conquerorshe was so disgusted by the cruelty and horror of war that he renounced it  he would have no more of it  he adopted the peaceful doctrines of buddhism and declared that henceforth his conquests should be the conquests of religion  164  illustration a lohan or buddhist apostle tang dynasty  his reign for eightandtwenty years was one of the brightest interludes in the troubled history of mankind  he organized a great digging of wells in india and the planting of trees for shade  he founded hospitals and public gardens and gardens for the growing of medicinal herbs  he created a ministry for the care of the aborigines and subject races of india  he made provision for the education of women  he made vast benefactions to the buddhist teaching orders and tried to stimulate them to a better and more energetic criticism of their own accumulated literature  for corruptions and superstitious accretions had accumulated very 165 speedily upon the pure and simple teaching of the great indian master  missionaries went from asoka to kashmir to persia to ceylon and alexandria  illustration transome showing the court of asoka  illustration asoka panel from bharhut  such was asoka greatest of kings  he was far in advance of his age  he left no prince and no organization of men to carry on his work and within a century of his death the great days of his reign had become a glorious memory in a shattered and decaying india  the priestly caste of the brahmins the highest and most privileged caste in the indian social body has always been opposed to the frank and open teaching of buddha  gradually they undermined the buddhist influence in the land  the old monstrous gods the innumerable cults of hinduism resumed their sway caste became 166 more rigorous and complicated  for long centuries buddhism and brahminism flourished side by side and then slowly buddhism decayed and brahminism in a multitude of forms replaced it  but beyond the confines of india and the realms of caste buddhism spreaduntil it had won china and siam and burma and japan countries in which it is predominant to this day  illustration the pillar of lions     167  xxx  confucius and lao tse   we have still to tell of two other great men confucius and lao tse who lived in that wonderful century which began the adolescence of mankind the sixth century bc  in this history thus far we have told very little of the early story of china  at present that early history is still very obscure and we look to chinese explorers and archæolologists in the new china that is now arising to work out their past as thoroughly as the european past has been worked out during the last century  very long ago the first primitive chinese civilizations arose in the great river valleys out of the primordial heliolithic culture  they had like egypt and sumeria the general characteristics of that culture and they centred upon temples in which priests and priest kings offered the seasonal blood sacrifices  the life in those cities must have been very like the egyptian and sumerian life of six or seven thousand years ago and very like the maya life of central america a thousand years ago  if there were human sacrifices they had long given way to animal sacrifices before the dawn of history  and a form of picture writing was growing up long before a thousand years bc  and just as the primitive civilizations of europe and western asia were in conflict with the nomads of the desert and the nomads of the north so the primitive chinese civilizations had a great cloud of nomadic peoples on their northern borders  there was a number of tribes akin in language and ways of living who are spoken of in history in succession as the huns the mongols the turks and tartars  they changed and divided and combined and recombined just as the nordic peoples in north europe and central asia changed and varied in name rather than in nature  these mongolian nomads had horses earlier than the nordic peoples and it may 168 be that in the region of the altai mountains they made an independent discovery of iron somewhen after 1000 bc and just as in the western case so ever and again these eastern nomads would achieve a sort of political unity and become the conquerors and masters and revivers of this or that settled and civilized region  it is quite possible that the earliest civilization of china was not mongolian at all any more than the earliest civilization of europe and western asia was nordic or semitic  it is quite possible that the earliest civilization of china was a brunette civilization and of a piece with the earliest egyptian sumerian and dravidian civilizations and that when the first recorded history of china began there had already been conquests and intermixture  at any rate we find that by 1750 bc china was already a vast system of little kingdoms and city states all acknowledging a loose allegiance and paying more or less regularly more or less definite feudal dues to one great priest emperor the son of heaven  the shang dynasty came to an end in 1125 bc  a chow dynasty succeeded shang and maintained china in a relaxing unity until the days of asoka in india and of the ptolemies in egypt  gradually china went to pieces during that long chow period  hunnish peoples came down and set up principalities local rulers discontinued their tribute and became independent  there was in the sixth century bc says one chinese authority five or six thousand practically independent states in china  it was what the chinese call in their records an age of confusion  but this age of confusion was compatible with much intellectual activity and with the existence of many local centres of art and civilized living  when we know more of chinese history we shall find that china also had her miletus and her athens her pergamum and her macedonia  at present we must be vague and brief about this period of chinese division simply because our knowledge is not sufficient for us to frame a coherent and consecutive story    169  illustration confucius    and just as in divided greece there were philosophers and in shattered and captive jewry prophets so in disordered china there were philosophers and teachers at this time  in all these cases 170 insecurity and uncertainty seemed to have quickened the better sort of mind  confucius was a man of aristocratic origin and some official importance in a small state called lu  here in a very parallel mood to the greek impulse he set up a sort of academy for discovering and teaching wisdom  the lawlessness and disorder of china distressed him profoundly  he conceived an ideal of a better government and a better life and travelled from state to state seeking a prince who would carry out his legislative and educational ideas  he never found his prince he found a prince but court intrigues undermined the influence of the teacher and finally defeated his reforming proposals  it is interesting to note that a century and a half later the greek philosopher plato also sought a prince and was for a time adviser to the tyrant dionysius who ruled syracuse in sicily  confucius died a disappointed man  no intelligent ruler arises to take me as his master he said and my time has come to die but his teaching had more vitality than he imagined in his declining and hopeless years and it became a great formative influence with the chinese people  it became one of what the chinese call the three teachings the other two being those of buddha and of lao tse  the gist of the teaching of confucius was the way of the noble or aristocratic man  he was concerned with personal conduct as much as gautama was concerned with the peace of selfforgetfulness and the greek with external knowledge and the jew with righteousness he was the most publicminded of all great teachers  he was supremely concerned by the confusion and miseries of the world and he wanted to make men noble in order to bring about a noble world  he sought to regulate conduct to an extraordinary extent to provide sound rules for every occasion in life  a polite publicspirited gentleman rather sternly selfdisciplined was the ideal he found already developing in the northern chinese world and one to which he gave a permanent form    171  illustration the great wall of china   the teaching of lao tse who was for a long time in charge of the imperial library of the chow dynasty was much more mystical and vague and elusive than that of confucius  he seems to have preached a stoical indifference to the pleasures and powers of 172 the world and a return to an imaginary simple life of the past  he left writings very contracted in style and very obscure he wrote in riddles  after his death his teachings like the teachings of gautama buddha were corrupted and overlaid by legends and had the most complex and extraordinary observances and superstitious ideas grafted upon them  in china just as in india primordial ideas of magic and monstrous legends out of the childish past of our race struggled against the new thinking in the world and succeeded in plastering it over with grotesque irrational and antiquated observances  both buddhism and taoism which ascribes itself largely to lao tse as one finds them in china now are religions of monk temple priest and offering of a type as ancient in form if not in thought as the sacrificial religions of ancient sumeria and egypt  but the teaching 173 of confucius was not so overlaid because it was limited and plain and straightforward and lent itself to no such distortions  illustration early chinese bronze bell  north china the china of the hwangho river became confucian in thought and spirit south china yangtsekiang china became taoist  since those days a conflict has always been traceable in chinese affairs between these two spirits the spirit of the north and the spirit of the south between in latter times pekin and nankin between the officialminded upright and conservative north and the sceptical artistic lax and experimental south  the divisions of china of the age of confusion reached their worst stage in the sixth century bc  the chow dynasty was so enfeebled and so discredited that lao tse left the unhappy court and retired into private life  three nominally subordinate powers dominated the situation in those days tsi and tsin both northern powers and chu which was an aggressive military power in the yangtse valley  at last tsi and tsin formed an alliance subdued chu and imposed a general treaty of disarmament and peace in china  the power of tsin became predominant  finally about the time of asoka in india the tsin monarch seized upon the sacrificial vessels of the chow emperor and took over his sacrificial duties  his son shihwangti king in 246 bc emperor in 220 bc is called in the chinese chronicles the first universal emperor  more fortunate than alexander shihwangti reigned for thirtysix years as king and emperor  his energetic reign marks the beginning of a new era of unity and prosperity for the chinese people  he fought vigorously against the hunnish invaders from the northern deserts and he began that immense work the great wall of china to set a limit to their incursions     174  xxxi  rome comes into history   the reader will note a general similarity in the history of all these civilizations in spite of the effectual separation caused by the great barriers of the indian northwest frontier and of the mountain masses of central asia and further india  first for thousands of years the heliolithic culture spread over all the warm and fertile river valleys of the old world and developed a temple system and priest rulers about its sacrificial traditions apparently its first makers were always those brunette peoples we have spoken of as the central race of mankind  then the nomads came in from the regions of seasonal grass and seasonal migrations and superposed their own characteristics and often their own language on the primitive civilization  they subjugated and stimulated it and were stimulated to fresh developments and made it here one thing and here another  in mesopotamia it was the elamite and then the semite and at last the nordic medes and persians and the greeks who supplied the ferment over the region of the Ægean peoples it was the greeks in india it was the aryanspeakers in egypt there was a thinner infusion of conquerors into a more intensely saturated priestly civilization in china the hun conquered and was absorbed and was followed by fresh huns china was mongolized just as greece and north india were aryanized and mesopotamia semitized and aryanized  everywhere the nomads destroyed much but everywhere they brought in a new spirit of free enquiry and moral innovation  they questioned the beliefs of immemorial ages  they let daylight into the temples  they set up kings who were neither priests nor gods but mere leaders among their captains and companions    175  illustration the dying gaul    in the centuries following the sixth century bc we find everywhere a great breaking down of ancient traditions and a new spirit 176 of moral and intellectual enquiry awake a spirit never more to be altogether stilled in the great progressive movement of mankind  we find reading and writing becoming common and accessible accomplishments among the ruling and prosperous minority they were no longer the jealously guarded secret of the priests  travel is increasing and transport growing easier by reason of horses and roads  a new and easy device to facilitate trade has been found in coined money  let us now transfer our attention back from china in the extreme east of the old world to the western half of the mediterranean here we have to note the appearance of a city which was destined to play at last a very great part indeed in human affairs rome  hitherto we have told very little about italy in our story  it was before 1000 bc a land of mountain and forest and thinly populated  aryanspeaking tribes had pressed down this peninsula and formed little towns and cities and the southern extremity was studded with greek settlements  the noble ruins of pæstum preserve for us to this day something of the dignity and splendour of these early greek establishments  a nonaryan people probably akin to the Ægean peoples the etruscans had established themselves in the central part of the peninsula  they had reversed the usual process by subjugating various aryan tribes rome when it comes into the light of history is a little trading city at a ford on the tiber with a latinspeaking population ruled over by etruscan kings  the old chronologies gave 753 bc as the date of the founding of rome half a century later than the founding of the great phoenician city of carthage and twentythree years after the first olympiad  etruscan tombs of a much earlier date than 753 bc have however been excavated in the roman forum  in that redletter century the sixth century bc the etruscan kings were expelled 510 bc and rome became an aristocratic republic with a lordly class of patrician families dominating a commonalty of plebeians  except that it spoke latin it was not unlike many aristocratic greek republics  for some centuries the internal history of rome was the story of a long and obstinate struggle for freedom and a share in the government on the part of the plebeians  it would not be difficult to find 177 greek parallels to this conflict which the greeks would have called a conflict of aristocracy with democracy  in the end the plebeians broke down most of the exclusive barriers of the old families and established a working equality with them  they destroyed the old exclusiveness and made it possible and acceptable for rome to extend her citizenship by the inclusion of more and more outsiders  for while she still struggled at home she was extending her power abroad  illustration remains of the ancient roman cisterns at carthage  the extension of roman power began in the fifth century bc until that time they had waged war and generally unsuccessful war with the etruscans  there was an etruscan fort veii only a few miles from rome which the romans had never been able to capture  in 474 bc however a great misfortune came to the etruscans  their fleet was destroyed by the greeks of syracuse in sicily  178 at the same time a wave of nordic invaders came down upon them from the north the gauls  caught between roman and gaul the etruscans felland disappear from history  veii was captured by the romans the gauls came through to rome and sacked the city 390 bc but could not capture the capitol  an attempted night surprise was betrayed by the cackling of some geese and finally the invaders were bought off and retired to the north of italy again  the gaulish raid seems to have invigorated rather than weakened rome  the romans conquered and assimilated the etruscans and extended their power over all central italy from the arno to naples  to this they had reached within a few years of 300 bc their conquests in italy were going on simultaneously with the growth of philips power in macedonia and greece and the tremendous raid of alexander to egypt and the indus  the romans had become notable people in the civilized world to the east of them by the breakup of alexanders empire  to the north of the roman power were the gauls to the south of them were the greek settlements of magna græcia that is to say of sicily and of the toe and heel of italy  the gauls were a hardy warlike people and the romans held that boundary by a line of forts and fortified settlements  the greek cities in the south headed by tarentum now taranto and by syracuse in sicily did not so much threaten as fear the romans  they looked about for some help against these new conquerors  we have already told how the empire of alexander fell to pieces and was divided among his generals and companions  among these adventurers was a kinsman of alexanders named pyrrhus who established himself in epirus which is across the adriatic sea over against the heel of italy  it was his ambition to play the part of philip of macedonia to magna græcia and to become protector and mastergeneral of tarentum syracuse and the rest of that part of the world  he had what was then it very efficient modern army he had an infantry phalanx cavalry from thessalywhich was now quite as good as the original macedonian cavalryand twenty fighting elephants he invaded italy and routed the romans in two considerable battles heraclea 280 bc and ausculum 279 bc and 179 having driven them north he turned his attention to the subjugation of sicily  but this brought against him a more formidable enemy than were the romans at that time the phoenician trading city of carthage which was probably then the greatest city in the world  sicily was too near carthage for a new alexander to be welcome there and carthage was mindful of the fate that had befallen her mother city tyre half a century before  so she sent a fleet to encourage or compel rome to continue the struggle and she cut the overseas communications of pyrrhus  pyrrhus found himself freshly assailed by the romans and suffered a disastrous repulse in an attack he had made upon their camp at beneventum between naples and rome  and suddenly came news that recalled him to epirus  the gauls were raiding south  but this time they were not raiding down into italy the roman frontier fortified and guarded had become too formidable for them  they were raiding down through illyria which is now serbia and albania to macedonia and epirus repulsed by the romans endangered at sea by the carthaginians and threatened at home by the gauls pyrrhus abandoned his dream of conquest and went home 275 bc and the power of rome was extended to the straits of messina  on the sicilian side of the straits was the greek city of messina and this presently fell into the hands of a gang of pirates  the carthaginians who were already practically overlords of sicily and allies of syracuse suppressed these pirates 270 bc and put in a carthaginian garrison there  the pirates appealed to rome and rome listened to their complaint  and so across the straits of messina the great trading power of carthage and this new conquering people the romans found themselves in antagonism face to face     180  xxxii  rome and carthage   it was in 264 bc that the great struggle between rome and carthage the punic wars began  in that year asoka was beginning his reign in behar and shihwangti was a little child the museum in alexandria was still doing good scientific work and the barbaric gauls were now in asia minor and exacting a tribute from pergamum  the different regions of the world were still separated by insurmountable distances and probably the rest of mankind heard only vague and remote rumours of the mortal fight that went on for a century and a half in spain italy north africa and the western mediterranean between the last stronghold of semitic power and rome this newcomer among aryanspeaking peoples  that war has left its traces upon issues that still stir the world  rome triumphed over carthage but the rivalry of aryan and semite was to merge itself later on in the conflict of gentile and jew  our history now is coming to events whose consequences and distorted traditions still maintain a lingering and expiring vitality in and exercise a complicating and confusing influence upon the conflicts and controversies of today  the first punic war began in 264 bc about the pirates of messina  it developed into a struggle for the possession of all sicily except the dominions of the greek king of syracuse  the advantage of the sea was at first with the carthaginians  they had great fighting ships of what was hitherto an unheardof size quinqueremes galleys with five banks of oars and a huge ram  at the battle of salamis two centuries before the leading battleships had only been triremes with three banks  but the romans with extraordinary energy and in spite of the fact that they had little naval experience set themselves to outbuild the carthaginians  they manned the new navy they created chiefly with greek seamen and they invented 181 grappling and boarding to make up for the superior seamanship of the enemy  when the carthaginian came up to ram or shear the oars of the roman huge grappling irons seized him and the roman soldiers swarmed aboard him  at mylæ 260 bc and at ecnomus 256 bc the carthaginians were disastrously beaten  they repulsed a roman landing near carthage but were badly beaten at palermo losing one hundred and four elephants thereto grace such a triumphal procession through the forum as rome had never seen before  but after that came two roman defeats and then a roman recovery  the last naval forces of carthage were defeated 182 by it last roman effort at the battle of the Ægatian isles 241 bc and carthage sued for peace  all sicily except the dominions of hiero king of syracuse was ceded to the romans  illustration hannibal  for twentytwo years rome and carthage kept the peace  both had trouble enough at home  in italy the gauls came south again threatened romewhich in a state of panic offered human sacrifices to the godsand were routed at telamon  rome pushed forward to the alps and even extended her dominions down the adriatic coast to illyria  carthage suffered from domestic insurrections and from revolts in corsica and sardinia and displayed far less recuperative power  finally an act of intolerable aggression rome seized and annexed the two revolting islands  spain at that time was carthaginian as far north as the river ebro  to that boundary the romans restricted them  any crossing of the ebro by the carthaginians was to be considered an act of war against the romans  at last in 218 bc the carthaginians provoked by new roman aggressions did cross this river under a young general named hannibal one of the most brilliant commanders in the whole of history  he marched his army from spain over the alps into italy raised the gauls against the romans and carried on the second punic war in italy itself for fifteen years  he inflicted tremendous defeats upon the romans at lake trasimere and at cannæ and throughout all his italian campaigns no roman army stood against him and escaped disaster  but a roman army had landed at marseilles and cut his communications with spain he had no siege train and he could never capture rome  finally the carthaginians threatened by the revolt of the numidians at home were forced back upon the defence of their own city in africa a roman army crossed into africa and hannibal experienced his first defeat under its walls at the battle of zama 202 bc at the hands of scipio africanus the elder  the battle of zama ended this second punic war  carthage capitulated she surrendered spain and her war fleet she paid an enormous indemnity and agreed to give up hannibal to the vengeance of the romans  but hannibal escaped and fled to asia where later being in danger of falling into the hands of his relentless enemies he took poison and died  183  for fiftysix years rome and the shorn city of carthage were at peace  and meanwhile rome spread her empire over confused and divided greece invaded asia minor and defeated antiochus iii the seleucid monarch at magnesia in lydia  she made egypt still under the ptolemies and pergamum and most of the small states of asia minor into allies or as we should call them now protected states  meanwhile carthage subjugated and enfeebled had been slowly regaining something of her former prosperity  her recovery revived the hate and suspicion of the romans  she was attacked upon the most shallow and artificial of quarrels 149 bc she made an obstinate and bitter resistance stood a long siege and was stormed 146 bc the street fighting or massacre lasted six days it was extraordinarily bloody and when the citadel capitulated only about fifty thousand of the carthaginian population remained alive out of a quarter of a million  they were sold into slavery and the city was burnt and elaborately destroyed  the blackened ruins were ploughed and sown as a sort of ceremonial effacement  map the extent of the roman power  its alliances about 150 bc  so ended the third punic war  of all the semitic states and cities that had flourished in the world five centuries before only one little country remained free under native rulers  this was judea which had liberated itself from the seleucids and was under the rule 184 of the native maccabean princes  by this time it had its bible almost complete and was developing the distinctive traditions of the jewish world as we know it now  it was natural that the carthaginians phoenicians and kindred peoples dispersed about the world should find a common link in their practically identical language and in this literature of hope and courage  to a large extent they were still the traders and bankers of the world  the semitic world had been submerged rather than replaced  jerusalem which has always been rather the symbol than the centre of judaism was taken by the romans in 65 bc and after various vicissitudes of quasiindependence and revolt was besieged by them in 70 ad and captured after a stubborn struggle  the temple was destroyed  a later rebellion in 132 ad completed its destruction and the jerusalem we know today was rebuilt later under roman auspices  a temple to the roman god jupiter capitolinus stood in the place of the temple and jews were forbidden to inhabit the city     185  xxxiii  the growth of the roman empire   now this new roman power which arose to dominate the western world in the second and first centuries bc was in several respects a different thing from any of the great empires that had hitherto prevailed in the civilized world  it was not at first a monarchy and it was not the creation of any one great conqueror  it was not indeed the first of republican empires athens had dominated a group of allies and dependents in the time of pericles and carthage when she entered upon her fatal struggle with rome was mistress of sardinia and corsica morocco algiers tunis and most of spain and sicily  but it was the first republican empire that escaped extinction and went on to fresh developments  the centre of this new system lay far to the west of the more ancient centres of empire which had hitherto been the river valleys of mesopotamia and egypt  this westward position enabled rome to bring in to civilization quite fresh regions and peoples the roman power extended to morocco and spain and was presently able to thrust northwestward over what is now france and belgium to britain and northeastward into hungary and south russia  but on the other hand it was never able to maintain itself in central asia or persia because they were too far from its administrative centres  it included therefore great masses of fresh nordic aryanspeaking peoples it presently incorporated nearly all the greek people in the world and its population was less strongly hamitic and semitic than that of any preceding empire  for some centuries this roman empire did not fall into the grooves of precedent that had so speedily swallowed up persian and greek and all that time it developed  the rulers of the medes and persians became entirely babylonized in a generation or so they 186 took over the tiara of the king of kings and the temples and priesthoods of his gods alexander and his successors followed in the same easy path of assimilation the seleucid monarchs had much the same court and administrative methods as nebuchadnezzar the ptolemies became pharaohs and altogether egyptian  they were assimilated just as before them the semitic conquerors of the sumerians had been assimilated  but the romans ruled in their own city and for some centuries kept to the laws of their own nature the only people who exercised any great mental influence upon them before the second or third century ad were the kindred and similar greeks  so that the roman empire was essentially a first attempt to rule a great dominion upon mainly aryan lines  it was so far a new pattern in history it was an expanded aryan republic  the old pattern of a personal conqueror ruling over a capital city that had grown up round the temple of a harvest god did not apply to it  the romans had gods and temples but like the gods of the greeks their gods were quasihuman immortals divine patricians  the romans also had blood sacrifices and even made human ones in times of stress things they may have learnt to do from their dusky etruscan teachers but until rome was long past its zenith neither priest nor temple played a large part in roman history  the roman empire was a growth an unplanned novel growth the roman people found themselves engaged almost unawares in a vast administrative experiment  it cannot be called a successful experiment  in the end their empire collapsed altogether  and it changed enormously in form and method from century to century  it changed more in a hundred years than bengal or mesopotamia or egypt changed in a thousand  it was always changing  it never attained to any fixity  in a sense the experiment failed  in a sense the experiment remains unfinished and europe and america today are still working out the riddles of worldwide statescraft first confronted by the roman people  it is well for the student of history to bear in mind the very great changes not only in political but in social and moral matters that went on throughout the period of roman dominion there is much too strong a tendency in peoples minds to think of the roman 187 rule as something finished and stable firm rounded noble and decisive  macaulays lays of ancient rome spqr the elder cato the scipios julius cæsar diocletian constantine the great triumphs orations gladiatorial combats and christian martyrs are all mixed up together in a picture of something high and cruel and dignified  the items of that picture have to be disentangled  they are collected at different points from a process of change profounder than that which separates the london of william the conqueror from the london of today  we may very conveniently divide the expansion of rome into four stages  the first stage began after the sack of rome by the goths in 390 bc and went on until the end of the first punic war 240 bc  we may call this stage the stage of the assimilative republic  it was perhaps the finest most characteristic stage in roman history  the agelong dissensions of patrician and plebeian were drawing to it close the etruscan threat had come to an end no one was very rich yet nor very poor and most men were publicspirited  it was a republic like the republic of the south african boers before 1900 or like the northern states of the american union between 1800 and 1850 a freefarmers republic  at the outset of this stage rome was a little state scarcely twenty miles square  she fought the sturdy but kindred states about her and sought not their destruction but coalescence  her centuries of civil dissension had trained her people in compromise and concessions  some of the defeated cities became altogether roman with a voting share in the government some became selfgoverning with the right to trade and marry in rome garrisons full of citizens were set up at strategic points and colonies of varied privileges founded among the freshly conquered people  great roads were made  the rapid latinization of all italy was the inevitable consequence of such a policy  in 89 bc all the free inhabitants of italy became citizens of the city of rome formally the whole roman empire became at last an extended city in 212 ad every free man in the entire extent of the empire was given citizenship the right if he could get there to vote in the town meeting in rome  this extension of citizenship to tractable cities and to whole countries was the distinctive device of roman expansion  it 188 reversed the old process of conquest and assimilation altogether by the roman method the conquerors assimilated the conquered  illustration the forum at rome as it is today  but after the first punic war and the annexation of sicily though the old process of assimilation still went on another process arose by its side  sicily for instance was treated as a conquered prey  it was declared an estate of the roman people  its rich soil and industrious population was exploited to make rome rich the patricians and the more influential among the plebeians secured the major share of that wealth  and the war also brought in a large supply of slaves  before the first punic war the population of the republic had been largely a population of citizen farmers  military service was their privilege and liability  while they were on active service their farms fell into debt and a new largescale slave agriculture grew up when they returned they found their produce in competition with slavegrown produce from sicily and from the new estates at home times had changed  the republic had 189 altered its character not only was sicily in the hands of rome the common man was in the hands of the rich creditor and the rich competitor  rome had entered upon its second stage the republic of adventurous rich men  illustration relics of roman rule  for two hundred years the roman soldier farmers had struggled for freedom and a share in the government of their state for a hundred years they had enjoyed their privileges  the first punic war wasted them and robbed them of all they had won  the value of their electoral privileges had also evaporated  the governing bodies of the roman republic were two in number  the first and more important was the senate  this was a body originally of patricians and then of prominent men of all sorts who were summoned to it first by certain powerful officials the consuls and censors  like the british house of lords it became a gathering of great landowners prominent politicians big business men and the 190 like  it was much more like the british house of lords than it was like the american senate  for three centuries from the punic wars onward it was the centre of roman political thought and purpose  the second body was the popular assembly  this was supposed to be an assembly of all the citizens of rome  when rome was a little state twenty miles square this was a possible gathering  when the citizenship of rome had spread beyond the confines in italy it was an altogether impossible one  its meetings proclaimed by hornblowing from the capitol and the city walls became more and more a gathering of political hacks and city riffraff  in the fourth century bc the popular assembly was a considerable check upon the senate a competent representation of the claims and rights of the common man  by the end of the punic wars it was an impotent relic of a vanquished popular control  no effectual legal check remained upon the big men  illustration the great roman arch at ctesiphon near bagdad  nothing of the nature of representative government was ever introduced into the roman republic  no one thought of electing delegates to represent the will of the citizens  this is a very important point for the student to grasp  the popular assembly 191 never became the equivalent of the american house of representatives or the british house of commons  in theory it was all the citizens in practice it ceased to be anything at all worth consideration  the common citizen of the roman empire was therefore in a very poor case after the second punic war he was impoverished he had often lost his farm he was ousted from profitable production by slaves and he had no political power left to him to remedy these things  the only methods of popular expression left to a people without any form of political expression are the strike and the revolt  the story of the second and first centuries bc so far as internal politics go is a story of futile revolutionary upheaval  the scale of this history will not permit us to tell of the intricate struggles of that time of the attempts to break up estates and restore the land to the free farmer of proposals to abolish debts in whole or in part  there was revolt and civil war  in 73 bc the distresses of italy were enhanced by a great insurrection of the slaves under spartacus  the slaves of italy revolted with some effect for among them were the trained fighters of the gladiatorial shows  for two years spartacus held out in the crater of vesuvius which seemed at that time to be an extinct volcano  this insurrection was defeated at last and suppressed with frantic cruelty  six thousand captured spartacists were crucified along the appian way the great highway that runs southward out of rome 71 bc  the common man never made head against the forces that were subjugating and degrading him  but the big rich men who were overcoming him were even in his defeat preparing a new power in the roman world over themselves and him the power of the army  before the second punic war the army of rome was a levy of free farmers who according to their quality rode or marched afoot to battle  this was a very good force for wars close at hand but not the sort of army that will go abroad and bear long campaigns with patience  and moreover as the slaves multiplied and the estates grew the supply of freespirited fighting farmers declined  it was a popular leader named marius who introduced a new factor  north africa after the overthrow of the carthaginian civilization had become a semibarbaric kingdom the kingdom of numidia  192 the roman power fell into conflict with jugurtha king of this state and experienced enormous difficulties in subduing him  marius was made consul in a phase of public indignation to end this discreditable war  this he did by raising paid troops and drilling them hard  jugurtha was brought in chains to rome 106 bc and marius when his time of office had expired held on to his consulship illegally with his newly created legions  there was no power in rome to restrain him  with marius began the third phase in the development of the roman power the republic of the military commanders  for now began a period in which the leaders of the paid legions fought for the mastery of the roman world  against marius was pitted the aristocratic sulla who had served under him in africa  each in turn made a great massacre of his political opponents  men were proscribed and executed by the thousand and their estates were sold  after the bloody rivalry of these two and the horror of the revolt of spartacus came a phase in which lucullus and pompey the great and crassus and julius cæsar were the masters of armies and dominated affairs  it was crassus who defeated spartacus lucullus conquered asia minor and penetrated to armenia and retired with great wealth into private life  crassus thrusting further invaded persia and was defeated and slain by the parthians  after a long rivalry pompey was defeated by julius cæsar 48 bc and murdered in egypt leaving julius cæsar sole master of the roman world  the figure of julius cæsar is one that has stirred the human imagination out of all proportion to its merit or true importance he has become a legend and a symbol  for us he is chiefly important as marking the transition from the phase of military adventurers to the beginning of the fourth stage in roman expansion the early empire  for in spite of the profoundest economic and political convulsions in spite of civil war and social degeneration throughout all this time the boundaries of the roman state crept outward and continued to creep outward to their maximum about 100 ad  there had been something like an ebb during the doubtful phases of the second punic war and again a manifest loss of vigour before the reconstruction of the army by marius the revolt of spartacus 193 marked a third phase julius cæsar made his reputation as a military leader in gaul which is now france and belgium  the chief tribes inhabiting this country belonged to the same celtic people as the gauls who had occupied north italy for a time and who had afterwards raided into asia minor and settled down as the galatians  cæsar drove back a german invasion of gaul and added all that country to the empire and he twice crossed the straits of dover into britain 55 and 54 bc where however he made no permanent conquest meanwhile pompey the great was consolidating roman conquests that reached in the east to the caspian sea  illustration the column of trajan at rome  at this time the middle of the first century bc the roman senate was still the nominal centre of the roman government appointing consuls and other officials granting powers and the like and a number of politicians among whom cicero was an outstanding 194 figure were struggling to preserve the great traditions of republican rome and to maintain respect for its laws  but the spirit of citizenship had gone from italy with the wasting away of the free farmers it was a land now of slaves and impoverished men with neither the understanding nor the desire for freedom  there was nothing whatever behind these republican leaders in the senate while behind the great adventurers they feared and desired to control were the legions  over the heads of the senate crassus and pompey and cæsar divided the rule of the empire between them the first triumvirate  when presently crassus was killed at distant carrhæ by the parthians pompey and cæsar fell out  pompey took up the republican side and laws were passed to bring cæsar to trial for his breaches of law and his disobedience to the decrees of the senate  it was illegal for a general to bring his troops out of the boundary of his command and the boundary between cæsars command and italy was the rubicon  in 49 bc he crossed the rubicon saying the die is cast and marched upon pompey and rome  it had been the custom in rome in the past in periods of military extremity to elect a dictator with practically unlimited powers to rule through the crisis  after his overthrow of pompey cæsar was made dictator first for ten years and then in 45 bc for life  in effect he was made monarch of the empire for life there was talk of a king a word abhorrent to rome since the expulsion of the etruscans five centuries before  cæsar refused to be king but adopted throne and sceptre  after his defeat of pompey cæsar had gone on into egypt and had made love to cleopatra the last of the ptolemies the goddess queen of egypt she seems to have turned his head very completely  he had brought back to rome the egyptian idea of a godking  his statue was set up in a temple with an inscription to the unconquerable god the expiring republicanism of rome flared up in a last protest and cæsar was stabbed to death in the senate at the foot of the statue of his murdered rival pompey the great  thirteen years more of this conflict of ambitious personalities followed  there was a second triumvirate of lepidus mark antony and octavian cæsar the latter the nephew of julius cæsar octavian like his uncle took the poorer hardier western provinces 195 where the best legions were recruited  in 31 bc he defeated mark antony his only serious rival at the naval battle of actium and made himself sole master of the roman world  but octavian was a man of different quality altogether from julius cæsar  he had no foolish craving to be god or king  he had no queenlover that he wished to dazzle  he restored freedom to the senate and people of rome  he declined to be dictator  the grateful senate in return gave him the reality instead of the forms of power  he was to be called not king indeed but princeps and augustus  he became augustus cæsar the first of the roman emperors 27 bc to 14 ad  he was followed by tiberius cæsar 14 to 37 ad and he by others caligula claudius nero and so on up to trajan 98 ad hadrian 117 ad antonius pius 138 ad and marcus aurelius 161180 ad  all these emperors were emperors of the legions the soldiers made them and some the soldiers destroyed gradually the senate fades out of romanhistory and the emperor and his administrative officials replace it  the boundaries of the empire crept forward now to their utmost limits  most of britain was added to the empire transylvania was brought in as a new province dacia trajan crossed the euphrates  hadrian had an idea that reminds us at once of what had happened at the other end of the old world  like shihwangti he built walls against the northern barbarians one across britain and a palisade between the rhine and the danube  he abandoned some of the acquisitions of trajan  the expansion of the roman empire was at an end     196  xxxiv  between rome and china   the second and first centuries bc mark a new phase in the history of mankind  mesopotamia and the eastern mediterranean are no longer the centre of interest  both mesopotamia and egypt were still fertile populous and fairly prosperous but they were no longer the dominant regions of the world  power had drifted to the west and to the east  two great empires now dominated the world this new roman empire and the renascent empire of china rome extended its power to the euphrates but it was never able to get beyond that boundary  it was too remote  beyond the euphrates the former persian and indian dominions of the seleucids fell under a number of new masters  china now under the han dynasty which had replaced the tsin dynasty at the death of shihwangti had extended its power across tibet and over the high mountain passes of the pamirs into western turkestan  but there too it reached its extremes  beyond was too far  china at this time was the greatest best organized and most civilized political system in the world  it was superior in area and population to the roman empire at its zenith  it was possible then for these two vast systems to flourish in the same world at the same time in almost complete ignorance of each other  the means of communication both by sea and land was not yet sufficiently developed and organized for them to come to a direct clash  yet they reacted upon each other in a very remarkable way and their influence upon the fate of the regions that lay between them upon central asia and india was profound  a certain amount of trade trickled through by camel caravans across persia for example and by coasting ships by way of india and the red sea in 66 bc roman troops under pompey followed in the footsteps of alexander the great and marched up the eastern shores of the 197 caspian sea  in 102 ad a chinese expeditionary force under pan chau reached the caspian and sent emissaries to report upon the power of rome  but many centuries were still to pass before definite knowledge and direct intercourse were to link the great parallel worlds of europe and eastern asia  to the north of both these great empires were barbaric wildernesses  what is now germany was largely forest lands the forests extended far into russia and made a home for the gigantic aurochs a bull of almost elephantine size  then to the north of the great mountain masses of asia stretched a band of deserts steppes and then forests and frozen lands  in the eastward lap of the elevated part of asia was the great triangle of manchuria large parts of these regions stretching between south russia and turkestan into manchuria were and are regions of exceptional climatic insecurity  their rainfall has varied greatly in the course of a few centuries  they are lands treacherous to man  for years they will carry pasture and sustain cultivation and then will come an age of decline in humidity and a cycle of killing droughts  illustration a chinese covered jar of greenglazed earthenware  the western part of this barbaric north from the german forests to south russia and turkestan and from gothland to the alps was the region of origin of the nordic peoples and of the aryan speech the eastern steppes and deserts of mongolia was the region of origin of the hunnish or mongolian or tartar or turkish peoplesfor all these several peoples were akin in language race and way of life  and as the nordic peoples seem to have been continually overflowing their own borders and pressing south upon the developing civilizations of mesopotamia and the mediterranean coast so the hunnish 198 tribes sent their surplus as wanderers raiders and conquerors into the settled regions of china  periods of plenty in the north would mean an increase in population there a shortage of grass a spell of cattle disease would drive the hungry warlike tribesmen south  illustration vase of bronze form unglazed stoneware  for a time there were simultaneously two fairly effective empires in the world capable of holding back the barbarians and even forcing forward the frontiers of the imperial peace  the thrust of the han empire from north china into mongolia was strong and continuous  the chinese population welled up over the barrier of the great wall  behind the imperial frontier guards came the chinese farmer with horse and plough ploughing up the grass lands and enclosing the winter pasture  the hunnish peoples raided and murdered the settlers but the chinese punitive expeditions were too much for them  the nomads were faced with the choice of settling down to the plough and becoming chinese taxpayers or shifting in search of fresh summer pastures  some took the former course and were absorbed  some drifted northeastward and eastward over the mountain passes down into western turkestan  this westward drive of the mongolian horsemen was going on from 200 bc onward  it was producing a westward pressure upon the aryan tribes and these again were pressing upon the roman frontiers ready to break through directly there was any weakness apparent  the parthians who were apparently a scythian people with some mongolian admixture came down to the euphrates by the first century bc  they fought against pompey the great in 199 his eastern raid  they defeated and killed crassus  they replaced the seleucid monarchy in persia by a dynasty of parthian kings the arsacid dynasty  illustration chinese vessel in bronze in form of a goose  but for a time the line of least resistance for hungry nomads lay neither to the west nor the east but through central asia and then southeastward through the khyber pass into india  it was india which received the mongolian drive in these centuries of roman and chinese strength  a series of raiding conquerors poured down through the punjab into the great plains to loot and destroy  the empire of asoka was broken up and for a time the history of india passes into darkness  a certain kushan dynasty founded by the indoscythiansone of the raiding peoplesruled for a time over north india and maintained a certain order  these invasions went on for several centuries  for a large part of the fifth century ad india was afflicted by the ephthalites or white huns who levied tribute on the small indian princes and held india in terror  every summer these ephthalites pastured in western turkestan every autumn they came down through the passes to terrorize india  200  in the second century ad a great misfortune came upon the roman and chinese empires that probably weakened the resistance of both to barbarian pressure  this was a pestilence of unexampled virulence  it raged for eleven years in china and disorganized the social framework profoundly  the han dynasty fell and a new age of division and confusion began from which china did not fairly recover until the seventh century ad with the coming of the great tang dynasty  the infection spread through asia to europe  it raged throughout the roman empire from 164 to 180 ad  it evidently weakened the roman imperial fabric very seriously  we begin to hear of depopulation in the roman provinces after this and there was a marked deterioration in the vigour and efficiency of government at any rate we presently find the frontier no longer invulnerable but giving way first in this place and then in that  a new nordic people the goths coming originally from gothland in sweden had migrated across russia to the volga region and the shores of the black sea and taken to the sea and piracy  by the end of the second century they may have begun to feel the westward thrust of the huns  in 247 they crossed the danube in a great land raid and defeated and killed the emperor decius in a battle in what is now serbia in 236 another germanic people the franks had broken bounds upon the lower rhine and the alemanni had poured into alsace  the legions in gaul beat back their invaders but the goths in the balkan peninsula raided again and again  the province of dacia vanished from roman history  a chill had come to the pride and confidence of rome  in 270275 rome which had been an open and secure city for three centuries was fortified by the emperor aurelian     201  xxxv  the common mans life under the early roman empire   before we tell of how this roman empire which was built up in the two centuries bc and which flourished in peace and security from the days of augustus cæsar onward for two centuries fell into disorder and was broken up it may be as well to devote some attention to the life of the ordinary people throughout this great realm  our history has come down now to within 2000 years of our own time and the life of the civilized people both under the peace of rome and the peace of the han dynasty was beginning to resemble more and more clearly the life of their civilized successors today  in the western world coined money was now in common use outside the priestly world there were many people of independent means who were neither officials of the government nor priests people travelled about more freely than they had ever done before and there were high roads and inns for them  compared with the past with the time before 500 bc life had become much more loose before that date civilized men had been bound to a district or country had been bound to a tradition and lived within a very limited horizon only the nomads traded and travelled  but neither the roman peace nor the peace of the han dynasty meant a uniform civilization over the large areas they controlled there were very great local differences and great contrasts and inequalities of culture between one district and another just as there are today under the british peace in india  the roman garrisons and colonies were dotted here and there over this great space worshipping roman gods and speaking the latin language but where there had been towns and cities before the coming of the romans they went on subordinated indeed but managing their own affairs and for a time at least worshipping their own gods in their own fashion  over greece asia minor egypt and the hellenized east 202 generally the latin language never prevailed  greek ruled there invincibly  saul of tarsus who became the apostle paul was a jew and a roman citizen but he spoke and wrote greek and not hebrew  even at the court of the parthian dynasty which had overthrown the greek seleucids in persia and was quite outside the roman imperial boundaries greek was the fashionable language  in some parts of spain and in north africa the carthaginian language also held on for a long time in spite of the destruction of carthage  such a town as seville which had been a prosperous city long before the roman name had been heard of kept its semitic goddess and preserved its semitic speech for generations in spite of a colony of roman veterans at italica a few miles away  septimius severus who was emperor from 193 to 211 ad spoke carthaginian as his mother speech  he learnt latin later as a foreign tongue 203 and it is recorded that his sister never learnt latin and conducted her roman household in the punic language  illustration a gladiator  in such countries as gaul and britain and in provinces like dacia now roughly roumania and pannonia hungary south of the danube where there were no preexisting great cities and temples and cultures the roman empire did however latinize  it civilized these countries for the first time  it created cities and towns where latin was from the first the dominant speech and where roman gods were served and roman customs and fashions followed the roumanian italian french and spanish languages all variations and modifications of latin remain to remind us of this extension of latin speech and customs northwest africa also became at last largely latinspeaking egypt greece and the rest of the empire to the east were never latinized  they remained egyptian and greek in culture and spirit  and even in rome among educated men greek was learnt as the language of a gentleman and greek literature and learning were very properly preferred to latin  in this miscellaneous empire the ways of doing work and business were naturally also very miscellaneous  the chief industry of the settled world was still largely agriculture  we have told how in italy the sturdy free farmers who were the backbone of the early roman republic were replaced by estates worked by slave labour after the punic wars  the greek world had had very various methods of cultivation from the arcadian plan wherein every free citizen toiled with his own hands to sparta wherein it was a dishonour to work and where agricultural work was done by a special slave class the helots  but that was ancient history now and over most of the hellenized world the estate system and slavegangs had spread  the agricultural slaves were captives who spoke many different languages so that they could not understand each other or they were born slaves they had no solidarity to resist oppression no tradition of rights no knowledge for they could not read nor write  although they came to form a majority of the country population they never made a successful insurrection  the insurrection of spartacus in the first century bc was an insurrection of the special slaves who were trained for the gladiatorial combats the agricultural workers in italy in the latter days of 204 the republic and the early empire suffered frightful indignities they would be chained at night to prevent escape or have half the head shaved to make it difficult they had no wives of their own they could be outraged mutilated and killed by their masters  a master could sell his slave to fight beasts in the arena  if a slave slew his master all the slaves in his household and not merely the murderer were crucified  in some parts of greece in athens notably the lot of the slave was never quite so frightful as this but it was still detestable  to such a population the barbarian invaders who presently broke through the defensive line of the legions came not as enemies but as liberators  illustration pompeii  the slave system had spread to most industries and to every sort of work that could be done by gangs  mines and metallurgical operations the rowing of galleys roadmaking and big building operations were all largely slave occupations  and almost all domestic service was performed by slaves  there were poor freemen 205 and there were freedmen in the cities and upon the country side working for themselves or even working for wages they were artizans supervisors and so forth workers of a new moneypaid class working in competition with slave workers but we do not know what proportion they made of the general population it probably varied widely in different places and at different periods  and there were also many modifications of slavery from the slavery that was chained at night and driven with whips to the farm or quarry to the slave whose master found it advantageous to leave him to cultivate his patch or work his craft and own his wife like a freeman provided he paid in a satisfactory quittance to his owner  there were armed slaves  at the opening of the period of the punic wars in 264 bc the etruscan sport of setting slaves to fight for their lives was revived in rome  it grew rapidly fashionable and soon every great roman rich man kept a retinue of gladiators who sometimes fought in the arena but whose real business it was to act as his bodyguard of bullies  and also there were learned slaves  the conquests of the later republic were among the highly civilized cities of greece north africa and asia minor and they brought in many highly educated captives the tutor of a young roman of good family was usually a slave  a rich man would have a greek slave as librarian and slave secretaries and learned men  he would keep his poet as he would keep a performing dog  in this atmosphere of slavery the traditions of modern literary criticism were evolved  the slaves still boast and quarrel in our reviews  there were enterprising people who bought intelligent boy slaves and had them educated for sale  slaves were trained as book copyists as jewellers and for endless skilled callings  but there were very considerable changes in the position of a slave during the four hundred years between the opening days of conquest under the republic of rich men and the days of disintegration that followed the great pestilence  in the second century bc warcaptives were abundant manners gross and brutal the slave had no rights and there was scarcely an outrage the reader can imagine that was not practised upon slaves in those days  but already in the first century ad there was a perceptible improvement in the attitude of the roman civilization towards slavery  captives were not so abundant for one thing 207 thing and slaves were dearer  and slaveowners began to realize that the profit and comfort they got from their slaves increased with the selfrespect of these unfortunates  but also the moral tone of the community was rising and a sense of justice was becoming effective  the higher mentality of greece was qualifying the old roman harshness  restrictions upon cruelty were made a master might no longer sell his slave to fight beasts a slave was given property rights in what was called his peculium slaves were paid wages as an encouragement and stimulus a form of slave marriage was recognized  very many forms of agriculture do not lend themselves to gang working or require gang workers only at certain seasons  in regions where such conditions prevailed the slave presently became a serf paying his owner part of his produce or working for him at certain seasons    206  illustration the coliseum rome  illustration interior of the coliseum at it appears today    when we begin to realize how essentially this great latin and greekspeaking roman empire of the first two centuries ad was a slave state and how small was the minority who had any pride or freedom in their lives we lay our hands on the clues to its decay and collapse  there was little of what we should call family life few homes of temperate living and active thought and study schools and colleges were few and far between  the free will and the free mind were nowhere to be found  the great roads the ruins of splendid buildings the tradition of law and power it left for the astonishment of succeeding generations must not conceal from us that all its outer splendour was built upon thwarted wills stifled intelligence and crippled and perverted desires  and even the minority who lorded it over that wide realm of subjugation and of restraint and forced labour were uneasy and unhappy in their souls art and literature science and philosophy which are the fruits of free and happy minds waned in that atmosphere  there was much copying and imitation an abundance of artistic artificers much slavish pedantry among the servile men of learning but the whole roman empire in four centuries produced nothing to set beside the bold and noble intellectual activities of the comparatively little city of athens during its one century of greatness  athens decayed under the roman sceptre  the science of alexandria decayed  the spirit of man it seemed was decaying in those days     208  xxxvi  religious developments under the roman empire   the soul of man under that latin and greek empire of the first two centuries of the christian era was a worried and frustrated soul compulsion and cruelty reigned there were pride and display but little honour little serenity or steadfast happiness  the unfortunate were despised and wretched the fortunate were insecure and feverishly eager for gratifications  in a great number of cities life centred on the red excitement of the arena where men and beasts fought and were tormented and slain amphitheatres are the most characteristic of roman ruins  life went on in that key  the uneasiness of mens hearts manifested itself in profound religious unrest  from the days when the aryan hordes first broke in upon the ancient civilizations it was inevitable that the old gods of the temples and priesthoods should suffer great adaptations or disappear  in the course of hundreds of generations the agricultural peoples of the brunette civilizations had shaped their lives and thoughts to the templecentred life  observances and the fear of disturbed routines sacrifices and mysteries dominated their minds  their gods seem monstrous and illogical to our modern minds because we belong to an aryanized world but to these older peoples these deities had the immediate conviction and vividness of things seen in an intense dream  the conquest of one city state by another in sumeria or early egypt meant a change or a renaming of gods or goddesses but left the shape and spirit of the worship intact  there was no change in its general character the figures in the dream changed but the dream went on and it was the same sort of dream  and the early semitic conquerors were sufficiently akin in spirit to the sumerians to take over the religion of the mesopotamian civilization they subjugated without any profound alteration  egypt was never 209 indeed subjugated to the extent of a religious revolution  under the ptolemies and under the cæsars her temples and altars and priesthoods remained essentially egyptian  so long as conquests went on between people of similar social and religious habits it was possible to get over the clash between the god of this temple and region and the god of that by a process of grouping or assimilation  if the two gods were alike in character they were identified  it was really the same god under another name said the priests and the people  this fusion of gods is called theocrasia and the age of the great conquests of the thousand years bc was an age of theocrasia  over wide areas the local gods were displaced by or rather they were swallowed up in a general god  so that when at last hebrew prophets in babylon proclaimed one god of righteousness in all the earth mens minds were fully prepared for that idea  but often the gods were too dissimilar for such an assimilation and then they were grouped together in some plausible relationship  a female godand the Ægean world before the coming of the greek was much addicted to mother godswould be married to a male god and an animal god or a star god would be humanized and the animal or astronomical aspect the serpent or the sun or the star made into an ornament or a symbol  or the god of a defeated people would become a malignant antagonist to the brighter gods the history of theology is full of such adaptations compromises and rationalizations of once local gods  as egypt developed from city states into one united kingdom there was much of this theocrasia  the chief god so to speak was osiris a sacrificial harvest god of whom pharaoh was supposed to be the earthly incarnation  osiris was represented as repeatedly dying and rising again he was not only the seed and the harvest but also by a natural extension of thought the means of human immortality  among his symbols was the widewinged scarabeus beetle which buries its eggs to rise again and also the effulgent sun which sets to rise  later on he was to be identified with apis the sacred bull  associated with him was the goddess isis isis was also hathor a cowgoddess and the crescent moon and the star of the sea  osiris dies and she bears a child horus who is also a 210 hawkgod and the dawn and who grows to become osiris again  the effigies of isis represent her as bearing the infant horus in her arms and standing on the crescent moon  these are not logical relationships but they were devised by the human mind before the development of hard and systematic thinking and they have a dreamlike coherence  beneath this triple group there are other and darker egyptian gods bad gods the dogheaded anubis black night and the like devourers tempters enemies of god and man  illustration mithras sacrificing a bull roman  every religious system does in the course of time fit itself to the shape of the human soul and there can be no doubt that out of these illogical and even uncouth symbols egyptian people were able to fashion for themselves ways of genuine devotion and consolation  the desire for immortality was very strong in the egyptian mind and the religious life of egypt turned on that desire the egyptian 211 religion was an immortality religion as no other religion had ever been  as egypt went down under foreign conquerors and the egyptian gods ceased to have any satisfactory political significance this craving for a life of compensations hereafter intensified  illustration isis and horus  after the greek conquest the new city of alexandria became the centre of egyptian religious life and indeed of the religious life of the whole hellenic world  a great temple the serapeum was set up by ptolemy i at which a sort of trinity of gods was worshipped these were serapis who was osirisapis rechristened isis and horus these were not regarded as separate gods but as three aspects of one god and serapis was identified with the greek zeus the roman jupiter and the persian sungod  this worship spread wherever the hellenic influence extended even into north india and western china  the idea of immortality an immortality of compensations and consolation was eagerly received by a world in which the common life was hopelessly wretched serapis was called the saviour of souls  after death said the hymns of that time we are still in the care of his providence  isis attracted many devotees  her images stood in her temples as queen of heaven bearing the infant horus in her arms  candles were burnt before her votive offerings were made to her shaven priests consecrated to celibacy waited on her altar  the rise of the roman empire opened the western european world to this growing cult  the temples of serapisisis the chanting of the priests and the hope of immortal life followed the roman standards to scotland and holland  but there were many rivals to the serapisisis religion  prominent among these was mithraism this was a religion of persian origin and it 212 centred upon some now forgotten mysteries about mithras sacrificing a sacred and benevolent bull  here we seem to have something more primordial than the complicated and sophisticated serapisisis beliefs  we are carried back directly to the blood sacrifices of the heliolithic stage in human culture  the bull upon the mithraic monuments always bleeds copiously from a wound in its side and from this blood springs new life  the votary to mithraism actually bathed in the blood of the sacrificial bull at his initiation he went beneath a scaffolding upon which a bull was killed so that the blood could actually run down on him  both these religions and the same is true of many other of the numerous parallel cults that sought the allegiance of the slaves and citizens under the earlier roman emperors are personal religions  they aim at personal salvation and personal immortality  the older religions were not personal like that they were social  the older fashion of divinity was god or goddess of the city first or of the state and only secondarily of the individual  the sacrifices were a public and not a private function  they concerned collective practical needs in this world in which we live  but the greeks first and now the romans had pushed religion out of politics  guided by the egyptian tradition religion had retreated to the other world  illustration bust of the emperor commodus ad 180192  these new private immortality religions took all the heart and emotion out of the old state religions but they did not actually replace them  a typical city under the earlier roman emperors would have a number of temples to all sorts of gods  there might be a temple to jupiter of the capitol the great god of rome and there would probably be one to the reigning cæsar  for the cæsars had learnt from the pharaohs the possibility of being gods  in such temples a cold and stately political worship went on one would go and make an offering and burn a pinch of incense to show ones loyalty  but it would be to the temple of isis the dear queen of heaven one would go with the burthen 213 of ones private troubles for advice and relief  there might be local and eccentric gods  seville for example long affected the worship of the old carthaginian venus  in a cave or an underground temple there would certainly be an altar to mithras attended by legionaries and slaves  and probably also there would be a synagogue where the jews gathered to read their bible and uphold their faith in the unseen god of all the earth  sometimes there would be trouble with the jews about the political side of the state religion  they held that their god was a jealous god intolerant of idolatry and they would refuse to take part in the public sacrifices to cæsar  they would not even salute the roman standards for fear of idolatry  in the east long before the time of buddha there had been ascetics men and women who gave up most of the delights of life who repudiated marriage and property and sought spiritual powers and an escape from the stresses and mortifications of the world in abstinence pain and solitude  buddha himself set his face against ascetic extravagances but many of his disciples followed a monkish life of great severity  obscure greek cults practised similar disciplines even to the extent of selfmutilation asceticism appeared in the jewish communities of judea and alexandria also in the first century bc  communities of men abandoned the world and gave themselves to austerities and mystical contemplation  such was the sect of the essenes throughout the first and second centuries ad there was an almost worldwide resort to such repudiations of life a universal search for salvation from the distresses of the time  the old sense of an established order the old confidence in priest and temple and law and custom had gone  amidst the prevailing slavery cruelty fear anxiety waste display and hectic selfindulgence went this epidemic of selfdisgust and mental insecurity this agonized search for peace even at the price of renunciation and voluntary suffering  this it was that filled the serapeum with weeping penitents and brought the converts into the gloom and gore of the mithraic cave     214  xxxvii  the teaching of jesus   it was while augustus cæsar the first of the emperors was reigning in rome that jesus who is the christ of christianity was born in judea  in his name a religion was to arise which was destined to become the official religion of the entire roman empire  now it is on the whole more convenient to keep history and theology apart  a large proportion of the christian world believes that jesus was an incarnation of that god of all the earth whom the jews first recognized  the historian if he is to remain historian can neither accept nor deny that interpretation materially jesus appeared in the likeness of a man and it is as a man that the historian must deal with him  he appeared in judea in the reign of tiberius cæsar  he was a prophet  he preached after the fashion of the preceding jewish prophets  he was a man of about thirty and we are in the profoundest ignorance of his manner of life before his preaching began  our only direct sources of information about the life and teaching of jesus are the four gospels  all four agree in giving us a picture of a very definite personality  one is obliged to say here was a man  this could not have been invented  but just as the personality of gautama buddha has been distorted and obscured by the stiff squatting figure the gilded idol of later buddhism so one feels that the lean and strenuous personality of jesus is much wronged by the unreality and conventionality that a mistaken reverence has imposed upon his figure in modern christian art  jesus was a penniless teacher who wandered about the dusty sunbit country of judea living upon casual gifts of food yet he is always represented clean combed and sleek in spotless raiment erect and with something motionless about him as though 215 he was gliding through the air  this alone has made him unreal and incredible to many people who cannot distinguish the core of the story from the ornamental and unwise additions of the unintelligently devout  we are left if we do strip this record of these difficult accessories with the figure of a being very human very earnest and passionate capable of swift anger and teaching a new and simple and profound doctrinenamely the universal loving fatherhood of god and the coming of the kingdom of heaven  he was clearly a personto use a common phraseof intense personal magnetism  he attracted followers and filled them with love and courage  weak and ailing people were heartened and healed by his presence  yet he was probably of a delicate physique because of the swiftness with which he died under the pains of crucifixion there is a tradition that he fainted when according to the custom he was made to bear his cross to the place of execution he went about the country for three years spreading his doctrine and then he came to jerusalem and was accused of trying to set up a strange kingdom in judea he was tried upon this charge and crucified together with two thieves  long before these two were dead his sufferings were over  the doctrine of the kingdom of heaven which was the main teaching of jesus is certainly one of the most revolutionary doctrines that ever stirred and changed human thought  it is small wonder if the world of that time failed to grasp its full significance and recoiled in dismay from even a half apprehension of its tremendous challenges to the established habits and institutions of mankind  for the doctrine of the kingdom of heaven as jesus seems to have preached it was no less than a bold and uncompromising demand for a complete change and cleansing of the life of our struggling race an utter cleansing without and within  to the gospels the reader must go for all that is preserved of this tremendous teaching here we are only concerned with the jar of its impact upon established ideas  the jews were persuaded that god the one god of the whole world was a righteous god but they also thought of him as a trading god who had made a bargain with their father abraham 216 about them a very good bargain indeed for them to bring them at last to predominance in the earth with dismay and anger they heard jesus sweeping away their dear securities  god he taught was no bargainer there were no chosen people and no favourites in the kingdom of heaven  god was the loving father of all life as incapable of showing favour as the universal sun  and all men were brotherssinners alike and beloved sons alikeof this divine father  in the parable of the good samaritan jesus cast scorn upon that natural tendency we all obey to glorify our own people and to minimize the righteousness of other creeds and other races  in the parable of the labourers he thrust aside the obstinate claim of the jews to have a special claim upon god  all whom god takes into the kingdom he taught god serves alike there is no distinction in his treatment because there is no measure to his bounty  from all moreover as the parable of the buried talent witnesses and as the incident of the widows mite enforces he demands the utmost  there are no privileges no rebates and no excuses in the kingdom of heaven  illustration early ideal portrait in gilded glass of jesus christ in which the traditional beard is not shown  217  but it is not only the intense tribal patriotism of the jews that jesus outraged  they were a people of intense family loyalty and he would have swept away all the narrow and restrictive family affections in the great flood of the love of god  the whole kingdom of heaven was to be the family of his followers  we are told that while he yet talked to the people behold his mother and his brethren stood without desiring to speak with him  then one said unto him behold thy mother and thy brethren stand without desiring to speak with thee  but he answered and said unto him that told him who is my mother and who are my brethren and he stretched forth his hands towards his disciples and said behold my mother and my brethren  for whosoever shall do the will of my father which is in heaven the same is my brother and sister and mother  2  illustration the road from nazareth to tiberias  and not only did jesus strike at patriotism and the bonds of family loyalty in the name of gods universal fatherhood and brotherhood of all mankind but it is clear that his teaching condemned all the gradations of the economic system all private wealth and 218 personal advantages  all men belonged to the kingdom all their possessions belonged to the kingdom the righteous life for all men the only righteous life was the service of gods will with all that we had with all that we were again and again he denounced private riches and the reservation of any private life  illustration davids tower and wall of jerusalem  and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good master what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life  and jesus said to him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is god thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honour thy father and mother  and he answered and said unto him master all these things have i observed from my youth  then jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me  and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions  and jesus looked round about and saith unto his disciples how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god and the disciples were astonished at his words  but jesus answered again and saith unto them children how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of god  it is 220 easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god  3    219  illustration a street in jerusalem    moreover in his tremendous prophecy of this kingdom which was to make all men one together in god jesus had small patience for the bargaining righteousness of formal religion  another large part of his recorded utterances is aimed against the meticulous observance of the rules of the pious career  then the pharisees and scribes asked him why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders but eat bread with unwashen hands  he answered and said unto them well hath isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites as it is written  this people honoureth me with their lips  but their heart is far from me  howbeit in vain do they worship me  teaching for doctrines the commandments of men  for laying aside the commandment of god ye hold the tradition of men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such things ye do  and he said unto them full well ye reject the commandment of god that ye may keep your own tradition  4  it was not merely a moral and a social revolution that jesus proclaimed it is clear from a score of indications that his teaching had a political bent of the plainest sort  it is true that he said his kingdom was not of this world that it was in the hearts of men and not upon a throne but it is equally clear that wherever and in what measure his kingdom was set up in the hearts of men the outer world would be in that measure revolutionized and made new  whatever else the deafness and blindness of his hearers may have missed in his utterances it is plain they did not miss his resolve to revolutionize the world  the whole tenor of the opposition to him and the circumstances of his trial and execution show clearly that to his contemporaries he seemed to propose plainly and did propose plainly to change and fuse and enlarge all human life  in view of what he plainly said is it any wonder that all who were rich and prosperous felt a horror of strange things a swimming of their world at his teaching  he was dragging out all the little private reservations they had made from social service into the light 221 of a universal religious life  he was like some terrible moral huntsman digging mankind out of the snug burrows in which they had lived hitherto  in the white blaze of this kingdom of his there was to be no property no privilege no pride and precedence no motive indeed and no reward but love  is it any wonder that men were dazzled and blinded and cried out against him  even his disciples cried out when he would not spare them the light  is it any wonder that the priests realized that between this man and themselves there was no choice but that he or priestcraft should perish  is it any wonder that the roman soldiers confronted and amazed by something soaring over their comprehension and threatening all their disciplines should take refuge in wild laughter and crown him with thorns and robe him in purple and make a mock cæsar of him  for to take him seriously was to enter upon a strange and alarming life to abandon habits to control instincts and impulses to essay an incredible happiness     2  matt xii 4650  3  mark x 1725  4  mark vii 19     222  xxxviii  the development of doctrinal christianity   in the four gospels we find the personality and teachings of jesus but very little of the dogmas of the christian church  it is in the epistles a series of writings by the immediate followers of jesus that the broad lines of christian belief are laid down  chief among the makers of christian doctrine was st paul  he had never seen jesus nor heard him preach  pauls name was originally saul and he was conspicuous at first as an active persecutor of the little band of disciples after the crucifixion  then he was suddenly converted to christianity and he changed his name to paul  he was a man of great intellectual vigour and deeply and passionately interested in the religious movements of the time he was well versed in judaism and in the mithraism and alexandrian religion of the day  he carried over many of their ideas and terms of expression into christianity  he did very little to enlarge or develop the original teaching of jesus the teaching of the kingdom of heaven  but he taught that jesus was not only the promised christ the promised leader of the jews but also that his death was a sacrifice like the deaths of the ancient sacrificial victims of the primordial civilizations for the redemption of mankind  when religions flourish side by side they tend to pick up each others ceremonial and other outward peculiarities  buddhism for example in china has now almost the same sort of temples and priests and uses as taoism which follows in the teachings of lao tse  yet the original teachings of buddhism and taoism were almost flatly opposed  and it reflects no doubt or discredit upon the essentials of christian teaching that it took over not merely such formal things as the shaven priest the votive offering the altars candles chanting and images of the alexandrian and mithraic faiths but adopted even their devotional phrases and their theological 223 ideas  all these religions were flourishing side by side with many less prominent cults  each was seeking adherents and there must have been a constant going and coming of converts between them  sometimes one or other would be in favour with the government  but christianity was regarded with more suspicion than its rivals because like the jews its adherents would not perform acts of worship to the god cæsar this made it a seditious religion quite apart from the revolutionary spirit of the teachings of jesus himself  illustration mosaic of ss peter and paul pointing to a throne on gold background  st paul familiarized his disciples with the idea that jesus like 224 osiris was a god who died to rise again and give men immortality  and presently the spreading christian community was greatly torn by complicated theological disputes about the relationship of this god jesus to god the father of mankind  the arians taught that jesus was divine but distant from and inferior to the father  the sabellians taught that jesus was merely an aspect of the father and that god was jesus and father at the same time just as a man may be a father and an artificer at the same time and the trinitarians taught a more subtle doctrine that god was both one and three father son and holy spirit  for a time it seemed that arianism would prevail over its rivals and then after disputes violence and wars the trinitarian formula became the accepted formula of all christendom  it may be found in its completest expression in the athanasian creed  we offer no comment on these controversies here  they do not sway history as the personal teaching of jesus sways history  the personal teaching of jesus does seem to mark a new phase in the moral and spiritual life of our race  its insistence upon the universal fatherhood of god and the implicit brotherhood of all men its insistence upon the sacredness of every human personality as a living temple of god was to have the profoundest effect upon all the subsequent social and political life of mankind  with christianity with the spreading teachings of jesus a new respect appears in the world for man as man  it may be true as hostile critics of christianity have urged that st paul preached obedience to slaves but it is equally true that the whole spirit of the teachings of jesus preserved in the gospels was against the subjugation of man by man  and still more distinctly was christianity opposed to such outrages upon human dignity as the gladiatorial combats in the arena  throughout the first two centuries after christ the christian religion spread throughout the roman empire weaving together an evergrowing multitude of converts into a new community of ideas and will  the attitude of the emperors varied between hostility and toleration  there were attempts to suppress this new faith in both the second and third centuries and finally in 303 and the following years a great persecution under the emperor diocletian the considerable accumulations of church property were 225 seized all bibles and religious writings were confiscated and destroyed christians were put out of the protection of the law and many executed  the destruction of the books is particularly notable  it shows how the power of the written word in holding together 226 the new faith was appreciated by the authorities these book religions christianity and judaism were religions that educated  their continued existence depended very largely on people being able to read and understand their doctrinal ideas the older religions had made no such appeal to the personal intelligence  in the ages of barbaric confusion that were now at hand in western europe it was the christian church that was mainly instrumental in preserving the tradition of learning  illustration the baptism of christ  the persecution of diocletian failed completely to suppress the growing christian community  in many provinces it was ineffective because the bulk of the population and many of the officials were christian  in 317 an edict of toleration was issued by the associated emperor galerius and in 324 constantine the great a friend and on his deathbed a baptized convert to christianity became sole ruler of the roman world  he abandoned all divine pretensions and put christian symbols on the shields and banners of his troops  in a few years christianity was securely established as the official religion of the empire  the competing religions disappeared or were absorbed with extraordinary celerity and in 300 theodosius the great caused the great statue of jupiter serapis at alexandria to be destroyed  from the outset of the fifth century onward the only priests or temples in the roman empire were christian priests and temples     227  xxxix  the barbarians break the empire into east and west   throughout the third century the roman empire decaying socially and disintegrating morally faced the barbarians  the emperors of this period were fighting military autocrats and the capital of the empire shifted with the necessities of their military policy now the imperial headquarters would be at milan in north italy now in what is now serbia at sirmium or nish now in nicomedia in asia minor  rome halfway down italy was too far from the centre of interest to be a convenient imperial seat  it was a declining city  over most of the empire peace still prevailed and men went about without arms  the armies continued to be the sole repositories of power the emperors dependent on their legions became more and more autocratic to the rest of the empire and their state more and more like that of the persian and other oriental monarchs  diocletian assumed a royal diadem and oriental robes  all along the imperial frontier which ran roughly along the rhine and danube enemies were now pressing  the franks and other german tribes had come up to the rhine  in north hungary were the vandals in what was once dacia and is now roumania the visigoths or west goths  behind these in south russia were the east goths or ostrogoths and beyond these again in the volga region the alans  but now mongolian peoples were forcing their way towards europe  the huns were already exacting tribute from the alans and ostrogoths and pushing them to the west  in asia the roman frontiers were crumpling back under the push of a renascent persia  this new persia the persia of the sassenid kings was to be a vigorous and on the whole a successful rival of the roman empire in asia for the next three centuries  a glance at the map of europe will show the reader the peculiar weakness of the empire  the river danube comes down to within 228 a couple of hundred miles of the adriatic sea in the region of what is now bosnia and serbia  it makes a square reentrant angle there  the romans never kept their sea communications in good order and this two hundred mile strip of land was their line of communication between the western latinspeaking part of the empire and the eastern greekspeaking portion  against this square angle of the danube the barbarian pressure was greatest when they broke through there it was inevitable that the empire should fall into two parts  map the empire and the barbarians  a more vigorous empire might have thrust forward and reconquered dacia but the roman empire lacked any such vigour  constantine the great was certainly a monarch of great devotion and intelligence  he beat back a raid of the goths from just these vital balkan regions but he had no force to carry the frontier across the danube  he was too preoccupied with the internal weaknesses of the empire  he brought the solidarity and moral force of christianity to revive the spirit of the declining empire and he decided to create a new permanent capital at byzantium upon the hellespont  this newmade byzantium which was rechristened constantinople in his honour was still building when he died  towards the end of his reign occurred a remarkable transaction  the 229 vandals being pressed by the goths asked to be received into the roman empire  they were assigned lands in pannonia which is now that part of hungary west of the danube and their fighting men became nominally legionaries  but these new legionaries remained under their own chiefs  rome failed to digest them  illustration constantines pillar constantinople  constantine died working to reorganize his great realm and soon the frontiers were ruptured again and the visigoths came almost to constantinople they defeated the emperor valens at adrianople and made a settlement in what is now bulgaria similar to the settlement of the vandals in pannonia  nominally they were subjects of the emperor practically they were conquerors  from 379 to 395 ad reigned the emperor theodosius the great and while he reigned the empire was still formally intact  over the armies of italy and pannonia presided stilicho a vandal over the armies in the balkan peninsula alaric a goth  when theodosius died at the close of the fourth century he left 230 two sons alaric supported one of these arcadius in constantinople and stilicho the other honorius in italy  in other words alaric and stilicho fought for the empire with the princes as puppets  in the course of their struggle alaric marched into italy and after a short siege took rome 410 ad  the opening half of the fifth century saw the whole of the roman empire in europe the prey of robber armies of barbarians  it is difficult to visualize the state of affairs in the world at that time  over france spain italy and the balkan peninsula the great cities that had flourished under the early empire still stood impoverished partly depopulated and falling into decay life in them must have been shallow mean and full of uncertainty local officials asserted their authority and went on with their work with such conscience as they had no doubt in the name of a now remote and inaccessible emperor  the churches went on but usually with illiterate priests  there was little reading and much superstition and fear  but everywhere except where looters had destroyed them books and pictures and statuary and suchlike works of art were still to be found  the life of the countryside had also degenerated  everywhere this roman world was much more weedy and untidy than it had been  in some regions war and pestilence had brought the land down to the level of a waste  roads and forests were infested with robbers into such regions the barbarians marched with little or no opposition and set up their chiefs as rulers often with roman official titles  if they were half civilized barbarians they would give the conquered districts tolerable terms they would take possession of the towns associate and intermarry and acquire with an accent the latin speech but the jutes the angles and saxons who submerged the roman province of britain were agriculturalists and had no use for towns they seem to have swept south britain clear of the romanized population and they replaced the language by their own teutonic dialects which became at last english  it is impossible in the space at our disposal to trace the movements of all the various german and slavonic tribes as they went to and fro in the disorganized empire in search of plunder and a pleasant home  but let the vandals serve as an example they came into 232 history in east germany  they settled as we have told in pannonia  thence they moved somewhen about 425 ad through the intervening provinces to spain  there they found visigoths from south russia and other german tribes setting up dukes and kings  from spain the vandals under genseric sailed for north africa 429 captured carthage 439 and built a fleet they secured the mastery of the sea and captured and pillaged rome 455 which had recovered very imperfectly from her capture and looting by alaric half a century earlier  then the vandals made themselves masters of sicily corsica sardinia and most of the other islands of the western mediterranean  they made in fact a sea empire very similar in its extent to the sea empire of carthage seven hundred odd years before  they were at the climax of their power about 477  they were a mere handful of conquerors holding all this country  in the next century almost all their territory had been reconquered for the empire of constantinople during a transitory blaze of energy under justinian i    231  illustration base of the obelisk of theodosius constantinople    the story of the vandals is but one sample of a host of similar adventures  but now there was coming into the european world the least kindred and most redoubtable of all these devastators the mongolian huns or tartars a yellow people active and able such as the western world had never before encountered     233  xl  the huns and the end of the western empire   this appearance of a conquering mongolian people in europe may be taken to mark a new stage in human history  until the last century or so before the christian era the mongol and the nordic peoples had not been in close touch  far away in the frozen lands beyond the northern forests the lapps a mongolian people had drifted westward as far as lapland but they played no part in the main current of history  for thousands of years the western world carried on the dramatic interplay of the aryan semitic and fundamental brunette peoples with very little interference except for an ethiopian invasion of egypt or so either from the black peoples to the south or from the mongolian world in the far east  it is probable that there were two chief causes for the new westward drift of the nomadic mongolians  one was the consolidation of the great empire of china its extension northward and the increase of its population during the prosperous period of the han dynasty  the other was some process of climatic change a lesser rainfall that abolished swamps and forests perhaps or a greater rainfall that extended grazing over desert steppes or even perhaps both these processes going on in different regions but which anyhow facilitated a westward migration  a third contributary cause was the economic wretchedness internal decay and falling population of the roman empire  the rich men of the later roman republic and then the taxgatherers of the military emperors had utterly consumed its vitality  so we have the factors of thrust means and opportunity  there was pressure from the east rot in the west and an open road  the hun had reached the eastern boundaries of european russia by the first century ad but it was not until the fourth and 234 fifth centuries ad that these horsemen rose to predominance upon the steppes  the fifth century was the huns century  the first huns to come into italy were mercenary bands in the pay of stilicho the vandal the master of honorius  presently they were in possession of pannonia the empty nest of the vandals  by the second quarter of the fifth century a great war chief had arisen among the huns attila  we have only vague and tantalizing glimpses of his power  he ruled not only over the huns but over a conglomerate of tributary germanic tribes his empire extended from the rhine cross the plains into central asia  he exchanged ambassadors with china  his head camp was in the plain of hungary east of the danube  there he was visited by an envoy from constantinople priscus who has left us an account of his state the way of living of these mongols was very like the way of living of the primitive aryans they had replaced  the common folk were in huts and tents the chiefs lived in great stockaded timber halls  there were feasts and drinking and singing by the bards the homeric heroes and even the macedonian companions of alexander would probably have felt more at home in the campcapital of attila than they would have done in the cultivated and decadent court of theodosius ii the son of arcadius who was then reigning in constantinople  for a time it seemed as though the nomads under the leadership of the huns and attila would play the same part towards the græcoroman civilization of the mediterranean countries that the barbaric greeks had played long ago to the Ægean civilization  it looked like history repeating itself upon a larger stage  but the huns were much more wedded to the nomadic life than the early greeks who were rather migratory cattle farmers than true nomads the huns raided and plundered but did not settle  for some years attila bullied theodosius as he chose  his armies devastated and looted right down to the walls of constantinople gibbon says that he totally destroyed no less than seventy cities in the balkan peninsula and theodosius bought him off by payments of tribute and tried to get rid of him for good by sending secret agents to assassinate him  in 451 attila turned his attention to the remains of the latinspeaking half of the empire and invaded 235 gaul  nearly every town in northern gaul was sacked franks visigoths and the imperial forces united against him and he was defeated at troyes in a vast dispersed battle in which a multitude of men variously estimated as between 150000 and 300000 were killed this checked him in gaul but it did not exhaust his enormous military resources  next year he came into italy by way of venetia burnt aquileia and padua and looted milan  illustration head of barbarian chief  numbers of fugitives from these north italian towns and particularly from padua fled to islands in the lagoons at the head of the adriatic and laid there the foundations of the city state of venice which was to become one of the greatest or the trading centres in the middle ages  in 453 attila died suddenly after a great feast to celebrate his marriage to a young woman and at his death this plunder confederation of his fell to pieces  the actual huns disappear from history mixed into the surrounding more numerous aryanspeaking populations  236 but these great hun raids practically consummated the end of the latin roman empire  after his death ten different emperors ruled in rome in twenty years set up by vandal and other mercenary troops  the vandals from carthage took and sacked rome in 455  finally in 476 odoacer the chief of the barbarian troops suppressed a pannonian who was figuring as emperor under the impressive name of romulus augustulus and informed the court of constantinople that there was no longer an emperor in the west  so ingloriously the latin roman empire came to an end  in 493 theodoric the goth became king of rome  all over western and central europe now barbarian chiefs were reigning as kings dukes and the like practically independent but for the most part professing some sort of shadowy allegiance to the emperor  there were hundreds and perhaps thousands of such practically independent brigand rulers  in gaul spain and italy and in dacia the latin speech still prevailed in locally distorted forms but in britain and east of the rhine languages of the german group or in bohemia a slavonic language czech were the common speech  the superior clergy and a small remnant of other educated men read and wrote latin  everywhere life was insecure and property was held by the strong arm  castles multiplied and roads fell into decay  the dawn of the sixth century was an age of division and of intellectual darkness throughout the western world  had it not been for the monks and christian missionaries latin learning might have perished altogether  why had the roman empire grown and why had it so completely decayed  it grew because at first the idea of citizenship held it together  throughout the days of the expanding republic and even into the days of the early empire there remained a great number of men conscious of roman citizenship feeling it a privilege and an obligation to be a roman citizen confident of their rights under the roman law and willing to make sacrifices in the name of rome the prestige of rome as of something just and great and lawupholding spread far beyond the roman boundaries  but even as early as the punic wars the sense of citizenship was being undermined by the growth of wealth and slavery  citizenship spread indeed but not the idea of citizenship  237  the roman empire was after all a very primitive organization it did not educate did not explain itself to its increasing multitudes of citizens did not invite their cooperation in its decisions  there was no network of schools to ensure a common understanding no distribution of news to sustain collective activity  the adventurers who struggled for power from the days of marius and sulla onward had no idea of creating and calling in public opinion upon the imperial affairs  the spirit of citizenship died of starvation and no one observed it die  all empires all states all organizations of human society are in the ultimate things of understanding and will  there remained no will for the roman empire in the world and so it came to an end  but though the latinspeaking roman empire died in the fifth century something else had been born within it that was to avail itself enormously of its prestige and tradition and that was the latinspeaking half of the catholic church  this lived while the empire died because it appealed to the minds and wills of men because it had books and a great system of teachers and missionaries to hold it together things stronger than any law or legions  throughout the fourth and fifth centuries ad while the empire was decaying christianity was spreading to a universal dominion in europe  it conquered its conquerors the barbarians when attila seemed disposed to march on rome the patriarch of rome intercepted him and did what no armies could do turning him back by sheer moral force  the patriarch or pope of rome claimed to be the head of the entire christian church  now that there were no more emperors he began to annex imperial titles and claims  he took the title of pontifex maximus head sacrificial priest of the roman dominion the most ancient of all the titles that the emperors had enjoyed     238  xli  the byzantine and sassanid empires   the greekspeaking eastern half of the roman empire showed much more political tenacity than the western half  it weathered the disasters of the fifth century ad which saw a complete and final breaking up of the original latin roman power  attila bullied the emperor theodosius ii and sacked and raided almost to the walls of constantinople but that city remained intact  the nubians came down the nile and looted upper egypt but lower egypt and alexandria were left still fairly prosperous  most of asia minor was held against the sassanid persians  the sixth century which was an age of complete darkness for the west saw indeed a considerable revival of the greek power justinian i 527565 was a ruler of very great ambition and energy and he was married to the empress theodora a woman of quite equal capacity who had begun life as an actress  justinian reconquered north africa from the vandals and most of italy from the goths  he even regained the south of spain  he did not limit his energies to naval and military enterprises  he founded a university built the great church of sta sophia in constantinople and codified the roman law  but in order to destroy a rival to his university foundation he closed the schools of philosophy in athens which had been going on in unbroken continuity from the days of plato that is to say for nearly a thousand years  from the third century onwards the persian empire had been the steadfast rival of the byzantine  the two empires kept asia minor syria and egypt in a state of perpetual unrest and waste in the first century ad these lands were still at a high level of civilization wealthy and with an abundant population but the continual coming and going of armies massacres looting and war taxation wore them down steadily until only shattered and ruinous 239 cities remained upon a countryside of scattered peasants in this melancholy process of impoverishment and disorder lower egypt fared perhaps less badly than the rest of the world alexandria like constantinople continued a dwindling trade between the east and the west  science and political philosophy seemed dead now in both these warring and decaying empires  the last philosophers of athens until their suppression preserved the texts of the great literature of the past with an infinite reverence and want of understanding  but there remained no class of men in the world no free gentlemen with bold and independent habits of thought to carry on the tradition of frank statement and enquiry embodied in these writings  the social and political chaos accounts largely for the disappearance of this class but there was also another reason why the human intelligence was sterile and feverish during this age  in both persia and byzantium it was all age of intolerance  both empires were religious empires in a new way in a way that greatly hampered the free activities of the human mind  illustration the church now a mosque of s sophia constantinople  240  illustration the magnificent roofwork in s sophia  of course the oldest empires in the world were religious empires centring upon the worship of a god or of a godking  alexander was treated as a divinity and the cæsars were gods in so much as they had altars and temples devoted to them and the offering of incense was made a test of loyalty to the roman state  but these older religions were essentially religions of act and fact  they did not invade the mind  if a man offered his sacrifice and bowed to the god he was left not only to think but to say practically whatever he liked about the affair  but the new sort of religions that had come into the world and particularly christianity turned inward  these new faiths demanded not simply conformity but understanding belief  naturally fierce controversy ensued upon the exact meaning of the things believed  these new religions were creed religions  the world was confronted with a new word orthodoxy and with a stern resolve to keep not only acts but speech 241 and private thought within the limits of a set teaching  for to hold a wrong opinion much more to convey it to other people was no longer regarded as an intellectual defect but a moral fault that might condemn a soul to everlasting destruction  illustration the ravenna panel depicting justinian and his court  both ardashir i who founded the sassanid dynasty in the third century ad and constantine the great who reconstructed the roman empire in the fourth turned to religious organizations for help because in these organizations they saw a new means of using and controlling the wills of men  and already before the end of the fourth century both empires were persecuting free talk and religious innovation  in persia ardashir found the ancient persian religion of zoroaster or zarathushtra with its priests and temples and a sacred fire that burnt upon its altars ready for his purpose as a state religion  before the end of the third century zoroastrianism was persecuting christianity and in 277 ad mani the founder of 243 a new faith the manichæans was crucified and his body flayed  constantinople on its side was busy hunting out christian heresies  manichæan ideas infected christianity and had to be fought with the fiercest methods in return ideas from christianity affected the purity of the zoroastrian doctrine  all ideas became suspect  science which demands before all things the free action of an untroubled mind suffered a complete eclipse throughout this phase of intolerance    242  illustration the rock hewn temple at petra    war the bitterest theology and the usual vices of mankind constituted byzantine life of those days  it was picturesque it was romantic it had little sweetness or light  when byzantium and persia were not fighting the barbarians from the north they wasted asia minor and syria in dreary and destructive hostilities even in close alliance these two empires would have found it a hard task to turn back the barbarians and recover their prosperity  the turks or tartars first come into history as the allies first of one power and then of another  in the sixth century the two chief antagonists were justinian and chosroes i in the opening of the seventh the emperor heraclius was pitted against chosroes ii 580  at first and until after heraclius had become emperor 610 chosroes ii carried all before him  he took antioch damascus and jerusalem and his armies reached chalcedon which is in asia minor over against constantinople  in 619 he conquered egypt  then heraclius pressed a counter attack home and routed a persian army at nineveh 627 although at that time there were still persian troops at chalcedon  in 628 chosroes ii was deposed and murdered by his son kavadh and an inconclusive peace was made between the two exhausted empires  byzantium and persia had fought their last war  but few people as yet dreamt of the storm that was even then gathering in the deserts to put an end for ever to this aimless chronic struggle  while heraclius was restoring order in syria a message reached him  it had been brought in to the imperial outpost at bostra south of damascus it was in arabic an obscure semitic desert language and it was read to the emperor if it reached him at all by an interpreter  it was from someone who called himself muhammad the prophet of god  it called upon the emperor to 244 acknowledge the one true god and to serve him  what the emperor said is not recorded  a similar message came to kavadh at ctesiphon  he was annoyed tore up the letter and bade the messenger begone  this muhammad it appeared was a bedouin leader whose headquarters were in the mean little desert town of medina  he was preaching a new religion of faith in the one true god  even so o lord he said rend thou his kingdom from kavadh     245  xlii  the dynasties of suy and tang in china   throughout the fifth sixth seventh and eighth centuries there was a steady drift of mongolian peoples westward  the huns of attila were merely precursors of this advance which led at last to the establishment of mongolian peoples in finland esthonia hungary and bulgaria where their descendants speaking languages akin to turkish survive to this day  the mongolian nomads were in fact playing a role towards the aryanized civilizations of europe and persia and india that the aryans had played to the Ægean and semitic civilizations ten or fifteen centuries before  in central asia the turkish peoples had taken root in what is now western turkestan and persia already employed many turkish officials and turkish mercenaries  the parthians had gone out of history absorbed into the general population of persia  there were no more aryan nomads in the history of central asia mongolian people had replaced them  the turks became masters of asia from china to the caspian  the same great pestilence at the end of the second century ad that had shattered the roman empire had overthrown the han dynasty in china  then came a period of division and of hunnish conquests from which china arose refreshed more rapidly and more completely than europe was destined to do  before the end of the sixth century china was reunited under the suy dynasty and this by the time of heraclius gave place to the tang dynasty whose reign marks another great period of prosperity for china  throughout the seventh eighth and ninth centuries china was the most secure and civilized country in the world  the han dynasty had extended her boundaries in the north the suy and tang dynasties now spread her civilization to the south and china 247 began to assume the proportions she has today  in central asia indeed she reached much further extending at last through tributary turkish tribes to persia and the caspian sea    246  illustration chinese earthenware art of the tang dynasty 616906    the new china that had arisen was a very different land from the old china of the hans  a new and more vigorous literary school appeared there was a great poetic revival buddhism had revolutionized philosophical and religious thought  there were great advances in artistic work in technical skill and in all the amenities of life  tea was first used paper manufactured and woodblock printing began  millions of people indeed were leading orderly graceful and kindly lives in china during these centuries when the attenuated populations of europe and western asia were living either in hovels small walled cities or grim robber fortresses  while the mind of the west was black with theological obsessions the mind of china was open and tolerant and enquiring  one of the earliest monarchs of the tang dynasty was taitsung who began to reign in 627 the year of the victory of heraclius at nineveh  he received an embassy from heraclius who was probably seeking an ally in the rear of persia  from persia itself came a party of christian missionaries 635  they were allowed to explain their creed to taitsung and he examined a chinese translation of their scriptures  he pronounced this strange religion acceptable and gave permission for the foundation of a church and monastery  to this monarch also in 628 came messengers from muhammad  they came to canton on a trading ship  they had sailed the whole way from arabia along the indian coasts  unlike heraclius and kavadh taitsung gave these envoys a courteous hearing  he expressed his interest in their theological ideas and assisted them to build a mosque in canton a mosque which survives it is said to this day the oldest mosque in the world     248  xliii  muhammad and islam   a prophetic amateur of history surveying the world in the opening of the seventh century might have concluded very reasonably that it was only a question of a few centuries before the whole of europe and asia fell under mongolian domination  there were no signs of order or union in western europe and the byzantine and persian empires were manifestly bent upon a mutual destruction india also was divided and wasted  on the other hand china was a steadily expanding empire which probably at that time exceeded all europe in population and the turkish people who were growing to power in central asia were disposed to work in accord with china and such a prophecy would not have been an altogether vain one  a time was to come in the thirteenth century when a mongolian overlord would rule from the danube to the pacific and turkish dynasties were destined to reign over the entire byzantine and persian empires over egypt and most of india  where our prophet would have been most likely to have erred would have been in underestimating the recuperative power of the latin end of europe and in ignoring the latent forces of the arabian desert  arabia would have seemed what it had been for times immemorial the refuge of small and bickering nomadic tribes  no semitic people had founded an empire now for more than a thousand years  then suddenly the bedouin flared out for a brief century of splendour  they spread their rule and language from spain to the boundaries of china  they gave the world a new culture  they created a religion that is still to this day one of the most vital forces in the world  249  the man who fired this arab flame appears first in history as the young husband of the widow of a rich merchant of the town of mecca named muhammad  until he was forty he did very little to distinguish himself in the world  he seems to have taken considerable interest in religious discussion  mecca was a pagan city at that time worshipping in particular a black stone the kaaba of great repute throughout all arabia and a centre of pilgrimages but there were great numbers of jews in the countryindeed all the southern portion of arabia professed the jewish faithand there were christian churches in syria  about forty muhammad began to develop prophetic characteristics like those of the hebrew prophets twelve hundred years before him he talked first to his wife of the one true god and of the rewards and punishments of virtue and wickedness  there can be no doubt that his thoughts were very strongly influenced by jewish and christian ideas  he gathered about him a small circle of believers and presently began to preach in the town against the prevalent idolatry  this made him extremely unpopular with his fellow townsmen because the pilgrimages to the kaaba were the chief source of such prosperity as mecca enjoyed  he became bolder and more definite in his teaching declaring himself to be the last chosen prophet of god entrusted with a mission to perfect religion  abraham he declared and jesus christ were his forerunners  he had been chosen to complete and perfect the revelation of gods will  he produced verses which he said had been communicated to him by an angel and he had a strange vision in which he was taken up through the heavens to god and instructed in his mission  as his teaching increased in force the hostility of his fellow townsmen increased also  at last a plot was made to kill him but he escaped with his faithful friend and disciple abu bekr to the friendly town of medina which adopted his doctrine  hostilities followed between mecca and medina which ended at last in a treaty mecca was to adopt the worship of the one true god and accept muhammad as his prophet but the adherents of the new faith were still to make the pilgrimage to mecca just as they had done when they were pagans  so muhammad established the one true god in 251 mecca without injuring its pilgrim traffic  in 629 muhammad returned to mecca as its master a year after he had sent out these envoys of his to heraclius taitsung kavadh and all the rulers of the earth    250  illustration at prayer in the desert  illustration looking across the sea of sand    then for four years more until his death in 632 muhammad spread his power over the rest of arabia  he married a number of wives in his declining years and his life on the whole was by modern standards unedifying  he seems to have been a man compounded of very considerable vanity greed cunning selfdeception and quite sincere religious passion  he dictated a book of injunctions and expositions the koran which he declared was communicated to him from god  regarded as literature or philosophy the koran is certainly unworthy of its alleged divine authorship  yet when the manifest defects of muhammads life and writings have been allowed for there remains in islam this faith he imposed upon the arabs much power and inspiration  one is its uncompromising monotheism its simple enthusiastic faith in the rule and fatherhood of god and its freedom from theological complications  another is its complete detachment from the sacrificial priest and the temple  it is an entirely prophetic religion proof against any possibility of relapse towards blood sacrifices  in the koran the limited 252 and ceremonial nature of the pilgrimage to mecca is stated beyond the possibility of dispute and every precaution was taken by muhammad to prevent the deification of himself after his death  and a third element of strength lay in the insistence of islam upon the perfect brotherhood and equality before god of all believers whatever their colour origin or status  these are the things that made islam a power in human affairs  it has been said that the true founder of the empire of islam was not so much muhammad as his friend and helper abu bekr  if muhammad with his shifty character was the mind and imagination of primitive islam abu bekr was its conscience and its will whenever muhammad wavered abu bekr sustained him  and when muhammad died abu bekr became caliph  successor and with that faith that moves mountains he set himself simply and sanely to organize the subjugation of the whole world to allahwith little armies of 3000 or 4000 arabsaccording to those letters the prophet had written from medina in 628 to all the monarchs of the world     253  xliv  the great days of the arabs   there follows the most amazing story of conquest in the whole history of our race  the byzantine army was smashed at the battle of the yarmuk a tributary of the jordan in 634 and the emperor heraclius his energy sapped by dropsy and his resources exhausted by the persian war saw his new conquests in syria damascus palmyra antioch jerusalem and the rest fall almost without resistance to the moslim  large elements in the population went over to islam  then the moslim turned east  the persians had found an able general in rustam they had a great host with a force of elephants and for three days they fought the arabs at kadessia 637 and broke at last in headlong rout  the conquest of all persia followed and the moslem empire pushed far into western turkestan and eastward until it met the chinese egypt fell almost without resistance to the new conquerors who full of a fanatical belief in the sufficiency of the koran wiped out the vestiges of the bookcopying industry of the alexandria library  the tide of conquest poured along the north coast of africa to the straits of gibraltar and spain  spain was invaded in 710 and the pyrenees mountains were reached in 720  in 732 the arab advance had reached the centre of france but here it was stopped for good at the battle of poitiers and thrust back as far as the pyrenees again  the conquest of egypt had given the moslim a fleet and for a time it looked as though they would take constantinople  they made repeated sea attacks between 672 and 718 but the great city held out against them  the arabs had little political aptitude and no political experience and this great empire with its capital now at damascus which stretched from spain to china was destined to break up very speedily from the very beginning doctrinal differences undermined 254 its unity  but our interest here lies not with the story of its political disintegration but with its effect upon the human mind and upon the general destinies of our race  the arab intelligence had been flung across the world even more swiftly and dramatically than had the greek a thousand years before  the intellectual stimulation of the whole world west of china the breakup of old ideas and development of new ones was enormous  map the growth of the moslem power in 25 years  map the moslem empire 750 ad  255  in persia this fresh excited arabic mind came into contact not only with manichæan zoroastrian and christian doctrine but with the scientific greek literature preserved not only in greek but in syrian translations  it found greek learning in egypt also everywhere and particularly in spain it discovered an active jewish tradition of speculation and discussion  in central asia it met buddhism and the material achievements of chinese civilization  it learnt the manufacture of paperwhich made printed books possiblefrom the chinese  and finally it came into touch with indian mathematics and philosophy  illustration jerusalem showing the mosque of omar  very speedily the intolerant selfsufficiency of the early days of faith which made the koran seem the only possible book was dropped learning sprang up everywhere in the footsteps of the arab conquerors  by the eighth century there was an educational 256 organization throughout the whole arabized world  in the ninth learned men in the schools of cordoba in spain were corresponding with learned men in cairo bagdad bokhara and samarkand  the jewish mind assimilated very readily with the arab and for a time the two semitic races worked together through the medium of arabic  long after the political breakup and enfeeblement of the arabs this intellectual community of the arabspeaking world endured  it was still producing very considerable results in the thirteenth century  illustration view of cairo mosques  so it was that the systematic accumulation and criticism of facts which was first begun by the greeks was resumed in this astonishing renascence of the semitic world  the seed of aristotle and the museum of alexandria that had lain so long inactive and neglected now germinated and began to grow towards fruition  very great advances were made in mathematical medical and physical science  257 the clumsy roman numerals were ousted by the arabic figures we use to this day and the zero sign was first employed  the very name algebra is arabic  so is the word chemistry  the names of such stars as algol aldebaran and boötes preserve the traces of arab conquests in the sky  their philosophy was destined to reanimate the medieval philosophy of france and italy and the whole christian world  the arab experimental chemists were called alchemists and they were still sufficiently barbaric in spirit to keep their methods and results secret as far as possible  they realized from the very beginning what enormous advantages their possible discoveries might give them and what farreaching consequences they might have on human life  they came upon many metallurgical and technical devices of the utmost value alloys and dyes distilling tinctures and essences optical glass but the two chief ends they sought they sought in vain  one was the philosophers stonea means of changing the metallic elements one into another and so getting a control of artificial gold and the other was the elixir vitoe a stimulant that would revivify age and prolong life indefinitely  the crabbed patient experimenting of these arab alchemists spread into the christian world  the fascination of their enquiries spread  very gradually the activities of these alchemists became more social and cooperative  they found it profitable to exchange and compare ideas  by insensible gradations the last of the alchemists became the first of the experimental philosophers  the old alchemists sought the philosophers stone which was to transmute base metals to gold and an elixir of immortality they found the methods of modern experimental science which promise in the end to give man illimitable power over the world and over his own destiny     258  xlv  the development of latin christendom   it is worth while to note the extremely shrunken dimensions of the share of the world remaining under aryan control in the seventh and eighth centuries  a thousand years before the aryanspeaking races were triumphant over all the civilized world west of china now the mongol had thrust as far as hungary nothing of asia remained under aryan rule except the byzantine dominions in asia minor and all africa was lost and nearly all spain  the great hellenic world had shrunken to a few possessions round the nucleus of the trading city of constantinople and the memory of the roman world was kept alive by the latin of the western christian priests  in vivid contrast to this tale of retrogression the semitic tradition had risen again from subjugation and obscurity after a thousand years of darkness  yet the vitality of the nordic peoples was not exhausted confined now to central and northwestern europe and terribly muddled in their social and political ideas they were nevertheless building up gradually and steadily a new social order and preparing unconsciously for the recovery of a power even more extensive than that they had previously enjoyed  we have told how at the beginning of the sixth century there remained no central government in western europe at all  that world was divided up among numbers of local rulers holding their own as they could  this was too insecure a state of affairs to last a system of cooperation and association grew up in this disorder the feudal system which has left its traces upon european life up to the present time  this feudal system was a sort of crystallization of society about power  everywhere the lone man felt insecure and was prepared to barter a certain amount of his liberty for help and protection  he sought a stronger man as his lord and protector 259 he gave him military services and paid him dues and in return he was confirmed in his possession of what was his  his lord again found safety in vassalage to a still greater lord  cities also found it convenient to have feudal protectors and monasteries and church estates bound themselves by similar ties  no doubt in many cases allegiance was claimed before it was offered the system grew downward as well as upward so a sort of pyramidal system grew up varying widely in different localities permitting at first a considerable play of violence and private warfare but making steadily for order and a new reign of law  the pyramids grew up until some became recognizable as kingdoms  already by the early sixth century a frankish kingdom existed under its founder clovis in what is now france and the netherlands and presently visigothic and lombard and gothic kingdoms were in existence  the moslim when they crossed the pyrenees in 720 found this frankish kingdom under the practical rule of charles martel the mayor of the palace of a degenerate descendant of clovis and experienced the decisive defeat of poitiers 732 at his hands this charles martel was practically overlord of europe north of the alps from the pyrenees to hungary  he ruled over a multitude of subordinate lords speaking frenchlatin and high and low german languages  his son pepin extinguished the last descendants of clovis and took the kingly state and title  his grandson charlemagne who began to reign in 768 found himself lord of a realm so large that he could think of reviving the title of latin emperor  he conquered north italy and made himself master of rome  approaching the story of europe as we do from the wider horizons of a world history we can see much more distinctly than the mere nationalist historian how cramping and disastrous this tradition of the latin roman empire was  a narrow intense struggle for this phantom predominance was to consume european energy for more than a thousand years  through all that period it is possible to trace certain unquenchable antagonisms they run through the wits of europe like the obsessions of a demented mind  one driving force was this ambition of successful rulers which charlemagne charles the great embodied to become cæsar  the realm of charlemagne consisted of a complex of feudal german states at 260 various stages of barbarism  west of the rhine most of these german peoples had learnt to speak various latinized dialects which fused at last to form french  east of the rhine the racially similar german peoples did not lose their german speech  on account of this communication was difficult between these two groups of barbarian conquerors and a split easily brought about  the split was made the more easy by the fact that the frankish usage made it seem natural to divide the empire of charlemagne among his sons at his death  so one aspect of the history of europe from the days of charlemagne onwards is a history of first this monarch and his family and then that struggling to a precarious headship of the kings princes dukes bishops and cities of europe while a steadily deepening antagonism between the french and german speaking elements develops in the medley  there was a formality of election for each emperor and the climax of his ambition was to struggle to the possession of that wornout misplaced capital rome and to a coronation there  map area more or less under frankish dominion in the time of charles martel  261  the next factor in the european political disorder was the resolve of the church at rome to make no temporal prince but the pope of rome himself emperor in effect  he was already pontifex maximus for all practical purposes he held the decaying city if he had no armies he had at least a vast propaganda organization in his priests throughout the whole latin world if he had little power over mens bodies he held the keys of heaven and hell in their imaginations and could exercise much influence upon their souls so throughout the middle ages while one prince manoeuvred against another first for equality then for ascendancy and at last for the supreme prize the pope of rome sometimes boldly sometimes craftily sometimes feeblyfor the popes were a succession of oldish men and the average reign of a pope was not more than two yearsmanoeuvred for the submission of all the princes to himself as the ultimate overlord of christendom  but these antagonisms of prince against prince and of emperor against pope do not by any means exhaust the factors of the european confusion  there was still an emperor in constantinople speaking greek and claiming the allegiance of all europe  when charlemagne sought to revive the empire it was merely the latin end of the empire he revived  it was natural that a sense of rivalry between latin empire and greek empire should develop very readily  and still more readily did the rivalry of greekspeaking christianity and the newer latinspeaking version develop  the pope of rome claimed to be the successor of st peter the chief of the apostles of christ and the head of the christian community everywhere  neither the emperor nor the patriarch in constantinople were disposed to acknowledge this claim  a dispute about a fine point in the doctrine of the holy trinity consummated a long series of dissensions in a final rupture in 1054  the latin church and the greek church became and remained thereafter distinct and frankly antagonistic  this antagonism must be added to the others in our estimate of the conflicts that wasted latin christendom in the middle ages  upon this divided world of christendom rained the blows of three sets of antagonists  about the baltic and north seas remained a series of nordic tribes who were only very slowly and reluctantly 263 christianized these were the northmen  they had taken to the sea and piracy and were raiding all the christian coasts down to spain  they had pushed up the russian rivers to the desolate central lands and brought their shipping over into the southflowing rivers  they had come out upon the caspian and black seas as pirates also  they set up principalities in russia they were the first people to be called russians  these northmen russians came near to taking constantinople  england in the early ninth century was a christianized low german country under a king egbert a protégé and pupil of charlemagne  the northmen wrested half the kingdom from his successor alfred the great 886 and finally under canute 1016 made themselves masters of the whole land  under rolph the ganger 912 another band of northmen conquered the north of france which became normandy    262  illustration statue of charlemagne in front of notre dame paris    canute ruled not only over england but over norway and denmark but his brief empire fell to pieces at his death through that political weakness of the barbaric peoplesdivision among a rulers sons  it is interesting to speculate what might have happened if this temporary union of the northmen had endured they were a race of astonishing boldness and energy  they sailed in their galleys even to iceland and greenland  they were the first europeans to land on american soil  later on norman adventurers were to recover sicily from the saracens and sack rome  it is a fascinating thing to imagine what a great northern seafaring power might have grown out of canutes kingdom reaching from america to russia  to the east of the germans and latinized europeans was a medley of slav tribes and turkish peoples  prominent among these were the magyars or hungarians who were coming westward throughout the eighth and ninth centuries  charlemagne held them for a time but after his death they established themselves in what is now hungary and after the fashion of their kindred predecessors the huns raided every summer into the settled parts of europe  in 938 they went through germany into france crossed the alps into north italy and so came home burning robbing and destroying  finally pounding away from the south at the vestiges of the 264 roman empire were the saracens  they had made themselves largely masters of the sea their only formidable adversaries upon the water were the northmen the russian northmen out of the black sea and the northmen of the west  map europe at the death of charlemagne814  hemmed in by these more vigorous and aggressive peoples amidst forces they did not understand and dangers they could not estimate charlemagne and after him a series of other ambitious spirits took up the futile drama of restoring the western empire under the name of the holy roman empire  from the time of charlemagne onward this idea obsessed the political life of western europe while in the east the greek half of the roman power decayed and dwindled until at last nothing remained of it at all but the corrupt trading city of constantinople and a few miles of territory about it  politically the continent of europe remained traditional and uncreative from the time of charlemagne onward for a thousand years  265  the name of charlemagne looms large in european history but his personality is but indistinctly seen  he could not read nor write but he had a considerable respect for learning he liked to be read aloud to at meals and he had a weakness for theological discussion  at his winter quarters at aixlachapelle or mayence he gathered about him a number of learned men and picked up much from their conversation  in the summer he made war against the spanish saracens against the slavs and magyars against the saxons and other still heathen german tribes  it is doubtful whether the idea of becoming cæsar in succession to romulus augustulus occurred to him before his acquisition of north italy or whether it was suggested to him by pope leo iii who was anxious to make the latin church independent of constantinople  there were the most extraordinary manoeuvres at rome between the pope and the prospective emperor in order to make it appear or not appear as if the pope gave him the imperial crown  the pope succeeded in crowning his visitor and conqueror by surprise in st peters on christmas day 800 ad  he produced a crown put it on the head of charlemagne and hailed him cæsar and augustus  there was great applause among the people  charlemagne was by no means pleased at the way in which the thing was done it rankled in his mind as a defeat and he left the most careful instructions to his son that he was not to let the pope crown him emperor he was to seize the crown into his own hands and put it on his own head himself  so at the very outset of this imperial revival we see beginning the agelong dispute of pope and emperor for priority but louis the pious the son of charlemagne disregarded his fathers instructions and was entirely submissive to the pope  the empire of charlemagne fell apart at the death of louis the pious and the split between the frenchspeaking franks and the germanspeaking franks widened  the next emperor to arise was otto the son of a certain henry the fowler a saxon who had been elected king of germany by an assembly of german princes and prelates in 919  otto descended upon rome and was crowned emperor there in 962  this saxon line came to an end early in the eleventh century and gave place to other german rulers  the feudal princes and nobles to the west who spoke various french dialects 266 did not fall under the sway of these german emperors after the carlovingian line the line that is descended from charlemagne had come to an end and no part of britain ever came into the holy roman empire  the duke of normandy the king of france and a number of lesser feudal rulers remained outside in 987 the kingdom of france passed out of the possession of the carlovingian line into the hands of hugh capet whose descendants were still reigning in the eighteenth century  at the time of hugh capet the king of france ruled only a comparatively small territory round paris  in 1066 england was attacked almost simultaneously by an invasion of the norwegian northmen under king harold hardrada and by the latinized northmen under the duke of normandy  harold king of england defeated the former at the battle of stamford bridge and was defeated by the latter at hastings  england was conquered by the normans and so cut off from scandinavian teutonic and russian affairs and brought into the most intimate relations and conflicts with the french  for the next four centuries the english were entangled in the conflicts of the french feudal princes and wasted upon the fields of france     267  xlvi  the crusades and the age of papal dominion   it is interesting to note that charlemagne corresponded with the caliph harounalraschid the harounalraschid of the arabian nights  it is recorded that harounalraschid sent ambassadors from bagdadwhich had now replaced damascus as the moslem capitalwith a splendid tent a water clock an elephant and the keys of the holy sepulchre  this latter present was admirably calculated to set the byzantine empire and this new holy roman empire by the ears as to which was the proper protector of the christians in jerusalem  these presents remind us that while europe in the ninth century was still a weltering disorder of war and pillage there flourished a great arab empire in egypt and mesopotamia far more civilized than anything europe could show  here literature and science still lived the arts flourished and the mind of man could move without fear or superstition  and even in spain and north africa where the saracenic dominions were falling into political confusion there was a vigorous intellectual life aristotle was read and discussed by these jews and arabs during these centuries of european darkness  they guarded the neglected seeds of science and philosophy  northeast of the caliphs dominions was a number of turkish tribes  they had been converted to islam and they held the faith much more simply and fiercely than the actively intellectual arabs and persians to the south  in the tenth century the turks were growing strong and vigorous while the arab power was divided and decaying  the relations of the turks to the empire of the caliphate became very similar to the relations of the medes to the last babylonian empire fourteen centuries before  in the eleventh century a group of turkish tribes the seljuk turks came down into mesopotamia and made the caliph their nominal ruler but really their 268 captive and tool  they conquered armenia then they struck at the remnants of the byzantine power in asia minor  in 1071 the byzantine army was utterly smashed at the battle of melasgird and the turks swept forward until not a trace of byzantine rule remained in asia  they took the fortress of nicæa over against constantinople and prepared to attempt that city  the byzantine emperor michael vii was overcome with terror  he was already heavily engaged in warfare with a band of norman adventurers who had seized durazzo and with a fierce turkish people the petschenegs who were raiding over the danube  in his extremity he sought help where he could and it is notable that he did not appeal to the western emperor but to the pope of rome as the head of latin christendom  he wrote to pope gregory vii and his successor alexius comnenus wrote still more urgently to urban ii  illustration crusader tombs in exeter cathedral  this was not a quarter of a century from the rupture of the latin and greek churches  that controversy was still vividly alive in mens minds and this disaster to byzantium must have presented itself to the pope as a supreme opportunity for reasserting the supremacy of the latin church over the dissentient greeks moreover this occasion gave the pope a chance to deal with two other matters that troubled western christendom very greatly  one was the custom of private war which disordered social life and the other was the superabundant fighting energy of the low germans and christianized northmen and particularly of the franks and normans  a religious war the crusade the war of the cross was 269 preached against the turkish captors of jerusalem and a truce to all warfare amongst christians 1095  the declared object of this war was the recovery of the holy sepulchre from the unbelievers  a man called peter the hermit carried on a popular propaganda throughout france and germany on broadly democratic lines  he went clad in a coarse garment barefooted on an ass he carried a huge cross and harangued the crowd in street or marketplace or church  he denounced the cruelties practised upon the christian pilgrims by the turks and the shame of the holy sepulchre being in any but christian hands  the fruits of centuries of christian teaching became apparent in the response a great wave of enthusiasm swept the western world and popular christendom discovered itself  illustration view of cairo  such a widespread uprising of the common people in relation to a single idea as now occurred was a new thing in the history of our race  there is nothing to parallel it in the previous history of the 270 roman empire or of india or china  on a smaller scale however there had been similar movements among the jewish people after their liberation from the babylonian captivity and later on islam was to display a parallel susceptibility to collective feeling  such movements were certainly connected with the new spirit that had come into life with the development of the missionaryteaching religions  the hebrew prophets jesus and his disciples mani muhammad were all exhorters of mens individual souls  they brought the personal conscience face to face with god  before that time religion had been much more a business of fetish of pseudoscience than of conscience  the old kind of religion turned upon temple initiated priest and mystical sacrifice and ruled the common man like a slave by fear  the new kind of religion made a man of him  the preaching of the first crusade was the first stirring of the common people in european history  it may be too much to call it the birth of modern democracy but certainly at that time modern democracy stirred  before very long we shall find it stirring again and raising the most disturbing social and religious questions  certainly this first stirring of democracy ended very pitifully and lamentably  considerable bodies of common people crowds rather than armies set out eastward from france and the rhineland and central europe without waiting for leaders or proper equipment to rescue the holy sepulchre  this was the peoples crusade two great mobs blundered into hungary mistook the recently converted magyars for pagans committed atrocities and were massacred  a third multitude with a similarly confused mind after a great pogrom of the jews in the rhineland marched eastward and was also destroyed in hungary  two other huge crowds under the leadership of peter the hermit himself reached constantinople crossed the bosphorus and were massacred rather than defeated by the seljuk turks  so began and ended this first movement of the european people as people  next year 1097 the real fighting forces crossed the bosphorus essentially they were norman in leadership and spirit  they stormed nicæa marched by much the same route as alexander had followed fourteen centuries before to antioch  the siege of antioch 271 kept them a year and in june 1099 they invested jerusalem  it was stormed after a months siege  the slaughter was terrible  men riding on horseback were splashed by the blood in the streets  at nightfall on july 15th the crusaders had fought their way into the church of the holy sepulchre and overcome all opposition there bloodstained weary and sobbing from excess of joy they knelt down in prayer  illustration the horses of s mark venice  immediately the hostility of latin and greek broke out again  the crusaders were the servants of the latin church and the greek patriarch of jerusalem found himself in a far worse case under the triumphant latins than under the turks  the crusaders discovered themselves between byzantine and turk and fighting both  much of asia minor was recovered by the byzantine empire and the latin princes were left a buffer between turk and greek with jerusalem and a few small principalities of which edessa was one of the chief in syria  their grip even on these possessions was precarious and in 1144 edessa fell to the moslim leading to an ineffective second crusade which failed to recover edessa but saved antioch from a similar fate  272  in 1169 the forces of islam were rallied under a kurdish adventurer named saladin who had made himself master of egypt  he preached a holy war against the christians recaptured jerusalem in 1187 and so provoked the third crusade  this failed to recover jerusalem  in the fourth crusade 12024 the latin church turned frankly upon the greek empire and there was not even a pretence of fighting the turks  it started from venice and in 1204 it stormed constantinople  the great rising trading city of venice was the leader in this adventure and most of the coasts and islands of the byzantine empire were annexed by the venetians a latin emperor baldwin of flanders was set up in constantinople and the latin and greek church were declared to be reunited  the latin emperors ruled in constantinople from 1204 to 1261 when the greek world shook itself free again from roman predominance  the twelfth century then and the opening of the thirteenth was the age of papal ascendancy just as the eleventh was the age of the ascendancy of the seljuk turks and the tenth the age of the northmen  a united christendom under the rule of the pope came nearer to being a working reality than it ever was before or after that time  in those centuries a simple christian faith was real and widespread over great areas of europe  rome itself had passed through some dark and discreditable phases few writers can be found to excuse the lives of popes john xi and john xii in the tenth century they were abominable creatures but the heart and body of latin christendom had remained earnest and simple the generality of the common priests and monks and nuns had lived exemplary and faithful lives  upon the wealth of confidence such lives created rested the power of the church  among the great popes of the past had been gregory the great gregory i 590604 and leo iii 795816 who invited charlemagne to be cæsar and crowned him in spite of himself  towards the close of the eleventh century there arose a great clerical statesman hildebrand who ended his life as pope gregory vii 10731085 next but one after him came urban ii 10871099 the pope of the first crusade  these two were the founders of this period of papal greatness during which the popes lorded it over the emperors  from bulgaria to ireland and 274 from norway to sicily and jerusalem the pope was supreme  gregory vii obliged the emperor henry iv to come in penitence to him at canossa and to await forgiveness for three days and nights in the courtyard of the castle clad in sackcloth and barefooted to the snow  in 1176 at venice the emperor frederick frederick barbarossa knelt to pope alexander iii and swore fealty to him    273  illustration a courtyard in the alhambra    the great power of the church in the beginning of the eleventh century lay in the wills and consciences of men  it failed to retain the moral prestige on which its power was based  in the opening decades of the fourteenth century it was discovered that the power of the pope had evaporated  what was it that destroyed the naive confidence of the common people of christendom in the church so that they would no longer rally to its appeal and serve its purposes  the first trouble was certainly the accumulation of wealth by the church  the church never died and there was a frequent disposition on the part of dying childless people to leave lands to the church  penitent sinners were exhorted to do so accordingly in many european countries as much as a fourth of the land became church property  the appetite for property grows with what it feeds upon  already in the thirteenth century it was being said everywhere that the priests were not good men that they were always hunting for money and legacies  the kings and princes disliked this alienation of property very greatly  in the place of feudal lords capable of military support they found their land supporting abbeys and monks and nuns  and these lands were really under foreign dominion  even before the time of pope gregory vii there had been a struggle between the princes and the papacy over the question of investitures the question that is of who should appoint the bishops  if that power rested with the pope and not the king then the latter lost control not only of the consciences of his subjects but of a considerable part of his dominions  for also the clergy claimed exemption from taxation  they paid their taxes to rome  and not only that but the church also claimed the right to levy a tax of onetenth upon the property of the layman in addition to the taxes he paid his prince  275  the history of nearly every country in latin christendom tells of the same phase in the eleventh century a phase of struggle between monarch and pope on the issue of investitures and generally it tells of a victory for the pope  he claimed to be able to excommunicate the prince to absolve his subjects from their allegiance to him to recognize a successor  he claimed to be able to put a nation under an interdict and then nearly all priestly functions ceased except the sacraments of baptism confirmation and penance the priests could neither hold the ordinary services marry people nor bury the dead  with these two weapons it was possible for the twelfth century popes to curb the most recalcitrant princes and overawe the most restive peoples  these were enormous powers and enormous powers are only to be used on extraordinary occasions  the popes used them at last with a frequency that staled their effect  within thirty years at the end of the twelfth century we find scotland france and england in turn under an interdict  and also the popes could not resist the temptation to preach crusades against offending princesuntil the crusading spirit was extinct  it is possible that if the church of rome had struggled simply against the princes and had had a care to keep its hold upon the general mind it might have achieved a permanent dominion over all christendom  but the high claims of the pope were reflected as arrogance in the conduct of the clergy  before the eleventh century the roman priests could marry they had close ties with the people among whom they lived they were indeed a part of the people  gregory vii made them celibates he cut the priests off from too great an intimacy with the laymen in order to bind them more closely to rome but indeed he opened a fissure between the church and the commonalty  the church had its own law courts cases involving not merely priests but monks students crusaders widows orphans and the helpless were reserved for the clerical courts and so were all matters relating to wills marriages and oaths and all cases of sorcery heresy and blasphemy  whenever the layman found himself in conflict with the priest he had to go to a clerical court  the obligations of peace and war fell upon his shoulders alone and left the priest free  it is no great wonder that jealousy and hatred of the priests grew up in the christian world  276  never did rome seem to realize that its power was in the consciences of common men  it fought against religious enthusiasm which should have been its ally and it forced doctrinal orthodoxy upon honest doubt and aberrant opinion  when the church interfered in matters of morality it had the common man with it but not when it interfered in matters of doctrine  when in the south of france waldo taught a return to the simplicity of jesus in faith and life innocent iii preached a crusade against the waldenses waldos followers and permitted them to be suppressed with fire sword rape and the most abominable cruelties  when again st francis of assisi 11811226 taught the imitation of christ and a life of poverty and service his followers the franciscans were persecuted scourged imprisoned and dispersed  in 1318 four of them were burnt alive at marseilles  on the other hand the fiercely orthodox order of the dominicans founded by st dominic 11701221 was strongly supported by innocent iii who with its assistance set up an organization the inquisition for the hunting of heresy and the affliction of free thought  so it was that the church by excessive claims by unrighteous privileges and by an irrational intolerance destroyed that free faith of the common man which was the final source of all its power  the story of its decline tells of no adequate foemen from without but continually of decay from within     277  xlvii  recalcitrant princes and the great schism   one very great weakness of the roman church in its struggle to secure the headship of all christendom was the manner in which the pope was chosen  if indeed the papacy was to achieve its manifest ambition and establish one rule and one peace throughout christendom then it was vitally necessary that it should have a strong steady and continuous direction  in those great days of its opportunity it needed before all things that the popes when they took office should be able men in the prime of life that each should have his successordesignate with whom he could discuss the policy of the church and that the forms and processes of election should be clear definite unalterable and unassailable  unhappily none of these things obtained  it was not even clear who could vote in the election of a pope nor whether the byzantine or holy roman emperor had a voice in the matter  that very great papal statesman hildebrand pope gregory vii 10731085 did much to regularize the election  he confined the votes to the roman cardinals and he reduced the emperors share to a formula of assent conceded to him by the church but he made no provision for a successordesignate and he left it possible for the disputes of the cardinals to keep the see vacant as in some cases it was kept vacant for a year or more  the consequences of this want of firm definition are to be seen in the whole history of the papacy up to the sixteenth century  from quite early times onward there were disputed elections and two or more men each claiming to be pope  the church would then be subjected to the indignity of going to the emperor or some other outside arbiter to settle the dispute  and the career of everyone of the great popes ended in a note of interrogation  at his death the church might be left headless and as ineffective as a decapitated 279 body  or he might be replaced by some old rival eager only to discredit and undo his work  or some enfeebled old man tottering on the brink of the grave might succeed him    278  illustration milan cathedral    it was inevitable that this peculiar weakness of the papal organization should attract the interference of the various german princes the french king and the norman and french kings who ruled in england that they should all try to influence the elections and have a pope in their own interest established in the lateran palace at rome  and the more powerful and important the pope became in european affairs the more urgent did these interventions become  under the circumstances it is no great wonder that many of the popes were weak and futile  the astonishing thing is that many of them were able and courageous men  one of the most vigorous and interesting of the popes of this great period was innocent iii 11981216 who was so fortunate as to become pope before he was thirtyeight  he and his successors were pitted against an even more interesting personality the emperor frederick ii stupor mundi he was called the wonder of the world  the struggle of this monarch against rome is a turning place in history  in the end rome defeated him and destroyed his dynasty but he left the prestige of the church and pope so badly wounded that its wounds festered and led to its decay  frederick was the son of the emperor henry vi and his mother was the daughter of roger i the norman king of sicily  he inherited this kingdom in 1198 when he was a child of four years  innocent iii had been made his guardian  sicily in those days had been but recently conquered by the normans the court was half oriental and full of highly educated arabs and some of these were associated in the education of the young king  no doubt they were at some pains to make their point of view clear to him  he got a moslem view of christianity as well as a christian view of islam and the unhappy result of this double system of instruction was a view exceptional in that age of faith that all religions were impostures  he talked freely on the subject his heresies and blasphemies are on record  as the young man grew up he found himself in conflict with his guardian  innocent iii wanted altogether too much from his ward 280 when the opportunity came for frederick to succeed as emperor the pope intervened with conditions  frederick must promise to put down heresy in germany with a strong hand moreover he must relinquish his crown in sicily and south italy because otherwise he would be too strong for the pope  and the german clergy were to be freed from all taxation  frederick agreed but with no intention of keeping his word  the pope had already induced the french king to make war upon his own subjects in france the cruel and bloody crusade against the waldenses he wanted frederick to do the same thing in germany  but frederick being far more of a heretic than any of the simple pietists who had incurred the popes animosity lacked the crusading impulse and when innocent urged him to crusade against the moslim and recover jerusalem he was equally ready to promise and equally slack in his performance  illustration a typical crusader don rodrigo de cardenas  having secured the imperial crown frederick ii stayed in sicily which he greatly preferred to germany as a residence and did nothing to redeem any of his promises to innocent iii who died baffled in 1216  281  honorius iii who succeeded innocent could do no better with frederick and gregory ix 1227 came to the papal throne evidently resolved to settle accounts with this young man at any cost  he excommunicated him  frederick ii was denied all the comforts of religion  in the halfarab court of sicily this produced singularly little discomfort  and also the pope addressed a public letter to the emperor reciting his vices which were indisputable his heresies and his general misconduct  to this frederick replied in a document of diabolical ability  it was addressed to all the princes of europe and it made the first clear statement of the issue between the pope and the princes  he made a shattering attack upon the manifest ambition of the pope to become the absolute ruler of all europe  he suggested a union of princes against this usurpation   he directed the attention of the princes specifically to the wealth of the church  having fired off this deadly missile frederick resolved to perform his twelveyearold promise and go upon a crusade  this was the sixth crusade 1228  it was as a crusade farcical  frederick ii went to egypt and met and discussed affairs with the sultan these two gentlemen both of sceptical opinions exchanged congenial views made a commercial convention to their mutual advantage and agreed to transfer jerusalem to frederick  this indeed was a new sort of crusade a crusade by private treaty here was no blood splashing the conqueror no weeping with excess of joy  as this astonishing crusader was an excommunicated man he had to be content with a purely secular coronation as king of jerusalem taking the crown from the altar with his own handfor all the clergy were bound to shun him  he then returned to italy chased the papal armies which had invaded his dominions back to their own territories and obliged the pope to grant him absolution from his excommunication  so a prince might treat the pope in the thirteenth century and there was now no storm of popular indignation to avenge him  those days were past  in 1239 gregory ix resumed his struggle with frederick excommunicated him for a second time and renewed that warfare of public abuse in which the papacy had already suffered severely the controversy was revived after gregory ix was dead when innocent iv 282 was pope and again a devastating letter which men were bound to remember was written by frederick against the church  he denounced the pride and irreligion of the clergy and ascribed all the corruptions of the time to their pride and wealth  he proposed to his fellow princes a general confiscation of church propertyfor the good of the church  it was a suggestion that never afterwards left the imagination of the european princes  we will not go on to tell of his last years  the particular events of his life are far less significant than its general atmosphere  it is possible to piece together something of his court life in sicily  he was luxurious in his way of living and fond of beautiful things  he is described as licentious  but it is clear that he was a man of very effectual curiosity and inquiry  he gathered jewish and moslem as well as christian philosophers at his court and he did much to irrigate the italian mind with saracenic influences  through him the arabic numerals and algebra were introduced to christian students and among other philosophers at his court was michael scott who translated portions of aristotle and the commentaries thereon of the great arab philosopher averroes of cordoba  in 1224 frederick founded the university of naples and he enlarged and enriched the great medical school at salerno university  he also founded a zoological garden  he left a book on hawking which shows him to have been an acute observer of the habits of birds and he was one of the first italians to write italian verse  italian poetry was indeed born at his court  he has been called by an able writer the first of the moderns and the phrase expresses aptly the unprejudiced detachment of his intellectual side  a still more striking intimation of the decay of the living and sustaining forces of the papacy appeared when presently the popes came into conflict with the growing power of the french king during the lifetime of the emperor frederick ii germany fell into disunion and the french king began to play the role of guard supporter and rival to the pope that had hitherto fallen to the hohenstaufen emperors  a series of popes pursued the policy of supporting the french monarchs  french princes were established in the kingdom of sicily and naples with the support and approval of rome and the french kings saw before them the possibility of 283 restoring and ruling the empire of charlemagne  when however the german interregnum after the death of frederick ii the last of the hohenstaufens came to all end and rudolf of habsburg was elected first habsburg emperor 1273 the policy of rome began to fluctuate between france and germany veering about with the sympathies of each successive pope  in the east in 1261 the greeks recaptured constantinople from the latin emperors and the founder of the new greek dynasty michael palæologus michael viii after some unreal tentatives of reconciliation with the pope broke away from the roman communion altogether and with that and the fall of the latin kingdoms in asia the eastward ascendancy of the popes came to an end  illustration costumes of the burgundian nobility flemish work of the fifteenth century  in 1294 boniface viii became pope  he was an italian hostile to the french and full of a sense of the great traditions and mission of rome  for a time he carried things with a high hand in 1300 he held a jubilee and a vast multitude of pilgrims assembled in rome  so great was the influx of money into the papal treasury that two assistants were kept busy with the rakes collecting the 284 offerings that were deposited at the tomb of st peter  5  but this festival was a delusive triumph boniface came into conflict with the french king in 1302 and in 1303 as he was about to pronounce sentence of excommunication against that  monarch he was surprised and arrested in his own ancestral palace at anagni by guillaume de nogaret  this agent from the french king forced an entrance into the palace made his way into the bedroom of the frightened popehe was lying in bed with a cross in his handsand heaped threats and insults upon him  the pope was liberated a day or so later by the townspeople and returned to rome but there he was seized upon and again made prisoner by the orsini family and in a few weeks time the shocked and disillusioned old man died a prisoner in their hands  illustration costumes of the burgundian nobility flemish work of the fifteenth century  the people of anagni did resent the first outrage and rose against nogaret to liberate boniface but then anagni was the popes native town  the important point to note is that the french king 285 in this rough treatment of the head of christendom was acting with the full approval of his people he had summoned a council of the three estates of france lords church and commons and gained their consent before proceeding to extremities  neither in italy germany nor england was there the slightest general manifestation of disapproval at this free handling of the sovereign pontiff  the idea of christendom had decayed until its power over the minds of men had gone  throughout the fourteenth century the papacy did nothing to recover its moral sway  the next pope elected clement v was a frenchman the choice of king philip of france  he never came to rome  he set up his court in the town of avignon which then belonged not to france but to the papal see though embedded in french territory and there his successors remained until 1377 when pope gregory xi returned to the vatican palace in rome  but gregory xi did not take the sympathies of the whole church with him  many of the cardinals were of french origin and their habits and associations were rooted deep at avignon  when in 1378 gregory xi died and an italian urban vi was elected these dissentient cardinals declared the election invalid and elected another pope the antipope clement vii  this split is called the great schism  the popes remained in rome and all the antifrench powers the emperor the king of england hungary poland and the north of europe were loyal to them  the antipopes on the other hand continued in avignon and were supported by the king of france his ally the king of scotland spain portugal and various german princes  each pope excommunicated and cursed the adherents of his rival 13781417  is it any wonder that presently all over europe people began to think for themselves in matters of religion  the beginnings of the franciscans and the dominicans which we have noted in the preceding chapters were but two among many of the new forces that were arising in christendom either to hold or shatter the church as its own wisdom might decide those two orders the church did assimilate and use though with a little violence in the case of the former  but other forces were more frankly disobedient and critical  a century and a half later 286 came wycliffe 13201384 he was a learned doctor at oxford  quite late in his life he began a series of outspoken criticisms of the corruption of the clergy and the unwisdom of the church  he organized a number of poor priests the wycliffites to spread his ideas throughout england and in order that people should judge between the church and himself he translated the bible into english  he was a more learned and far abler man than either st francis or st dominic  he had supporters in high places and a great following among the people and though rome raged against him and ordered his imprisonment he died a free man  but the black and ancient spirit that was leading the catholic church to its destruction would not let his bones rest in the grave  by a decree of the council of constance in 1415 his remains were ordered to be dug up and burnt an order which was carried out at the command of pope martin v by bishop fleming in 1428  this desecration was not the act of some isolated fanatic it was the official act of the church  5  j h robinson     287  xlviii  the mongol conquests   but in the thirteenth century while this strange and finally ineffectual struggle to unify christendom under the rule of the pope was going on in europe far more momentous events were afoot upon the larger stage of asia  a turkish people from the country to the north of china rose suddenly to prominence in the worlds affairs and achieved such a series of conquests as has no parallel in history  these were the mongols  at the opening of the thirteenth century they were a horde of nomadic horsemen living very much as their predecessors the huns had done subsisting chiefly upon meat and mares milk and living in tents of skin  they had shaken themselves free from chinese dominion and brought a number of other turkish tribes into a military confederacy  their central camp was at karakorum in mongolia  at this time china was in a state of division  the great dynasty of tang had passed into decay by the tenth century and after a phase of division into warring states three main empires that of kin in the north with pekin as its capital and that of sung in the south with a capital at nankin and hsia in the centre remain in 1214 jengis khan the leader of the mongol confederates made war on the kin empire and captured pekin 1214  he then turned westward and conquered western turkestan persia armenia india down to lahore and south russia as far as kieff  he died master of a vast empire that reached from the pacific to the dnieper  his successor ogdai khan continued this astonishing career of conquest  his armies were organized to a very high level of efficiency and they had with them a new chinese invention gunpowder which they used in small field guns  he completed the conquest of the kin empire and then swept his hosts right across asia to russia 1235 an altogether amazing march  kieff was 288 destroyed in 1240 and nearly all russia became tributary to the mongols  poland was ravaged and a mixed army of poles and germans was annihilated at the battle of liegnitz in lower silesia in 1241  the emperor frederick ii does not seem to have made any great efforts to stay the advancing tide  map the empire of jengis khan at his death 1227  it is only recently says bury in his notes to gibbons decline and fall of the roman empire that european history has begun to understand that the successes of the mongol army which overran poland and occupied hungary in the spring of ad 1241 were won by consummate strategy and were not due to a mere overwhelming superiority of numbers  but this fact has not yet become a matter of common knowledge the vulgar opinion which represents the tartars as a wild horde carrying all before them solely by their multitude and galloping through eastern europe without a strategic plan rushing at all obstacles and overcoming them by mere weight still prevails     it was wonderful how punctually and effectually the arrangements were carried out in operations extending from the lower vistula to transylvania  such a campaign was quite beyond the 289 power of any european army of the time and it was beyond the vision of any european commander  there was no general in europe from frederick ii downward who was not a tyro in strategy compared to subutai  it should also be noticed that the mongols embarked upon the enterprise with full knowledge of the political situation of hungary and the condition of polandthey had taken care to inform themselves by a wellorganized system of spies on the other hand the hungarians and the christian powers like childish barbarians knew hardly anything about their enemies  map the ottoman empire before 1453  but though the mongols were victorious at liegnitz they did not continue their drive westward  they were getting into woodlands and hilly country which did not suit their tactics and so they turned southward and prepared to settle in hungary massacring or assimilating the kindred magyar even as these had previously massacred and assimilated the mixed scythians and avars and huns before them  from the hungarian plain they would probably have made raids west and south as the hungarians had done in the ninth century the avars in the seventh and eighth and the huns in the fifth  but ogdai died suddenly and in 1242 there was trouble 290 about the succession and recalled by this the undefeated hosts of mongols began to pour back across hungary and roumania towards the east  thereafter the mongols concentrated their attention upon their asiatic conquests  by the middle of the thirteenth century they had conquered the sung empire  mangu khan succeeded ogdai khan as great khan in 1251 and made his brother kublai khan governor of china  in 1280 kublai khan had been formally recognized emperor of china and so founded the yuan dynasty which lasted until 1368 while the last ruins of the sung rule were going down in china another brother of mangu hulagu was conquering persia and syria the mongols displayed a bitter animosity to islam at this time and not only massacred the population of bagdad when they captured that city but set to work to destroy the immemorial irrigation system which had kept mesopotamia incessantly prosperous and populous from the early days of sumeria  from that time until our own mesopotamia has been a desert of ruins sustaining only a scanty population  into egypt the mongols never penetrated the sultan of egypt completely defeated an army of hulagus in palestine in 1260  after that disaster the tide of mongol victory ebbed  the dominions of the great khan fell into a number of separate states the eastern mongols became buddhists like the chinese the western became moslim  the chinese threw off the rule of the yuan dynasty in 1368 and set up the native ming dynasty which flourished from 1368 to 1644  the russians remained tributary to the tartar hordes upon the southeast steppes until 1480 when the grand duke of moscow repudiated his allegiance and laid the foundation of modern russia  in the fourteenth century there was a brief revival of mongol vigour under timurlane a descendant of jengis khan  he established himself in western turkestan assumed the title of grand khan in 1369 and conquered from syria to delhi  he was the most savage and destructive of all the mongol conquerors  he established an empire of desolation that did not survive his death  in 1505 however a descendant of this timur an adventurer named baber got together an army with guns and swept down upon the 292 plains of india  his grandson akbar 15561605 completed his conquests and this mongol or mogul as the arabs called it dynasty ruled in delhi over the greater part of india until the eighteenth century    291  illustration tartar horsemen    map the ottoman empire at the death of suleiman the magnificent 1566 ad  one of the consequences of the first great sweep of mongol conquest in the thirteenth century was to drive a certain tribe of turks the ottoman turks out of turkestan into asia minor  they extended and consolidated their power in asia minor crossed the dardanelles and conquered macedonia serbia and bulgaria until at last constantinople remained like an island amongst the ottoman dominions  in 1453 the ottoman sultan muhammad ii took constantinople attacking it from the european side with a great number of guns  this event caused intense excitement in europe and there was talk of a crusade but the day of the crusades was past  in the course of the sixteenth century the ottoman sultans conquered bagdad hungary egypt and most of north africa and their fleet made them masters of the mediterranean  they very nearly took vienna and they exacted it tribute from the emperor there were but two items to offset the general ebb of christian 293 dominion in the fifteenth century  one was the restoration of the independence of moscow 1480 the other was the gradual reconquest of spain by the christians in 1492 granada the last moslem state in the peninsula fell to king ferdinand of aragon and his queen isabella of castile  but it was not until as late as 1571 that the naval battle of lepanto broke the prick of the ottomans and restored the mediterranean waters to christian ascendancy     294  xlix  the intellectual revival of the europeans   throughout the twelfth century there were many signs that the european intelligence was recovering courage and leisure and preparing to take up again the intellectual enterprises of the first greek scientific enquiries and such speculations as those of the italian lucretius  the causes of this revival were many and complex  the suppression of private war the higher standards of comfort and security that followed the crusades and the stimulation of mens minds by the experiences of these expeditions were no doubt necessary preliminary conditions  trade was reviving cities were recovering ease and safety the standard of education was arising in the church and spreading among laymen the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries were a period of growing independent or quasiindependent cities venice florence genoa lisbon paris bruges london antwerp hamburg nuremberg novgorod wisby and bergen for example  they were all trading cities with many travellers and where men trade and travel they talk and think  the polemics of the popes and princes the conspicuous savagery and wickedness of the persecution of heretics were exciting men to doubt the authority of the church and question and discuss fundamental things  we have seen how the arabs were the means of restoring aristotle to europe and how such a prince as frederick ii acted as a channel through which arabic philosophy and science played upon the renascent european mind  still more influential in the stirring up of mens ideas were the jews  their very existence was a note of interrogation to the claims of the church  and finally the secret fascinating enquiries of the alchemists were spreading far and wide and setting men to the petty furtive and yet fruitful resumption of experimental science  295  and the stir in mens minds was by no means confined now to the independent and well educated  the mind of the common man was awake in the world as it had never been before in all the experience of mankind  in spite of priest and persecution christianity does seem to have carried a mental ferment wherever its teaching reached  it established a direct relation between the conscience of the individual man and the god of righteousness so that now if need arose he had the courage to form his own judgment upon prince or prelate or creed  as early as the eleventh century philosophical discussion had begun again in europe and there were great and growing universities at paris oxford bologna and other centres  there medieval schoolmen took up again and thrashed out a series of questions upon the value and meaning of words that were a necessary preliminary to clear thinking in the scientific age that was to follow  and standing by himself because of his distinctive genius was roger bacon circa 1210 to circa 1293 a franciscan of oxford the father of modern experimental science  his name deserves a prominence in our history second only to that of aristotle  his writings are one long tirade against ignorance  he told his age it was ignorant an incredibly bold thing to do  nowadays a man may tell the world it is as silly as it is solemn that all its methods are still infantile and clumsy and its dogmas childish assumptions without much physical danger but these peoples of the middle ages when they were not actually being massacred or starving or dying of pestilence were passionately convinced of the wisdom the completeness and finality of their beliefs and disposed to resent any reflections upon them very bitterly  roger bacons writings were like a flash of light in a profound darkness  he combined his attack upon the ignorance of his times with a wealth of suggestion for the increase of knowledge  in his passionate insistence upon the need of experiment and of collecting knowledge the spirit of aristotle lives again in him experiment experiment that is the burthen of roger bacon  yet of aristotle himself roger bacon fell foul  he fell foul of him because men instead of facing facts boldly sat in rooms and pored over the bad latin translations which were then all that was 296 available of the master  if i had my way he wrote in his intemperate fashion i should burn all the books of aristotle for the study of them can only lead to a loss of time produce error and increase ignorance a sentiment that aristotle would probably have echoed could he have returned to a world in which his works were not so much read as worshippedand that as roger bacon showed in these most abominable translations  illustration an early printing press  297  throughout his books a little disguised by the necessity of seeming to square it all with orthodoxy for fear of the prison and worse roger bacon shouted to mankind cease to be ruled by dogmas and authorities look at the world four chief sources of ignorance he denounced respect for authority custom the sense of the ignorant crowd and the vain proud unteachableness of our dispositions  overcome but these and a world of power would open to men  machines for navigating are possible without rowers so that great ships suited to river or ocean guided by one man may be borne with greater speed than if they were full of men  likewise cars may be made so that without a draught animal they may be moved cum impetu inoestimable as we deem the scythed chariots to have been from which antiquity fought  and flying machines are possible so that a man may sit in the middle turning some device by which artificial wings may beat the air in the manner of a flying bird  so roger bacon wrote but three more centuries were to elapse before men began any systematic attempts to explore the hidden stores of power and interest he realized so clearly existed beneath the dull surface of human affairs  but the saracenic world not only gave christendom the stimulus of its philosophers and alchemists it also gave it paper  it is scarcely too much to say that paper made the intellectual revival of europe possible  paper originated in china where its use probably goes back to the second century bc  in 751 the chinese made an attack upon the arab moslems in samarkand they were repulsed and among the prisoners taken from them were some skilled papermakers from whom the art was learnt  arabic paper manuscripts from the ninth century onward still exist  the manufacture entered christendom either through greece or by the capture of moorish papermills during the christian reconquest of spain  but under the christian spanish the product deteriorated sadly  good paper was not made in christian europe until the end of the thirteenth century and then it was italy which led the world  only by the fourteenth century did the manufacture reach germany and not until the end of that century was it abundant and 298 cheap enough for the printing of books to be a practicable business proposition  thereupon printing followed naturally and necessarily for printing is the most obvious of inventions and the intellectual life of the world entered upon a new and far more vigorous phase  it ceased to be a little trickle from mind to mind it became a broad flood in which thousands and presently scores and hundreds of thousands of minds participated  one immediate result of this achievement of printing was the appearance of an abundance of bibles in the world  another was a cheapening of schoolbooks  the knowledge of reading spread swiftly  there was not only a great increase of books in the world but the books that were now made were plainer to read and so easier to understand  instead of toiling at a crabbed text arid then thinking over its significance readers now could think unimpeded as they read  with this increase in the facility of reading the reading public grew  the book ceased to be a highly decorated toy or a scholars mystery  people began to write books to be read as well as looked at by ordinary people  they wrote in the ordinary language and not in latin  with the fourteenth century the real history of the european literature begins  so far we have been dealing only with the saracenic share in the european revival  let us turn now to the influence of the mongol conquests  they stimulated the geographical imagination of europe enormously  for a time under the great khan all asia and western europe enjoyed an open intercourse all the roads were temporarily open and representatives of every nation appeared at the court of karakorum  the barriers between europe and asia set up by the religious feud of christianity and islam were lowered  great hopes were entertained by the papacy for the conversion of the mongols to christianity  their only religion so far had been shumanism a primitive paganism  envoys of the pope buddhist priests from india parisian and italian and chinese artificers byzantine and armenian merchants mingled with arab officials and persian and indian astronomers and mathematicians at the mongol court  we hear too much in history of the campaigns and massacres of the mongols and not enough of their curiosity and desire for learning  not perhaps as an originative people but as transmitters 299 of knowledge and method their influence upon the worlds history has been very great  and everything one can learn of the vague and romantic personalities of jengis or kublai tends to confirm the impression that these men were at least as understanding and creative monarchs as either that flamboyant but egotistical figure alexander the great or that raiser of political ghosts that energetic but illiterate theologian charlemagne  illustration ancient bronze figure from benin w africa  one of the most interesting of these visitors to the mongol court was a certain venetian marco polo who afterwards set down his story in a book  he went to china about 1272 with his father and uncle who had already once made the journey  the great khan had been deeply impressed by the elder polos they were the first men of the latin peoples he had seen and he sent them back with enquiries for teachers and learned men who could explain christianity to him and for various other european things that had aroused his curiosity  their visit with marco was their second visit  the three polos started by way of palestine and not by the crimea as in their previous expedition  they had with them a gold tablet and other indications from the great khan that must have greatly facilitated their journey  the great khan had asked for some oil from the lamp that burns in the holy sepulchre at jerusalem and so thither they first went and then by way of cilicia into armenia  they went thus far north because the sultan of egypt was raiding the mongol domains at this time  thence they came by way of mesopotamia to ormuz on the persian gulf as if they contemplated a sea voyage  at ormuz they met merchants from india  for some reason they did not take ship but instead turned northward through the persian deserts and so by way of balkh over 300 the pamir to kashgar and by way of kotan and the lob nor into the hwangho valley and on to pekin  at pekin was the great khan and they were hospitably entertained  illustration another ancient negro bronze of a european  marco particularly pleased kublai he was young and clever and it is clear he had mastered the tartar language very thoroughly  he was given an official position and sent on several missions chiefly in southwest china  the tale he had to tell of vast stretches of smiling and prosperous country all the way excellent hostelries for travellers and fine vineyards fields and gardens of many abbeys of buddhist monks of manufactures of cloth of silk and gold and many fine taffetas a constant succession of cities and boroughs and so on first roused the incredulity and then fired the imagination of all europe  he told of burmah and of its great armies with hundreds of elephants and how these animals were defeated by the mongol bowmen and also of the mongol conquest of pegu  he told of japan and greatly exaggerated the amount of gold in that country  for three years marco ruled the city of yangchow as governor and he probably impressed the chinese inhabitants as being little more of a foreigner than any tartar would have been  he may also have been sent on a mission to india  chinese records mention a certain polo attached to the imperial council in 1277 a very valuable confirmation of the general truth of the polo story  the publication of marco polos travels produced a profound effect upon the european imagination  the european literature and especially the european romance of the fifteenth century echoes with the names in marco polos story with cathay north china and cambulac pekin and the like  illustration early italian engraving of a sailing ship  two centuries later among the readers of the travels of marco polo was a certain genoese mariner christopher columbus who 301 conceived the brilliant idea of sailing westward round the world to china  in seville there is a copy of the travels with marginal notes by columbus  there were many reasons why the thought of a genoese should be turned in this direction  until its capture by the turks in 1453 constantinople had been an impartial trading mart between the western world and the east and the genoese had traded there freely  but the latin venetians the bitter rivals of the genoese had been the allies and helpers of the turks against the greeks and with the coming of the turks constantinople turned an 302 unfriendly face upon genoese trade the long forgotten discovery that the world was round had gradually resumed its sway over mens minds  the idea of going westward to china was therefore a fairly obvious one  it was encouraged by two things  the mariners compass had now been invented and men were no longer left to the mercy of a fine night and the stars to determine the direction in which they were sailing and the normans catalonians and genoese and portuguese had already pushed out into the atlantic as far as the canary isles madeira and the azores  yet columbus found many difficulties before he could get ships to put his idea to the test  he went from one european court to another  finally at granada just won from the moors he secured the patronage of ferdinand and isabella and was able to set out across the unknown ocean in three small ships  after a voyage of two months and nine days he came to a land which he believed to be india but which was really a new continent whose distinct existence the old world had never hitherto suspected  he returned to spain with gold cotton strange beasts and birds and two wildeyed painted indians to be baptized  they were called indians because to the end of his days he believed that this land he had found was india  only in the course of several years did men begin to realize that the whole new continent of america was added to the worlds resources  the success of columbus stimulated overseas enterprise enormously in 1497 the portuguese sailed round africa to india and in 1515 there were portuguese ships in java  in 1519 magellan a portuguese sailor in spanish employment sailed out of seville westward with five ships of which one the vittoria came back up the river to seville in 1522 the first ship that had ever circumnavigated the world  thirtyone men were aboard her survivors of twohundredandeighty who had started  magellan himself had been killed in the philippine isles  printed paper books a new realization of the round world as a thing altogether attainable a new vision of strange lands strange animals and plants strange manners and customs discoveries overseas and in the skies and in the ways and materials of life burst upon the european mind the greek classics buried and forgotten for so 303 long were speedily being printed and studied and were colouring mens thoughts with the dreams of plato and the traditions of an age of republican freedom and dignity  the roman dominion had first brought law and order to western europe and the latin church had restored it but under both pagan and catholic rome curiosity and innovation were subordinate to and restrained by organization  the reign of the latin mind was now drawing to an end  between the thirteenth and the sixteenth century the european aryans thanks to the stimulating influence of semite and mongol and the rediscovery of the greek classics broke away from the latin tradition and rose again to the intellectual and material leadership of mankind     304  l  the reformation of the latin church   the latin church itself was enormously affected by this mental rebirth  it was dismembered and even the portion that survived was extensively renewed  we have told how nearly the church came to the autocratic leadership of all christendom in the eleventh and twelfth centuries and how in the fourteenth and fifteenth its power over mens minds and affairs declined  we have described how popular religious enthusiasm which had in earlier ages been its support and power was turned against it by its pride persecutions and centralization and how the insidious scepticism of frederick ii bore fruit in a growing insubordination of the princes  the great schism had reduced its religious and political prestige to negligible proportions  the forces of insurrection struck it now from both sides  the teachings of the englishman wycliffe spread widely throughout europe  in 1398 a learned czech john huss delivered a series of lectures upon wycliffes teachings in the university of prague this teaching spread rapidly beyond the educated class and aroused great popular enthusiasm  in 141418 a council of the whole church was held at constance to settle the great schism  huss was invited to this council under promise of a safe conduct from the emperor seized put on trial for heresy and burnt alive 1415 so far from tranquillizing the bohemian people this led to an insurrection of the hussites in that country the first of a series of religious wars that inaugurated the breakup of latin christendom  against this insurrection pope martin v the pope specially elected at constance as the head of a reunited christendom preached a crusade  five crusades in all were launched upon this sturdy little people and all of them failed  all the unemployed ruffianism of europe was 305 turned upon bohemia in the fifteenth century just as in the thirteenth it had been turned upon the waldenses  but the bohemian czechs unlike the waldenses believed in armed resistance  the bohemian crusade dissolved and streamed away from the battlefield at the sound of the hussites waggons and the distant chanting of their troops it did not even wait to fight battle of domazlice 1431  in 1436 an agreement was patched up with the hussites by a new council of the church at basle in which many of the special objections to latin practice were conceded  illustration portrait of luther  in the fifteenth century a great pestilence had produced much social disorganization throughout europe  there had been extreme misery and discontent among the common people and peasant risings against the landlords and the wealthy in england and france after the hussite wars these peasant insurrections increased in gravity in germany and took on a religious character  printing came in as an influence upon this development  by the middle of the fifteenth century there were printers at work with movable type 306 in holland and the rhineland  the art spread to italy and england where caxton was printing in westminster in 1477 the immediate consequence was a great increase and distribution of bibles and greatly increased facilities for widespread popular controversies  the european world became a world of readers to an extent that had never happened to any community in the past and this sudden irrigation of the general mind with clearer ideas and more accessible information occurred just at a time when the church was confused and divided and not in a position to defend itself effectively and when many princes were looking for means to weaken its hold upon the vast wealth it claimed in their dominions  in germany the attack upon the church gathered round the personality of an exmonk martin luther 14831546 who appeared in wittenberg in 1517 offering disputations against various orthodox doctrines and practices  at first he disputed in latin in the fashion of the schoolmen  then he took up the new weapon of the printed word and scattered his views far and wide in german addressed to the ordinary people  an attempt was made to suppress him as huss had been suppressed but the printing press had changed conditions and he had too many open and secret friends among the german princes for this fate to overtake him  for now in this age of multiplying ideas and weakened faith there were many rulers who saw their advantage in breaking the religious ties between their people and rome  they sought to make themselves in person the heads of a more nationalized religion england scotland sweden norway denmark north germany and bohemia one after another separated themselves from the roman communion  they have remained separated ever since  the various princes concerned cared very little for the moral and intellectual freedom of their subjects  they used the religious doubts and insurgence of their peoples to strengthen them against rome but they tried to keep a grip upon the popular movement as soon as that rupture was achieved and a national church set up under the control of the crown  but there has always been a curious vitality in the teaching of jesus a direct appeal to righteousness and a mans selfrespect over every loyalty and every subordination lay or ecclesiastical  none of these princely churches broke 307 off without also breaking off a number of fragmentary sects that would admit the intervention of neither prince nor pope between a man and his god  in england and scotland for example there was a number of sects who now held firmly to the bible as their one guide in life and belief  they refused the disciplines of a state church  in england these dissentients were the nonconformists who played a very large part in the polities of that country in the seventeenth 308 and eighteenth centuries  in england they carried their objection to a princely head to the church so far as to decapitate king charles i 1649 and for eleven prosperous years england was a republic under nonconformist rule  illustration a majolica dish pained in colours  the breaking away of this large section of northern europe from latin christendom is what is generally spoken of as the reformation  but the shock and stress of these losses produced changes perhaps as profound in the roman church itself  the church was reorganized and a new spirit came into its life  one of the dominant figures in this revival was a young spanish soldier inigo lopez de recalde better known to the world as st ignatius of loyola  after some romantic beginnings he became a priest 1538 and was permitted to found the society of jesus a direct attempt to bring the generous and chivalrous traditions of military discipline into the service of religion  this society of jesus the jesuits became one of the greatest teaching and missionary societies the world has ever seen  it carried christianity to india china and america  it arrested the rapid disintegration of the roman church  it raised the standard of education throughout the whole catholic world it raised the level of catholic intelligence and quickened the catholic conscience everywhere it stimulated protestant europe to competitive educational efforts  the vigorous and aggressive roman catholic church we know today is largely the product of this jesuit revival     309  li  the emperor charles v   the holy roman empire came to a sort of climax in the reign of the emperor charles v  he was one of the most extraordinary monarchs that europe has ever seen  for a time he had the air of being the greatest monarch since charlemagne  his greatness was not of his own making  it was largely the creation of his grandfather the emperor maximilian i 14591519  some families have fought others have intrigued their way to world power the habsburgs married their way maximilian began his career with austria styria part of alsace and other districts the original habsburg patrimony he marriedthe ladys name scarcely matters to usthe netherlands and burgundy  most of burgundy slipped from him after his first wifes death but the netherlands he held  then he tried unsuccessfully to marry brittany  he became emperor in succession to his father frederick iii in 1493 and married the duchy of milan  finally he married his son to the weakminded daughter of ferdinand and isabella the ferdinand and isabella of columbus who not only reigned over a freshly united spain and over sardinia and the kingdom of the two sicilies but over all america west of brazil  so it was that this charles v his grandson inherited most of the american continent and between a third and a half of what the turks had left of europe  he succeeded to the netherlands in 1506  when his grandfather ferdinand died in 1516 he became practically king of the spanish dominions his mother being imbecile and his grandfather maximilian dying in 1519 he was in 1520 elected emperor at the still comparatively tender age of twenty  he was a fair young man with a not very intelligent face a thick upper lip and a long clumsy chin  he found himself in a world of young and vigorous personalities  it was an age of brilliant young 310 monarchs  francis i had succeeded to the french throne in 1515 at the age of twentyone henry viii had become king of england in 1509 at eighteen  it was the age of baber in india 15261530 and suleiman the magnificent in turkey 1520 both exceptionally capable monarchs and the pope leo x 1513 was also a very distinguished pope  the pope and francis i attempted to prevent the election of charles as emperor because they dreaded the concentration of so much power in the hands of one man  both francis i and henry viii offered themselves to the imperial electors  but there was now a long established tradition of habsburg emperors since 1273 and some energetic bribery secured the election for charles  at first the young man was very much a magnificent puppet in the hands of his ministers  then slowly he began to assert himself and take control  he began to realize something of the threatening complexities of his exalted position  it was a position as unsound as it was splendid  from the very outset of his reign he was faced by the situation created by luthers agitations in germany  the emperor had one reason for siding with the reformers in the opposition of the pope to his election  but he had been brought up in spain that most catholic of countries and he decided against luther  so he came into conflict with the protestant princes and particularly the elector of saxony  he found himself in the presence of an opening rift that was to split the outworn fabric of christendom into two contending camps  his attempts to close that rift were strenuous and honest and ineffective  there was an extensive peasant revolt in germany which interwove with the general political and religious disturbance  and these internal troubles were complicated by attacks upon the empire from east and west alike on the west of charles was his spirited rival francis i to the east was the ever advancing turk who was now in hungary in alliance with francis and clamouring for certain arrears of tribute from the austrian dominions  charles had the money and army of spain at his disposal but it was extremely difficult to get any effective support in money from germany  his social and political troubles were complicated by financial distresses  he was forced to ruinous borrowing  311  illustration the charles v portrait by titian  312  on the whole charles in alliance with henry viii was successful against francis i and the turk  their chief battlefield was north italy the generalship was dull on both sides their advances and retreats depended mainly on the arrival of reinforcements  the german army invaded france failed to take marseilles fell back into italy lost milan and was besieged in pavia  francis i made a long and unsuccessful siege of pavia was caught by fresh german forces defeated wounded and taken prisoner  but thereupon the pope and henry viii still haunted by the fear of his attaining excessive power turned against charles  the german troops in milan under the constable of bourbon being unpaid forced rather than followed their commander into a raid upon rome  they stormed the city and pillaged it 1527  the pope took refuge in the castle of st angelo while the looting and slaughter went on  he bought off the german troops at last by the payment of four hundred thousand ducats  ten years of such confused fighting impoverished all europe  at last the emperor found himself triumphant in italy  in 1530 he was crowned by the popehe was the last german emperor to be so crownedat bologna  meanwhile the turks were making great headway in hungary  they had defeated and killed the king of hungary in 1526 they held budapesth and in 1529 suleiman the magnificent very nearly took vienna  the emperor was greatly concerned by these advances and did his utmost to drive back the turks but he found the greatest difficulty in getting the german princes to unite even with this formidable enemy upon their very borders  francis i remained implacable for a time and there was a new french war but in 1538 charles won his rival over to a more friendly attitude after ravaging the south of france  francis and charles then formed an alliance against the turk  but the protestant princes the german princes who were resolved to break away from rome had formed a league the schmalkaldic league against the emperor and in the place of a great campaign to recover hungary for christendom charles had to turn his mind to the gathering internal struggle in germany  of that struggle he saw only the opening war  it was a struggle a sanguinary irrational bickering of princes for ascendancy now 313 flaming into war and destruction now sinking back to intrigues and diplomacies it was a snakes sack of princely policies that was to go on writhing incurably right into the nineteenth century and to waste and desolate central europe again and again  the emperor never seems to have grasped the true forces at work in these gathering troubles  he was for his time and station an exceptionally worthy man and he seems to have taken the religious dissensions that were tearing europe into warring fragments as genuine theological differences  he gathered diets and councils in futile attempts at reconciliation  formulæ and confessions were tried over  the student of german history must struggle with the details of the religious peace of nuremberg the settlement at the diet of ratisbon the interim of augsburg and the like  here we do but mention them as details in the worried life of this culminating emperor  as a matter of fact hardly one of the multifarious princes and rulers in europe seems to have been acting in good faith  the widespread religious trouble of the world the desire of the common people for truth and social righteousness the spreading knowledge of the time all those things were merely counters in the imaginations of princely diplomacy  henry viii of england who had begun his career with a book against heresy and who had been rewarded by the pope with the title of defender of the faith being anxious to divorce his first wife in favour of a young lady named anne boleyn and wishing also to loot the vast wealth of the church in england joined the company of protestant princes in 1530  sweden denmark and norway had already gone over to the protestant side  the german religious war began in 1546 a few months after the death of martin luther  we need not trouble about the incidents of the campaign  the protestant saxon army was badly beaten at lochau  by something very like a breach of faith philip of hesse the emperors chief remaining antagonist was caught and imprisoned and the turks were bought off by the promise of an annual tribute  in 1547 to the great relief of the emperor francis i died  so by 1547 charles got to a kind of settlement and made his last efforts to effect peace where there was no peace  in 1552 all germany was at war again only a precipitate flight from innsbruck 314 saved charles from capture and in 1552 with the treaty of passau came another unstable equilibrium  such is the brief outline of the politics of the empire for thirtytwo years  it is interesting to note how entirely the european mind was concentrated upon the struggle for european ascendancy  neither turks french english nor germans had yet discovered any political interest in the great continent of america nor any significance in the new sea routes to asia great things were happening in america cortez with a mere handful of men had conquered the great neolithic empire of mexico for spain pizarro had crossed the isthmus of panama 1530 and subjugated another wonderland peru  but as yet these events meant no more to europe than a useful and stimulating influx of silver to the spanish treasury  it was after the treaty of passau that charles began to display his distinctive originality of mind  he was now entirely bored and disillusioned by his imperial greatness  a sense of the intolerable futility of these european rivalries came upon him he had never been of a very sound constitution he was naturally indolent and he was suffering greatly from gout  he abdicated he made over all his sovereign rights in germany to his brother ferdinand and spain and the netherlands he resigned to his son philip  then in a sort of magnificent dudgeon he retired to a monastery at yuste among the oak and chestnut forests in the hills to the north of the tagus valley  there he died in 1558  much has been written in a sentimental vein of this retirement this renunciation of the world by this tired majestic titan worldweary seeking in an austere solitude his peace with god but his retreat was neither solitary nor austere he had with him nearly a hundred and fifty attendants his establishment had all the splendour and indulgences without the fatigues or a court and philip ii was a dutiful son to whom his fathers advice was a command  illustration interior of st peters rome showing the high altar  and if charles had lost his living interest in the administration of european affairs there were other motives of a more immediate sort to stir him  says prescott in the almost daily correspondence between quixada or gaztelu and the secretary of state at valladolid there is scarcely a letter that does not turn more or less on the emperors eating or his illness  the one seems naturally to follow 315 like a running commentary on the other  it is rare that such topics have formed the burden of communications with the department of state  it must have been no easy matter for the secretary to preserve his gravity in the perusal of despatches in which politics and gastronomy were so strangely mixed together  the courier from valladolid to lisbon was ordered to make a detour so as to take jarandilla in his route and bring supplies to the royal table  on 316 thursdays he was to bring fish to serve for the jour maigre that was to follow  the trout in the neighbourhood charles thought too small so others of a larger size were to be sent from valladolid  fish of every kind was to his taste as indeed was anything that in its nature or habits at all approached to fish  eels frogs oysters occupied an important place in the royal bill of fare potted fish especially anchovies found great favour with him and he regretted that he had not brought a better supply of these from the low countries  on an eelpasty he particularly doted   6  in 1554 charles had obtained a bull from pope julius iii granting him a dispensation from fasting and allowing him to break his fast early in the morning even when he was to take the sacrament  eating and doctoring it was a return to elemental things  he had never acquired the habit of reading but he would be read aloud to at meals after the fashion of charlemagne and would make what one narrator describes as a sweet and heavenly commentary  he also amused himself with mechanical toys by listening to music or sermons and by attending to the imperial business that still came drifting in to him  the death of the empress to whom he was greatly attached had turned his mind towards religion which in his case took a punctilious and ceremonial form every friday in lent he scourged himself with the rest of the monks with such good will as to draw blood  these exercises and the gout released a bigotry in charles that had hitherto been restrained by considerations of policy  the appearance of protestant teaching close at hand in valladolid roused him to fury  tell the grand inquisitor and his council from me to be at their posts and to lay the axe at the root of the evil before it spreads further  he expressed a doubt whether it would not be well in so black an affair to dispense with the ordinary course of justice and to show no mercy lest the criminal if pardoned should have the opportunity of repeating his crime  he recommended as an example his own mode or proceeding in the netherlands where all who remained obstinate in their errors were burned alive and those who were admitted to penitence were beheaded  and almost symbolical of his place and role in history was his 317 preoccupation with funerals  he seems to have had an intuition that something great was dead in europe and sorely needed burial that there was a need to write finis overdue  he not only attended every actual funeral that was celebrated at yuste but he had services conducted for the absent dead he held a funeral service in memory of his wife on the anniversary of her death and finally he celebrated his own obsequies  the chapel was hung with black and the blaze of hundreds of waxlights was scarcely sufficient to dispel the darkness  the brethren in their conventual dress and all the emperors household clad in deep mourning gathered round a huge catafalque shrouded also in black which had been raised in the centre of the chapel  the service for the burial of the dead was then performed and amidst the dismal wail of the monks the prayers ascended for the departed spirit that it might be received into the mansions of the blessed  the sorrowful attendants were melted to tears as the image of their masters death was presented to their mindsor they were touched it may be with compassion by this pitiable display of weakness  charles muffled in a dark mantle and bearing a lighted candle in his hand mingled with his household the spectator of his own obsequies and the doleful ceremony was concluded by his placing the taper in the hands of the priest in sign of his surrendering up his soul to the almighty  within two months of this masquerade he was dead  and the brief greatness of the holy roman empire died with him  his realm was already divided between his brother and his son  the holy roman empire struggled on indeed to the days of napoleon i but as an invalid and dying thing  to this day its unburied tradition still poisons the political air  6  prescotts appendix to robertsons history of charles v     318  lii  the age of political experiments of grand monarchy and parliaments and republicanism in europe   the latin church was broken the holy roman empire was in extreme decay the history of europe from the opening of the sixteenth century onward is a story of peoples feeling their way darkly to some new method of government better adapted to the new conditions that were arising  in the ancient world over long periods of time there had been changes of dynasty and even changes of ruling race and language but the form of government through monarch and temple remained fairly stable and still more stable was the ordinary way of living  in this modern europe since the sixteenth century the dynastic changes are unimportant and the interest of history lies in the wide and increasing variety of experiments in political and social organization  the political history of the world from the sixteenth century onward was we have said an effort a largely unconscious effort of mankind to adapt its political and social methods to certain new conditions that had now arisen  the effort to adapt was complicated by the fad that the conditions themselves were changing with a steadily increasing rapidity  the adaptation mainly unconscious and almost always unwilling for man in general hates voluntary change has lagged more and more behind the alterations in conditions  from the sixteenth century onward the history of mankind is a story of political and social institutions becoming more and more plainly misfits less comfortable and more vexatious and of the slow reluctant realization of the need for a conscious and deliberate reconstruction of the whole scheme of human societies in the face of needs and possibilities new to all the former experiences of life  what are these changes in the conditions of human life that have disorganized that balance of empire priest peasant and trader with 319 periodic refreshment by barbaric conquest that has held human affairs in the old world in a sort of working rhythm for more than a hundred centuries  they are manifold and various for human affairs are multitudinously complex but the main changes seem all to turn upon one cause namely the growth and extension of a knowledge of the nature of things beginning first of all in small groups of intelligent people and spreading at first slowly and in the last five hundred years very rapidly to larger and larger proportions of the general population  but there has also been a great change in human conditions due to a change in the spirit of human life  this change has gone on side by side with the increase and extension of knowledge and is subtly connected with it  there has been an increasing disposition to treat a life based on the common and more elementary desires and gratifications as unsatisfactory and to seek relationship with and service and participation in a larger life  this is the common characteristic of all the great religions that have spread throughout the world in the last twenty odd centuries buddhism christianity and islam alike  they have had to do with the spirit of man in a way that the older religions did not have to do  they are forces quite different in their nature and effect from the old fetishistic bloodsacrifice religions of priest and temple that they have in part modified and in part replaced  they have gradually evolved a selfrespect in the individual and a sense of participation and responsibility in the common concerns of mankind that did not exist among the populations of the earlier civilizations  the first considerable change in the conditions of political and social life was the simplification and extended use of writing in the ancient civilizations which made larger empires and wider political understandings practicable and inevitable  the next movement forward came with the introduction of the horse and later on of the camel as a means of transport the use of wheeled vehicles the extension of roads and the increased military efficiency due to the discovery of terrestrial iron  then followed the profound economic disturbances due to the device of coined money and the change in the nature of debt proprietorship and trade due to this convenient but dangerous convention  the empires grew in size and range and 320 mens ideas grew likewise to correspond with these things  came the disappearance of local gods the age of theocrasia and the teaching of the great world religions  came also the beginnings of reasoned and recorded history and geography the first realization by man of his profound ignorance and the first systematic search for knowledge  for a time the scientific process which began so brilliantly in greece and alexandria was interrupted  the raids of the teutonic barbarians the westward drive of the mongolian peoples convulsive religious reconstruction and great pestilences put enormous strains upon political and social order  when civilization emerged again from this phase of conflict and confusion slavery was no longer the basis of economic life and the first papermills were preparing a new medium for collective information and cooperation in printed matter  gradually at this point and that the search for knowledge the systematic scientific process was resumed  and now from the sixteenth century onward as an inevitable byproduct of systematic thought appeared a steadily increasing series of inventions and devices affecting the intercommunication and interaction of men with one another  they all tended towards wider range of action greater mutual benefits or injuries and increased cooperation and they came faster and faster  mens minds had not been prepared for anything of the sort and until the great catastrophes at the beginning of the twentieth century quickened mens minds the historian has very little to tell of any intelligently planned attempts to meet the new conditions this increasing flow of inventions was creating  the history of mankind for the last four centuries is rather like that of an imprisoned sleeper stirring clumsily and uneasily while the prison that restrains and shelters him catches fire not waking but incorporating the crackling and warmth of the fire with ancient and incongruous dreams than like that of a man consciously awake to danger and opportunity  since history is the story not of individual lives but of communities it is inevitable that the inventions that figure most in the historical record are inventions affecting communications in the sixteenth century the chief new things that we have to note are the appearance of printed paper and the seaworthy oceangoing sailing ship using the new device of the mariners compass  the former 321 cheapened spread and revolutionized teaching public information and discussion and the fundamental operations of political activity  the latter made the round world one  but almost equally important was the increased utilization and improvement of guns and gunpowder which the mongols had first brought westward in the thirteenth century  this destroyed the practical immunity of barons in their castles and of walled cities  guns swept away feudalism  constantinople fell to guns mexico and peru fell before the terror of the spanish guns  illustration cromwell dissolves the long parliament and so becomes autocrat of the english republic  the seventeenth century saw the development of systematic scientific publication a less conspicuous but ultimately far more pregnant innovation  conspicuous among the leaders in this great forward step was sir francis bacon 15611626 afterwards lord 322 verulam lord chancellor of england  he was the pupil and perhaps the mouthpiece of another englishman dr gilbert the experimental philosopher of colchester 15401603  this second bacon like the first preached observation and experiment and he used the inspiring and fruitful form of a utopian story the new atlantis to express his dream of a great service of scientific research  presently arose the royal society of london the florentine society and later other national bodies for the encouragement of research and the publication and exchange of knowledge  these european scientific societies became fountains not only of countless inventions but also of a destructive criticism of the grotesque theological history of the world that had dominated and crippled human thought for many centuries  neither the seventeenth nor the eighteenth century witnessed any innovations so immediately revolutionary in human conditions as printed paper and the oceangoing ship but there was a steady accumulation of knowledge and scientific energy that was to bear its full fruits in the nineteenth century  the exploration and mapping of the world went on  tasmania australia new zealand appeared on the map  in great britain in the eighteenth century coal coke began to be used for metallurgical purposes leading to a considerable cheapening of iron and to the possibility of casting and using it in larger pieces than had been possible before when it had been smelted with wood charcoal  modern machinery dawned  like the trees of the celestial city science bears bud and flower and fruit at the same time and continuously  with the onset of the nineteenth century the real fruition of sciencewhich indeed henceforth may never ceasebegan  first came steam and steel the railway the great liner vast bridges and buildings machinery of almost limitless power the possibility of a bountiful satisfaction of every material human need and then still more wonderful the hidden treasures of electrical science were opened to men   we have compared the political and social life of man from the sixteenth century onward to that of a sleeping prisoner who lies and dreams while his prison burns about him  in the sixteenth century the european mind was still going on with its latin imperial dream 323 its dream of a holy roman empire united under a catholic church  but just as some uncontrollable element in our composition will insist at times upon introducing into our dreams the most absurd and destructive comments so thrust into this dream we find the sleeping face and craving stomach of the emperor charles v while henry viii of england and luther tear the unity of catholicism to shreds  illustration the court at versailles  in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the dream turned to personal monarchy  the history of nearly all europe during this period tells with variations the story of an attempt to consolidate a monarchy to make it absolute and to extend its power over weaker adjacent regions and of the steady resistance first of the landowners and then with the increase of foreign trade and home industry of the growing trading and moneyed class to the exaction and interference of the crown  there is no universal victory of either side here it is the king who gets the upper hand while there it is the 324 man of private property who beats the king  in one case we find a king becoming the sun and centre of his national world while just over his borders a sturdy mercantile class maintains a republic  so wide a range of variation shows how entirely experimental what local accidents were all the various governments of this period  a very common figure in these national dramas is the kings minister often in the still catholic countries a prelate who stands behind the king serves him and dominates him by his indispensable services  here in the limits set to us it is impossible to tell these various national dramas in detail  the trading folk of holland went protestant and republican and cast off the rule of philip ii of spain the son of the emperor charles v  in england henry viii and his minister wolsey queen elizabeth and her minister burleigh prepared the foundations of an absolutism that was wrecked by the folly of james i and charles i  charles i was beheaded for treason to his people 1649 a new turn in the political thought of europe  for a dozen years until 1660 britain was a republic and the crown was an unstable power much overshadowed by parliament until george iii 17601820 made a strenuous and partly successful effort to restore its predominance  the king of france on the other hand was the most successful of all the european kings in perfecting monarchy  two great ministers richelieu 15851642 and mazarin 16021661 built up the power of the crown in that country and the process was aided by the long reign and very considerable abilities of king louis xiv the grand monarque 16431715  louis xiv was indeed the pattern king of europe  he was within his limitations an exceptionally capable king his ambition was stronger than his baser passions and he guided his country towards bankruptcy through the complication of a spirited foreign policy with an elaborate dignity that still extorts our admiration  his immediate desire was to consolidate and extend france to the rhine and pyrenees and to absorb the spanish netherlands his remoter view saw the french kings as the possible successors of charlemagne in a recast holy roman empire  he made bribery a state method almost more important than warfare charles ii of 325 england was in his pay and so were most of the polish nobility presently to be described  his money or rather the money of the taxpaying classes in france went everywhere  but his prevailing occupation was splendour  his great palace at versailles with its salons its corridors its mirrors its terraces and fountains and parks and prospects was the envy and admiration of the world  illustration the sack of a village during the french revolution  he provoked a universal imitation  every king and princelet in europe was building his own versailles as much beyond his means as his subjects and credits would permit  everywhere the nobility rebuilt or extended their chateaux to the new pattern  a great industry of beautiful and elaborate fabrics and furnishings developed  the luxurious arts flourished everywhere sculpture in alabaster faience gilt woodwork metal work stamped leather much music magnificent painting beautiful printing and bindings fine crockery fine vintages  amidst the mirrors and fine furniture went a strange race of gentlemen in tall powdered wigs silks and laces poised upon high red heels supported by amazing canes and still more wonderful ladies under towers of powdered hair and wearing vast expansions of silk and satin sustained on wire  through it all postured the great louis the sun of his world unaware of the meagre and sulky and bitter faces that watched him from those lower darknesses to which his sunshine did not penetrate  map central europe after the peace of westphalia 1648  the german people remained politically divided throughout this period of the monarchies and experimental governments and a considerable 326 number of ducal and princely courts aped the splendours of versailles on varying scales  the thirty years war 161848 a devastating scramble among the germans swedes and bohemians for fluctuating political advantages sapped the energies of germany for a century  a map must show the crazy patchwork in which this struggle ended a map of europe according to the peace of westphalia 1648  one sees a tangle of principalities dukedoms free states and the like some partly in and partly out of the empire  swedens arm the reader will note reached far into germany and except for a few islands of territory within the imperial boundaries france was still far from the rhine  amidst this patchwork the 327 kingdom of prussiait became a kingdom in 1701rose steadily to prominence and sustained a series of successful wars  frederick the great of prussia 174086 had his versailles at potsdam where his court spoke french read french literature and rivalled the culture of the french king  in 1714 the elector of hanover became king of england adding one more to the list of monarchies half in and half out of the empire  the austrian branch of the descendants of charles v retained the title of emperor the spanish branch retained spain  but now there was also an emperor of the east again  after the fall of constantinople 1453 the grand duke of moscow ivan the great 14621505 claimed to be heir to the byzantine throne and adopted the byzantine doubleheaded eagle upon his arms  his grandson ivan iv ivan the terrible 15331584 assumed the imperial title of cæsar tsar  but only in the latter half of the seventeenth century did russia cease to seem remote and asiatic to the european mind  the tsar peter the great 16821725 brought russia into the arena of western affairs  he built a new capital for his empire petersburg upon the neva that played the part of a window between russia and europe and he set up his versailles at peterhof eighteen miles away employing a french architect who gave him a terrace fountains cascades picture gallery park and all the recognized appointments of grand monarchy  in russia as in prussia french became the language of the court  unhappily placed between austria prussia and russia was the polish kingdom an illorganized state of great landed proprietors too jealous of their own individual grandeur to permit more than a nominal kingship to the monarch they elected  her fate was division among these three neighbours in spite of the efforts of france to retain her as an independent ally  switzerland at this time was a group of republican cantons venice was a republic italy like so much of germany was divided among minor dukes and princes  the pope ruled like a prince in the papal states too fearful now of losing the allegiance of the remaining catholic princes to interfere between them and their subjects or to remind the world of the commonweal of christendom there remained indeed no common 328 political idea in europe at all europe was given over altogether to division and diversity  all these sovereign princes and republics carried on schemes of aggrandizement against each other  each one of them pursued a foreign policy of aggression against its neighbours and of aggressive alliances  we europeans still live today in the last phase of this age of the multifarious sovereign states and still suffer from the hatreds hostilities and suspicions it engendered the history of this time becomes more and more manifestly gossip more and more unmeaning and wearisome to a modern intelligence  you are told of how this war was caused by this kings mistress and how the jealousy of one minister for another caused that  a tittletattle of bribes and rivalries disgusts the intelligent student  the more permanently significant fact is that in spite of the obstruction of a score of frontiers reading and thought still spread and increased and inventions multiplied the eighteenth century saw the appearance of a literature profoundly sceptical and critical of the courts and policies of the time  in such a book as voltaires candide we have the expression of an infinite weariness with the planless confusion of the european world     329  liii  the new empires of the europeans in asia and overseas   while central europe thus remained divided and confused the western europeans and particularly the dutch the scandinavians the spanish the portuguese the french and the british were extending the area of their struggles across the seas of all the world  the printing press had dissolved the political ideas of europe into a vast and at first indeterminate fermentation but that other great innovation the oceangoing sailing ship was inexorably extending the range of european experience to the furthermost limits of salt water  the first overseas settlements of the dutch and northern atlantic europeans were not for colonization but for trade and mining  the spaniards were first in the field they claimed dominion over the whole of this new world of america  very soon however the portuguese asked for a share  the popeit was one of the last acts of rome as mistress of the worlddivided the new continent between these two firstcomers giving portugal brazil and everything else east of a line 370 leagues west of the cape verde islands and all the rest to spain 1494  the portuguese at this time were also pushing overseas enterprise southward and eastward in 1497 vasco da gama had sailed from lisbon round the cape to zanzibar and then to calicut in india  in 1515 there were portuguese ships in java and the moluccas and the portuguese were setting up and fortifying trading stations round and about the coasts of the indian ocean  mozambique goa and two smaller possessions in india macao in china and a part of timor are to this day portuguese possessions  the nations excluded from america by the papal settlement paid little heed to the rights of spain and portugal  the english the danes and swedes and presently the dutch were soon staking 330 out claims in north america and the west indies and his most catholic majesty of france heeded the papal settlement as little as any protestant  the wars of europe extended themselves to these claims and possessions  map britain france  spain in america 1750  in the long run the english were the most successful in this scramble for overseas possessions the danes and swedes were too 331 deeply entangled in the complicated affairs of germany to sustain effective expeditions abroad  sweden was wasted upon the german battlefields by a picturesque king gustavus adolphus the protestant lion of the north  the dutch were the heirs of such small settlements as sweden made in america and the dutch were too near french aggressions to hold their own against the british in the far east the chief rivals for empire were the british dutch and french and in america the british french and spanish the british had the supreme advantage of a water frontier the silver streak of the english channel against europe  the tradition of the latin empire entangled them least  illustration europeans tiger hunting in india  france has always thought too much in terms of europe  throughout the eighteenth century she was wasting her opportunities of expansion in west and east alike in order to dominate spain italy and the german confusion  the religious and political dissensions of britain in the seventeenth century had driven many 332 of the english to seek a permanent home in america  they struck root and increased and multiplied giving the british a great advantage in the american struggle  in 1756 and 1760 the french lost canada to the british and their american colonists and a few years later the british trading company found itself completely dominant over french dutch and portuguese in the peninsula of india  the great mongol empire of baber akbar and their successors had now far gone in decay and the story of its practical capture by a london trading company the british east india company is one of the most extraordinary episodes in the whole history of conquest  illustration the last effort and fall of tippoo sultan  this east india company had been originally at the time of its incorporation under queen elizabeth no more than a company of sea adventurers  step by step they had been forced to raise troops and arm their ships  and now this trading company with its tradition of gain found itself dealing not merely in spices and dyes and tea and jewels but in the revenues and territories of princes 333 and the destinies of india  it had come to buy and sell and it found itself achieving a tremendous piracy  there was no one to challenge its proceedings  is it any wonder that its captains and commanders and officials nay even its clerks and common soldiers came back to england loaded with spoils  men under such circumstances with a great and wealthy land at their mercy could not determine what they might or might not do it was a strange land to them with a strange sunlight its brown people seemed a different race outside their range of sympathy its mysterious temples sustained fantastic standards of behaviour englishmen at home were perplexed when presently these generals and officials came back to make dark accusations against each other of extortions and cruelties  upon clive parliament passed a vote of censure  he committed suicide in 1774  in 1788 warren hastings a second great indian administrator was impeached and acquitted 1792  it was a strange and unprecedented situation in the worlds history  the english parliament found itself ruling over a london trading company which in its turn was dominating an empire far greater and more populous than all the domains of the british crown  to the bulk of the english people india was a remote fantastic almost inaccessible land to which adventurous poor young men went out to return after many years very rich and very choleric old gentlemen  it was difficult for the english to conceive what the life of these countless brown millions in the eastern sunshine could be  their imaginations declined the task india remained romantically unreal  it was impossible for the english therefore to exert any effective supervision and control over the companys proceedings  and while the western european powers were thus fighting for these fantastic overseas empires upon every ocean in the world two great land conquests were in progress in asia  china had thrown off the mongol yoke in 1360 and flourished under the great native dynasty of the mings until 1644  then the manchus another mongol people reconquered china and remained masters of china until 1912  meanwhile russia was pushing east and growing to greatness in the worlds affairs  the rise of this great central power of the old world which is neither altogether of the east nor 334 altogether of the west is one of the utmost importance to our human destiny  its expansion is very largely due to the appearance of a christian steppe people the cossacks who formed a barrier between the feudal agriculture of poland and hungary to the west and the tartar to the east  the cossacks were the wild east of europe and in many ways not unlike the wild west of the united states in the middle nineteenth century  all who had made russia too hot to hold them criminals as well as the persecuted innocent rebellious serfs religious secretaries thieves vagabonds murderers sought asylum in the southern steppes and there made a fresh start and fought for life and freedom against pole russian and tartar alike  doubtless fugitives from the tartars to the east also contributed to the cossack mixture slowly these border folk were incorporated in the russian imperial service much as the highland clans of scotland were converted into regiments by the british government  new lands were offered them in asia  they became a weapon against the dwindling power of the mongolian nomads first in turkestan and then across siberia as far as the amur  the decay of mongol energy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is very difficult to explain  within two or three centuries from the days of jengis and timurlane central asia had relapsed from a period of world ascendancy to extreme political impotence  changes of climate unrecorded pestilences infections of a malarial type may have played their part in this recessionwhich may be only a temporary recession measured by the scale of universal historyof the central asian peoples  some authorities think that the spread of buddhist teaching from china also had a pacifying influence upon them  at any rate by the sixteenth century the mongol tartar and turkish peoples were no longer pressing outward but were being invaded subjugated and pushed back both by christian russia in the west and by china in the east  all through the seventeenth century the cossacks were spreading eastward from european russia and settling wherever they found agricultural conditions  cordons of forts and stations formed a moving frontier to these settlements to the south where the turkomans were still strong and active to the northeast however russia had no frontier until she reached right to the pacific      335  liv  the american war of independence   the third quarter of the eighteenth century thus saw the remarkable and unstable spectacle of a europe divided against itself and no longer with any unifying political or religious idea yet through the immense stimulation of mens imaginations by the printed book the printed map and the opportunity of the new oceangoing shipping able in a disorganized and contentious manner to dominate all the coasts of the world  it was a planless incoherent ebullition of enterprise due to temporary and almost accidental advantages over the rest of mankind  by virtue of these advantages this new and still largely empty continent of america was peopled mainly from western european sources and south africa and australia and new zealand marked down as prospective homes for a european population  the motive that had sent columbus to america and vasco da gama to india was the perennial first motive of all sailors since the beginning of thingstrade  but while in the already populous and productive east the trade motive remained dominant and the european settlements remained trading settlements from which the european inhabitants hoped to return home to spend their money the europeans in america dealing with communities at a very much lower level of productive activity found a new inducement for persistence in the search for gold and silver  particularly did the mines of spanish america yield silver  the europeans had to go to america not simply as armed merchants but as prospectors miners searchers after natural products and presently as planters  in the north they sought furs  mines and plantations necessitated settlements  they obliged people to set up permanent overseas homes  finally in some cases as when the english puritans went to new england in the early seventeenth 336 century to escape religious persecution when in the eighteenth oglethorpe sent people from the english debtors prisons to georgia and when in the end of the eighteenth the dutch sent orphans to the cape of good hope the europeans frankly crossed the seas to find new homes for good  in the nineteenth century and especially after the coming of the steamship the stream of european emigration to the new empty lands of america and australia rose for some decades to the scale of a great migration  so there grew up permanent overseas populations of europeans and the european culture was transplanted to much larger areas than those in which it had been developed  these new communities bringing a readymade civilization with them to these new lands grew up as it were unplanned and unperceived the statecraft of europe did not foresee them and was unprepared with any ideas about their treatment  the politicians and ministers of europe continued to regard them as essentially expeditionary establishments sources of revenue possessions and dependencies long after their peoples had developed a keen sense of their separate social life  and also they continued to treat them as helplessly subject to the mother country long after the population had spread inland out of reach of any effectual punitive operations from the sea  because until right into the nineteenth century it must be remembered the link of all these overseas empires was the oceangoing sailing ship  on land the swiftest thing was still the horse and the cohesion and unity of political systems on land was still limited by the limitations of horse communications  now at the end of the third quarter of the eighteenth century the northern twothirds of north america was under the british crown france had abandoned america  except for brazil which was portuguese and one or two small islands and areas in french british danish and dutch hands florida louisiana california and all america to the south was spanish  it was the british colonies south of maine and lake ontario that first demonstrated the inadequacy of the sailing ship to hold overseas populations together in one political system  these british colonies were very miscellaneous in their origin and character  there were french swedish and dutch settlements 337 as well as british there were british catholics in maryland and british ultraprotestants in new england and while the new englanders farmed their own land and denounced slavery the british in virginia and the south were planters employing a swelling multitude of imported negro slaves  there was no natural common unity in such states  to get from one to the other might mean a coasting voyage hardly less tedious than the transatlantic crossing  but the union that diverse origin and natural conditions denied the british americans was forced upon them by the selfishness and stupidity of the british government in london they were taxed without any voice in the spending of the taxes their trade was sacrificed to british interests the highly profitable slave trade was maintained by the british government in spite of the opposition of the virginians whothough quite willing to hold and use slavesfeared to be swamped by an evergrowing barbaric black population  illustration george washington  britain at that time was lapsing towards an intenser form of monarchy and the obstinate personality of george iii 17601820 did much to force on a struggle between the home and the colonial governments  the conflict was precipitated by legislation which favoured the london east india company at the expense of the american shipper three cargoes of tea which were imported under the new conditions were thrown overboard in boston harbour by a band of men disguised as indians 1773  338 fighting only began in 1775 when the british government attempted to arrest two of the american leaders at lexington near boston  the first shots were fired in lexington by the british the first fighting occurred at concord  illustration the battle of bunker hill near boston  so the american war of independence began though for more than a year the colonists showed themselves extremely unwilling to sever their links with the mother land  it was not until the middle of 1776 that the congress of the insurgent states issued the declaration of independence  george washington who like many of the leading colonists of the time had had a military training in the wars against the french was made commanderinchief  in 1777 a british general general burgoyne in an attempt to reach new york from canada was defeated at freemans farm and obliged to surrender at saratoga  in the same year the french and spanish declared war upon great britain greatly hampering her sea communications  a second british army under general cornwallis was caught in the yorktown peninsula in virginia and obliged to capitulate in 1781  in 1783 peace was made in paris and the thirteen colonies from maine to georgia became a union of independent sovereign states  so the united states of america came into existence  canada remained loyal to the british flag  map the united states showing extent of settlement in 1790  for four years these states had only a very feeble central government under certain articles of confederation and they seemed destined to break up into separate independent communities their immediate separation was delayed by the hostility of the british and a certain aggressiveness on the part of the french which brought 340 home to them the immediate dangers of division  a constitution was drawn up and ratified in 1788 establishing a more efficient federal government with a president holding very considerable powers and the weak sense of national unity was invigorated by a second war with britain in 1812 nevertheless the area covered by the states was so wide and their interests so diverse at that time thatgiven only the means of communication then availablea disintegration of the union into separate states on the european scale of size was merely a question of time  attendance at washington meant a long tedious and insecure journey for the senators and congressmen of the remoter districts and the mechanical impediments to the diffusion of a common education and a common literature and intelligence were practically insurmountable  forces were at work in the world however that were to arrest the process of differentiation altogether  presently came the river steamboat and then the railway and the telegraph to save the united states from fragmentation and weave its dispersed people together again into the first of great modern nations  twentytwo years later the spanish colonies in america were to follow the example of the thirteen and break their connection with europe  but being more dispersed over the continent and separated by great mountainous chains and deserts and forests and by the portuguese empire of brazil they did not achieve a union among themselves  they became a constellation of republican states very prone at first to wars among themselves and to revolutions  brazil followed a rather different line towards the inevitable separation  in 1807 the french armies under napoleon had occupied the mother country of portugal and the monarchy had fled to brazil  from that time on until they separated portugal was rather a dependency of brazil than brazil of portugal  in 1822 brazil declared itself a separate empire under pedro i a son of the portuguese king  but the new world has never been very favourable to monarchy  in 1889 the emperor of brazil was shipped off quietly to europe and the united states of brazil fell into line with the rest of republican america     341  lv  the french revolution and the restoration of monarchy in france   britain had hardly lost the thirteen colonies in america before a profound social and political convulsion at the very heart of grand monarchy was to remind europe still more vividly of the essentially temporary nature of the political arrangements of the world  we have said that the french monarchy was the most successful of the personal monarchies in europe  it was the envy and model of a multitude of competing and minor courts  but it flourished on a basis of injustice that led to its dramatic collapse  it was brilliant and aggressive but it was wasteful of the life and substance of its common people  the clergy and nobility were protected from taxation by a system of exemption that threw the whole burden of the state upon the middle and lower classes  the peasants were ground down by taxation the middle classes were dominated and humiliated by the nobility  in 1787 this french monarchy found itself bankrupt and obliged to call representatives of the different classes of the realm into consultation upon the perplexities of defective income and excessive expenditure  in 1789 the states general a gathering of the nobles clergy and commons roughly equivalent to the earlier form of the british parliament was called together at versailles it had not assembled since 1610  for all that time france had been an absolute monarchy  now the people found a means of expressing their long fermenting discontent  disputes immediately broke out between the three estates due to the resolve of the third estate the commons to control the assembly  the commons got the better of these disputes and the states general became a national assembly clearly resolved to keep the crown in order as the british 342 parliament kept the british crown in order  the king louis xvi prepared for a struggle and brought up troops from the provinces  whereupon paris and france revolted  the collapse of the absolute monarchy was very swift  the grimlooking prison of the bastille was stormed by the people of paris and the insurrection spread rapidly throughout france  in the east and northwest provinces many chateaux belonging to the nobility were burnt by the peasants their titledeeds carefully destroyed and the owners murdered or driven away  in a month the ancient and decayed system of the aristocratic order had collapsed  many of the leading princes and courtiers of the queens party fled abroad  a provisional city government was set up in paris and in most of the other large cities and a new armed force the national guard a force designed primarily and plainly to resist the forces of the crown was brought into existence by these municipal bodies  the national assembly found itself called upon to create a new political and social system for a new age  it was a task that tried the powers of that gathering to the utmost  it made a great sweep of the chief injustices of the absolutist regime it abolished tax exemptions serfdom aristocratic titles and privileges and sought to establish a constitutional monarchy in paris  the king abandoned versailles and its splendours and kept a diminished state in the palace of the tuileries in paris  for two years it seemed that the national assembly might struggle through to an effective modernized government  much of its work was sound and still endures if much was experimental and had to be undone  much was ineffective  there was a clearing up of the penal code torture arbitrary imprisonment and persecutions for heresy were abolished  the ancient provinces of france normandy burgundy and the like gave place to eighty departments  promotion to the highest ranks in the army was laid open to men of every class  an excellent and simple system of law courts was set up but its value was much vitiated by having the judges appointed by popular election for short periods of time  this made the crowd a sort of final court of appeal and the judges like the members of the assembly were forced to play to the gallery  and the whole vast property of the church was seized and administered 343 by the state religious establishments not engaged in education or works of charity were broken up and the salaries of the clergy made a charge upon the nation  this in itself was not a bad thing for the lower clergy in france who were often scandalously underpaid in comparison with the richer dignitaries  but in addition the choice of priests and bishops was made elective which struck at the very root idea of the roman church which centred everything upon the pope and in which all authority is from above downward  practically the national assembly wanted at one blow to make the church in france protestant in organization if not in doctrine  everywhere there were disputes and conflicts between the state priests created by the national assembly and the recalcitrant nonjuring priests who were loyal to rome  in 1791 the experiment of constitutional monarchy in france was brought to an abrupt end by the action of the king and queen working in concert with their aristocratic and monarchist friends abroad  foreign armies gathered on the eastern frontier and one night in june the king and queen and their children slipped away from the tuileries and fled to join the foreigners and the aristocratic exiles  they were caught at varennes and brought back to paris and an france flamed up into a passion of patriotic republicanism  a republic was proclaimed open war with austria and prussia ensued and the king was tried and executed january 1793 on the model already set by england for treason to his people  and now followed a strange phase in the history of the french people  there arose a great flame of enthusiasm for france and the republic  there was to be an end to compromise at home and abroad at home royalists and every form of disloyalty were to be stamped out abroad france was to be the protector and helper of all revolutionaries  all europe all the world was to become republican  the youth of france poured into the republican armies a new and wonderful song spread through the land a song that still warms the blood like wine the marseillaise  before that chant and the leaping columns of french bayonets and their enthusiastically served guns the foreign armies rolled back before the end of 1792 the french armies had gone far beyond the utmost achievements of louis xiv everywhere they stood on 344 foreign soil  they were in brussels they had overrun savoy they had raided to mayence they had seized the scheldt from holland then the french government did an unwise thing  it had been exasperated by the expulsion of its representative from england upon the execution of louis and it declared war against england it was an unwise thing to do because the revolution which had given france a new enthusiastic infantry and a brilliant artillery released from its aristocratic officers and many cramping conditions had destroyed the discipline of the navy and the english were supreme upon the sea  and this provocation united all england against france whereas there had been at first a very considerable liberal movement in great britain in sympathy with the revolution  illustration the trial of louis xvi  of the fight that france made in the next few years against a european coalition we cannot tell in any detail  she drove the austrians for ever out of belgium and made holland a republic the dutch fleet frozen in the texel surrendered to a handful of 345 cavalry without firing its guns  for some time the french thrust towards italy was hung up and it was only in 1796 that a new general napoleon bonaparte led the ragged and hungry republican armies in triumph across piedmont to mantua and verona says c f atkinson  7  what astonished the allies most of all was the number and the velocity of the republicans  these improvised armies had in fact nothing to delay them  tents were unprocurable for want of money untransportable for want of the enormous number of wagons that would have been required and also unnecessary for the discomfort that would have caused wholesale desertion in professional armies was cheerfully borne by the men of 179394   supplies for armies of then unheardof size could not be carried in convoys and the french soon became familiar with living on the country  thus 1793 saw the birth of the modern system of warrapidity of movement full development of national strength bivouacs requisitions and force as against cautious manoeuvring small professional armies tents and full rations and chicane  the first represented the decisioncompelling spirit the second the spirit of risking little to gain a little    and while these ragged hosts of enthusiasts were chanting the marseillaise and fighting for la france manifestly never quite clear in their minds whether they were looting or liberating the countries into which they poured the republican enthusiasm in paris was spending itself in a far less glorious fashion  the revolution was now under the sway of a fanatical leader robespierre  this man is difficult to judge he was a man or poor physique naturally timid and a prig  but he had that most necessary gift for power faith  he set himself to save the republic as he conceived it and he imagined it could be saved by no other man than he  so that to keep in power was to save the republic  the living spirit of the republic it seemed had sprung from a slaughter of royalists and the execution of the king  there were insurrections one in the west in the district of la vendée where the people rose against the conscription and against the dispossession of the orthodox clergy and were led by noblemen and priests one in the south where lyons and marseilles had risen and the royalists of toulon 346 had admitted an english and spanish garrison  to which there seemed no more effectual reply than to go on killing royalists  the revolutionary tribunal went to work and a steady slaughtering began  the invention of the guillotine was opportune to this mood  the queen was guillotined most of robespierres antagonists were guillotined atheists who argued that there was no supreme being were guillotined day by day week by week this infernal new machine chopped off heads and more heads and more the reign of robespierre lived it seemed on blood and needed more and more as an opiumtaker needs more and more opium  illustration the execution of marie antoinette queen of france october 16 1793  finally in the summer of 1794 robespierre himself was overthrown and guillotined  he was succeeded by a directory of five men which carried on the war of defence abroad and held france together at home for five years  their reign formed a curious interlude in this history of violent changes  they took things 347 as they found them  the propagandist zeal of the revolution carried the french armies into holland belgium switzerland south germany and north italy  everywhere kings were expelled and republics set up  but such propagandist zeal as animated the directorate did not prevent the looting of the treasures of the liberated peoples to relieve the financial embarrassment of the french government  their wars became less and less the holy wars of freedom and more and more like the aggressive wars of the ancient regime  the last feature of grand monarchy that france was disposed to discard was her tradition of foreign policy  one discovers it still as vigorous under the directorate as if there had been no revolution  unhappily for france and the world a man arose who embodied in its intensest form this national egotism of the french  he gave that country ten years of glory and the humiliation of a final defeat this was that same napoleon bonaparte who had led the armies of the directory to victory in italy  throughout the five years of the directorate he had been scheming and working for selfadvancement  gradually he clambered to supreme power  he was a man of severely limited understanding but of ruthless directness and great energy  he had begun life as an extremist of the school of robespierre he owed his first promotion to that side but he had no real grasp of the new forces that were working in europe  his utmost political imagination carried him to a belated and tawdry attempt to restore the western empire  he tried to destroy the remains of the old holy roman empire intending to replace it by a new one centring upon paris the emperor in vienna ceased to be the holy roman emperor and became simply emperor of austria  napoleon divorced his french wife in order to marry an austrian princess  he became practically monarch of france as first consul in 1799 and he made himself emperor of france in 1804 in direct imitation of charlemagne  he was crowned by the pope in paris taking the crown from the pope and putting it upon his own head himself as charlemagne had directed  his son was crowned king of rome  for some years napoleons reign was a career of victory  he 348 conquered most of italy and spain defeated prussia and austria and dominated all europe west of russia  but he never won the command of the sea from the british and his fleets sustained a conclusive defeat inflicted by the british admiral nelson at trafalgar 1805  spain rose against him in 1808 and a british army under wellington thrust the french armies slowly northward out of the peninsula  in 1811 napoleon came into conflict with the tsar alexander i and in 1812 he invaded russia with a great conglomerate army of 600000 men that was defeated and largely destroyed by the russians and the russian winter  germany rose against him sweden turned against him  the french armies were beaten back and at fontainebleau napoleon abdicated 1814  he was exiled to elba returned to france for one last effort in 1815 and was defeated by the allied british belgians and prussians at waterloo  he died a british prisoner at st helena in 1821  the forces released by the french revolution were wasted and finished  a great congress of the victorious allies met at vienna to restore as far as possible the state of affairs that the great storm had rent to pieces  for nearly forty years a sort of peace a peace of exhausted effort was maintained in europe  7  in his article french revolutionary wars in the encyclopædia britannica     349  lvi  the uneasy peace in europe that followed the fall of napoleon   two main causes prevented that period from being a complete social and international peace and prepared the way for the cycle of wars between 1854 and 1871  the first of these was the tendency of the royal courts concerned towards the restoration of unfair privilege and interference with freedom of thought and writing and teaching  the second was the impossible system of boundaries drawn by the diplomatists of vienna  the inherent disposition of monarchy to march back towards past conditions was first and most particularly manifest in spain here even the inquisition was restored  across the atlantic the spanish colonies had followed the example of the united states and revolted against the european great power system when napoleon set his brother joseph on the spanish throne in 1810  the george washington of south america was general bolivar  spain was unable to suppress this revolt it dragged on much as the united states war of independence had dragged on and at last the suggestion was made by austria in accordance with the spirit of the holy alliance that the european monarch should assist spain in this struggle  this was opposed by britain in europe but it was the prompt action of president monroe of the united states in 1823 which conclusively warned off this projected monarchist restoration  he announced that the united states would regard any extension of the european system in the western hemisphere as a hostile act  thus arose the monroe doctrine the doctrine that there must be no extension of extraamerican government in america which has kept the great power system out of america for nearly a hundred years and permitted the new states of spanish america to work out their destinies along their own lines  350  but if spanish monarchism lost its colonies it could at least under the protection of the concert of europe do what it chose in europe  a popular insurrection in spain was crushed by a french army in 1823 with a mandate from a european congress and simultaneously austria suppressed a revolution in naples  in 1824 louis xviii died and was succeeded by charles x  charles set himself to destroy the liberty of the press and universities and to restore absolute government the sum of a billion francs was voted to compensate the nobles for the chateau burnings and sequestrations of 1789  in 1830 paris rose against this embodiment of the ancient regime and replaced him by louis philippe the son of that philip duke of orleans who was executed during the terror  the other continental monarchies in face of the open approval of the revolution by great britain and a strong liberal ferment in germany and austria did not interfere in this affair  after all france was still a monarchy  this man louis philippe 183048 remained the constitutional king of france for eighteen years  such were the uneasy swayings of the peace of the congress of vienna which were provoked by the reactionary proceedings of the monarchists  the stresses that arose from the unscientific boundaries planned by the diplomatists at vienna gathered force more deliberately but they were even more dangerous to the peace of mankind  it is extraordinarily inconvenient to administer together the affairs of peoples speaking different languages and so reading different literatures and having different general ideas especially if those differences are exacerbated by religious disputes  only some strong mutual interest such as the common defensive needs of the swiss mountaineers can justify a close linking of peoples of dissimilar languages and faiths and even in switzerland there is the utmost local autonomy  when as in macedonia populations are mixed in a patchwork of villages and districts the cantonal system is imperatively needed  but if the reader will look at the map of europe as the congress of vienna drew it he will see that this gathering seems almost as if it had planned the maximum of local exasperation  it destroyed the dutch republic quite needlessly it lumped 351 together the protestant dutch with the frenchspeaking catholics of the old spanish austrian netherlands and set up a kingdom of the netherlands  it handed over not merely the old republic of venice but all of north italy as far as milan to the germanspeaking austrians  frenchspeaking savoy it combined with pieces of italy to restore the kingdom of sardinia  austria and hungary already a sufficiently explosive mixture of discordant nationalities germans hungarians czechoslovaks jugoslavs roumanians and now italians was made still more impossible by confirming austrias polish acquisitions of 1772 and 1795  the catholic and republicanspirited polish people were chiefly given over to the less civilized rule of the greekorthodox tsar but important districts went to protestant prussia  the tsar was also confirmed in his acquisition of the entirely alien finns  the very dissimilar norwegian and swedish peoples were bound together under one king  germany the reader will see was left in a particularly dangerous state of muddle prussia and austria were both partly in and partly out of a german confederation which included a multitude of minor states  the king of denmark came into the german confederation by virtue of certain germanspeaking possessions in holstein  luxembourg was included in the german confederation though its ruler was also king of the netherlands and though many of its peoples talked french  here was a complete disregard of the fact that the people who talk german and base their ideas on german literature the people who talk italian and base their ideas on italian literature and the people who talk polish and base their ideas on polish literature will all be far better off and most helpful and least obnoxious to the rest of mankind if they conduct their own affairs in their own idiom within the ringfence of their own speech  is it any wonder that one of the most popular songs in germany during this period declared that wherever the german tongue was spoken there was the german fatherland  in 1830 frenchspeaking belgium stirred up by the current revolution in france revolted against its dutch association in the kingdom of the netherlands  the powers terrified at the possibilities of a republic or of annexation to france hurried in to pacify 353 this situation and gave the belgians a monarch leopold i of saxecoburg gotha  there were also ineffectual revolts in italy and germany in 1830 and a much more serious one in russian poland  a republican government held out in warsaw for a year against nicholas i who succeeded alexander in 1825 and was then stamped out of existence with great violence and cruelty the polish language was banned and the greek orthodox church was substituted for the roman catholic as the state religion     352  illustration portrait of napoleon coronation    map europe after the congress of vienna  in 1821 there was an insurrection of the greeks against the turks for six years they fought a desperate war while the governments of europe looked on  liberal opinion protested against this inactivity volunteers from every european country joined the insurgents and at last britain france and russia took joint action  the turkish fleet was destroyed by the french and english at the battle of navarino 1827 and the tsar invaded turkey  by the treaty of adrianople 1829 greece was declared free but 354 she was not permitted to resume her ancient republican traditions  a german king was found for greece one prince otto of bavaria and christian governors were set up in the danubian provinces which are now roumania and serbia a part of the jugoslav region  much blood had still to run however before the turk was altogether expelled from these lands     355  lvii  the development of material knowledge   throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and the opening years of the nineteenth century while these conflicts of the powers and princes were going on in europe and the patchwork of the treaty of westphalia 1648 was changing kaleidoscopically into the patchwork of the treaty of vienna 1815 and while the sailing ship was spreading european influence throughout the world a steady growth of knowledge and a general clearing up of mens ideas about the world in which they lived was in progress in the european and europeanized world  it went on disconnected from political life and producing throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries no striking immediate results in political life  nor was it affecting popular thought very profoundly during this period  these reactions were to come later and only in their full force in the latter half of the nineteenth century  it was a process that went on chiefly in a small world of prosperous and independentspirited people  without what the english call the private gentleman the scientific process could not have begun in greece and could not have been renewed in europe  the universities played a part but not a leading part in the philosophical and scientific thought of this period  endowed learning is apt to be timid and conservative learning lacking in initiative and resistent to innovation unless it has the spur of contact with independent minds  we have already noted the formation of the royal society in 1662 and its work in realizing the dream of bacons new atlantis throughout the eighteenth century there was much clearing up of general ideas about matter and motion much mathematical advance a systematic development of the use of optical glass in microscope and telescope a renewed energy in classificatory natural 356 history a great revival of anatomical science  the science of geologyforeshadowed by aristotle and anticipated by leonardo da vinci 14521519began its great task of interpreting the record of the rocks  illustration early rolling stock on the liverpool and manchester railway in the first days of the railway  the progress of physical science reacted upon metallurgy improved metallurgy affording the possibility of a larger and bolder handling of masses of metal and other materials reacted upon practical inventions  machinery on a new scale and in a new abundance appeared to revolutionize industry  illustration early travelling on the liverpool and manchester railway 1833  in 1804 trevithick adapted the watt engine to transport and made the first locomotive  in 1825 the first railway between stockton and darlington was opened and stephensons rocket with a thirteenton train got up to a speed of fortyfour miles per hour  from 1830 onward railways multiplied  by the middle of the century a network of railways had spread all over europe  here was a sudden change in what had long been a fixed condition of human life the maximum rate of land transport  after the russian disaster napoleon travelled from near vilna to paris in 312 hours  this was a journey of about 1400 miles  he was travelling with every conceivable advantage and he averaged 357 under 5 miles an hour  an ordinary traveller could not have done this distance in twice the time  these were about the same maximum rates of travel as held good between rome and gaul in the first century ad  then suddenly came this tremendous change the railways reduced this journey for any ordinary traveller to less than fortyeight hours  that is to say they reduced the chief european distances to about a tenth of what they had been they made it possible to carry out administrative work in areas ten times as great as any that had hitherto been workable under one administration  the full significance of that possibility in europe still remains to be realized  europe is still netted in boundaries drawn in the horse and road era  in america the effects were immediate  to the united states of america sprawling westward it meant the possibility of a continuous access to washington however far the frontier travelled across the continent  it meant unity sustained on a scale that would otherwise have been impossible  illustration the steamboat clermont 1807 usa  the steamboat was if anything a little ahead of the steam engine in its earlier phases  there was a steamboat the charlotte dundas on the firth of clyde canal in 1802 and in 1807 an american 358 named fulton had a steamer the clermont with britishbuilt engines upon the hudson river above new york  the first steamship to put to sea was also an american the phoenix which went from new york hoboken to philadelphia  so too was the first ship using steam she also had sails to cross the atlantic the savannah 1819  all these were paddlewheel boats and paddlewheel boats are not adapted to work in heavy seas  the paddles smash too easily and the boat is then disabled  the screw steamship followed rather slowly  many difficulties had to be surmounted before the screw was a practicable thing  not until the middle of the century did the tonnage of steamships upon the sea begin to overhaul that of sailing ships  after that the evolution in sea transport was rapid  for the first time men began to cross the seas and oceans with some certainty as to the date of their arrival  the transatlantic crossing which had been an uncertain adventure of several weekswhich might stretch to monthswas accelerated until in 1910 it was brought down in the case of the fastest boats to under five days with a practically notifiable hour of arrival  concurrently with the development of steam transport upon land and sea a new and striking addition to the facilities of human intercourse arose out of the investigations of volta galvani and faraday into various electrical phenomena  the electric telegraph came into existence in 1835  the first underseas cable was laid in 1851 between france and england  in a few years the telegraph system had spread over the civilized world and news which had hitherto travelled slowly from point to point became practically simultaneous throughout the earth  these things the steam railway and the electric telegraph were to the popular imagination of the middle nineteenth century the most striking and revolutionary of inventions but they were only the most conspicuous and clumsy first fruits of a far more extensive process  technical knowledge and skill were developing with an extraordinary rapidity and to an extraordinary extent measured by the progress of any previous age  far less conspicuous at first in everyday life but finally far more important was the extension of mans power over various structural materials  before the middle of the eighteenth century iron was reduced from its ores by 359 means of wood charcoal was handled in small pieces and hammered and wrought into shape it was material for a craftsman  quality and treatment were enormously dependent upon the experience and sagacity of the individual ironworker  the largest masses of iron that could be dealt with under those conditions amounted at most in the sixteenth century to two or three tons  there was a very definite upward limit therefore to the size of cannon  the blastfurnace rose in the eighteenth century and developed with the use of coke  not before the eighteenth century do we find rolled sheet iron 1728 and rolled rods and bars 1783 nasmyths steam hammer came as late as 1838  the ancient world because of its metallurgical inferiority could not use steam  the steam engine even the primitive pumping engine could not develop before sheet iron was available  the early engines seem to the modern eye very pitiful and clumsy bits of ironmongery but they were the utmost that the metallurgical science of the time could do  as late as 1856 came the bessemer process and presently 1864 the openhearth process in which steel and every sort of iron could be melted purified and cast in a manner and upon a scale hitherto unheard of  today in the electric furnace one may see tons of incandescent steel swirling about like boiling milk in a saucepan  nothing in the previous practical advances of mankind is comparable in its consequences to the complete mastery over enormous masses of steel and iron and over their texture and quality which man has now achieved  the railways and early engines of all sorts were the mere first triumphs of the new metallurgical methods  presently came ships of iron and steel vast bridges and a new way of building with steel upon a gigantic scale  men realized too late that they had planned their railways with far too timid a gauge that they could have organized their travelling with far more steadiness and comfort upon a much bigger scale  before the nineteenth century there were no ships in the world much over 2000 tons burthen now there is nothing wonderful about a 50000ton liner  there are people who sneer at this kind of progress as being a progress in mere size but that sort of sneering merely marks the intellectual limitations of those who indulge in it  360 the great ship or the steelframe building is not as they imagine a magnified version of the small ship or building of the past it is a thing different in kind more lightly and strongly built of finer and stronger materials instead of being a thing of precedent and ruleofthumb it is a thing of subtle and intricate calculation in the old house or ship matter was dominantthe material and its needs had to be slavishly obeyed in the new matter had been captured changed coerced  think of the coal and iron and sand dragged out of the banks and pits wrenched wrought molten and cast to be flung at last a slender glittering pinnacle of steel and glass six hundred feet above the crowded city  we have given these particulars of the advance in mans knowledge of the metallurgy of steel and its results by way of illustration a parallel story could be told of the metallurgy of copper and tin and of a multitude of metals nickel and aluminium to name but two unknown before the nineteenth century dawned  it is in this great and growing mastery over substances over different sorts of glass over rocks and plasters and the like over colours and textures that the main triumphs of the mechanical revolution have thus far been achieved  yet we are still in the stage of the first fruits in the matter  we have the power but we have still to learn how to use our power  many of the first employments of these gifts of science have been vulgar tawdry stupid or horrible  the artist and the adaptor have still hardly begun to work with the endless variety of substances now at their disposal  parallel with this extension of mechanical possibilities the new science of electricity grew up  it was only in the eighties of the nineteenth century that this body of enquiry began to yield results to impress the vulgar mind  then suddenly came electric light and electric traction and the transmutation of forces the possibility of sending power that could be changed into mechanical motion or light or heat as one chose along a copper wire as water is sent along a pipe began to come through to the ideas of ordinary people  the british and french were at first the leading peoples in this great proliferation of knowledge but presently the germans who had learnt humility under napoleon showed such zeal and pertinacity in scientific enquiry as to overhaul these leaders british 361 science was largely the creation of englishmen and scotchmen working outside the ordinary centres of erudition  illustration eighteenth century spinning wheel  illustration model of arkwrights spinning jenny 1769  the universities of britain were at this time in a state of educational retrogression largely given over to a pedantic conning of the latin and greek classics  french education too was dominated by the classical tradition of the jesuit schools and consequently it was not difficult for the germans to organize a body of investigators small indeed in relation to the possibilities of the case but large in proportion to the little band of british and french inventors and experimentalists  and though this work of research and experiment was making britain and france the most rich and 362 powerful countries in the world it was not making scientific and inventive men rich and powerful there is a necessary unworldliness about a sincere scientific man he is too preoccupied with his research to plan and scheme how to make money out of it  the economic exploitation of his discoveries falls very easily and naturally therefore into the hands of a more acquisitive type and so we find that the crops of rich men which every fresh phase of scientific and technical progress has produced in great britain though they have not displayed quite the same passionate desire to insult and kill the goose that laid the national golden eggs as the scholastic and clerical professions have been quite content to let that profitable creature starve  inventors and discoverers came by nature they thought for cleverer people to profit by  in this matter the germans were a little wiser  the german learned did not display the same vehement hatred of the new learning  they permitted its development  the german business man and manufacturer again had not quite the same contempt for the man of science as had his british competitor  knowledge these germans believed might be a cultivated crop responsive to fertilizers  they did concede therefore a certain amount of opportunity to the scientific mind their public expenditure on scientific work was relatively greater and this expenditure was abundantly rewarded  by the latter half of the nineteenth century the german scientific worker had made german a necessary language for every science student who wished to keep abreast with the latest work in his department and in certain branches and particularly in chemistry germany acquired a very great superiority over her western neighbours  the scientific effort of the sixties and seventies in germany began to tell after the eighties and the german gained steadily upon britain and france in technical and industrial prosperity  a fresh phase in the history of invention opened when in the eighties a new type of engine came into use an engine in which the expansive force of an explosive mixture replaced the expansive force of steam  the light highly efficient engines that were thus made possible were applied to the automobile and developed at last to reach such a pitch of lightness and efficiency as to render flight363 long known to be possiblea practical achievement  a successful flying machinebut not a machine large enough to take up a human bodywas made by professor langley of the smithsonian institute of washington as early as 1897  by 1909 the aeroplane was available for human locomotion  there had seemed to be a pause in the increase of human speed with the perfection of railways and automobile road traction but with the flying machine came fresh reductions in the effective distance between one point of the earths surface and another  in the eighteenth century the distance from london to edinburgh was an eight days journey in 1918 the british civil air transport commission reported that the journey from london to melbourne halfway round the earth would probably in a few years time be accomplished in that same period of eight days  illustration an early weaving machine  too much stress must not be laid upon these striking reductions in the time distances of one place from another  they are merely one aspect of a much profounder and more momentous enlargement of human possibility  the science of agriculture and agricultural chemistry for instance made quite parallel advances during the nineteenth century  men learnt so to fertilize the soil as to produce quadruple and quintuple the crops got from the same area in the seventeenth century  there was a still more extraordinary advance in medical science the average duration of life rose the daily efficiency increased the waste of life through illhealth diminished  364  now here altogether we have such a change in human life as to constitute a fresh phase of history  in a little more than a century this mechanical revolution has been brought about  in that time man made a stride in the material conditions of his life vaster than he had done during the whole long interval between the palæolithic stage and the age of cultivation or between the days of pepi in egypt and those of george iii  a new gigantic material framework for human affairs has come into existence  clearly it demands great readjustments of our social economical and political methods  but these readjustments have necessarily waited upon the development of the mechanical revolution and they are still only in their opening stage today     365  lviii  the industrial revolution   there is a tendency in many histories to confuse together what we have here called the mechanical revolution which was an entirely new thing in human experience arising out of the development of organized science a new step like the invention of agriculture or the discovery of metals with something else quite different in its origins something for which there was already an historical precedent the social and financial development which is called the industrial revolution  the two processes were going on together they were constantly reacting upon each other but they were in root and essence different  there would have been an industrial revolution of sorts if there had been no coal no steam no machinery but in that case it would probably have followed far more closely upon the lines of the social and financial developments of the later years of the roman republic it would have repeated the story of dispossessed free cultivators gang labour great estates great financial fortunes and a socially destructive financial process  even the factory method came before power and machinery  factories were the product not of machinery but of the division of labour  drilled and sweated workers were making such things as millinery cardboard boxes and furniture and colouring maps and book illustrations and so forth before even waterwheels had been used for industrial purposes  there were factories in rome in the days of augustus new books for instance were dictated to rows of copyists in the factories of the booksellers  the attentive student of defoe and of the political pamphlets of fielding will realize that the idea of herding poor people into establishments to work collectively for their living was already current in britain before the close of the seventeenth century  there are intimations of it even as early as mores utopia 1516  it was a social and not a mechanical development  366  up to past the middle of the eighteenth century the social and economic history of western europe was in fact retreading the path along which the roman state had gone in the last three centuries bc  but the political disunions of europe the political convulsions against monarchy the recalcitrance of the common folk and perhaps also the greater accessibility of the western european intelligence to mechanical ideas and inventions turned the process into quite novel directions  ideas of human solidarity thanks to christianity were far more widely diffused in the newer european world political power was not so concentrated and the man of energy anxious to get rich turned his mind therefore very willingly from the ideas of the slave and of gang labour to the idea of mechanical power and the machine  the mechanical revolution the process of mechanical invention and discovery was a new thing in human experience and it went on regardless of the social political economic and industrial consequences it might produce  the industrial revolution on the other hand like most other human affairs was and is more and more profoundly changed and deflected by the constant variation in human conditions caused by the mechanical revolution  and the essential difference between the amassing of riches the extinction of small farmers and small business men and the phase of big finance in the latter centuries of the roman republic on the one hand and the very similar concentration of capital in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries on the other lies in the profound difference in the character of labour that the mechanical revolution was bringing about  the power of the old world was human power everything depended ultimately upon the driving power of human muscle the muscle of ignorant and subjugated men  a little animal muscle supplied by draft oxen horse traction and the like contributed  where a weight had to be lifted men lifted it where a rock had to be quarried men chipped it out where a field had to be ploughed men and oxen ploughed it the roman equivalent of the steamship was the galley with its bank of sweating rowers  a vast proportion of mankind in the early civilizations were employed in purely mechanical drudgery  at its onset powerdriven machinery did not seem to promise any release from such unintelligent toil  great gangs 367 of men were employed in excavating canals in making railway cuttings and embankments and the like  the number of miners increased enormously  but the extension of facilities and the output of commodities increased much more  and as the nineteenth century went on the plain logic of the new situation asserted itself more clearly  human beings were no longer wanted as a source of mere indiscriminated power  what could be done mechanically by a human being could be done faster and better by a machine  the human being was needed now only where choice and intelligence had to be exercised  human beings were wanted only as human beings  the drudge on whom all the previous civilizations had rested the creature of mere obedience the man whose brains were superfluous had become unnecessary to the welfare of mankind  illustration incident in the days of the slave trade  this was as true of such ancient industries as agriculture and mining as it was of the newest metallurgical processes  for ploughing sowing and harvesting swift machines came forward to do the work of scores of men  the roman civilization was built upon cheap and degraded human beings modern civilization is being rebuilt upon 368 cheap mechanical power  for a hundred years power has been getting cheaper and labour dearer  if for a generation or so machinery has had to wait its turn in the mine it is simply because for a time men were cheaper than machinery  illustration early factory in colebrookdale  now here was a changeover of quite primary importance in human affairs  the chief solicitude of the rich and of the ruler in the old civilization had been to keep up a supply of drudges  as the nineteenth century went on it became more and more plain to the intelligent directive people that the common man had now to be something better than a drudge  he had to be educatedif only to secure industrial efficiency  he had to understand what he was about  from the days of the first christian propaganda popular education had been smouldering in europe just as it had smouldered in asia wherever islam has set its foot because of the necessity of making the believer understand a little of the belief by which he is 369 saved and of enabling him to read a little in the sacred books by which his belief is conveyed  christian controversies with their competition for adherents ploughed the ground for the harvest of popular education  in england for instance by the thirties and forties of the nineteenth century the disputes of the sects and the necessity of catching adherents young had produced a series of competing educational organizations for children the church national schools the dissenting british schools and even roman catholic elementary schools the second half of the nineteenth century was a period of rapid advance in popular education throughout all the westernized world there was no parallel advance in the education of the upper classessome advance no doubt but nothing to correspondand so the great gulf that had divided that world hitherto into the readers and the nonreading mass became little more than a slightly perceptible difference in educational level  at the back of this process was the mechanical revolution apparently regardless of social conditions but really insisting inexorably upon the complete abolition of a totally illiterate class throughout the world  the economic revolution of the roman republic had never been clearly apprehended by the common people of rome  the ordinary roman citizen never saw the changes through which he lived clearly and comprehensively as we see them  but the industrial revolution as it went on towards the end of the nineteenth century was more and more distinctly seen as one whole process by the common people it was affecting because presently they could read and discuss and communicate and because they went about and saw things as no commonalty had ever done before     370  lix  the development of modern political and social ideas   the institutions and customs and political ideas of the ancient civilizations grew up slowly age by age no man designing and no man foreseeing  it was only in that great century of human adolescence the sixth century bc that men began to think clearly about their relations to one another and first to question and first propose to alter and rearrange the established beliefs and laws and methods of human government  we have told of the glorious intellectual dawn of greece and alexandria and how presently the collapse of the slaveholding civilizations and the clouds of religious intolerance and absolutist government darkened the promise of that beginning  the light of fearless thinking did not break through the european obscurity again effectually until the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries  we have tried to show something of the share of the great winds of arab curiosity and mongol conquest in this gradual clearing of the mental skies of europe  and at first it was chiefly material knowledge that increased  the first fruits of the recovered manhood of the race were material achievements and material power  the science of human relationship of individual and social psychology of education and of economics are not only more subtle and intricate in themselves but also bound up inextricably with much emotional matter  the advances made in them have been slower and made against greater opposition  men will listen dispassionately to the most diverse suggestions about stars or molecules but ideas about our ways of life touch and reflect upon everyone about us  and just as in greece the bold speculations of plato came before aristotles hard search for fact so in europe the first political enquiries of the new phase were put in the form of utopian stories directly imitated from platos republic and his laws sir thomas 371 mores utopia is a curious imitation of plato that bore fruit in a new english poor law  the neapolitan campanellas city of the sun was more fantastic and less fruitful  by the end of the seventeenth century we find a considerable and growing literature of political and social science was being produced  among the pioneers in this discussion was john locke the son of an english republican an oxford scholar who first directed his attention to chemistry and medicine  his treatises on government toleration and education show a mind fully awake to the possibilities of social reconstruction  parallel with and a little later than john locke in england montesquieu 16891755 in france subjected social political and religious institutions to a searching and fundamental analysis  he stripped the magical prestige from the absolutist monarchy in france  he shares with locke the credit for clearing away many of the false ideas that had hitherto prevented deliberate and conscious attempts to reconstruct human society  the generation that followed him in the middle and later decades of the eighteenth century was boldly speculative upon the moral and intellectual clearings he had made  a group of brilliant writers the encyclopædists mostly rebel spirits from the excellent schools of the jesuits set themselves to scheme out a new world 1766  side by side with the encyclopædists were the economists or physiocrats who were making bold and crude enquiries into the production and distribution of food and goods morelly the author of the code de la nature denounced the institution of private property and proposed a communistic organization of society  he was the precursor of that large and various school of collectivist thinkers in the nineteenth century who are lumped together as socialists  what is socialism  there are a hundred definitions of socialism and a thousand sects of socialists  essentially socialism is no more and no less than a criticism of the idea of property in the light of the public good  we may review the history of that idea through the ages very briefly  that and the idea of internationalism are the two cardinal ideas upon which most of our political life is turning  372  illustration carl marx  the idea of property arises out of the combative instincts of the species  long before men were men the ancestral ape was a proprietor  primitive property is what a beast will fight for the dog and his bone the tigress and her lair the roaring stag and his herd these are proprietorship blazing  no more nonsensical expression is conceivable in sociology than the term primitive communism  the old man of the family tribe of early palæolithic times insisted 373 upon his proprietorship in his wives and daughters in his tools in his visible universe  if any other man wandered into his visible universe he fought him and if he could he slew him  the tribe grew in the course of ages as atkinson showed convincingly in his primal law by the gradual toleration by the old man of the existence of the younger men and of their proprietorship in the wives they captured from outside the tribe and in the tools and ornaments they made and the game they slew  human society grew by a compromise between this ones property and that  it was a compromise with instinct which was forced upon men by the necessity of driving some other tribe out of its visible universe  if the hills and forests and streams were not your land or my land it was because they had to be our land  each of us would have preferred to have it my land but that would not work  in that case the other fellows would have destroyed us  society therefore is from its beginning a mitigation of ownership  ownership in the beast and in the primitive savage was far more intense a thing than it is in the civilized world today  it is rooted more strongly in our instincts than in our reason  in the natural savage and in the untutored man today there is no limitation to the sphere of ownership  whatever you can fight for you can own womenfolk spared captive captured beast forest glade stonepit or what not  as the community grew a sort of law came to restrain internecine fighting men developed roughandready methods of settling proprietorship  men could own what they were the first to make or capture or claim  it seemed natural that a debtor who could not pay should become the property of his creditor  equally natural was it that after claiming a patch of land a man should exact payments from anyone who wanted to use it  it was only slowly as the possibilities of organized life dawned on men that this unlimited property in anything whatever began to be recognized as a nuisance  men found themselves born into a universe all owned and claimed nay they found themselves born owned and claimed  the social struggles of the earlier civilization are difficult to trace now but the history we have told of the roman republic shows a community waking up to the idea that debts may become a public inconvenience and should then be repudiated and that the unlimited ownership of land is also an inconvenience  we 374 find that later babylonia severely limited the rights of property in slaves  finally we find in the teaching of that great revolutionist jesus of nazareth such an attack upon property as had never been before easier it was he said for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for the owner of great possessions to enter the kingdom of heaven  a steady continuous criticism of the permissible scope of property seems to have been going on in the world for the last twentyfive or thirty centuries  nineteen hundred years after jesus of nazareth we find all the world that has come under the christian teaching persuaded that there could be no property in human beings  and also the idea that a man may do what he likes with his own was very much shaken in relation to other sorts of property  but this world of the closing eighteenth century was still only in the interrogative stage in this matter  it had got nothing clear enough much less settled enough to act upon  one of its primary impulses was to protect property against the greed and waste of kings and the exploitation of noble adventurers  it was largely to protect private property from taxation that the french revolution began  but the equalitarian formulæ of the revolution carried it into a criticism of the very property it had risen to protect  how can men be free and equal when numbers of them have no ground to stand upon and nothing to eat and the owners will neither feed nor lodge them unless they toil  excessivelythe poor complained  to which riddle the reply of one important political group was to set about dividing up  they wanted to intensify and universalize property  aiming at the same end by another route there were the primitive socialistsor to be more exact communistswho wanted to abolish private property altogether the state a democratic state was of course understood was to own all property  it is paradoxical that different men seeking the same ends of liberty and happiness should propose on the one hand to make property as absolute as possible and on the other to put an end to it altogether  but so it was  and the clue to this paradox is to be found in the fact that ownership is not one thing but a multitude of different things  375  it was only as the nineteenth century developed that men began to realize that property was not one simple thing but a great complex of ownerships of different values and consequences that many things such as ones body the implements of an artist clothing toothbrushes are very profoundly and incurably ones personal property and that there is a very great range of things railways machinery of various sorts homes cultivated gardens pleasure boats for example which need each to be considered very particularly to determine how far and under what limitations it may come under private ownership and how far it falls into the public domain and may be administered and let out by the state in the collective interest  on the practical side these questions pass into politics and the problem of making and sustaining efficient state administration  they open up issues in social psychology and interact with the enquiries of educational science  the criticism of property is still a vast and passionate ferment rather than a science  on the one hand are the individualists who would protect and enlarge our present freedoms with what we possess and on the other the socialists who would in many directions pool our ownerships and restrain our proprietory acts  in practice one will find every gradation between the extreme individualist who will scarcely tolerate a tax of any sort to support a government and the communist who would deny any possessions at all  the ordinary socialist of today is what is called a collectivist he would allow a considerable amount of private property but put such affairs as education transport mines landowning most mass productions of staple articles and the like into the hands of a highly organized state  nowadays there does seem to be a gradual convergence of reasonable men towards a moderate socialism scientifically studied and planned  it is realized more and more clearly that the untutored man does not cooperate easily and successfully in large undertakings and that every step towards a more complex state and every function that the state takes over from private enterprise necessitates a corresponding educational advance and the organization of a proper criticism and control both the press and the political methods of the contemporary state are far too crude for any large extension of collective activities  but for a time the stresses between employer and employed and 376 particularly between selfish employers and reluctant workers led to a worldwide dissemination of the very harsh and elementary form of communism which is associated with the name of marx  marx based his theories on a belief that mens minds are limited by their economic necessities and that there is a necessary conflict of interests in our present civilization between the prosperous and employing classes of people and the employed mass  with the advance in education necessitated by the mechanical revolution this great employed majority will become more and more classconscious and more and more solid in antagonism to the classconscious ruling minority  in some way the classconscious workers would seize power he prophesied and inaugurate a new social state  the antagonism the insurrection the possible revolution are understandable enough but it does not follow that a new social state or anything but a socially destructive process will ensue  put to the test in russia marxism as we shall note later has proved singularly uncreative  illustration science in the coal mine  377  marx sought to replace national antagonism by class antagonisms marxism has produced in succession a first a second and a third workers international  but from the starting point of modern individualistic thought it is also possible to reach international ideas  from the days of that great english economist adam smith onward there has been an increasing realization that for worldwide prosperity free and unencumbered trade about the earth is needed  the individualist with his hostility to the state is hostile also to tariffs and boundaries and all the restraints upon free act and movement that national boundaries seem to justify it is interesting to see two lines of thought so diverse in spirit so different in substance as this classwar socialism of the marxists and the individualistic freetrading philosophy of the british business men of the victorian age heading at last in spite of these primary differences towards the same intimations of a new worldwide treatment of human affairs outside the boundaries and limitations of any existing state  the logic of reality triumphs over the logic of theory  we begin to perceive that from widely divergent starting points individualist theory and socialist theory are part of a common search a search for more spacious social and political ideas and interpretations upon which men may contrive to work together a search that began again in europe and has intensified as mens confidence in the ideas of the holy roman empire and in christendom decayed and as the age of discovery broadened their horizons from the world of the mediterranean to the whole wide world  to bring this description of the elaboration and development of social economic and political ideas right down to the discussions of the present day would be to introduce issues altogether too controversial for the scope and intentions of this book  but regarding these things as we do here from the vast perspectives of the student of world history we are bound to recognize that this reconstruction of these directive ideas in the human mind is still an unfinished taskwe cannot even estimate yet how unfinished the task may be  certain common beliefs do seem to be emerging and their influence is very perceptible upon the political events and public acts of today but at present they are not clear enough nor convincing enough to compel men definitely and systematically towards their realization  378 mens acts waver between tradition and the new and on the whole they rather gravitate towards the traditional  yet compared with the thought of even a brief lifetime ago there does seem to be an outline shaping itself of a new order in human affairs  it is a sketchy outline vanishing into vagueness at this point and that 379 and fluctuating in detail and formulæ yet it grows steadfastly clearer and its main lines change less and less  illustration constructional detail of the forth bridge  it is becoming plainer and plainer each year that in many respects and in an increasing range of affairs mankind is becoming one community and that it is more and more necessary that in such matters there should be a common worldwide control  for example it is steadily truer that the whole planet is now one economic community that the proper exploitation of its natural resources demands one comprehensive direction and that the greater power and range that discovery has given human effort makes the present fragmentary and contentious administration of such affairs more and more wasteful and dangerous  financial and monetary expedients also become worldwide interests to be dealt with successfully only on worldwide lines  infectious diseases and the increase and migrations of population are also now plainly seen to be worldwide concerns  the greater power and range of human activities has also made war disproportionately destructive and disorganizing and even as a clumsy way of settling issues between government and government and people and people ineffective  all these things clamour for controls and authorities of a greater range and greater comprehensiveness than any government that has hitherto existed  but it does not follow that the solution of these problems lies in some supergovernment of all the world arising by conquest or by the coalescence of existing governments  by analogy with existing institutions men have thought of the parliament of mankind of a world congress of a president or emperor of the earth  our first natural reaction is towards some such conclusion but the discussion and experiences of half a century of suggestions and attempts has on the whole discouraged belief in that first obvious idea  along that line to world unity the resistances are too great  the drift of thought seems now to be in the direction of a number of special committees or organizations with worldwide power delegated to them by existing governments in this group of matters or that bodies concerned with the waste or development of natural wealth with the equalization of labour conditions with world peace with currency population and health and so forth  380  the world may discover that all its common interests are being managed as one concern while it still fails to realize that a world government exists  but before even so much human unity is attained before such international arrangements can be put above patriotic suspicions and jealousies it is necessary that the common mind of the race should be possessed of that idea of human unity and that the idea of mankind as one family should be a matter of universal instruction and understanding  for a score of centuries or more the spirit of the great universal religions has been struggling to maintain and extend that idea of a universal human brotherhood but to this day the spites angers and distrusts of tribal national and racial friction obstruct and successfully obstruct the broader views and more generous impulses which would make every man the servant of all mankind the idea of human brotherhood struggles now to possess the human soul just as the idea of christendom struggled to possess the soul of europe in the confusion and disorder of the sixth and seventh centuries of the christian era  the dissemination and triumph of such ideas must be the work of a multitude of devoted and undistinguished missionaries and no contemporary writer can presume to guess how far such work has gone or what harvest it may be preparing  social and economic questions seem to be inseparably mingled with international ones  the solution in each case lies in an appeal to that same spirit of service which can enter and inspire the human heart  the distrust intractability and egotism of nations reflects and is reflected by the distrust intractability and egotism of the individual owner and worker in the face of the common good  exaggerations of possessiveness in the individual are parallel and of a piece with the clutching greed of nations and emperors  they are products of the same instinctive tendencies and the same ignorances and traditions internationalism is the socialism of nations  no one who has wrestled with these problems can feel that there yet exists a sufficient depth and strength of psychological science and a sufficiently plannedout educational method and organization for any real and final solution of these riddles of human intercourse and cooperation  we are as incapable of planning a really effective peace organization of the world today as were men in 1820 to plan an 381 electric railway system but for all we know the thing is equally practicable and may be as nearly at hand  no man can go beyond his own knowledge no thought can reach beyond contemporary thought and it is impossible for us to guess or foretell how many generations of humanity may have to live in war and waste and insecurity and misery before the dawn of the great peace to which all history seems to be pointing peace in the heart and peace in the world ends our night of wasteful and aimless living  our proposed solutions are still vague and crude passion and suspicion surround them  a great task of intellectual reconstruction is going on it is still incomplete and our conceptions grow clearer and more exactslowly rapidly it is hard to tell which  but as they grow clearer they will gather power over the minds and imaginations of men  their present lack of grip is due to their lack of assurance and exact rightness they are misunderstood because they are variously and confusingly presented  but with precision and certainty the new vision of the world will gain compelling power  it may presently gain power very rapidly  and a great work of educational reconstruction will follow logically and necessarily upon that clearer understanding     382  lx  the expansion of the united states   the region of the world that displayed the most immediate and striking results from the new inventions in transport was north america  politically the united states embodied and its constitution crystallized the liberal ideas of the middle eighteenth century  it dispensed with statechurch or crown it would have no titles it protected property very jealously as a method of freedom andthe exact practice varied at first in the different statesit gave nearly every adult male citizen a vote its method of voting was barbarically crude and as a consequence its political life fell very soon under the control of highly organized party machines but that did not prevent the newly emancipated population developing an energy enterprise and public spirit far beyond that of any other contemporary population  then came that acceleration of locomotion to which we have already called attention  it is a curious thing that america which owes most to this acceleration in locomotion has felt it least  the united states have taken the railway the river steamboat the telegraph and so forth as though they were a natural part of their growth  they were not  these things happened to come along just in time to save american unity  the united states of today were made first by the river steamboat and then by the railway without these things the present united states this vast continental nation would have been altogether impossible  the westward flow of population would have been far more sluggish  it might never have crossed the great central plains  it took nearly two hundred years for effective settlement to reach from the coast to missouri much less than halfway across the continent  the first state established beyond the river was the steamboat state of missouri in 1821  but the rest of the distance to the pacific was done in a few decades  383  if we had the resources of the cinema it would be interesting to show a map of north america year by year from 1600 onward with little dots to represent hundreds of people each dot a hundred and stars to represent cities of a hundred thousand people  for two hundred years the reader would see that stippling creeping slowly along the coastal districts and navigable waters spreading still more gradually into indiana kentucky and so forth  then somewhere about 1810 would come a change  things would get more lively along the river courses  the dots would be multiplying and spreading  that would be the steamboat  the pioneer dots would be spreading soon over kansas and nebraska from a number of jumpingoff places along the great rivers  then from about 1850 onward would come the black lines of the railways and after that the little black dots would not simply creep but run  they would appear now so rapidly it would be almost as though they were being put on by some sort of spraying machine  and suddenly here and then there would appear the first stars to indicate the first great cities of a hundred thousand people  first one or two and then a multitude of citieseach like a knot in the growing net of the railways  the growth of the united states is a process that has no precedent in the worlds history it is a new kind of occurrence  such a community could not have come into existence before and if it had without railways it would certainly have dropped to pieces long before now  without railways or telegraph it would be far easier to administer california from pekin than from washington but this great population of the united states of america has not only grown outrageously it has kept uniform  nay it has become more uniform  the man of san francisco is more like the man of new york today than the man of virginia was like the man of new england a century ago  and the process of assimilation goes on unimpeded  the united states is being woven by railway by telegraph more and more into one vast unity speaking thinking and acting harmoniously with itself  soon aviation will be helping in the work  this great community of the united states is an altogether new thing in history  there have been great empires before with populations exceeding 100 millions out these were associations of divergent 384 peoples there has never been one single people on this scale before  we want a new term for this new thing  we call the united states a country just as we call france or holland a country  but the two things are as different as an automobile and a onehorse shay  they are the creations of different periods and different conditions they are going to work at a different pace and in an entirely different way  the united states in scale and possibility is halfway between a european state and a united states of all the world  but on the way to this present greatness and security the american people passed through one phase of dire conflict  the river steamboats the railways the telegraph and their associate facilities did not come soon enough to avert a deepening conflict of interests and ideas between the southern and northern states of the union  the former were slaveholding states the latter states in which all men were free  the railways and steamboats at first did but bring into sharper conflict an already established difference between the two sections of the united states  the increasing unification due to the new means of transport made the question whether the southern spirit or the northern should prevail an ever more urgent one  there was little possibility of compromise  the northern spirit was free and individualistic the southern made for great estates and a conscious gentility ruling over a dusky subject multitude  every new territory that was organized into a state as the tide of population swept westward every new incorporation into the fast growing american system became a field of conflict between the two ideas whether it should become a state of free citizens or whether the estate and slavery system should prevail  from 1833 an american antislavery society was not merely resisting the extension of the institution but agitating the whole country for its complete abolition  the issue flamed up into open conflict over the admission of texas to the union  texas had originally been a part of the republic of mexico but it was largely colonized by americans from the slaveholding states and it seceded from mexico established its independence in 1835 and was annexed to the united states in 1844  under the mexican law slavery had been forbidden in texas but now the south claimed texas for slavery and got it  385  meanwhile the development of ocean navigation was bringing a growing swarm of immigrants from europe to swell the spreading population of the northern states and the raising of iowa wisconsin minnesota and oregon all northern farm lands to state level gave the antislavery north the possibility of predominance both in the senate and the house of representatives  the cottongrowing south irritated by the growing threat of the abolitionist movement and fearing this predominance in congress began to talk of secession from the union  southerners began to dream of annexations to the south of them in mexico and the west indies and of great slave state detached from the north and reaching to panama  illustration one of the first american river steamers  the return of abraham lincoln as an antiextension president in 1860 decided the south to split the union  south carolina passed an ordinance of secession and prepared for war  mississippi florida alabama georgia louisiana and texas joined her and a convention met at montgomery in alabama elected jefferson davis president of the confederated states of america and adopted a constitution specifically upholding the institution of negro slavery  386  abraham lincoln was it chanced a man entirely typical of the new people that had grown up after the war of independence  his early years had been spent as a drifting particle in the general westward flow of the population  he was born in kentucky 1809 was taken to indiana as a boy and later on to illinois  life was rough in the backwoods of indiana in those days the house was a mere log cabin in the wilderness and his schooling was poor and casual  but his mother taught him to read early and he became a voracious reader  at seventeen he was a big athletic youth a great wrestler and runner  he worked for a time as clerk in a store went into business as a storekeeper with a drunken partner and contracted debts that he did not fully pay off for fifteen years  in 1834 when he was still only five and twenty he was elected member of the house of representatives for the state of illinois  in illinois particularly the question of slavery flamed because the great leader of the party for the extension of slavery in the national congress was senator douglas of illinois  douglas was a man of great ability and prestige and for some years lincoln fought against him by speech and pamphlet rising steadily to the position of his most formidable and finally victorious antagonist  their culminating struggle was the presidential campaign of 1860 and on the fourth of march 1861 lincoln was inaugurated president with the southern states already in active secession from the rule of the federal government at washington and committing acts of war  this civil war in america was fought by improvised armies that grew steadily from a few score thousands to hundreds of thousandsuntil at last the federal forces exceeded a million men it was fought over a vast area between new mexico and the eastern sea washington and richmond were the chief objectives it is beyond our scope here to tell of the mounting energy of that epic struggle that rolled to and fro across the hills and woods of tennessee and virginia and down the mississippi  there was a terrible waste and killing of men  thrust was followed by counter thrust hope gave way to despondency and returned and was again disappointed  sometimes washington seemed within the confederate grasp again the federal armies were driving towards richmond  the confederates outnumbered and far poorer in resources fought under 387 a general of supreme ability general lee  the generalship of the union was far inferior generals were dismissed new generals appointed until at last under sherman and grant came victory over the ragged and depleted south  in october 1864 a federal army under sherman broke through the confederate left and marched down from tennessee through georgia to the coast right across the confederate country and then turned up through the 388 carolinas coming in upon the rear of the confederate armies  meanwhile grant held lee before richmond until sherman closed on him  on april 9th 1865 lee and his army surrendered at appomattox court house and within a month all the remaining secessionist armies had laid down their arms and the confederacy was at an end  illustration abraham lincoln  this four years struggle had meant an enormous physical and moral strain for the people of the united states  the principle of state autonomy was very dear to many minds and the north seemed in effect to be forcing abolition upon the south  in the border states brothers and cousins even fathers and sons would take opposite sides and find themselves in antagonistic armies  the north felt its cause a righteous one but for great numbers of people it was not a fullbodied and unchallenged righteousness but for lincoln there was no doubt  he was a clearminded man in the midst of much confusion  he stood for union he stood for the wide peace of america  he was opposed to slavery but slavery he held to be a secondary issue his primary purpose was that the united states should not be torn into two contrasted and jarring fragments  when in the opening stages of the war congress and the federal generals embarked upon a precipitate emancipation lincoln opposed and mitigated their enthusiasm  he was for emancipation by stages and with compensation  it was only in january 1865 that the situation had ripened to a point when congress could propose to abolish slavery for ever by a constitutional amendment and the war was already over before this amendment was ratified by the states  as the war dragged on through 1862 and 1863 the first passions and enthusiasms waned and america learnt all the phases of war weariness and war disgust  the president found himself with defeatists traitors dismissed generals tortuous party politicians and a doubting and fatigued people behind him and uninspired generals and depressed troops before him his chief consolation must have been that jefferson davis at richmond could be in little better case  the english government misbehaved and permitted the confederate agents in england to launch and man three swift privateer shipsthe alabama is the best remembered of themwhich 389 chased united states shipping from the seas the french army in mexico was trampling the monroe doctrine in the dirt  came subtle proposals from richmond to drop the war leave the issues of the war for subsequent discussion and turn federal and confederate in alliance upon the french in mexico  but lincoln would not listen to such proposals unless the supremacy of the union was maintained  the americans might do such things as one people but not as two  he held the united states together through long weary months of reverses and ineffective effort through black phases of division and failing courage and there is no record that he ever faltered from his purpose  there were times when there was nothing to be done when he sat in the white house silent and motionless a grim monument of resolve times when he relaxed his mind by jesting and broad anecdotes  he saw the union triumphant  he entered richmond the day after its surrender and heard of lees capitulation  he returned to washington and on april 11th made his last public address  his theme was reconciliation and the reconstruction of loyal government in the defeated states  on the evening of april 14th he went to fords theatre in washington and as he sat looking at the stage he was shot in the back of the head and killed by an actor named booth who had some sort of grievance against him and who had crept into the box unobserved  but lincolns work was done the union was saved  at the beginning of the war there was no railway to the pacific coast after it the railways spread like a swiftly growing plant until now they have clutched and held and woven all the vast territory of the united states into one indissoluble mental and material unitythe greatest real communityuntil the common folk of china have learnt to readin the world     390  lxi  the rise of germany to predominance in europe   we have told how after the convulsion of the french revolution and the napoleonic adventure europe settled down again for a time to an insecure peace and a sort of modernized revival of the political conditions of fifty years before  until the middle of the century the new facilities in the handling of steel and the railway and steamship produced no marked political consequences but the social tension due to the development of urban industrialism grew  france remained a conspicuously uneasy country  the revolution of 1830 was followed by another in 1848 then napoleon iii a nephew of napoleon bonaparte became first president and then in 1852 emperor  he set about rebuilding paris and changed it from a picturesque seventeenth century insanitary city into the spacious latinized city of marble it is today  he set about rebuilding france and made it into a brilliantlooking modernized imperialism  he displayed a disposition to revive that competitiveness of the great powers which had kept europe busy with futile wars during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries  the tsar nicholas i of russia 18251856 was also becoming aggressive and pressing southward upon the turkish empire with his eyes on constantinople  after the turn of the century europe broke out into a fresh cycle of wars  they were chiefly balanceofpower and ascendancy wars  england france and sardinia assailed russia in the crimean war in defence of turkey prussia with italy as an ally and austria fought for the leadership of germany france liberated north italy from austria at the price of savoy and italy gradually unified itself into one kingdom  then napoleon iii was so ill advised as to attempt adventures in mexico during the american civil war he set up an emperor maximilian there and abandoned him hastily to 391 his fatehe was shot by the mexicanswhen the victorious federal government showed its teeth  map map of europe 18481871  in 1870 came a longpending struggle for predominance in europe between france and prussia  prussia had long foreseen and prepared for this struggle and france was rotten with financial corruption  her defeat was swift and dramatic  the germans invaded france in august one great french army under the emperor capitulated at sedan in september another surrendered in october at metz and in january 1871 paris after a siege and bombardment fell into german hands  peace was signed at frankfort surrendering the provinces of alsace and lorraine to the germans  392 germany excluding austria was unified as an empire and the king of prussia was added to the galaxy of european cæsars as the german emperor  for the next fortythree years germany was the leading power upon the european continent  there was a russoturkish war in 18778 but thereafter except for certain readjustments in the balkans european frontiers remained uneasily stable for thirty years     393  lxii  the new overseas empires of steamship and railway   the end of the eighteenth century was a period of disrupting empires and disillusioned expansionists  the long and tedious journey between britain and spain and their colonies in america prevented any really free coming and going between the home land and the daughter lands and so the colonies separated into new and distinct communities with distinctive ideas and interests and even modes of speech  as they grew they strained more and more at the feeble and uncertain link of shipping that had joined them weak tradingposts in the wilderness like those of france in canada or trading establishments in great alien communities like those of britain in india might well cling for bare existence to the nation which gave them support and a reason for their existence  that much and no more seemed to many thinkers in the early part of the nineteenth century to be the limit set to overseas rule  in 1820 the sketchy great european empires outside of europe that had figured so bravely in the maps of the middle eighteenth century had shrunken to very small dimensions only the russian sprawled as large as ever across asia  the british empire in 1815 consisted of the thinly populated coastal river and lake regions of canada and a great hinterland of wilderness in which the only settlements as yet were the furtrading stations of the hudson bay company about a third of the indian peninsula under the rule of the east india company the coast districts of the cape of good hope inhabited by blacks and rebelliousspirited dutch settlers a few trading stations on the coast of west africa the rock of gibraltar the island of malta jamaica a few minor slavelabour possessions in the west indies british guiana in south america and on the other side of the world two dumps for convicts at botany bay in australia and in tasmania  spain retained cuba and a few settlements in the philippine islands  394 portugal had in africa some vestiges of her ancient claims  holland had various islands and possessions in the east indies and dutch guiana and denmark an island or so in the west indies  france had one or two west indian islands and french guiana  this seemed to be as much as the european powers needed or were likely to acquire of the rest of the world  only the east india company showed any spirit of expansion  while europe was busy with the napoleonic wars the east india company under a succession of governorsgeneral was playing much the same role in india that had been played before by turkoman and suchlike invaders from the north  and after the peace of vienna it went on levying its revenues making wars sending ambassadors to asiatic powers a quasiindependent state however with a marked disposition to send wealth westward  we cannot tell here in any detail how the british company made its way to supremacy sometimes as the ally of this power sometimes as that and finally as the conqueror of all  its power spread to assam sind oudh  the map of india began to take on the outlines familiar to the english schoolboy of today a patchwork of native states embraced and held together by the great provinces under direct british rule     in 1859 following upon a serious mutiny of the native troops in india this empire of the east india company was annexed to the british crown  by an act entitled an act for the better government of india the governorgeneral became a viceroy representing the sovereign and the place of the company was taken by a secretary of state for india responsible to the british parliament  in 1877 lord beaconsfield to complete the work caused queen victoria to be proclaimed empress of india  upon these extraordinary lines india and britain are linked at the present time  india is still the empire of the great mogul but the great mogul has been replaced by the crowned republic of great britain  india is an autocracy without an autocrat  its rule combines the disadvantage of absolute monarchy with the impersonality and irresponsibility of democratic officialdom  the indian with a complaint to make has no visible monarch to go to his emperor is a golden symbol he must circulate pamphlets in england 395 or inspire a question in the british house of commons  the more occupied parliament is with british affairs the less attention india will receive and the more she will be at the mercy of her small group of higher officials  illustration railway bridge over the gorge victoria falls of the zambesi southern rhodesia  apart from india there was no great expansion of any european empire until the railways and the steamships were in effective action  a considerable school of political thinkers in britain was disposed to regard overseas possessions as a source of weakness to the kingdom  the australian settlements developed slowly until in 1842 the discovery of valuable copper mines and in 1851 of gold gave them a new importance  improvements in transport were also making australian wool an increasingly marketable commodity in europe  396 canada too was not remarkably progressive until 1849 it was troubled by dissensions between its french and british inhabitants there were several serious revolts and it was only in 1867 that a new constitution creating a federal dominion of canada relieved its internal strains  it was the railway that altered the canadian outlook it enabled canada just as it enabled the united states to expand westward to market its corn and other produce in europe and in spite of its swift and extensive growth to remain in language and sympathy and interests one community  the railway the steamship and the telegraph cable were indeed changing all the conditions of colonial development  before 1840 english settlements had already begun in new zealand and a new zealand land company had been formed to exploit the possibilities of the island  in 1840 new zealand also was added to the colonial possessions of the british crown  canada as we have noted was the first of the british possessions to respond richly to the new economic possibilities that the new methods of transport were opening  presently the republics of south america and particularly the argentine republic began to feel in their cattle trade and coffee growing the increased nearness of the european market  hitherto the chief commodities that had attracted the european powers into unsettled and barbaric regions had been gold or other metals spices ivory or slaves but in the latter quarter of the nineteenth century the increase of the european populations was obliging their governments to look abroad for staple foods and the growth of scientific industrialism was creating a demand for new raw materials fats and greases of every kind rubber and other hitherto disregarded substances  it was plain that great britain and holland and portugal were reaping a great and growing commercial advantage from their very considerable control of tropical and subtropical products  after 1871 germany and presently france and later italy began to look for unannexed rawmaterial areas or for oriental countries capable of profitable modernization  so began a fresh scramble all over the world except in the american region where the monroe doctrine now barred such adventures for politically unprotected lands  397  map the british empire in 1815  close to europe was the continent of africa full of vaguely known possibilities  in 1850 it was a continent of black mystery only egypt and the coast were known  here we have no space to tell the amazing story of the explorers and adventurers who first pierced the african darkness and of the political agents administrators traders settlers and scientific men who followed in their track wonderful races of men like the pygmies strange beasts like the okapi marvellous fruits and flowers and insects terrible diseases astounding scenery of forest and mountain enormous inland seas and gigantic rivers and cascades were revealed a whole new world  even remains at zimbabwe of some unrecorded and vanished civilization the southward enterprise of an early people were discovered  into this new world came the europeans and found the rifle already there in the hands of the arab slavetraders and negro life in disorder  by 1900 in half a century all africa was mapped explored estimated and divided between the european powers  little heed was given to the welfare of the natives in this scramble  the arab slaver was indeed curbed rather than expelled but the greed for rubber which was a wild product collected under compulsion by the natives in the belgian congo a greed exacerbated by the clash of inexperienced european administrators with the native 398 population led to horrible atrocities  no european power has perfectly clean hands in this matter  we cannot tell here in any detail how great britain got possession of egypt in 1883 and remained there in spite of the fact that egypt was technically a part of the turkish empire nor how nearly this scramble led to war between france and great britain in 1898 when a certain colonel marchand crossing central africa from the west coast tried at fashoda to seize the upper nile  nor can we tell how the british government first let the boers or dutch settlers of the orange river district and the transvaal set up independent republics in the inland parts of south africa and then repented and annexed the transvaal republic in 1877 nor how the transvaal boers fought for freedom and won it after the battle of majuba hill 1881  majuba hill was made to rankle in the memory of the english people by a persistent press campaign  a war with both republics broke out in 1899 a three years war enormously costly to the british people which ended at last in the surrender of the two republics  their period of subjugation was a brief one  in 1907 after the downfall of the imperialist government which had conquered them the liberals took the south african problem in hand and these former republics became free and fairly willing associates with cape colony and  natal in a confederation of all the states of south africa as one selfgoverning republic under the british crown  in a quarter of a century the partition of africa was completed there remained unannexed three comparatively small countries liberia a settlement of liberated negro slaves on the west coast morocco under a moslem sultan and abyssinia a barbaric country with an ancient and peculiar form of christianity which had successfully maintained its independence against italy at the battle of adowa in 1896     399  lxiii  european aggression in asia and the rise of japan   it is difficult to believe that any large number of people really accepted this headlong painting of the map of africa in european colours as a permanent new settlement of the worlds affairs but it is the duty of the historian to record that it was so accepted there was but a shallow historical background to the european mind in the nineteenth century and no habit of penetrating criticism the quite temporary advantages that the mechanical revolution in the west had given the europeans over the rest of the old world were regarded by people blankly ignorant of such events as the great mongol conquests as evidences of a permanent and assured european leadership of mankind  they had no sense of the transferability of science and its fruits  they did not realize that chinamen and indians could carry on the work of research as ably as frenchmen or englishmen  they believed that there was some innate intellectual drive in the west and some innate indolence and conservatism in the east that assured the europeans a world predominance for ever  the consequence of this infatuation was that the various european foreign offices set themselves not merely to scramble with the british for the savage and undeveloped regions of the worlds surface but also to carve up the populous and civilized countries of asia as though these people also were no more than raw material for exploitation  the inwardly precarious but outwardly splendid imperialism of the british ruling class in india and the extensive and profitable possessions of the dutch in the east indies filled the rival great powers with dreams of similar glories in persia in the disintegrating ottoman empire and in further india china and japan  400  in 1898 germany seized kiau chau in china  britain responded by seizing weihaiwei and the next year the russians took possession of port arthur  a flame of hatred for the europeans swept through china  there were massacres of europeans and christian converts and in 1900 an attack upon and siege of the european legations in pekin  a combined force of europeans made a punitive expedition to pekin rescued the legations and stole an enormous amount of valuable property  the russians then seized manchuria and in 1904 the british invaded tibet  but now a new power appeared in the struggle of the great powers japan  hitherto japan has played but a small part in this history her secluded civilization has not contributed very largely to the general shaping of human destinies she has received much but she has given little  the japanese proper are of the mongolian race  their civilization their writing and their literary and artistic traditions are derived from the chinese  their history is an interesting and romantic one they developed a feudal system and a system of chivalry in the earlier centuries of the christian era their attacks upon korea and china are an eastern equivalent of the english wars in france  japan was first brought into contact with europe in the sixteenth century in 1542 some portuguese reached it in a chinese junk and in 1549 a jesuit missionary francis xavier began his teaching there  for a time japan welcomed european intercourse and the christian missionaries made a great number of converts  a certain william adams became the most trusted european adviser of the japanese and showed them how to build big ships  there were voyages in japanesebuilt ships to india and peru  then arose complicated quarrels between the spanish dominicans the portuguese jesuits and the english and dutch protestants each warning the japanese against the political designs of the others the jesuits in a phase of ascendancy persecuted and insulted the buddhists with great acrimony  in the end the japanese came to the conclusion that the europeans were an intolerable nuisance and that catholic christianity in particular was a mere cloak for the political dreams of the pope and the spanish monarchyalready in possession of the philippine islands there was a great persecution of the christians and in 1638 japan was absolutely 401 closed to europeans and remained closed for over 200 years during those two centuries the japanese were as completely cut off from the rest of the world as though they lived upon another planet  it was forbidden to build any ship larger than a mere coasting boat  no japanese could go abroad and no european enter the country  illustration japanese soldier on the eighteenth century  for two centuries japan remained outside the main current of history  she lived on in a state of picturesque feudalism in which about five per cent of the population the samurai or fighting men and the nobles and their families tyrannized without restraint over the rest of the population  meanwhile the great world outside went on to wider visions and new powers strange shipping became more frequent passing the japanese headlands sometimes ships were wrecked and sailors brought ashore  through the dutch settlement in the island of deshima their one link with the outer universe came warnings that japan was not keeping pace with the power of the western world  in 1837 a ship sailed into yedo bay flying a strange flag of stripes and stars and carrying some japanese sailors she had picked up far adrift in the pacific  she was driven off by cannon shot  this flag presently reappeared on other ships  one in 1849 came to demand the liberation 402 of eighteen shipwrecked american sailors  then in 1853 came four american warships under commodore perry and refused to be driven away  he lay at anchor in forbidden waters and sent messages to the two rulers who at that time shared the control of japan  in 1854 he returned with ten ships amazing ships propelled by steam and equipped with big guns and he made proposals for trade and intercourse that the japanese had no power to resist  he landed with a guard of 500 men to sign the treaty  incredulous crowds watched this visitation from the outer world marching through the streets  russia holland and britain followed in the wake of america  a great nobleman whose estates commanded the straits of shimonoseki saw fit to fire on foreign vessels and a bombardment by a fleet of british french dutch and american warships destroyed his batteries and scattered his swordsmen  finally an allied squadron 1865 at anchor off kioto imposed a ratification of the treaties which opened japan to the world  the humiliation of the japanese by these events was intense  with astonishing energy and intelligence they set themselves to bring their culture and organization to the level of the european powers  never in all the history of mankind did a nation make such a stride as japan then did  in 1866 she was a medieval people a fantastic caricature of the extremest romantic feudalism in 1899 hers was a completely westernized people on a level with the most advanced european powers  she completely dispelled the persuasion that asia was in some irrevocable way hopelessly behind europe  she made all european progress seem sluggish by comparison  we cannot tell here in any detail of japans war with china in 189495  it demonstrated the extent of her westernization  she had an efficient westernized army and a small but sound fleet but the significance of her renascence though it was appreciated by britain and the united states who were already treating her as if she were a european state was not understood by the other great powers engaged in the pursuit of new indias in asia  russia was pushing down through manchuria to korea  france was already established far to the south in tonkin and annam germany was 403 prowling hungrily on the lookout for some settlement  the three powers combined to prevent japan reaping any fruits from the chinese war  she was exhausted by the struggle and they threatened her with war  illustration a street in tokio  japan submitted for a time and gathered her forces  within ten years she was ready for a struggle with russia which marks an epoch in the history of asia the close of the period of european arrogance  the russian people were of course innocent and ignorant of this trouble that was being made for them halfway round the world and the wiser russian statesmen were against these foolish thrusts but a gang of financial adventurers including the grand dukes his cousins surrounded the tsar  they had gambled deeply in the prospective looting of manchuria and china and they would suffer no withdrawal  so there began a transportation of great armies of japanese soldiers across the sea to port arthur and korea and the sending of endless trainloads of russian peasants along the siberian railway to die in those distant battlefields  404  the russians badly led and dishonestly provided were beaten on sea and land alike  the russian baltic fleet sailed round africa to be utterly destroyed in the straits of tshushima  a revolutionary movement among the common people of russia infuriated by this remote and reasonless slaughter obliged the tsar to end the war 1905 he returned the southern half of saghalien which had been seized by russia in 1875 evacuated manchuria resigned korea to japan  the european invasion of asia was coming to an end and the retraction of europes tentacles was beginning     405  lxiv  the british empire in 1914   we may note here briefly the varied nature of the constituents of the british empire in 1914 which the steamship and railway had brought together  it was and is a quite unique political combination nothing of the sort has ever existed before  first and central to the whole system was the crowned republic of the united british kingdom including against the will of a considerable part of the irish people ireland  the majority of the british parliament made up of the three united parliaments of england and wales scotland and ireland determines the headship the quality and policy of the ministry and determines it largely on considerations arising out of british domestic politics  it is this ministry which is the effective supreme government with powers of peace and war over all the rest of the empire  next in order of political importance to the british states were the crowned republics of australia canada newfoundland the oldest british possession 1583 new zealand and south africa all practically independent and selfgoverning states in alliance with great britain but each with a representative of the crown appointed by the government in office  next the indian empire an extension of the empire of the great mogul with its dependent and protected states reaching now from beluchistan to burma and including aden in all of which empire the british crown and the india office under parliamentary control played the role of the original turkoman dynasty  then the ambiguous possession of egypt still nominally a part of the turkish empire and still retaining its own monarch the khedive but under almost despotic british official rule  then the still more ambiguous angloegyptian sudan province 407 occupied and administered jointly by the british and by the british controlled egyptian government  then a number of partially selfgoverning communities some british in origin and some not with elected legislatures and an appointed executive such as malta jamaica the bahamas and bermuda  then the crown colonies in which the rule of the british home government through the colonial office verged on autocracy as in ceylon trinidad and fiji where there was an appointed council and gibraltar and st helena where there was a governor  then great areas of chiefly tropical lands rawproduct areas with politically weak and undercivilized native communities which were nominally protectorates and administered either by a high commissioner set over native chiefs as in basutoland or over a chartered company as in rhodesia  in some cases the foreign office in some cases the colonial office and in some cases the india office has been concerned in acquiring the possessions that fell into this last and least definite class of all but for the most part the colonial office was now responsible for them  illustration gibraltar    406  map overseas empires of european powers january 1914    it will be manifest therefore that no single office and no single brain had ever comprehended the british empire as a whole it was a mixture of growths and accumulations entirely different from anything that has ever been called an empire before  it guaranteed a wide peace and security that is why it was endured and sustained by many men of the subject racesin spite of official tyrannies 408 and insufficiencies and of much negligence on the part of the home public  like the athenian empire it was an overseas empire its ways were sea ways and its common link was the british navy  like all empires its cohesion was dependent physically upon a method of communication the development of seamanship shipbuilding and steamships between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries had made it a possible and convenient paxthe pax britannica and fresh developments of air or swift land transport might at any time make it inconvenient  illustration street in hong kong     409  lxv  the age of armament in europe and the great war of 191418   the progress in material science that created this vast steamboatandrailway republic of america and spread this precarious british steamship empire over the world produced quite other effects upon the congested nations upon the continent of europe  they found themselves confined within boundaries fixed during the horseandhighroad period of human life and their expansion overseas had been very largely anticipated by great britain  only russia had any freedom to expand eastward and she drove a great railway across siberia until she entangled herself in a conflict with japan and pushed southeastwardly towards the borders of persia and india to the annoyance of britain  the rest of the european powers were in a state of intensifying congestion in order to realize the full possibilities of the new apparatus of human life they had to rearrange their affairs upon a broader basis either by some sort of voluntary union or by a union imposed upon them by some predominant power  the tendency of modern thought was in the direction of the former alternative but all the force of political tradition drove europe towards the latter  the downfall of the empire of napoleon iii the establishment of the new german empire pointed mens hopes and fears towards the idea of a europe consolidated under german auspices  for thirtysix years of uneasy peace the polities of europe centred upon that possibility  france the steadfast rival of germany for european ascendancy since the division of the empire of charlemagne sought to correct her own weakness by a close alliance with russia and germany linked herself closely with the austrian empire it had ceased to be the holy roman empire in the days of napoleon i and less successfully with the new kingdom of italy  410 at first great britain stood as usual half in and half out of continental affairs  but she was gradually forced into a close association with the francorussian group by the aggressive development of a great german navy  the grandiose imagination of the emperor william ii 18881918 thrust germany into premature overseas enterprise that ultimately brought not only great britain but japan and the united states into the circle of her enemies  illustration british tank in the battle of the menin road  all these nations armed  year after year the proportion of national production devoted to the making of guns equipment battleships and the like increased year after year the balance 411 of things seemed trembling towards war and then war would be averted  at last it came  germany and austria struck at france and russia and serbia the german armies marching through belgium britain immediately came into the war on the side of belgium bringing in japan as her ally and very soon turkey followed on the german side  italy entered the war against austria in 1915 and bulgaria joined the central powers in the october of that year  in 1916 rumania and in 1917 the united states and china were forced into war against germany  it is not within the scope of this history to define the exact share of blame for this vast catastrophe  the more interesting question is not why the great war was begun but why the great war was not anticipated and prevented  it is a far graver thing for mankind that scores of millions of people were too patriotic stupid or apathetic to prevent this disaster by a movement towards european unity upon frank and generous lines than that a small number of people may have been active in bringing it about  illustration the ruins of ypres once a delightful old flemish town  it is impossible within the space at our command here to trace the intricate details of the war  within a few months it became apparent that the progress of modern technical science had changed 412 the nature of warfare very profoundly  physical science gives power power over steel over distance over disease whether that power is used well or ill depends upon the moral and political intelligence of the world  the governments of europe inspired by antiquated policies of hate and suspicion found themselves with unexampled powers both of destruction and resistance in their hands  the war became a consuming fire round and about the world causing losses both to victors and vanquished out of all proportion to the issues involved  the first phase of the war was a tremendous rush of the germans upon paris and an invasion of east prussia by the russians  both attacks were held and turned  then the power of the defensive developed there was a rapid elaboration of trench warfare until for a time the opposing armies lay entrenched in long lines right across europe unable to make any advance without enormous losses  the armies were millions strong and behind them entire populations were organized for the supply of food and munitions to the front  then was a cessation of nearly every sort of productive activity except such as contributed to military operations  all the ablebodied manhood of europe was drawn into the armies or navies or into the improvised factories that served 413 them  there was an enormous replacement of men by women in industry  probably more than half the people in the belligerent countries of europe changed their employment altogether during this stupendous struggle  they were socially uprooted and transplanted education and normal scientific work were restricted or diverted to immediate military ends and the distribution of news was crippled and corrupted by military control and propaganda activities  illustration the devastation of modern war  the phase of military deadlock passed slowly into one of aggression upon the combatant populations behind the fronts by the destruction of food supplies and by attacks through the air  and also there was a steady improvement in the size and range of the guns employed and of such ingenious devices as poisongas shells and the small mobile forts known as tanks to break down the resistance of troops in the trenches  the air offensive was the most revolutionary of all the new methods  it carried warfare from two dimensions into three  hitherto in the history of mankind war had gone on only where the armies marched and met now it went on everywhere  first the zeppelin and then the bombing aeroplane carried war over and past the front to an everincreasing area of civilian activities beyond  the old distinction maintained in civilized warfare between the civilian and combatant population disappeared  everyone who grew food or who sewed a garment everyone who felled a tree or repaired a house every railway station and every warehouse was held to be fair game for destruction  the air offensive increased in range and terror with every month in the war  at last great areas of europe were in a state of siege and subject to nightly raids such exposed cities as london and paris passed sleepless night after sleepless night while the bombs burst the antiaircraft guns maintained an intolerable racket and the fire engines and ambulances rattled headlong through the darkened and deserted streets  the effects upon the minds and health of old people and of young children were particularly distressing and destructive  pestilence that old follower of warfare did not arrive until the very end of the fighting in 1918  for four years medical science staved off any general epidemic then carne a great outbreak of 414 influenza about the world which destroyed many millions of people  famine also was staved off for some time  by the beginning of 1918 however most of europe was in a state of mitigated and regulated famine  the production of food throughout the world had fallen very greatly through the calling off of peasant mankind to the fronts and the distribution of such food as was produced was impeded by the havoc wrought by the submarine by the rupture of customary routes through the closing of frontiers and by the disorganization of the transport system of the world  the various governments took possession of the dwindling food supplies and with more or less success rationed their populations  by the fourth year the whole world was suffering from shortages of clothing and housing and of most of the normal gear of life as well as of food  business and economic life were profoundly disorganized  everyone was worried and most people were leading lives of unwonted discomfort  the actual warfare ceased in november 1918  after a supreme effort in the spring of 1918 that almost carried the germans to paris the central powers collapsed  they had come to an end of their spirit and resources     415  lxvi  the revolution and famine in russia   but a good year and more before the collapse of the central powers the half oriental monarchy of russia which had professed to be the continuation of the byzantine empire had collapsed  the tsardom had been showing signs of profound rottenness for some years before the war the court was under the sway of a fantastic religious impostor rasputin and the public administration civil and military was in a state of extreme inefficiency and corruption  at the outset of the war there was a great flare of patriotic enthusiasm in russia  a vast conscript army was called up for which there was neither adequate military equipment nor a proper supply of competent officers and this great host ill supplied and badly handled was hurled against the german and austrian frontiers  there can be no doubt that the early appearance of russian armies in east prussia in september 1914 diverted the energies and attention of the germans from their first victorious drive upon paris  the sufferings and deaths of scores of thousands of illled russian peasants saved france from complete overthrow in that momentous opening campaign and made all western europe the debtors of that great and tragic people  but the strain of the war upon this sprawling illorganized empire was too heavy for its strength  the russian common soldiers were sent into battle without guns to support them without even rifle ammunition they were wasted by their officers and generals in a delirium of militarist enthusiasm  for a time they seemed to be suffering mutely as the beasts suffer but there is a limit to the endurance even of the most ignorant  a profound disgust for tsardom was creeping through these armies of betrayed and wasted men  from the close of 1915 onward russia was a source of deepening anxiety to her western allies  throughout 1916 she remained largely on 416 the defensive and there were rumours of a separate peace with germany  on december 29th 1916 the monk rasputin was murdered at a dinner party in petrograd and a belated attempt was made to put the tsardom in order  by march things were moving rapidly food riots in petrograd developed into a revolutionary insurrection there was an attempted suppression of the duma the representative body there were attempted arrests of liberal leaders the formation of a provisional government under prince lvoff and an abdication march 15th by the tsar  for a time it seemed that a moderate and controlled revolution might be possibleperhaps under a new tsar  then it became evident that the destruction of popular confidence in russia had gone too far for any such adjustments the russian people were sick to death of the old order of things in europe of tsars and wars and of great powers it wanted relief and that speedily from unendurable miseries  the allies had no understanding of russian realities their diplomatists were ignorant of russian genteel persons with their attention directed to the russian court rather than to russia they blundered steadily with the new situation  there was little goodwill among these diplomatists for republicanism and a manifest disposition to embarrass the new government as much as possible  at the head of the russian republican government was an eloquent and picturesque leader kerensky who found himself assailed by the forces of a profounder revolutionary movement the social revolution at home and coldshouldered by the allied governments abroad  his allies would neither let him give the russian peasants the land for which they craved nor peace beyond their frontiers  the french and the british press pestered their exhausted ally for a fresh offensive but when presently the germans made a strong attack by sea and land upon riga the british admiralty quailed before the prospect of a baltic expedition in relief  the new russian republic had to fight unsupported  in spite of their naval predominance and the bitter protests of the great english admiral lord fisher 18411920 it is to be noted that the british and their allies except for some submarine attacks left the germans the complete mastery of the baltic throughout the war  417  the russian masses however were resolute to end the war  at any cost  there had come into existence in petrograd a body representing the workers and common soldiers the soviet and this body clamoured for an international conference of socialists at stockholm  food riots were occurring in berlin at this time war weariness in austria and germany was profound and there can be little doubt in the light of subsequent events that such a conference would have precipitated a reasonable peace on democratic lines in 1917 and a german revolution  kerensky implored his western allies to allow this conference to take place but fearful of a worldwide outbreak of socialism and republicanism they refused in spite of the favourable response of a small majority of the british labour party  without either moral or physical help from the allies the unhappy moderate russian republic still fought on and made a last desperate offensive effort in july  it failed after some preliminary successes and there came another great slaughtering of russians  the limit of russian endurance was reached  mutinies broke out in the russian armies and particularly upon the northern front and on november 7th 1917 kerenskys government was overthrown and power was seized by the soviets dominated by the bolshevik socialists under lenin and pledged to make peace regardless of the western powers  on march 2nd 1918 a separate peace between russia and germany was signed at brestlitovsk    418  illustration a view in petersburg under bolshevik rule    it speedily became evident that these bolshevik socialists were men of a very different quality from the rhetorical constitutionalists and revolutionaries of the kerensky phase they were fanatical marxist communists  they believed that their accession to power in russia was only the opening of a worldwide social revolution and they set about changing the social and economic order with the thoroughness of perfect faith and absolute inexperience  the western european and the american governments were themselves much too illinformed and incapable to guide or help this extraordinary experiment and the press set itself to discredit and the ruling classes to wreck these usurpers upon any terms and at any cost to themselves or to russia  a propaganda of abominable and disgusting inventions went on unchecked in the press of the 419 world the bolshevik leaders were represented as incredible monsters glutted with blood and plunder and living lives of sensuality before which the realities of the tsarist court during the rasputin regime paled to a white purity expeditions were launched at the exhausted country insurgents and raiders were encouraged armed and subsidized and no method of attack was too mean or too monstrous for the frightened enemies of the bolshevik regime  in 1919 the russian bolsheviks ruling a country already exhausted and disorganized by five years of intensive warfare were fighting a british expedition at archangel japanese invaders in eastern siberia roumanians with french and greek contingents in the south the russian admiral koltchak in siberia and general deniken supported by the french fleet in the crimea  in july of that year an esthonian army under general yudenitch almost got to petersburg  in 1920 the poles incited by the french made a new attack on russia and a new reactionary raider general wrangel took over the task of general deniken in invading and devastating his own country  in march 1921 the sailors at cronstadt revolted  the russian government under its president lenin survived all these various attacks  it showed an amazing tenacity and the common people of russia sustained it unswervingly under conditions of extreme hardship  by the end of 1921 both britain and italy had made a sort of recognition of the communist rule  but if the bolshevik government was successful in its struggle against foreign intervention and internal revolt it was far less happy in its attempts to set up a new social order based upon communist ideas in russia  the russian peasant is a small landhungry proprietor as far from communism in his thoughts and methods as a whale is from flying the revolution gave him the land of the great landowners but could not make him grow food for anything but negotiable money and the revolution among other things had practically destroyed the value of money agricultural production already greatly disordered by the collapse of the railways through warstrain shrank to a mere cultivation of food by the peasants for their own consumption the towns starved  hasty and illplanned attempts to make over industrial production 420 in accordance with communist ideas were equally unsuccessful  by 1920 russia presented the unprecedented spectacle of a modern civilization in complete collapse  railways were rusting and passing out of use towns were falling into ruin everywhere there was an immense mortality yet the country still fought with its enemies at its gates  in 1921 came a drought and a great famine among the peasant cultivators in the wardevastated southeast provinces  millions of people starved  but the question of the distresses and the possible recuperation of russia brings us too close to current controversies to be discussed here     421  lxvii  the political and social reconstruction of the world   the scheme and scale upon which this history is planned do not permit us to enter into the complicated and acrimonious disputes that centre about the treaties and particularly of the treaty of versailles which concluded the great war  we are beginning to realize that that conflict terrible and enormous as it was ended nothing began nothing and settled nothing  it killed millions of people it wasted and impoverished the world  it smashed russia altogether  it was at best an acute and frightful reminder that we were living foolishly and confusedly without much plan or foresight in a dangerous and unsympathetic universe  the crudely organized egotisms and passions of national and imperial greed that carried mankind into that tragedy emerged from it sufficiently unimpaired to make some other similar disaster highly probable so soon as the world has a little recovered from its war exhaustion and fatigue  wars and revolutions make nothing their utmost service to mankind is that in a very rough and painful way they destroy superannuated and obstructive things  the great war lifted the threat of german imperialism from europe and shattered the imperialism of russia  it cleared away a number of monarchies  but a multitude of flags still waves in europe the frontiers still exasperate great armies accumulate fresh stores of equipment  the peace conference at versailles was a gathering very ill adapted to do more than carry out the conflicts and defeats of the war to their logical conclusions  the germans austrians turks and bulgarians were permitted no share in its deliberations they were only to accept the decisions it dictated to them  from the point of view of human welfare the choice of the place of meeting was particularly unfortunate  it was at versailles in 1871 that with every circumstance of triumphant vulgarity the new german 422 empire had been proclaimed  the suggestion of a melodramatic reversal of that scene in the same hall of mirrors was overpowering  whatever generosities had appeared in the opening phases of the great war had long been exhausted  the populations of the victorious countries were acutely aware of their own losses and sufferings and entirely regardless of the fact that the defeated had paid in the like manner  the war had arisen as a natural and inevitable consequence of the competitive nationalisms of europe and the absence of any federal adjustment of these competitive forces war is the necessary logical consummation of independent sovereign nationalities living in too small an area with too powerful an armament and if the great war had not come in the form it did it would have come in some similar formjust as it will certainly return upon a still more disastrous scale in twenty or thirty years time if no political unification anticipates and prevents it  states organized for war will make wars as surely as hens will lay eggs but the feeling of these distressed and warworn countries disregarded this fact and the whole of the defeated peoples were treated as morally and materially responsible for all the damage as they would no doubt have treated the victor peoples had the issue of war been different the french and english thought the germans were to blame the germans thought the russians french and english were to blame and only an intelligent minority thought that there was anything to blame in the fragmentary political constitution of europe  the treaty of versailles was intended to be exemplary and vindictive it provided tremendous penalties for the vanquished it sought to provide compensations for the wounded and suffering victors by imposing enormous debts upon nations already bankrupt and its attempts to reconstitute international relations by the establishment of a league of nations against war were manifestly insincere and inadequate  illustration passenger aeroplane flying over northolt  so far as europe was concerned it is doubtful if there would have been any attempt whatever to organize international relations for a permanent peace  the proposal of the league of nations was brought into practical politics by the president of the united states of america president wilson  its chief support was in america  so far the united states this new modern state had 423 developed no distinctive ideas of international relationship beyond the monroe doctrine which protected the new world from european interference  now suddenly it was called upon for its mental contribution to the vast problem of the time  it had none the natural disposition of the american people was towards a permanent world peace  with this however was linked a strong traditional distrust of oldworld polities and a habit of isolation from oldworld entanglements  the americans had hardly begun to think out an american solution of world problems when the submarine campaign of the germans dragged them into the war on the side of the antigerman allies  president wilsons scheme of a league of nations was an attempt at short notice to create a distinctively american world project  it was a sketchy inadequate and dangerous scheme  in europe however it was taken as a matured american point of view  the generality of mankind in 191819 was intensely weary of war and anxious at almost any sacrifice to erect 424 barriers against its recurrence but there was not a single government in the old world willing to waive one iota of its sovereign independence to attain any such end  the public utterances of president wilson leading up to the project of a world league of nations seemed for a time to appeal right over the heads of the governments to the peoples of the world they were taken as expressing the ripe intentions of america and the response was enormous  unhappily president wilson had to deal with governments and not with peoples he was a man capable of tremendous flashes of vision and yet when put to the test egotistical and limited and the great wave of enthusiasm he evoked passed and was wasted  says dr dillon in his book the peace conference europe when the president touched its shores was as clay ready for the creative potter  never before were the nations so eager to follow a moses who would take them to the longpromised land where wars are prohibited and blockades unknown  and to their thinking he was just that great leader  in france men bowed down before him with awe and affection  labour leaders in paris told me that they shed tears of joy in his presence and that their comrades would go through fire and water to help him to realize his noble schemes  to the working classes in italy his name was a heavenly clarion at the sound of which the earth would be renewed  the germans regarded him and his doctrine as their sheetanchor of safety  the fearless herr muehlon said if president wilson were to address the germans and pronounce a severe sentence upon them they would accept it with resignation and without a murmur and set to work at once  in germanaustria his fame was that of a saviour and the mere mention of his name brought balm to the suffering and surcease of sorrow to the afflicted    such were the overpowering expectations that president wilson raised  how completely he disappointed them and how weak and futile was the league of nations he made is too long and too distressful a story to tell here  he exaggerated in his person our common human tragedy he was so very great in his dreams and so incapable in his performance  america dissented from the acts of its president and would not join the league europe accepted from him  there was a slow realization on the part of the american 425 people that it had been rushed into something for which it was totally unprepared  there was a corresponding realization on the part of europe that america had nothing ready to give to the old world in its extremity  born prematurely and crippled at its birth that league has become indeed with its elaborate and unpractical constitution and its manifest limitations of power a serious obstacle in the way of any effective reorganization of international relationships  the problem would be a clearer one if the league did not yet exist yet that worldwide blaze of enthusiasm that first welcomed the project that readiness of men everywhere round and about the earth of men that is as distinguished from governments for a world control of war is a thing to be recorded with emphasis in any history  behind the shortsighted governments that divide and mismanage human affairs a real force for world unity and world order exists and grows  from 1918 onward the world entered upon an age of conferences  of these the conference at washington called by president harding 1921 has been the most successful and suggestive  notable too is the genoa conference 1922 for the appearance of german and russian delegates at its deliberations  we will not discuss this long procession of conferences and tentatives in any detail  it becomes more and more clearly manifest that a huge work of reconstruction has to be done by mankind if a crescendo of such convulsions and world massacres as that of the great war is to be averted  no such hasty improvisation as the league of nations no patchedup system of conferences between this group of states and that which change nothing with an air of settling everything will meet the complex political needs of the new age that lies before us  a systematic development and a systematic application of the sciences of human relationship of personal and group psychology of financial and economic science and of education sciences still only in their infancy is required  narrow and obsolete dead and dying moral and political ideas have to be replaced by a clearer and a simpler conception of the common origins and destinies of our kind  illustration a peaceful garden in england  but if the dangers confusions and disasters that crowd upon man in these days are enormous beyond any experience of the past it is because science has brought him such powers as he never had 426 before  and the scientific method of fearless thought exhaustively lucid statement and exhaustively criticized planning which has given him these as yet uncontrollable powers gives him also the hope of controlling these powers  man is still only adolescent  his troubles are not the troubles of senility and exhaustion but of increasing and still undisciplined strength when we look at all 427 history as one process as we have been doing in this book when we see the steadfast upward struggle of life towards vision and control then we see in their true proportions the hopes and dangers of the present time  as yet we are hardly in the earliest dawn of human greatness  but in the beauty of flower and sunset in the happy and perfect movement of young animals and in the delight of ten thousand various landscapes we have some intimations of what life can do for us and in some few works of plastic and pictorial art in some great music in a few noble buildings and happy gardens we have an intimation of what the human will can do with material possibilities  we have dreams we have at present undisciplined but ever increasing power  can we doubt that presently our race will more than realize our boldest imaginations that it will achieve unity and peace that it will live the children of our blood and lives will live in a world made more splendid and lovely than any palace or garden that we know going on from strength to strength in an ever widening circle of adventure and achievement  what man has done the little triumphs of his present state and all this history we have told form but the prelude to the things that man has got to do     429  chronological table   about the year 1000 bc the aryan peoples were establishing themselves in the peninsulas of spain italy and
