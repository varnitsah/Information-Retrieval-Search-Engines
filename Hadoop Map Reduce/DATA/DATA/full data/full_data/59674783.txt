 the reception of the empress  xvi   the library of grosbois  xvii  the end      chapter i   the coast of france  i dare say that i had already read my uncles letter a hundred times and i am sure that i knew it by heart  none the less i took it out of my pocket and sitting on the side of the lugger i went over it again with as much attention as if it were for the first time  it was written in a prim angular hand such as one might expect from a man who had begun life as a village attorney and it was addressed to louis de laval to the care of william hargreaves of the green man in ashford kent  the landlord had many a hogshead of untaxed french brandy from the normandy coast and the letter had found its way by the same hands  my dear nephew louis said the letter now that your father is dead and that you are alone in the world i am sure that you will not wish to carry on the feud which has existed between the two halves of the family  at the time of the troubles your father was drawn towards the side of the king and i towards that of the people and it ended as you know by his having to fly from the country and by my becoming the possessor of the estates of grosbois  no doubt it is very hard that you should find yourself in a different position to your ancestors but i am sure that you would rather that the land should be held by a bernac than by a stranger  from the brother of your mother you will at least always meet with sympathy and consideration  and now i have some advice for you  you know that i have always been a republican but it has become evident to me that there is no use in fighting against fate and that napoleons power is far too great to be shaken  this being so i have tried to serve him for it is well to howl when you are among wolves  i have been able to do so much for him that he has become my very good friend so that i may ask him what i like in return  he is now as you are probably aware with the army at boulogne within a few miles of grosbois  if you will come over at once he will certainly forget the hostility of your father in consideration of the services of your uncle  it is true that your name is still proscribed but my influence with the emperor will set that matter right  come to me then come at once and come with confidence                                       your uncle                                           c bernac  so much for the letter but it was the outside which had puzzled me most  a seal of red wax had been affixed at either end and my uncle had apparently used his thumb as a signet  one could see the little rippling edges of a coarse skin imprinted upon the wax  and then above one of the seals there was written in english the two words dont come  it was hastily scrawled and whether by a man or a woman it was impossible to say but there it stared me in the face that sinister addition to an invitation  dont come  had it been added by this unknown uncle of mine on account of some sudden change in his plans surely that was inconceivable for why in that case should he send the invitation at all  or was it placed there by some one else who wished to warn me from accepting this offer of hospitality  the letter was in french  the warning was in english  could it have been added in england  but the seals were unbroken and how could any one in england know what were the contents of the letter  and then as i sat there with the big sail humming like a shell above my head and the green water hissing beside me i thought over all that i had heard of this uncle of mine  my father the descendant of one of the proudest and oldest families in france had chosen beauty and virtue rather than rank in his wife  never for an hour had she given him cause to regret it but this lawyer brother of hers had as i understood offended my father by his slavish obsequiousness in days of prosperity and his venomous enmity in the days of trouble  he had hounded on the peasants until my family had been compelled to fly from the country and had afterwards aided robespierre in his worst excesses receiving as a reward the castle and estate of grosbois which was our own  at the fall of robespierre he had succeeded in conciliating barras and through every successive change he still managed to gain a fresh tenure of the property  now it appeared from his letter that the new emperor of france had also taken his part though why he should befriend a man with such a history and what service my republican uncle could possibly render to him were matters upon which i could form no opinion  and now you will ask me no doubt why i should accept the invitation of such a mana man whom my father had always stigmatised as a usurper and a traitor  it is easier to speak of it now than then but the fact was that we of the new generation felt it very irksome and difficult to carry on the bitter quarrels of the last  to the older emigres the clock of time seemed to have stopped in the year 1792 and they remained for ever with the loves and the hatreds of that era fixed indelibly upon their souls  they had been burned into them by the fiery furnace through which they had passed  but we who had grown up upon a strange soil understood that the world had moved and that new issues had arisen  we were inclined to forget these feuds of the last generation france to us was no longer the murderous land of the sansculotte and the guillotine basket it was rather the glorious queen of war attacked by all and conquering all but still so hard pressed that her scattered sons could hear her call to arms for ever sounding in their ears  it was that call more than my uncles letter which was taking me over the waters of the channel  for long my heart had been with my country in her struggle and yet while my father lived i had never dared to say so for to him who had served under conde and fought at quiberon it would have seemed the blackest treason  but after his death there was no reason why i should not return to the land of my birth and my desire was the stronger because eugeniethe same eugenie who has been thirty years my wifewas of the same way of thinking as myself  her parents were a branch of the de choiseuls and their prejudices were even stronger than those of my father  little did they think what was passing in the minds of their children  many a time when they were mourning a french victory in the parlour we were both capering with joy in the garden  there was a little window all choked round with laurel bushes in the corner of the bare brick house and there we used to meet at night the dearer to each other from our difference with all who surrounded us  i would tell her my ambitions she would strengthen them by her enthusiasm  and so all was ready when the time came  but there was another reason besides the death of my father and the receipt of this letter from my uncle  ashford was becoming too hot to hold me  i will say this for the english that they were very generous hosts to the french emigrants  there was not one of us who did not carry away a kindly remembrance of the land and its people  but in every country there are overbearing swaggering folk and even in quiet sleepy ashford we were plagued by them  there was one young kentish squire farley was his name who had earned a reputation in the town as a bully and a roisterer  he could not meet one of us without uttering insults not merely against the present french government which might have been excusable in an english patriot but against france itself and all frenchmen  often we were forced to be deaf in his presence but at last his conduct became so intolerable that i determined to teach him a lesson  there were several of us in the coffeeroom at the green man one evening and he full of wine and malice was heaping insults upon the french his eyes creeping round to me every moment to see how i was taking it  now monsieur de laval he cried putting his rude hand upon my shoulder here is a toast for you to drink  this is to the arm of nelson which strikes down the french  he stood leering at me to see if i would drink it  well sir said i i will drink your toast if you will drink mine in return come on then said he  so we drank  now monsieur let us have your toast said he  fill your glass then said i  it is full now well then heres to the cannonball which carried off that arm  in an instant i had a glass of port wine running down my face and within an hour a meeting had been arranged  i shot him through the shoulder and that night when i came to the little window eugenie plucked off some of the laurel leaves and stuck them in my hair  there were no legal proceedings about the duel but it made my position a little difficult in the town and it will explain with other things why i had no hesitation in accepting my unknown uncles invitation in spite of the singular addition which i found upon the cover  if he had indeed sufficient influence with the emperor to remove the proscription which was attached to our name then the only barrier which shut me off from my country would be demolished  you must picture me all this time as sitting upon the side of the lugger and turning my prospects and my position over in my head  my reverie was interrupted by the heavy hand of the english skipper dropping abruptly upon my arm  now then master said he its time you were stepping into the dingey  i do not inherit the politics of the aristocrats but i have never lost their sense of personal dignity  i gently pushed away his polluting hand and i remarked that we were still a long way from the shore  well you can do as you please said he roughly im going no nearer so you can take your choice of getting into the dingey or of swimming for it  it was in vain that i pleaded that he had been paid his price  i did not add that that price meant that the watch which had belonged to three generations of de lavals was now lying in the shop of a dover goldsmith  little enough too he cried harshly  down sail jim and bring her to  now master you can step over the side or you can come back to dover but i dont take the vixen a cables length nearer to ambleteuse beef with this gale coming up from the souwest  in that case i shall go said i  you can lay your life on that he answered and laughed in so irritating a fashion that i half turned upon him with the intention of chastising him  one is very helpless with these fellows however for a serious affair is of course out of the question while if one uses a cane upon them they have a vile habit of striking with their hands which gives them an advantage  the marquis de chamfort told me that when he first settled in sutton at the time of the emigration he lost a tooth when reproving an unruly peasant  i made the best of a necessity therefore and shrugging my shoulders i passed over the side of the lugger into the little boat  my bundle was dropped in after meconceive to yourself the heir of all the de lavals travelling with a single bundle for his baggageand two seamen pushed her off pulling with long slow strokes towards the lowlying shore  there was certainly every promise of a wild night for the dark cloud which had rolled up over the setting sun was now frayed and ragged at the edges extending a good third of the way across the heavens  it had split low down near the horizon and the crimson glare of the sunset beat through the gap so that there was the appearance of fire with a monstrous reek of smoke  a red dancing belt of light lay across the broad slatecoloured ocean and in the centre of it the little black craft was wallowing and tumbling  the two seamen kept looking up at the heavens and then over their shoulders at the land and i feared every moment that they would put back before the gale burst  i was filled with apprehension every time when the end of their pull turned their faces skyward and it was to draw their attention away from the stormdrift that i asked them what the lights were which had begun to twinkle through the dusk both to the right and to the left of us  thats boulogne to the north and etaples upon the south said one of the seamen civilly  boulogne  etaples  how the words came back to me  it was to boulogne that in my boyhood we had gone down for the summer bathing  could i not remember as a little lad trotting along by my fathers side as he paced the beach and wondering why every fishermans cap flew off at our approach  and as to etaples it was thence that we had fled for england when the folks came raving to the pierhead as we passed and i joined my thin voice to my fathers as he shrieked back at them for a stone had broken my mothers knee and we were all frenzied with our fear and our hatred  and here they were these places of my childhood twinkling to the north and south of me while there in the darkness between them and only ten miles off at the furthest lay my own castle my own land of grosbois where the men of my blood had lived and died long before some of us had gone across with duke william to conquer the proud island over the water  how i strained my eager eyes through the darkness as i thought that the distant black keep of our fortalice might even now be visible  yes sir said the seaman tis a fine stretch of lonesome coast and many is the cock of your hackle that i have helped ashore there  what do you take me for then i asked  well tis no business of mine sir he answered  there are some trades that had best not even be spoken about  you think that i am a conspirator  well master since you have put a name to it  lor love you sir were used to it  i give you my word that i am none  an escaped prisoner then  no nor that either  the man leaned upon his oar and i could see in the gloom that his face was thrust forward and that it was wrinkled with suspicion  if youre one of boneys spies he cried  i a spy the tone of my voice was enough to convince him  well said he im darned if i know what you are  but if youd been a spy id ha had no hand in landing you whatever the skipper might say  mind you ive no word to say against boney said the other seaman speaking in a very thick rumbling voice  hes been a rare good friend to the poor mariner  it surprised me to hear him speak so for the virulence of feeling against the new french emperor in england exceeded all belief and high and low were united in their hatred of him but the sailor soon gave me a clue to his politics  if the poor mariner can run in his little bit of coffee and sugar and run out his silk and his brandy he has boney to thank for it said he the merchants have had their spell and now its the turn of the poor mariner  i remembered then that buonaparte was personally very popular amongst the smugglers as well he might be seeing that he had made over into their hands all the trade of the channel  the seaman continued to pull with his left hand but he pointed with his right over the slatecoloured dancing waters  theres boney himself said he  you who live in a quieter age cannot conceive the thrill which these simple words sent through me  it was but ten years since we had first heard of this man with the curious italian namethink  of it ten years the time that it takes for a private to become a noncommissioned officer or a clerk to win a fiftypound advance in his salary  he had sprung in an instant out of nothing into everything  one month people were asking who he was the next he had broken out in the north of italy like the plague venice and genoa withered at the touch of this swarthy illnourished boy  he cowed the soldiers in the field and he outwitted the statesmen in the council chamber  with a frenzy of energy he rushed to the east and then while men were still marvelling at the way in which he had converted egypt into a french department he was back again in italy and had beaten austria for the second time to the earth  he travelled as quickly as the rumour of his coming and where he came there were new victories new combinations the crackling of old systems and the blurring of ancient lines of frontier  holland savoy switzerlandthey were become mere names upon the map  france was eating into europe in every direction  they had made him emperor this beardless artillery officer and without an effort he had crushed down those republicans before whom the oldest king and the proudest nobility of europe had been helpless  so it came about that we who watched him dart from place to place like the shuttle of destiny and who heard his name always in connection with some new achievement and some new success had come at last to look upon him as something more than human something monstrous overshadowing france and menacing europe  his giant presence loomed over the continent and so deep was the impression which his fame had made in my mind that when the english sailor pointed confidently over the darkening waters and cried theres boney i looked up for the instant with a foolish expectation of seeing some gigantic figure some elemental creature dark inchoate and threatening brooding over the waters of the channel  even now after the long gap of years and the knowledge of his downfall that great man casts his spell upon you but all that you read and all that you hear cannot give you an idea of what his name meant in the days when he was at the summit of his career  what actually met my eye was very different from this childish expectation of mine  to the north there was a long low cape the name of which has now escaped me  in the evening light it had been of the same greyish green tint as the other headlands but now as the darkness fell it gradually  broke into a dull glow like a cooling iron on that wild night seen and lost with the heave and sweep of the boat this lurid streak carried with it a vague but sinister suggestion the red line splitting the darkness might have been a giant halfforged swordblade with its point towards england  what is it then i asked  just what i say master said he  its one of boneys armies with boney himself in the middle of it as like as not  them is their camp fires and youll see a dozen such between this and ostend hes audacious enough to come across is little boney if he could dowse lord nelsons other eye but theres no chance for him until then and well he knows it  how can lord nelson know what he is doing i asked  the man pointed out over my shoulder into the darkness and far on the horizon i perceived three little twinkling lights  watch dog said he in his husky voice  andromeda  fortyfour added his companion  i have often thought of them since the long glow upon the land and the three little lights upon the sea standing for so much for the two great rivals face to face for the power of the land and the power of the water for the centuriesold battle which may last for centuries to come  and yet frenchman as i am do i not know that the struggle is already decidedfor it lies between the childless nation and that which has a lusty young brood springing up around her  if france falls she dies but if england falls how many nations are there who will carry her speech her traditions and her blood on into the history of the future  the land had been looming darker and the thudding of waves upon the sand sounded louder every instant upon my ears  i could already see the quick dancing gleam of the surf in front of me  suddenly as i peered through the deepening shadow a long dark boat shot out from it like a trout from under a stone making straight in our direction  a guard boat cried one of the seamen  bill boy were done said the other and began to stuff something into his sea boot  but the boat swerved at the sight of us like a shying horse and was off in another direction as fast as eight frantic oars could drive her the seamen stared after her and wiped their brows  her conscience dont seem much easier than our own said one of them  i made sure it was the preventives  looks to me as if you werent the only queer cargo on the coast tonight mister remarked his comrade  what could she be  cursed if i know what she was  i rammed a cake of good trinidad tobacco into my boot when i saw her  ive seen the inside of a french prison before now  give way bill and have it over  a minute later with a low grating sound we ran aground upon a gravelly leach  my bundle was thrown ashore i stepped after it and a seaman pushed the prow off again springing in as his comrade backed her into deep water  already the glow in the west had vanished the stormcloud was half up the heavens and a thick blackness had gathered over the ocean  as i turned to watch the vanishing boat a keen wet blast flapped in my face and the air was filled with the high piping of the wind and with the deep thunder of the sea  and thus it was that on a wild evening in the early spring of the year 1805 i louis de laval being in the twentyfirst year of my age returned after an exile of thirteen years to the country of which my family had for many centuries been the ornament and support  she had treated us badly this country she had repaid our services by insult exile and confiscation  but all that was forgotten as i the only de laval of the new generation dropped upon my knees upon her sacred soil and with the strong smell of the seaweed in my nostrils pressed my lips upon the wet and pringling gravel    chapter ii   the saltmarsh  when a man has reached his mature age he can rest at that point of vantage and cast his eyes back at the long road along which he has travelled lying with its gleams of sunshine and its stretches of shadow in the valley behind him  he knows then its whence and its whither and the twists and bends which were so full of promise or of menace as he approached them lie exposed and open to his gaze  so plain is it all that he can scarce remember how dark it may have seemed to him or how long he once hesitated at the cross roads  thus when he tries to recall each stage of the journey he does so with the knowledge of its end and can no longer make it clear even to himself how it may have seemed to him at the time  and yet in spite of the strain of years and the many passages which have befallen me since there is no time of my life which comes back so very clearly as that gusty evening and to this day i cannot feel the briny wholesome whiff of the seaweed without being carried back with that intimate feeling of reality which only the sense of smell can confer to the wet shingle of the french beach  when i had risen from my knees the first thing that i did was to put my purse into the inner pocket of my coat  i had taken it out in order to give a gold piece to the sailor who had handed me ashore though i have little doubt that the fellow was both wealthier and of more assured prospects than myself  i had actually drawn out a silver halfcrown but i could not bring myself to offer it to him and so ended by giving a tenth part of my whole fortune to a stranger  the other nine sovereigns i put very carefully away and then sitting down upon a flat rock just above high water mark i turned it all over in my mind and weighed what i should do  already i was cold and hungry with the wind lashing my face and the spray smarting in my eyes but at least i was no longer living upon the charity of the enemies of my country and the thought set my heart dancing within me  but the castle as well as i could remember was a good ten miles off  to go there now was to arrive at an unseemly hour unkempt and weatherstained before this uncle whom i had never seen  my sensitive pride conjured up a picture of the scornful faces of his servants as they looked out upon this bedraggled wanderer from england slinking back to the castle which should have been his own  no i must seek shelter for the night and then at my leisure with as fair a show of appearances as possible i must present myself before my relative  where then could i find a refuge from the storm  you will ask me doubtless why i did not make for etaples or boulogne i answer that it was for the same reason which forced me to land secretly upon that forbidding coast  the name of de laval still headed the list of the proscribed for my father had been a famous and energetic leader of the small but influential body of men who had remained true at all costs to the old order of things  do not think that because i was of another way of thinking i despised those who had given up so much for their principles  there is a curious saintlike trait in our natures which draws us most strongly towards that which involves the greatest sacrifice and i have sometimes thought that if the conditions had been less onerous the bourbons might have had fewer or at least less noble followers  the french nobles had been more faithful to them than the english to the stuarts for cromwell had no luxurious court or rich appointments which he could hold out to those who would desert the royal cause  no words can exaggerate the selfabnegation of those men  i have seen a supper party under my fathers roof where our guests were two fencingmasters three professors of language one ornamental gardener and one translator of books who held his hand in the front of his coat to conceal a rent in the lapel  but these eight men were of the highest nobility of france who might have had what they chose to ask if they would only consent to forget the past and to throw themselves heartily into the new order of things  but the humble and what is sadder the incapable monarch of hartwell still held the allegiance of those old montmorencies rohans and choiseuls who having shared the greatness of his family were determined also to stand by it in its ruin  the dark chambers of that exiled monarch were furnished with something better than the tapestry of gobelins or the china of sevres  across the gulf which separates my old age from theirs i can still see those illclad gravemannered men and i raise my hat to the noblest group of nobles that our history can show  to visit a coasttown therefore before i had seen my uncle or learnt whether my return had been sanctioned would be simply to deliver myself into the hands of the gens darmes who were ever on the lookout for strangers from england  to go before the new emperor was one thing and to be dragged before him another  on the whole it seemed to me that my best course was to wander inland in the hope of finding some empty barn or outhouse where i could pass the night unseen and undisturbed  then in the morning i should consider how it was best for me to approach my uncle bernac and through him the new master of france  the wind had freshened meanwhile into a gale and it was so dark upon the seaward side that i could only catch the white flash of a leaping wave here and there in the blackness  of the lugger which had brought me from dover i could see no sign  on the land side of me there seemed as far as i could make it out to be a line of low hills but when i came to traverse them i found that the dim light had exaggerated their size and that they were mere scattered sanddunes mottled with patches of bramble  over these i toiled with my bundle slung over my shoulder plodding heavily through the loose sand and tripping over the creepers but forgetting my wet clothes and my numb hands as i recalled the many hardships and adventures which my ancestors had undergone  it amused me to think that the day might come when my own descendants might fortify themselves by the recollection of that which was happening to me for in a great family like ours the individual is always subordinate to the race  it seemed to me that i should never get to the end of the sanddunes but when at last i did come off them i heartily wished that i was back upon them again for the sea in that part comes by some creek up the back of the beach forming at low tide a great desolate saltmarsh which must be a forlorn place even in the daytime but upon such a night as that it was a most dreary wilderness  at first it was but a softness of the ground causing me to slip as i walked but soon the mud was over my ankles and halfway up to my knees so that each foot gave a loud flop as i raised it and a dull splash as i set it down again  i would willingly have made my way out even if i had to return to the sanddunes but in trying to pick my path i had lost all my bearings and the air was so full of the sounds of the storm that the sea seemed to be on every side of me  i had heard of how one may steer oneself by observation of the stars but my quiet english life had not taught me how such things were done and had i known i could scarcely have profited by it since the few stars which were visible peeped out here and there in the rifts of the flying stormclouds  i wandered on then wet and weary trusting to fortune but always blundering deeper and deeper into this horrible bog until i began to think that my first night in france was destined also to be my last and that the heir of the de lavals was destined to perish of cold and misery in the depths of this obscene morass  i must have toiled for many miles in this dreary fashion sometimes coming upon shallower mud and sometimes upon deeper but never making my way on to the dry when i perceived through the gloom something which turned my heart even heavier than it had been before  this was a curious clump of some whitish shrubcottongrass of a flowering varietywhich glimmered suddenly before me in the darkness  now an hour earlier i had passed just such a squareheaded whitish clump so that i was confirmed in the opinion which i had already begun to form that i was wandering in a circle  to make it certain i stooped down striking a momentary flash from my tinderbox and there sure enough was my own old track very clearly marked in the brown mud in front of me at this confirmation of my worst fears i threw my eyes up to heaven in my despair and there i saw something which for the first time gave me a clue in the uncertainty which surrounded me  it was nothing else than a glimpse of the moon between two flowing clouds  this in itself might have been of small avail to me but over its white face was marked a long thin v which shot swiftly across like a shaftless arrow  it was a flock of wild ducks and its flight was in the same direction as that towards which my face was turned  now i had observed in kent how all these creatures come further inland when there is rough weather breaking so i made no doubt that their course indicated the path which would lead me away from the sea  i struggled on therefore taking every precaution to walk in a straight line above all being very careful to make a stride of equal length with either leg until at last after half an hour or so my perseverance was rewarded by the welcome sight of a little yellow light as from a cottage window glimmering through the darkness  ah how it shone through my eyes and down into my heart glowing and twinkling there that little golden speck which meant food and rest and life itself to the wanderer i blundered towards it through the mud and the slush as fast as my weary legs would bear me  i was too cold and miserable to refuse any shelter and i had no doubt that for the sake of one of my gold pieces the fisherman or peasant who lived in this strange situation would shut his eyes to whatever might be suspicious in my presence or appearance  as i approached it became more and more wonderful to me that any one should live there at all for the bog grew worse rather than better and in the occasional gleams of moonshine i could make out that the water lay in glimmering pools all round the low dark cottage from which the light was breaking  i could see now that it shone through a small square window  as i approached the gleam was suddenly obscured and there in a yellow frame appeared the round black outline of a mans head peering out into the darkness  a second time it appeared before i reached the cottage and there was something in the stealthy manner in which it peeped and whisked away and peeped once more which filled me with surprise and with a certain vague apprehension  so cautious were the movements of this sentinel and so singular the position of his watchhouse that i determined in spite of my misery to see something more of him before i trusted myself to the shelter of his roof  and indeed the amount of shelter which i might hope for was not very great for as i drew softly nearer i could see that the light from within was beating through at several points and that the whole cottage was in the most crazy state of disrepair  for a moment i paused thinking that even the saltmarsh might perhaps be a safer restingplace for the night than the headquarters of some desperate smuggler for such i conjectured that this lonely dwelling must be the scud however had covered the moon once more and the darkness was so pitchy black that i felt that i might reconnoitre a little more closely without fear of discovery  walking on tiptoe i approached the little window and looked in  what i saw reassured me vastly  a small wood fire was crackling in one of those oldfashioned country grates and beside it was seated a strikingly handsome young man who was reading earnestly out of a fat little book  he had an oval olivetinted face with long black hair ungathered in a queue and there was something of the poet or of the artist in his whole appearance  the sight of that refined face and of the warm yellow firelight which beat upon it was a very cheering one to a cold and famished traveller  i stood for an instant gazing at him and noticing the way in which his full and somewhat loosefitting lower lip quivered continually as if he were repeating to himself that which he was reading  i was still looking at him when he put his book down upon the table and approached the window  catching a glimpse of my figure in the darkness he called out something which i could not hear and waved his hand in a gesture of welcome  an instant later the door flew open and there was his thin tall figure standing upon the threshold with his skirts flapping in the wind  my dear friends he cried peering out into the gloom with his hand over his eyes to screen them from the saltladen wind and driving sand i had given you up  i thought that you were never coming  ive been waiting for two hours  for answer i stepped out in front of him so that the light fell upon my face  i am afraid sir said i  but i had no time to finish my sentence  he struck at me with both hands like an angry cat and springing back into the room he slammed the door with a crash in my face  the swiftness of his movements and the malignity of his gesture were in such singular contrast with his appearance that i was struck speechless with surprise  but as i stood there with the door in front of me i was a witness to something which filled me with even greater astonishment  i have already said that the cottage was in the last stage of disrepair amidst the many seams and cracks through which the light was breaking there was one along the whole of the hinge side of the door which gave me from where i was standing a view of the further end of the room at which the fire was burning  as i gazed then i saw this man reappear in front of the fire fumbling furiously with both his hands in his bosom and then with a spring he disappeared up the chimney so that i could only see his shoes and half of his black calves as he stood upon the brickwork at the side of the grate  in an instant he was down again and back at the door  who are you he cried in a voice which seemed to me to be thrilling with some strong emotion  i am a traveller and have lost my way  there was a pause as if he were thinking what  course he should pursue  you will find little here to tempt you to stay said he at last  i am weary and spent sir and surely you will not refuse me shelter i have been wandering for hours in the saltmarsh  did you meet anyone there he asked eagerly  no  stand back a little from the door  this is a wild place and the times are troublous  a man must take some precautions  i took a few steps back and he then opened the door sufficiently to allow his head to come through  he said nothing but he looked at me for a long time in a very searching manner  what is your name  louis laval said i thinking that it might sound less dangerous in this plebeian form  whither are you going  i wish to reach some shelter  you are from england  i am from the coast  he shook his head slowly to show me how little my replies had satisfied him  you cannot come in here said he  but surely  no no it is impossible  show me then how to find my way out of the marsh  it is easy enough  if you go a few hundred paces in that direction you will perceive the lights of a village  you are already almost free of the marsh  he stepped a pace or two from the door in order to point the way for me and then turned upon his heel  i had already taken a stride or two away from him and his inhospitable hut when he suddenly called after me  come monsieur laval said he with quite a different ring in his voice i really cannot permit you to leave me upon so tempestuous a night  a warm by my fire and a glass of brandy will hearten you upon your way  you may think that i did not feel disposed to contradict him though i could make nothing of this sudden and welcome change in his manner  i am much obliged to you sir said i  and i followed him into the hut    chapter iii   the ruined cottage  it was delightful to see the glow and twinkle of the fire and to escape from the wet wind and the numbing cold but my curiosity had already risen so high about this lonely man and his singular dwelling that my thoughts ran rather upon that than upon my personal comfort  there was his remarkable appearance the fact that he should be awaiting company within that miserable ruin in the heart of the morass at so sinister an hour and finally the inexplicable incident of the chimney all of which excited my imagination  it was beyond my comprehension why he should at one moment charge me sternly to continue my journey and then in almost the same breath invite me most cordially to seek the shelter of his hut  on all these points i was keenly on the alert for an explanation yet i endeavoured to conceal my feelings and to assume the air of a man who finds everything quite natural about him and who is much too absorbed in his own personal wants to have a thought to spare upon anything outside himself  a glance at the inside of the cottage as i entered confirmed me in the conjecture which the appearance of the outside had already given rise to that it was not used for human residence and that this man was only here for a rendezvous  prolonged moisture had peeled the plaster in flakes from the walls and had covered the stones with blotches and rosettes of lichen  the whole place was rotten and scaling like a leper  the single large room was unfurnished save for a crazy table three wooden boxes which might be used as seats and a great pile of decayed fishingnet in the corner  the splinters of a fourth box with a handaxe which leaned against the wall showed how the wood for the fire had been gathered  but it was to the table that my gaze was chiefly drawn for there beside the lamp and the book lay an open basket from which projected the knuckleend of a ham the corner of a loaf of bread and the black neck of a bottle  if my host had been suspicious and cold at our first meeting he was now atoning for his inhospitality by an overdone cordiality even harder for me to explain  with many lamentations over my mudstained and sodden condition he drew a box close to the blaze and cut me off a corner of the bread and ham  i could not help observing however that though his loose underlipped mouth was wreathed with smiles his beautiful dark eyes were continually running over me and my attire asking and reasking what my business might be  as for myself said he with an air of false candour you will very well understand that in these days a worthy merchant must do the best he can to get his wares and if the emperor god save him sees fit in his wisdom to put an end to open trade one must come to such places as these to get into touch with those who bring across the coffee and the tobacco  i promise you that in the tuileries itself there is no difficulty about getting either one or the other and the emperor drinks his ten cups a day of the real mocha without asking questions though he must know that it is not grown within the confines of france  the vegetable kingdom still remains one of the few which napoleon has not yet conquered and if it were not for traders who are at some risk and inconvenience it is hard to say what we should do for our supplies i suppose sir that you are not yourself either in the seafaring or in the trading line  i contented myself by answering that i was not by which reticence i could see that i only excited his curiosity the more  as to his account of himself i read a lie in those telltale eyes all the time that he was talking  as i looked at him now in the full light of the lamp and the fire i could see that he was even more goodlooking than i had at first thought but with a type of beauty which has never been to my taste  his features were so refined as to be almost effeminate and so regular that they would have been perfect if it had not been for that illfitting slabbing mouth  it was a clever and yet it was a weak face full of a sort of fickle enthusiasm and feeble impulsiveness i felt that the more i knew him the less reason i should probably find either to like him or to fear him and in my first conclusion i was right although i had occasion to change my views upon the second  you will forgive me monsieur laval if i was a little cold at first said he  since the emperor has been upon the coast the place swarms with police agents so that a trader must look to his own interests you will allow that my fears of you were not unnatural since neither your dress nor your appearance were such as one would expect to meet with in such a place and at such a time  it was on my lips to return the remark but i refrained  i can assure you said i that i am merely a traveller who have lost my way  now that i am refreshed and rested i will not encroach further upon your hospitality except to ask you to point out the way to the nearest village  tut you had best stay where you are for the night grows wilder every instant  as he spoke there came a whoop and scream of wind in the chimney as if the old place were coming down about our ears  he walked across to the window and looked very earnestly out of it just as i had seen him do upon my first approach  the fact is monsieur laval said he looking round at me with his falseair of good fellowship you may be of some good service to me if you will wait here for half an hour or so  how so i asked wavering between my distrust and my curiosity  well to be frank with youand never did a man look less frank as he spokei am waiting here for some of those people with whom i do business  but in some way they have not come yet and i am inclined to take a walk round the marsh on the chance of finding them if they have lost their way  on the other hand it would be exceedingly awkward for me if they were to come here in my absence and imagine that i am gone i should take it as a favour then if you would remain here for half an hour or so that you may tell them how matters stand if i should chance to miss them  the request seemed reasonable enough and yet there was that same oblique glance which told me that it was false  still i could not see what harm could come to me by complying with his request and certainly i could not have devised any arrangement which would give me such an opportunity of satisfying my curiosity  what was in that wide stone chimney and why had he clambered up there upon the sight of me my adventure would be inconclusive indeed if i did not settle that point before i went on with my journey  well said he snatching up his black broadbrimmed hat and running very briskly to the door i am sure that you will not refuse me my request and i must delay no longer or i shall never get my business finished  he closed the door hurriedly behind him and i heard the splashing of his footsteps until they were lost in the howling of the gale  and so the mysterious cottage was mine to ransack if i could pluck its secrets from it  i lifted the book which had been left upon the table it was rousseaus social contractexcellent literature but hardly what one would expect a trader to carry with him whilst awaiting an appointment with smugglers  on the flyleaf was written lucien lesage and beneath it in a womans hand lucien from sibylle lesage then was the name of my goodlooking but sinister acquaintance it only remained for me now to discover what it was which he had concealed up the chimney  i listened intently and as there was no sound from without save the cry of the storm i stepped on to the edge of the grate as i had seen him do and sprang up by the side of the fire  it was a very broad oldfashioned cottage chimney so that standing on one side i was not inconvenienced either by the heat or by the smoke and the bright glare from below showed me in an instant that for which i sought  there was a recess at the back caused by the fall or removal of one of the stones and in this was lying a small bundle  there could not be the least doubt that it was this which the fellow had striven so frantically to conceal upon the first alarm of the approach of a stranger  i took it down and held it to the light  it was a small square of yellow glazed cloth tied round with white tape  upon my opening it a number of letters appeared and a single large paper folded up  the addresses upon the letters took my breath away  the first that i glanced at was to citizen talleyrand  the others were in the republican style addressed to citizen fouche to citizen soult to citizen macdonald to citizen berthier and so on through the whole list of famous names in war and in diplomacy who were the pillars of the new empire  what in the world could this pretended merchant of coffee have to write to all these great notables about  the other paper would explain no doubt  i laid the letters upon the shelf and i unfolded the paper which had been enclosed with them  it did not take more than the opening sentence to convince me that the saltmarsh outside might prove to be a very much safer place than this accursed cottage  these were the words which met my eyes  fellowcitizens of france  the deed of today has proved that even in the midst of his troops a tyrant is unable to escape the vengeance of an outraged people  the committee of three acting temporarily for the republic has awarded to buonaparte the same fate which has already befallen louis capet  in avenging the outrage of the 18th brumaire  so far i had got when my heart sprang suddenly into my mouth and the paper fluttered down from my fingers  a grip of iron had closed suddenly round each of my ankles and there in the light of the fire i saw two hands which even in that terrified glance i perceived to be covered with black hair and of an enormous size  so my friend cried a thundering voice this time at least we have been too many for you    chapter iv   men of the night  i had little time given me to realise the extraordinary and humiliating position in which i found myself for i was lifted up by my ankles as if i were a fowl pulled off a perch and jerked roughly down into the room my back striking upon the stone floor with a thud which shook the breath from my body  dont kill him yet toussac said a soft voice  let us make sure who he is first  i felt the pressure of a thumb upon my chin and of fingers upon my throat and my head was slowly forced round until the strain became unbearable  quarter of an inch does it and no mark said the thunderous voice you can trust my old turn  dont toussac dont said the same gentle voice which had spoken first  i saw you do it once before and the horrible snick that it made haunted me for a long time  to think that the sacred flame of life can be so readily snuffed out by that great material finger and thumb mind can indeed conquer matter but the fighting must not be at close quarters  my neck was so twisted that i could not see any of these people who were discussing my fate  i could only lie and listen  the fact remains my dear charles that the fellow has our allimportant secret and that it is our lives or his  i recognised in the voice which was now speaking that of the man of the cottage  we owe it to ourselves to put it out of his power to harm us  let him sit up toussac for there is no possibility of his escaping  some irresistible force at the back of my neck dragged me instantly into a sitting position and so for the first time i was able to look round me in a dazed fashion and to see these men into whose hands i had fallen  that they were murderers in the past and had murderous plans for the future i already gathered from what i had heard and seen i understood also that in the heart of that lonely marsh i was absolutely in their power  none the less i remembered the name that i bore and i concealed as far as i could the sickening terror which lay at my heart  there were three of them in the room my former acquaintance and two new comers  lesage stood by the table with his fat brown book in his hand looking at me with a composed face but with that humorous questioning twinkle in his eyes which a master chessplayer might assume when he had left his opponent without a move  on the top of the box beside him sat a very asceticfaced yellow holloweyed man of fifty with prim lips and a shrunken skin which hung loosely over the long jerking tendons under his prominent chin  he was dressed in snuffcoloured clothes and his legs under his kneebreeches were of a ludicrous thinness  he shook his head at me with an air of sad wisdom and i could read little comfort in his inhuman grey eyes  but it was the man called toussac who alarmed me most  he was a colossus bulky rather than tall but misshapen from his excess of muscle  his huge legs were crooked like those of a great ape and indeed there was something animal about his whole appearance something for he was bearded up to his eyes and it was a paw rather than a hand which still clutched me by the collar  as to his expression he was too thatched with hair to show one but his large black eyes looked with a sinister questioning from me to the others  if they were the judge and jury it was clear who was to be executioner  whence did he come  what is his business  how came he to know the hidingplace  asked the thin man  when he first came i mistook him for you in the darkness lesage answered  you will acknowledge that it was not a night on which one would expect to meet many people in the saltmarsh  on discovering my mistake i shut the door and concealed the papers in the chimney  i had forgotten that he might see me do this through that crack by the hinges but when i went out again to show him his way and so get rid of him my eye caught the gap and i at once realised that he had seen my action and that it must have aroused his curiosity to such an extent that it would be quite certain that he would think and speak of it  i called him back into the hut therefore in order that i might have time to consider what i had best do with him  sapristi a couple of cuts of that woodaxe and a bed in the softest corner of the marsh would have settled the business at once said the fellow by my side  quite true my good toussac but it is not usual to lead off with your ace of trumps  a little delicacya little finesse  let us hear what you did then  it was my first object to learn whether this man laval  what did you say his name was cried the thin man  his name according to his account is laval  my first object then was to find out whether he had in truth seen me conceal the papers or not it was an important question for us and as things have turned out more important still for him  i made my little plan therefore i waited until i saw you approach and i then left him alone in the hut i watched through the window and saw him fly to the hidingplace we then entered and i asked you toussac to be good enough to lift him downand there he lies  the young fellow looked proudly round for the applause of his comrades and the thin man clapped his hands softly together looking very hard at me while he did so  my dear lesage said he you have certainly excelled yourself when our new republic looks for its minister of police we shall know where to find him  i confess that when after guiding toussac to this shelter i followed you in and perceived a gentlemans legs projecting from the fireplace even my wits which are usually none of the slowest hardly grasped the situation  toussac however grasped the legs he is always practical the good toussac  enough words growled the hairy creature beside me  it is because we have talked instead of acting that this buonaparte has a crown upon his head or a head upon his shoulders  let us have done with the fellow and come to business  the refined features of lesage made me look towards him as to a possible protector but his large dark eyes were as cold and hard as jet as he looked back at me  what toussac says is right said he  we imperil our own safety if he goes with our secret  the devil take our own safety cried toussac  what has that to do with the matter  we imperil the success of our plansthat is of more importance  the two things go together replied lesage  there is no doubt that rule 13 of our confederation defines exactly what should be done in such a case  any responsibility must rest with the passers of rule 13  my heart had turned cold when this man with his poets face supported the savage at my side  but my hopes were raised again when the thin man who had said little hitherto though he had continued to stare at me very intently began now to show some signs of alarm at the bloodthirsty proposals of his comrades  my dear lucien said he in a soothing voice laying his hand upon the young mans arm we philosophers and reasoners must have a respect for human life  the tabernacle is not to be lightly violated  we have frequently agreed that if it were not for the excesses of marat  i have every respect for your opinion charles the other interrupted you will allow that i have always been a willing and obedient disciple but i again say that our personal safety is involved and that as far as i see there is no middle course  no one could be more averse from cruelty than i am but you were present with me some months ago when toussac silenced the man from bow street and certainly it was done with such dexterity that the process was probably more painful to the spectators than to the victim  he could not have been aware of the horrible sound which announced his own dissolution  if you and i had constancy enough to endure thisand if i remember right it was chiefly at your instigation that the deed was donethen surely on this more vital occasion  no no toussac stop cried the thin man his voice rising from its soft tones to a perfect scream as the giants hairy hand gripped me by the chin once more  i appeal to you lucien upon practical as well as upon moral grounds not to let this deed be done  consider that if things should go against us this will cut us off from all hopes of mercy  consider also  this argument seemed for a moment to stagger the younger man whose olive complexion had turned a shade greyer  there will be no hope for us in any case charles said he  we have no choice but to obey rule 13  some latitude is allowed to us  we are ourselves upon the inner committee  but it takes a quorum to change a rule and we have no powers to do it  his pendulous lip was quivering but there was no softening in his eyes  slowly under the pressure of those cruel fingers my chin began to sweep round to my shoulder and i commended my soul to the virgin and to saint ignatius who has always been the especial patron of my family but this man charles who had already befriended me darted forwards and began to tear at toussacs hands with a vehemence which was very different from his former philosophic calm  you shall not kill him he cried angrily  who are you to set your wills up against mine  let him go toussac take your thumb from his chin  i wont have it done i tell you then as he saw by the inflexible faces of his companions that blustering would not help him he turned suddenly to tones of entreaty see now ill make you a promise said he  listen to me lucien let me examine him  if he is a police spy he shall die  you may have him then toussac  but if he is only a harmless traveller who has blundered in here by an evil chance and who has been led by a foolish curiosity to inquire into our business then you will leave him to me  you will observe that from the beginning of this affair i had never once opened my mouth nor said a word in my defence which made me mightily pleased with myself afterwards though my silence came rather from pride than from courage  to lose life and selfrespect together was more than i could face  but now at this appeal from my advocate i turned my eyes from the monster who held me to the other who condemned me the brutality of the one alarmed me less than the selfinterested attitude of the other for a man is never so dangerous as when he is afraid and of all judges the judge who has cause to fear you is the most inflexible  my life depended upon the answer which was to come to the appeal of my champion  lesage tapped his fingers upon his teeth and smiled indulgently at the earnestness of his companion  rule 13  rule 13 he kept repeating in that exasperating voice of his  i will take all responsibility  ill tell you what mister said toussac in his savage voice theres another rule besides rule 13 and thats the one that says that if any man shelters an offender he shall be treated as if he was himself guilty of the offence  this attack did not shake the serenity of my champion in the least  you are an excellent man of action toussac said he calmly but when it comes to choosing the right course you must leave it to wiser heads than your own  his air of tranquil superiority seemed to daunt the fierce creature who held me  he shrugged his huge shoulders in silent dissent  as to you lucien my friend continued i am surprised considering the position to which you aspire in my family that you should for an instant stand in the way of any wish which i may express  if you have grasped the true principles of liberty and if you are privileged to be one of the small band who have never despaired of the republic to whom is it that you owe it  yes yes charles i acknowledge what you say the young man answered with much agitation  i am sure that i should be the last to oppose any wish which you might express but in this case i fear lest your tenderness of heart may be leading you astray  by all means ask him any questions that you like but it seems to me that there can be only one end to the matter  so i thought also for with the full secret of these desperate men in my possession what hope was there that they would ever suffer me to leave the hut alive  and yet so sweet is human life and so dear a respite be it ever so short a one that when that murderous hand was taken from my chin i heard a sudden chiming of little bells and the lamp blazed up into a strange fantastic blur  it was but for a moment and then my mind was clear again and i was looking up at the strange gaunt face of my examiner  whence have you come he asked  from england  but you are french  yes  when did you arrive  tonight  how  in a lugger from dover  the fellow is speaking the truth growled toussac  yes ill say that for him that he is speaking the truth  we saw the lugger and someone was landed from it just after the boat that brought me over pushed off  i remembered that boat which had been the first thing which i had seen upon the coast of france  how little i had thought what it would mean to me  and now my advocate began asking questionsvague useless questionsin a slow hesitating fashion which set toussac grumbling  this crossexamination appeared to me to be a useless farce and yet there was a certain eagerness and intensity in my questioners manner which gave me the assurance that he had some end in view  was it merely that he wished to gain time  time for what  and then suddenly with that quick perception which comes upon those whose nerves are strained by an extremity of danger i became convinced that he really was awaiting somethingthat he was tense with expectation  i read it upon his drawn face upon his sidelong head with his ear scooped into his hand above all in his twitching restless eyes  he expected an interruption and he was talking talking talking in order to gain time for it  i was as sure of it as if he had whispered his secret in my ear and down in my numb cold heart a warm little spring of hope began to bubble and run  but toussac had chafed at all this wordfencing and now with an oath he broke in upon our dialogue  i have had enough of this he cried  it is not for childs play of this sort that i risked my head in coming over here  have we nothing better to talk about than this fellow  do you suppose i came from london to listen to your fine phrases  have done with it i say and get to business  very good said my champion  theres an excellent little cupboard here which makes as fine a prison as one could wish for  let us put him in here and pass on to business  we can deal with him when we have finished  and have him overhear all that we say said lesage  i dont know what the devil has come over you cried toussac turning suspicious eyes upon my protector  i never knew you squeamish before and certainly you were not backward in the affair of the man from bow street  this fellow has our secret and he must either die or we shall see him at our trial  what is the sense of arranging a plot and then at the last moment turning a man loose who will ruin us all  let us snap his neck and have done with it  the great hairy hands were stretched towards me again but lesage had sprung suddenly to his feet  his face had turned very white and he stood listening with his forefinger up and his head slanted  it was a long thin delicate hand and it was quivering like a leaf in the wind  i heard something he whispered  and i said the older man  what was it  silence  listen  for a minute or more we all stayed with straining ears while the wind still whimpered in the chimney or rattled the crazy window  it was nothing said lesage at last with a nervous laugh the storm makes curious sounds sometimes  i heard nothing said toussac  hush cried the other  there it is again  a clear rising cry floated high above the wailing of the storm a wild musical cry beginning on a low note and thrilling swiftly up to a keen sharpedged howl  a hound  they are following us  lesage dashed to the fireplace and i saw him thrust his papers into the blaze and grind them down with his heel  toussac seized the woodaxe which leaned against the wall  the thin man dragged the pile of decayed netting from the corner and opened a small wooden screen which shut off a low recess  in here he whispered quick  and then as i scrambled into my refuge i heard him say to the others that i would be safe there and that they could lay their hands upon me when they wished    chapter v   the law  the cupboardfor it was little moreinto which i had been hurried was low and narrow and i felt in the darkness that it was heaped with peculiar round wickerwork baskets the nature of which i could by no means imagine although i discovered afterwards that they were lobster traps  the only light which entered was through the cracks of the old broken door but these were so wide and numerous that i could see the whole of the room which i had just quitted  sick and faint with the shadow of death still clouding my wits i was none the less fascinated by the scene which lay before me  my thin friend with the same prim composure upon his emaciated face had seated himself again upon the box  with his hands clasped round one of his knees he was rocking slowly backwards and forwards and i noticed in the lamplight that his jaw muscles were contracting rhythmically like the gills of a fish  beside him stood lesage his white face glistening with moisture and his loose lip quivering with fear  every now and then he would make a vigorous attempt to compose his features but after each rally a fresh wave of terror would sweep everything before it and set him shaking once more   as to toussac he stood before the fire a magnificent figure with the axe held down by his leg and his head thrown back in defiance so that his great black beard bristled straight out in front of him  he said not a word but every fibre of his body was braced for a struggle  then as the howl of the hound rose louder and clearer from the marsh outside he ran forward and threw open the door  no no keep the dog out cried lesage in an agony of apprehension  you fool our only chance is to kill it  but it is in leash  if it is in leash nothing can save us  but if as i think it is running free then we may escape yet  lesage cowered up against the table with his agonised eyes fixed upon the blueblack square of the door  the man who had befriended me still swayed his body about with a singular halfsmile upon his face  his skinny hand was twitching at the frill of his shirt and i conjectured that he held some weapon concealed there  toussac stood between them and the open door and much as i feared and loathed him i could not take my eyes from his gallant figure  as to myself i was so much occupied by the singular drama before me and by the impending fate of those three men of the cottage that all thought of my own fortunes had passed completely out of my mind  on this mean stage a terrible allabsorbing drama was being played and i crouching in a squalid recess was to be the sole spectator of it  i could but hold my breath and wait and watch  and suddenly i became conscious that they could all three see something which was invisible to me  i read it from their tense faces and their staring eyes  toussac swung his axe over his shoulder and poised himself for a blow  lesage cowered away and put one hand between his eyes and the open door  the other ceased swinging his spindle legs and sat like a little brown image upon the edge of his box  there was a moist pattering of feet a yellow streak shot through the doorway and toussac lashed at it as i have seen an english cricketer strike at a ball  his aim was true for he buried the head of the hatchet in the creatures throat but the force of his blow shattered his weapon and the weight of the hound carried him backwards on to the floor  over they rolled and over the hairy man and the hairy dog growling and worrying in a bestial combat  he was fumbling at the animals throat and i could not see what he was doing until it gave a sudden sharp yelp of pain and there was a rending sound like the tearing of canvas the man staggered up with his hands dripping and the tawny mass with the blotch of crimson lay motionless upon the floor  now cried toussac in a voice of thunder now and he rushed from the hut  lesage had shrunk away into the corner in a frenzy of fear whilst toussac had been killing the hound but now he raised his agonised face which was as wet as if he had dipped it into a basin  yes yes he cried we must fly charles  the hound has left the police behind and we may still escape  but the other with the same imperturbable face motionless save for the rhythm of his jaw muscles walked quietly over and closed the door upon the inside  i think friend lucien said he in his quiet voice that you had best stay where you are  lesage looked at him with amazement gradually replacing terror upon his pallid features  but you do not understand charles he cried  oh yes i think i do said the other smiling  they may be here in a few minutes  the hound has slipped its leash you see and has left them behind in the marsh but they are sure to come here for there is no other cottage but this  they are sure to come here  well then let us fly  in the darkness we may yet escape  no we shall stay where we are  madman you may sacrifice your own life but not mine  stay if you wish but for my part i am going  he ran towards the door with a foolish helpless flapping of his hands but the other sprang in front of him with so determined a gesture of authority that the younger man staggered back from it as from a blow  you fool said his companion  you poor miserable dupe  lesages mouth opened and he stood staring with his knees bent and his spreadfingered hands up the most hideous picture of fear that i have ever seen  you charles you he stammered hawking up each word  yes me said the other smiling grimly  a police agent all the time  you who were the very soul of our society you who were in our inmost council  you who led us on oh charles you have not the heart  i think i hear them coming charles  let me pass i beg and implore you to let me pass  the granite face shook slowly from side to side  but why me  why not toussac  if the dog had crippled toussac why then i might have had you both but friend toussac is rather vigorous for a thin little fellow like me no no my good lucien you are destined to be the trophy of my bow and my spear and you must reconcile yourself to the fact  lesage slapped his forehead as if to assure himself that he was not dreaming  a police agent he repeated charles a police agent  i thought it would surprise you  but you were the most republican of us all  we were none of us advanced enough for you  how often have we gathered round you charles to listen to your philosophy  and there is sibylle too  dont tell me that sibylle was a police spy also  but you are joking charles say that you are joking  the man relaxed his grim features and his eyes puckered with amusement  your astonishment is very flattering said he  i confess that i thought that i played my part rather cleverly  it is not my fault that these bunglers unleashed their hound but at least i shall have the credit of having made a singlehanded capture of one very desperate and dangerous conspirator  he smiled drily at this description of his prisoner  the emperor knows how to reward his friends he added and also how to punish his enemies  all this time he had held his hand in his bosom and now he drew it out so far as to show the brass gleam of a pistol butt  it is no use said he in answer to some look in the others eye you stay in the hut alive or dead  lesage put his hands to his face and began to cry with loud helpless sobbings  why you have been worse than any of us charles he moaned  it was you who told toussac to kill the man from bow street and it was you also who set fire to the house in the rue basse de la rampart  and now you turn on us  i did that because i wished to be the one to throw light upon it alland at the proper moment  that is very fine charles but what will be thought about that when i make it all public in my own defence  how can you explain all that to your emperor  there is still time to prevent my telling all that i know about you  well really i think that you are right my friend said the other drawing out his pistol and cocking it  perhaps i did go a little beyond my instructions in one or two points and as you very properly remark there is still time to set it right  it is a matter of detail whether i give you up living or give you up dead and i think that on the whole it had better be dead  it had been horrible to see toussac tear the throat out of the hound but it had not made my flesh creep as it crept now  pity was mingled with my disgust for this unfortunate young man who had been fitted by nature for the life of a retired student or of a dreaming poet but who had been dragged by stronger wills than his own into a part which no child could be more incapable of playing  i forgave him the trick by which he had caught me and the selfish fears to which he had been willing to sacrifice me  he had flung himself down upon the ground and floundered about in a convulsion of terror whilst his terrible little companion with his cynical smile stood over him with his pistol in his hand  he played with the helpless panting coward as a cat might with a mouse but i read in his inexorable eyes that it was no jest and his finger seemed to be already tightening upon his trigger  full of horror at so coldblooded a murder i pushed open my crazy cupboard and had rushed out to plead for the victim when there came a buzz of voices and a clanking of steel from without  with a stentorian shout of in the name of the emperor a single violent wrench tore the door of the hut from its hinges  it was still blowing hard and through the open doorway i could see a thick cluster of mounted men with plumes slanted and mantles flapping the rain shining upon their shoulders  at the side the light from the hut struck upon the heads of two beautiful horses and upon the heavy redtoupeed busbies of the hussars who stood at their heads  in the doorway stood another hussara man of high rank as could be seen from the richness of his dress and the distinction of his bearing  he was booted to the knees with a uniform of light blue and silver which his tall slim lightcavalry figure suited to a marvel  i could not but admire the way in which he carried himself for he never deigned to draw the sword which shone at his side but he stood in the doorway glancing round the bloodbespattered hut and staring at its occupants with a very cool and alert expression  he had a handsome face pale and clearcut with a bristling moustache which cut across the brass chinchain of his busby  well said he well  the older man had put his pistol back into the breast of his brown coat  this is lucien lesage said he  the hussar looked with disgust at the prostrate figure upon the floor  a pretty conspirator said he  get up you grovelling hound here gerard take charge of him and bring him into camp  a younger officer with two troopers at his heels came clanking in to the hut and the wretched creature half swooning was dragged out into the darkness  where is the otherthe man called toussac  he killed the hound and escaped  lesage would have got away also had i not prevented him  if you had kept the dog in leash we should have had them both but as it is colonel lasalle i think that you may congratulate me  he held out his hand as he spoke but the other turned abruptly on his heel  you hear that general savary said he looking out of the door toussac has escaped  a tall dark young man appeared within the circle of light cast by the lamp  the agitation of his handsome swarthy face showed the effect which the news had upon him  where is he then  it is a quarter of an hour since he got away  but he is the only dangerous man of them all  the emperor will be furious  in which direction did he fly  it must have been inland  but who is this asked general savary pointing at me  i understood from your information that there were only two besides yourself monsieur  i had rather no names were mentioned said the other abruptly  i can well understand that general savary answered with a sneer  i would have told you that the cottage was the rendezvous but it was not decided upon until the last moment  i gave you the means of tracking toussac but you let the hound slip  i certainly think that you will have to answer to the emperor for the way in which you have managed the business  that sir is our affair said general savary sternly  in the meantime you have not told us who this person is  it seemed useless for me to conceal my identity since i had a letter in my pocket which would reveal it  my name is louis de laval said i proudly  i may confess that i think we had exaggerated our own importance over in england  we had thought that all france was wondering whether we should return whereas in the quick march of events france had really almost forgotten our existence  this young general savary was not in the least impressed by my aristocratic name but he jotted it down in his notebook  monsieur de laval has nothing whatever to do with the matter said the spy  he has blundered into it entirely by chance and i will answer for his safe keeping in case he should be wanted  he will certainly be wanted said general savary  in the meantime i need every trooper that i have for the chase so if you make yourself personally responsible and bring him to the camp when needed i see no objection to his remaining in your keeping  i shall send to you if i require him  he will be at the emperors orders  are there any papers in the cottage  they have been burned  that is unfortunate  but i have duplicates  excellent  come lasalle every minute counts and there is nothing to be done here  let the men scatter and we may still ride him down  the two tall soldiers clanked out of the cottage without taking any further notice of my companion and i heard the sharp stern order and the jingling of metal as the troopers sprang back into their saddles once more  an instant later they were off and i listened to the dull beat of their hoofs dying rapidly into a confused murmur  my little snuffcoloured champion went to the door of the hut and peered after them through the darkness  then he came back and looked me up and down with his usual dry sardonic smile  well young man said he we have played some pretty tableaux vivants for your amusement and you can thank me for that nice seat in the front row of the parterre  i am under a very deep obligation to you sir i answered struggling between my gratitude and my aversion  i hardly know how to thank you  he looked at me with a singular expression in his ironical eyes  you will have the opportunity for thanking me later said he in the meantime as you say that you are a stranger upon our coast and as i am responsible for your safe keeping you cannot do better than follow me and i will take you to a place where you may sleep in safety    chapter vi   the secret passage  the fire had already smouldered down and my companion blew out the lamp so that we had not taken ten paces before we had lost sight of the illomened cottage in which i had received so singular a welcome upon my homecoming  the wind had softened down but a fine rain cold and clammy came drifting up from the sea  had i been left to myself i should have found myself as much at a loss as i had been when i first landed but my companion walked with a brisk and assured step so that it was evident that he guided himself by landmarks which were invisible to me  for my part wet and miserable with my forlorn bundle under my arm and my nerves all jangled by my terrible experiences i trudged in silence by his side turning over in my mind all that had occurred to me  young as i was i had heard much political discussion amongst my elders in england and the state of affairs in france was perfectly familiar to me  i was aware that the recent elevation of buonaparte to the throne had enraged the small but formidable section of jacobins and extreme republicans who saw that all their efforts to abolish a kingdom had only ended in transforming it into an empire  it was indeed a pitiable result of their frenzied strivings that a crown with eight fleursdelis should be changed into a higher crown surmounted by a cross and ball  on the other hand the followers of the bourbons in whose company i had spent my youth were equally disappointed at the manner in which the mass of the french people hailed this final step in the return from chaos to order  contradictory as were their motives the more violent spirits of both parties were united in their hatred to napoleon and in their fierce determination to get rid of him by any means  hence a series of conspiracies most of them with their base in england and hence also a large use of spies and informers upon the part of fouche and of savary upon whom the responsibility of the safety of the emperor lay  a strange chance had landed me upon the french coast at the very same time as a murderous conspirator and had afterwards enabled me to see the weapons with which the police contrived to thwart and outwit him and his associates  when i looked back upon my series of adventures my wanderings in the saltmarsh my entrance into the cottage my discovery of the papers my capture by the conspirators the long period of suspense with toussacs dreadful thumb upon my chin and finally the moving scenes which i had witnessedthe killing of the hound the capture of lesage and the arrival of the soldiersi could not wonder that my nerves were overwrought and that i surprised myself in little convulsive gestures like those of a frightened child  the chief thought which now filled my mind was what my relations were with this dangerous man who walked by my side  his conduct and bearing had filled me with abhorrence  i had seen the depth of cunning with which he had duped and betrayed his companions and i had read in his lean smiling face the cold deliberate cruelty of his nature as he stood pistol in hand over the whimpering coward whom he had outwitted yet i could not deny that when through my own foolish curiosity i had placed myself in a most hopeless position it was he who had braved the wrath of the formidable toussac in order to extricate me  it was evident also that he might have made his achievement more striking by delivering up two prisoners instead of one to the troopers  it is true that i was not a conspirator but i might have found it difficult to prove it  so inconsistent did such conduct seem in this little yellow flintstone of a man that after walking a mile or two in silence i asked him suddenly what the meaning of it might be  i heard a dry chuckle in the darkness as if he were amused by the abruptness and directness of my question  you are a most amusing person monsieurmonsieurlet me see what did you say your name was  de laval  ah quite so monsieur de laval  you have the impetuosity and the ingenuousness of youth  you want to know what is up a chimney you jump up the chimney  you want to know the reason of a thing and you blurt out a question  i have been in the habit of living among people who keep their thoughts to themselves and i find you very refreshing  whatever the motives of your conduct there is no doubt that you saved my life said i  i am much obliged to you for your intercession it is the most difficult thing in the world to express gratitude to a person who fills you with abhorrence and i fear that my halting speech was another instance of that ingenuousness of which he accused me  i can do without your thanks said he coldly  you are perfectly right when you think that if it had suited my purpose i should have let you perish and i am perfectly right when i think that if it were not that you are under an obligation you would fail to see my hand if i stretched it out to you just as that overgrown puppy lasalle did  it is very honourable he thinks to serve the emperor upon the field of battle and to risk life in his behalf but when it comes to living amidst danger as i have done consorting with desperate men and knowing well that the least slip would mean death why then one is beneath the notice of a fine cleanhanded gentleman  why he continued in a burst of bitter passion i have dared more and endured more with toussac and a few of his kidney for comrades than this lasalle has done in all the childish cavalry charges that ever he undertook  as to service all his marshals put together have not rendered the emperor as pressing a service as i have done  but i daresay it does not strike you in that light monsieurmonsieur  de laval  quite soit is curious how that name escapes me  i daresay you take the same view as colonel lasalle  it is not a question upon which i can offer an opinion said i i only know that i owe my life to your intercession  i do not know what reply he might have made to this evasion but at that moment we heard a couple of pistol shots and a distant shouting from far away in the darkness  we stopped for a few minutes but all was silent once more  they must have caught sight of toussac said my companion  i am afraid that he is too strong and too cunning to be taken by them  i do not know what impression he left upon you but i can tell you that you will go far to meet a more dangerous man  i answered that i would go far to avoid meeting one unless i had the means of defending myself and my companions dry chuckle showed that he appreciated my feelings  yet he is an absolutely honest man which is no very common thing in these days said he  he is one of those who at the outbreak of the revolution embraced it with the whole strength of his simple nature he believed what the writers and the speakers told him and he was convinced that after a little disturbance and a few necessary executions france was to become a heaven upon earth the centre of peace and comfort and brotherly love  a good many people got those fine ideas into their heads but the heads have mostly dropped into the sawdustbasket by this time  toussac was true to them and when instead of peace he found war instead of comfort a grinding poverty and instead of equality an empire it drove him mad  he became the fierce creature you see with the one idea of devoting his huge body and giants strength to the destruction of those who had interfered with his ideal  he is fearless persevering and implacable  i have no doubt at all that he will kill me for the part that i have played tonight  it was in the calmest voice that my companion uttered the remark and it made me understand that it was no boast when he said there was more courage needed to carry on his unsavoury trade than to play the part of a beau sabreur like lasalle  he paused a little and then went on as if speaking to himself  yes said he i missed my chance  i certainly  ought to have shot him when he was struggling with the hound  but if i had only wounded him he would have torn me into bits like an overboiled pullet so perhaps it is as well as it is  we had left the saltmarsh behind us and for some time i had felt the soft springy turf of the downland beneath my feet and our path had risen and dipped over the curves of the low coast hills  in spite of the darkness my companion walked with great assurance never hesitating for an instant and keeping up a stiff pace which was welcome to me in my sodden and benumbed condition  i had been so young when i left my native place that it is doubtful whether even in daylight i should have recognised the countryside but now in the darkness half stupefied by my adventures i could not form the least idea as to where we were or what we were making for  a certain recklessness had taken possession of me and i cared little where i went as long as i could gain the rest and shelter of which i stood in need  i do not know how long we had walked i only know that i had dozed and woke and dozed again whilst still automatically keeping pace with my comrade when i was at last aroused by his coming to a dead stop the rain had ceased and although the moon was still obscured the heavens had cleared somewhat and i could see for a little distance in every direction  a huge white basin gaped in front of us and i made out that it was a deserted chalk quarry with brambles and ferns growing thickly all round the edges  my companion after a stealthy glance round to make sure that no one was observing us picked his way amongst the scattered clumps of bushes until he reached the wall of chalk  this he skirted for some distance squeezing between the cliff and the brambles until he came at last to a spot where all further progress appeared to be impossible  can you see a light behind us asked my companion  i turned round and looked carefully in every direction but was unable to see one  never mind said he  you go first and i will follow  in some way during the instant that my back had been turned he had swung aside or plucked out the tangle of bush which had barred our way  when i turned there was a square dark opening in the white glimmering wall in front of us  it is small at the entrance but it grows larger further in said he  i hesitated for an instant  whither was it that this strange man was leading me  did he live in a cave like a wild beast or was this some trap into which he was luring me  the moon shone out at the instant and in its silver light this black silent porthole looked inexpressibly cheerless and menacing  you have gone rather far to turn back my good friend said my companion  you must either trust me altogether or not trust me at all  i am at your disposal  pass in then and i shall follow  i crept into the narrow passage which was so low that i had to crawl down it upon my hands and knees  craning my neck round i could see the black angular silhouette of my companion as he came after me  he paused at the entrance and then with a rustling of branches and snapping of twigs the faint light was suddenly shut off from outside and we were left in pitchy darkness  i heard the scraping of his knees as he crawled up behind me  go on until you come to a step down said he  we shall have more room there and we can strike a light  the ceiling was so low that by arching my back i could easily strike it and my elbows touched the wall upon either side  in those days i was slim and lithe however so that i found no difficulty in making my way onwards until at the end of a hundred paces or it may have been a hundred and fifty i felt with my hands that there was a dip in front of me  down this i clambered and was instantly conscious from the purer air that i was in some larger cavity  i heard the snapping of my companions flint and the red glow of the tinder paper leaped suddenly into the clear yellow flame of the taper  at first i could only see that stern emaciated face like some grotesque carving in walnut wood with the ceaseless fishlike vibration of the muscles of his jaw  the light beat full upon it and it stood strangely out with a dim halo round it in the darkness  then he raised the taper and swept it slowly round at arms length so as to illuminate the place in which we stood  i found that we were in a subterranean tunnel which appeared to extend into the bowels of the earth  it was so high that i could stand erect with ease and the old lichenblotched stones which lined the walls told of its great age  at the spot where we stood the ceiling had fallen in and the original passage been blocked but a cutting had been made from this point through the chalk to form the narrow burrow along which we had come  this cutting appeared to be quite recent for a mound of debris and some trenching tools were still lying in the passage my companion taper in hand started off down the tunnel and i followed at his heels stepping over the great stones which had fallen from the roof or the walls and now obstructed the path  well said he grinning at me over his shoulder have you ever seen anything like this in england  never i answered  these are the precautions and devices which men adopted in rough days long ago  now that rough days have come again they are very useful to those who know of such places  whither does it lead then i asked  to this said he stopping before an old wooden door powerfully clamped with iron  he fumbled with the metalwork keeping himself between me and it so that i could not see what he was doing  there was a sharp snick and the door revolved slowly upon its hinges  within there was a steep flight of timeworn steps leading upwards  he motioned me on and closed the door behind us  at the head of the stair there was a second wooden gate which he opened in a similar manner  i had been dazed before ever i came into the chalk pit but now at this succession of incidents i began to rub my eyes and ask myself whether this was young louis de laval late of ashford in kent or whether it was some dream of the adventures of a hero of pigault lebrun  these massive mossgrown arches and mighty ironclamped doors were indeed like the dim shadowy background of a vision but the guttering taper my sodden bundle and all the sordid details of my disarranged toilet assured me only too clearly of their reality  above all the swift brisk businesslike manner of my companion and his occasional abrupt remarks brought my fancies back to the ground once more  he held the door open for me now and closed it again when i had passed through  we found ourselves in a long vaulted corridor with a stoneflagged floor and a dim oil lamp burning at the further end  two ironbarred windows showed that we had come above the earths surface once more down this corridor we passed and then through several passages and up a short winding stair  at the head of it was an open door which led into a small but comfortable bedroom  i presume that this will satisfy your wants for tonight said he  i asked for nothing better than to throw myself down damp clothes and all upon that snowy coverlet but for the instant my curiosity overcame my fatigue  i am much indebted to you sir said i  perhaps you will add to your favours by letting me know where i am  you are in my house and that must suffice you for tonight  in the morning we shall go further into the matter he rang a small bell and a gaunt shockheaded country manservant came running at the call  your mistress has retired i suppose  yes sir a good two hours ago  very good  i shall call you myself in the morning  he closed my door and the echo of his steps seemed hardly to have died from my ears before i had sunk into that deep and dreamless sleep which only youth and fatigue can give    chapter vii   the owner of grosbois  my host was as good as his word for when a noise in my room awoke me in the morning it was to find him standing by the side of my bed so composed in his features and so drab in his attire that it was hard to associate him with the stirring scenes of yesterday and with the repulsive part which he had played in them  now in the fresh morning sunlight he presented rather the appearance of a pedantic schoolmaster an impression which was increased by the masterful and yet benevolent smile with which he regarded me  in spite of his smile i was more conscious than ever that my whole soul shrank from him and that i should not be at my ease until i had broken this companionship which had been so involuntarily formed  he carried a heap of clothes over one arm which he threw upon a chair at the bottom of my bed  i gather from the little that you told me last night said he that your wardrobe is at present somewhat scanty  i fear that your inches are greater than those of anyone in my household but i have brought a few things here amongst which you may find something to fit you here too are the razors the soap and the powderbox  i will return in half an hour when your toilet will doubtless be completed  i found that my own clothes with a little brushing were as good as ever but i availed myself of his offer to the extent of a ruffled shirt and a black satin cravat  i had finished dressing and was looking out of the window of my room which opened on to a blank wall when my host returned  he looked me all over with a keenly scrutinising eye and appeared to be satisfied with what he saw  that will do  that will do very well indeed said he nodding a critical head  in these times a slight indication of travel or hard work upon a costume is more fashionable than the foppishness of the incroyable  i have heard ladies remark that it was in better taste now sir if you will kindly follow me  his solicitude about my dress filled me with surprise but this was soon forgotten in the shock which was awaiting me  for as we passed down the passage and into a large hall which seemed strangely familiar to me there was a fulllength portrait of my father standing right in front of me  i stood staring with a gasp of astonishment and turned to see the cold grey eyes of my companion fixed upon me with a humorous glitter  you seem surprised monsieur de laval said he  for gods sake said i do not trifle with me any further  who are you and what is this place  to which you have taken me  for answer he broke into one of his dry chuckles and laying his skinny brown hand upon my wrist he led me into a large apartment  in the centre was a table tastefully laid and beyond it in a low chair a young lady was seated with a book in her hand  she rose as we entered and i saw that she was tall and slender with a dark face pronounced features and black eyes of extraordinary brilliancy  even in that one glance it struck me that the expression with which she regarded me was by no means a friendly one  sibylle said my host and his words took the breath from my lips this is your cousin from england louis de laval  this my dear nephew is my only daughter sibylle bernac  then you  i am your mothers brother charles bernac  you are my uncle bernac i stammered at him like an idiot  but why did you not tell me so i cried  i was not sorry to have a chance of quietly observing what his english education had done for my nephew  it might also have been harder for me to stand your friend if my comrades had any reason to think that i was personally interested in you  but you will permit me now to welcome you heartily to france and to express my regret if your reception has been a rough one  i am sure that sibylle will help me to atone for it he smiled archly at his daughter who continued to regard me with a stony face  i looked round me and gradually the spacious room with the weapons upon the wall and the deers heads came dimly back to my memory that view through the oriel window too with the clump of oaks in the sloping park and the sea in the distance beyond i had certainly seen it before  it was true then and i was in our own castle of grosbois and this dreadful man in the snuffcoloured coat this sinister plotter with the deathshead face was the man whom i had heard my poor father curse so often the man who had ousted him from his own property and installed himself in his place  and yet i could not forget that it was he also who at some risk to himself had saved me the night before and my soul was again torn between my gratitude and my repulsion  we had seated ourselves at the table and as we ate this newlyfound uncle of mine continued to explain all those points which i had failed to understand  i suspected that it was you the instant that i set eyes upon you said he  i am old enough to remember your father when he was a young gallant and you are his very doublethough i may say without flattery that where there is a difference it is in your favour and yet he had the name of being one of the handsomest men betwixt rouen and the sea  you must bear in mind that i was expecting you and that there are not so many young aristocrats of your age wandering about along the coast  i was surprised when you did not recognise where you were last night  had you never heard of the secret passage of grosbois  it came vaguely back to me that in my childhood i had heard of this underground tunnel but that the roof had fallen in and rendered it useless  precisely said my uncle  when the castle passed into my hands one of the very first things which i did was to cut a new opening at the end of it for i foresaw that in these troublesome times it might be of use to me indeed had it been in repair it might have made the escape of your mother and father a very much easier affair  his words recalled all that i had heard and all that i could remember of those dreadful days when we the lords of the country side had been chased across it as if we had been wolves with the howling mob still clustering at the pierhead to shake their fists and hurl their stones at us  i remembered too that it was this very man who was speaking to me who had thrown oil upon the flames in those days and whose fortunes had been founded upon our ruin  as i looked across at him i found that his keen grey eyes were fixed upon me and i could see that he had read the thoughts in my mind  we must let bygones be bygones said he  those are quarrels of the last generation and sibylle and you represent a new one  my cousin had not said one word or taken any notice of my presence but at this joining of our names she glanced at me with the same hostile expression which i had already remarked  come sibylle said her father you can assure your cousin louis that so far as you are concerned any family misunderstanding is at an end  it is very well for us to talk in that way father she answered it is not your picture that hangs in the hall or your coatofarms that i see upon the wall  we hold the castle and the land but it is for the heir of the de lavals to tell us if he is satisfied with this  her dark scornful eyes were fixed upon me as she waited for my reply but her father hastened to intervene  this is not a very hospitable tone in which to greet your cousin said he harshly  it has so chanced that louis heritage has fallen to us but it is not for us to remind him of the fact  he needs no reminding said she  you do me an injustice i cried for the evident and malignant scorn of this girl galled me to the quick  it is true that i cannot forget that this castle and these grounds belonged to my ancestorsi should be a clod indeed if i could forget itbut if you think that i harbour any bitterness you are mistaken  for my own part i ask nothing better than to open up a career for myself with my own sword  and never was there a time when it could be more easily and more brilliantly done cried my uncle  there are great things about to happen in the world and if you are at the emperors court you will be in the middle of them  i understand that you are content to serve him  i wish to serve my country  by serving the emperor you do so for without him the country becomes chaos  from all we hear it is not a very easy service said my cousin i should have thought that you would have been very much more comfortable in englandand then you would have been so much safer also  everything which the girl said seemed to be meant as an insult to me and yet i could not imagine how i had ever offended her  never had i met a woman for whom i conceived so hearty and rapid a dislike  i could see that her remarks were as offensive to her father as they were to me for he looked at her with eyes which were as angry as her own  your cousin is a brave man and that is more than can be said for someone else that i could mention said he  for whom she asked  never mind he snapped and jumping up with the air of a man who is afraid that his rage may master him and that he may say more than he wished he ran from the room  she seemed startled by this retort of his and rose as if she would follow him  then she tossed her head and laughed incredulously  i suppose that you have never met your uncle before said she after a few minutes of embarrassed silence  never answered i  well what do you think of him now you have met him  such a question from a daughter about her father filled me with a certain vague horror  i felt that he must be even a worse man than i had taken him for if he had so completely forfeited the loyalty of his own nearest and dearest  your silence is a sufficient answer said she as i hesitated for a reply  i do not know how you came to meet him last night or what passed between you for we do not share each others confidences i think however that you have read him aright  now i have something to ask you  you had a letter from him inviting you to leave england and to come here had you not  yes i had  did you observe nothing on the outside  i thought of those two sinister words which had puzzled me so much  what it was you who warned me not to come  yes it was i  i had no other means of doing it  but why did you do it  because i did not wish you to come here  did you think that i would harm you  she sat silent for a few seconds like one who is afraid of saying too much  when her answer came it was a very unexpected one  i was afraid that you would be harmed  you think that i am in danger here  i am sure of it  you advise me to leave  without losing an instant  from whom is the danger then  again she hesitated and then with a reckless motion like one who throws prudence to the winds she turned upon me  it is from my father said she  but why should he harm me  that is for your sagacity to discover  but i assure you mademoiselle that in this matter you misjudge him said i  as it happens he interfered to save my life last night  to save your life  from whom  from two conspirators whose plans i had chanced to discover  conspirators  she looked at me in surprise  they would have killed me if he had not intervened  it is not his interest that you should be harmed yet awhile  he had reasons for wishing you to come to castle grosbois  but i have been very frank with you and i wish you to be equally so with me  does it happendoes it happen that during your youth in england you have everyou have ever had an affair of the heart  everything which this cousin of mine said appeared to me to be stranger than the last and this question coming at the end of so serious a conversation was the strangest of all  but frankness begets frankness and i did not hesitate  i have left the very best and truest girl in the world behind me in england said i  eugenie is her name eugenie de choiseul the niece of the old duke  my reply seemed to give my cousin great satisfaction  her large dark eyes shone with  pleasure  you are very attached she asked  i shall never be happy until i see her  and you would not give her up  god forbid  not for the castle of grosbois  not even for that  my cousin held out her hand to me with a charmingly frank impulsiveness  you will forgive me for my rudeness said she  i see that we are to be allies and not enemies  and our hands were still clasped when her father reentered the room    chapter viii   cousin sibylle  i could see in my uncles grim face as he looked at us the keenest satisfaction contending with surprise at this sign of our sudden reconciliation  all trace of his recent anger seemed to have left him as he addressed his daughter but in spite of his altered tone i noticed that her eyes looked defiance and distrust  i have some papers of importance to look over said he  for an hour or so i shall be engaged  i can guess that louis would like to see the old place once again and i am sure that he could not have a better guide than you sibylle if you will take him over it  she raised no objection and for my part i was overjoyed at the proposal as it gave me an opportunity of learning more of this singular cousin of mine who had told me so much and yet seemed to know so much more  what was the meaning of this obscure warning which she had given me against her father and why was she so frankly anxious to know about my love affairs  these were the two questions which pressed for an answer  so out we went together into the sweet coastland air the sweeter for the gale of the night before and we walked through the old yewlined paths and out into the park and so round the castle looking up at the gables the grey pinnacles the oakmullioned windows the ancient wing with its crenulated walls and its meurtriere windows the modern with its pleasant verandah and veil of honeysuckle  and as she showed me each fresh little detail with a particularity which made me understand how dear the place had become to her she would still keep offering her apologies for the fact that she should be the hostess and i the visitor  it is not against you but against ourselves that i was bitter said she for are we not the cuckoos who have taken a strange nest and driven out those who built it  it makes me blush to think that my father should invite you to your own house  perhaps we had been rooted here too long i answered  perhaps it is for our own good that we are driven out to carve our own fortunes as i intend to do  you say that you are going to the emperor  yes  you know that he is in camp near here  so i have heard  but your family is still proscribed  i have done him no harm  i will go boldly to him and ask him to admit me into his service  well said she there are some who call him a usurper and wish him all evil but for my own part i have never heard of anything that he has said and done which was not great and noble  but i had expected that you would be quite an englishman cousin louis and come over here with your pockets full of pitts guineas and your heart of treason  i have met nothing but hospitality from the english i answered but my heart has always been french  but your father fought against us at quiberon  let each generation settle its own quarrels said i  i am quite of your fathers opinion about that  do not judge my father by his words but by his deeds said she with a warning finger upraised and above all cousin louis unless you wish to have my life upon your conscience never let him suspect that i have said a word to set you on your guard  your life i gasped  oh yes he would not stick at that she cried  he killed my mother i do not say that he slaughtered her but i mean that his cold brutality broke her gentle heart  now perhaps you begin to understand why i can talk of him in this fashion  as she spoke i could see the secret broodings of years the bitter resentments crushed down in her silent soul rising suddenly to flush her dark cheeks and to gleam in her splendid eyes  i realised at that moment that in that tall slim figure there dwelt an unconquerable spirit  you must think that i speak very freely to you since i have only known you a few hours cousin louis said she  to whom should you speak freely if not to your own relative  it is true and yet i never expected that i should be on such terms with you  i looked forward to your coming with dread and sorrow no doubt i showed something of my feelings when my father brought you in  indeed you did i answered  i feared that my presence was unwelcome to you  most unwelcome both for your own sake and for mine said she for your sake because i suspected as i have told you that my fathers intentions might be unfriendly  for mine  why for yours i asked in surprise for she had stopped in embarrassment  you have told me that your heart is anothers  i may tell you that my hand is also promised and that my love has gone with it  may all happiness attend it said i  but why should this make my coming unwelcome  that thick english air has dimmed your wits cousin said she shaking her stately head at me  but i can speak freely now that i know that this plan would be as hateful to you as to me  you must know then that if my father could have married us he would have united all claims to the succession of grosbois  then come what mightbourbon or buonapartenothing could shake his position  i thought of the solicitude which he had shown over my toilet in the morning his anxiety that i should make a favourable impression his displeasure when she had been cold to me and the smile upon his face when he had seen us hand in hand  i believe you are right i cried  right  of course i am right  look at him watching us now  we were walking on the edge of the dried moat and as i looked up there sure enough was the little yellow face toned towards us in the angle of one of the windows  seeing that i was watching him he rose and waved his hand merrily  now you know why he saved your lifesince you say that he saved it said she  it would suit his plans best that you should marry his daughter and so he wished you to live  but when once he understands that that is impossible why then my poor cousin louis his only way of guarding against the return of the de lavals must lie in ensuring that there are none to return  it was those words of hers coupled with that furtive yellow face still lurking at the window which made me realise the imminence of my danger no one in france had any reason to take an interest in me  if i were to pass away there was no one who could make inquiryi was absolutely in his power  my memory told me what a ruthless and dangerous man it was with whom i had to deal  but said i he must have known that your affections were already engaged  he did she answered it was that which made me most uneasy of all i was afraid for you and afraid for myself but most of all i was afraid for lucien  no man can stand in the way of his plans  lucien  the name was like a lightning flash upon a dark night  i had heard of the vagaries of a womans love but was it possible that this spirited woman loved that poor creature whom i had seen grovelling last night in a frenzy of fear  but now i remembered also where i had seen the name sibylle  it was upon the flyleaf of his book  lucien from sibylle was the inscription  i recalled also that my uncle had said something to him about his aspirations  lucien is hotheaded and easily carried away said she  my father has seen a great deal of him lately  they sit for hours in his room and lucien will say nothing of what passes between them  i fear that there is something going forward which may lead to evil  lucien is a student rather than a man of the world but he has strong opinions about politics  i was at my wits ends what to do whether to be silent or to tell her of the terrible position in which her lover was placed but even as i hesitated she with the quick intuition of a woman read the doubts which were in my mind  you know something of him she cried  i understood that he had gone to paris  for gods sake tell me what you know about him  his name is lesage  yes yes  lucien lesage  i havei have seen him i stammered  you have seen him  and you only arrived in france last night where did you see him what has happened to him  she gripped me by the wrist in her anxiety  it was cruel to tell her and yet it seemed more cruel still to keep silent  i looked round in my bewilderment and there was my uncle himself coming along over the closecropped green lawn  by his side with a merry clashing of steel and jingling of spurs there walked a handsome young hussarthe same to whom the charge of the prisoner had been committed upon the night before  sibylle never hesitated for an instant but with a set face and blazing eyes she swept towards them  father said she what have you done with lucien  i saw his impassive face wince for a moment before the passionate hatred and contempt which he read in her eyes  we will discuss this at some future time said he  i will know here and now she cried  what have you done with lucien  gentlemen said he turning to the young hussar and me i am sorry that we should intrude our little domestic differences upon your attention  you will i am sure make allowances lieutenant when i tell you that your prisoner of last night was a very dear friend of my daughters  such family considerations do not prevent me from doing my duty to the emperor but they make that duty more painful than it would otherwise be  you have my sympathy mademoiselle said the young hussar  it was to him that my cousin had now turned  do i understand that you took him prisoner she asked  it was unfortunately my duty  from you i will get the truth  whither did you take him  to the emperors camp  and why  ah mademoiselle it is not for me to go into politics  my duties are but to wield a sword and sit a horse and obey my orders  both these gentlemen will be my witnesses that i received my instructions from colonel lasalle  but on what charge was he arrested  tut tut child we have had enough of this said my uncle harshly if you insist upon knowing i will tell you once and for all that monsieur lucien lesage has been seized for being concerned in a plot against the life of the emperor and that it was my privilege to denounce the wouldbe assassin  to denounce him cried the girl  i know that it was you who set him on who encouraged him who held him to it whenever he tried to draw back  oh you villain you villain  what have i over done what sin of my ancestors am i expiating that i should be compelled to call such a man father  my uncle shrugged his shoulders as if to say that it was useless to argue with a womans tantrums  the hussar and i made as if we would stroll away for it was embarrassing to stand listening to such words but in her fury she called to us to stop and be witnesses against him never have i seen such a recklessness of passion as blazed in her dry wideopened eyes  you have deceived others but you have never deceived me she cried i know you as your own conscience knows you  you may murder me as you murdered my mother before me but you can never frighten me into being your accomplice  you proclaimed yourself a republican that you might creep into a house and estate which do not belong to you  and now you try to make a friend of buonaparte by betraying your old associates who still trust in you  and you have sent lucien to his death  but i know your plans and my cousin louis knows them also and i can assure you that there is just as much chance of his agreeing to them as there is of my doing so  id rather lie in my grave than be the wife of any man but lucien  if you had seen the pitiful poltroon that he proved himself you would not say so said my uncle coolly  you are not yourself at present but when you return to your right mind you will be ashamed of having made this public exposure of your weakness  and now lieutenant you have something to say  my message was to you monsieur de laval said the young hussar turning his back contemptuously upon my uncle  the emperor has sent me to bring you to him at once at the camp at boulogne  my heart leapt at the thought of escaping from my uncle  i ask nothing better i cried  a horse and an escort are waiting at the gates  i am ready to start at this instant  nay there can be no such very great hurry said my uncle  surely you will wait for luncheon lieutenant gerard  the emperors commissions sir are not carried out in such a manner said the young hussar sternly  i have already wasted too much time we must be upon our way in five minutes  my uncle placed his hand upon my arm and led me slowly towards the gateway through which my cousin sibylle had already passed  there is one matter that i wish to speak to you about before you go since my time is so short you will forgive me if i introduce it without preamble  you have seen your cousin sibylle and though her behaviour this morning is such as to prejudice you against her yet i can assure you that she is a very amiable girl  she spoke just now as if she had mentioned the plan which i had conceived to you  i confess to you that i cannot imagine anything more convenient than that we should unite in order to settle once for all every question as to which branch of the family shall hold the estates  unfortunately said i there are objections  and pray what are they  the fact that my cousins hand as i have just learned is promised to another  that need not hinder us said he with a sour smile i will undertake that he never claims the promise  i fear that i have the english idea of marriage that it should go by love and not by convenience  but in any case your scheme is out of the question for my own affections are pledged to a young lady in england  he looked wickedly at me out of the corners of his grey eyes  think well what you are doing louis said he in a sibilant whisper which was as menacing as a serpents hiss  you are deranging my plans and that is not done with impunity  it is not a matter in which i have any choice  he gripped me by the sleeve and waved his hand round as satan may have done when he showed the kingdoms and principalities  look at the park he cried the fields the woods  look at the old castle in which your fathers have lived for eight hundred years  you have but to say the word and it is all yours once more  there flashed up into my memory the little redbrick house at ashford and eugenies sweet pale face looking over the laurel bushes which grew by the window  it is impossible said i  there must have been something in my manner which made him comprehend that it really was so for his face darkened with anger and his persuasion changed in an instant to menace  if i had known this they might have done what they wished with you last night said he i would never have put out a finger to save you  i am glad to hear you say so i answered for it makes it easier for me to say that i wish to go my own way and to have nothing more to do with you  what you have just said frees me from the bond of gratitude which held me back  i have no doubt that you would like to have nothing more to do with me he cried  you will wish it more heartily still before you finish very well sir go your own way and i will go mine and we shall see who comes out the best in the end  a group of hussars were standing by their horses heads in the gateway in a few minutes i had packed my scanty possessions and i was hastening with them down the corridor when a chill struck suddenly through my heart at the thought of my cousin sibylle  how could i leave her alone with this grim companion in the old castle  had she not herself told me that her very life might be at stake  i had stopped in my perplexity and suddenly there was a patter of feet and there she was running towards me  goodbye cousin louis she cried with outstretched hands  i was thinking of you said i your father and i have had an explanation and a quarrel  thank god she cried  your only chance was to get away from him but beware for he will do you an injury if he can  he may do his worst but how can i leave you here in his power  have no fears about me  he has more reason to avoid me than i him but they are calling for you cousin louis  goodbye and god be with you    chapter ix   the camp of boulogne  my uncle was still standing at the castle gateway the very picture of a usurper with our own old coatofarms of the bend argent and the three blue martlets engraved upon the stones at either side of him  he gave me no sign of greeting as i mounted the large grey horse which was awaiting me but he looked thoughtfully at me from under his downdrawn brows and his jaw muscles still throbbed with that stealthy rhythmical movement  i read a cold and settled malice in his set yellow face and his stern eyes  for my own part i sprang readily enough into the saddle for the mans presence had from the first been loathsome to me and i was right glad to be able to turn my back upon him  and so with a stern quick order from the lieutenant and a jingle and clatter from the troopers we were off upon our journey  as i glanced back at the black keep of grosbois and at the sinister figure who stood looking after us from beside the gateway i saw from over his head a white handkerchief gleam for an instant in a last greeting from one of the gloomy meurtriere windows and again a chill ran through me as i thought of the fearless girl and of the hands in which we were leaving her  but sorrow clears from the mind of youth like the tarnish of breath upon glass and who could carry a heavy heart upon so lightfooted a horse and through so sweet an air  the white glimmering road wound over the downs with the sea far upon the left and between lay that great saltmarsh which had been the scene of our adventures  i could even see as i fancied a dull black spot in the distance to mark the position of that terrible cottage  far away the little clusters of houses showed the positions of etaples ambleterre and the other fishing villages whilst i could see that the point which had seemed last night to glow like a halfforged redhot swordblade was now white as a snowfield with the camp of a great army  far far away a little dim cloud upon the water stood for the land where i had spent my daysthe pleasant homely land which will always rank next to my own in my affections  and now i turned my attention from the downs and the sea to the hussars who rode beside me forming as i could perceive a guard rather than an escort  save for the patrol last night they were the first of the famous soldiers of napoleon whom i had ever seen and it was with admiration and curiosity that i looked upon men who had won a worldwide reputation for their discipline and their gallantry  their appearance was by no means gorgeous and their dress and equipment was much more modest than that of the east kent yeomanry which rode every saturday through ashford but the stained tunics the worn leathers and the rough hardy horses gave them a very workmanlike appearance  they were small light brownfaced fellows heavily whiskered and moustached many of them wearing earrings in their ears  it surprised me that even the youngest and most boyishlooking of them should be so bristling with hair until upon a second look i perceived that his whiskers were formed of lumps of black wax stuck on to the sides of his face   the tall young lieutenant noticed the astonishment with which i gazed at his boyish trooper  yes yes said he they are artificial sure enough but what can you expect from a lad of seventeen  on the other hand we cannot spoil the appearance of the regiment upon parade by having a girls cheeks in the ranks  it melts terribly in this warm weather lieutenant said the hussar joining in the conversation with the freedom which was one of the characteristics of napoleons troops  well well caspar in a year or two you will dispense with them  who knows  perhaps he will have dispensed with his head also by that time said a corporal in front and they all laughed together in a manner which in england would have meant a courtmartial  this seemed to me to be one of the survivals of the revolution that officer and private were left upon a very familiar footing which was increased no doubt by the freedom with which the emperor would chat with his old soldiers and the liberties which he would allow them to take with him it was no uncommon thing for a shower of chaff to come from the ranks directed at their own commanding officers and i am sorry to say also that it was no very unusual thing for a shower of bullets to come also unpopular officers were continually assassinated by their own men at the battle of montebello it is well known that every officer with the exception of one lieutenant belonging to the 24th demibrigade was shot down from behind  but this was a relic of the bad times and as the emperor gained more complete control a better feeling was established the history of our army at that time proved at any rate that the highest efficiency could be maintained without the flogging which was still used in the prussian and the english service and it was shown for the first time that great bodies of men could be induced to act from a sense of duty and a love of country without hope of reward or fear of punishment  when a french general could suffer his division to straggle as they would over the face of the country with the certainty that they would concentrate upon the day of battle he proved that he had soldiers who were worthy of his trust  one thing had struck me as curious about these hussarsthat they pronounced french with the utmost difficulty  i remarked it to the lieutenant as he rode by my side and i asked him from what foreign country his men were recruited since i could perceive that they were not frenchmen  my faith you must not let them hear you say so said he for they would answer you as like as not by a thrust from their sabres  we are the premier regiment of the french cavalry the first hussars of bercheny and though it is true that our men are all recruited in alsace and few of them can speak anything but german they are as good frenchmen as kleber or kellermann who came from the same parts our men are all picked and our officers he added pulling at his light moustache are the finest in the service  the swaggering vanity of the fellow amused me for he cocked his busby swung the blue dolman which hung from his shoulder sat his horse and clattered his scabbard in a manner which told of his boyish delight and pride in himself and his regiment  as i looked at his lithe figure and his fearless bearing i could quite imagine that he did himself no more than justice while his frank smile and his merry blue eyes assured me that he would prove a good comrade  he had himself been taking observations of me for he suddenly placed his hand upon my knee as we rode side by side  i trust that the emperor is not displeased with you said he with a very grave face  i cannot think that he can be so i answered for i have come from england to put my services at his disposal  when the report was presented last night and he heard of your presence in that den of thieves he was very anxious that you should be brought to him  perhaps it is that he wishes you to be guide to us in england no doubt you know your way all over the island  the hussars idea of an island seemed to be limited to the little patches which lie off the norman or breton coast  i tried to explain to him that this was a great country not much smaller than france  well well said he we shall know all about it presently for we are going to conquer it  they say in the camp that we shall probably enter london either next wednesday evening or else on the thursday morning we are to have a week for plundering the town and then one army corps is to take possession of scotland and another of ireland  his serene confidence made me smile  but how do you know you can do all this i asked  oh said he the emperor has arranged it  but they have an army and they are well prepared  they are brave men and they will fight  there would be no use their doing that for the emperor is going over himself said he and in the simple answer i understood for the first time the absolute trust and confidence which these soldiers had in their leader  their feeling for him was fanaticism and its strength was religion and never did mahomet nerve the arms of his believers and strengthen them against pain and death more absolutely than this little greycoated idol did to those who worshipped him  if he had chosenand he was more than once upon the point of itto assert that he was indeed above humanity he would have found millions to grant his claim you who have heard of him as a stout gentleman in a straw hat as he was in his later days may find it hard to understand it but if you had seen his mangled soldiers still with their dying breath crying out to him and turning their livid faces towards him as he passed you would have realised the hold which he had over the minds of men  you have been over there asked the lieutenant presently jerking his thumb towards the distant cloud upon the water  yes i have spent my life there  but why did you stay there when there was such good fighting to be had in the french service  my father was driven out of the country as an aristocrat  it was only after his death that i could offer my sword to the emperor  you have missed a great deal but i have no doubt that we shall still have plenty of fine wars  and you think that the english will offer us battle  i have no doubt of it  we feared that when they understood that it was the emperor in person who had come they would throw down their arms  i have heard that there are some fine women over there  the women are beautiful  he said nothing but for some time he squared his shoulders and puffed out his chest curling up the ends of his little yellow moustache  but they will escape in boats he muttered at last and i could see that he had still that picture of a little island in his imagination if they could but see us they might remain  it has been said of the hussars of bercheny that they can set a whole population running the women towards us the men away  we are as you have no doubt observed a very fine body of men and the officers are the pick of the service though the seniors are hardly up to the same standard as the rest of us  with all his selfconfidence this officer did not seem to me to be more than my own age so i asked him whether he had seen any service  his moustache bristled with indignation at my question and he looked me up and down with a severe eye  i have had the good fortune to be present at nine battles sir and at more than forty skirmishes said he  i have also fought a considerable number of duels and i can assure you that i am always ready to meet anyoneeven a civilianwho may wish to put me to the proof  i assured him that he was very fortunate to be so young and yet to have seen so much upon which his illtemper vanished as quickly as it came and he explained that he had served in the hohenlinden campaign under moreau as well as in napoleons passage of the alps and the campaign of marengo  when you have been with the army for a little time the name of etienne gerard will not be so unfamiliar to you said he  i believe that i may claim to be the hero of one or two little stories which the soldiers love to tell about their camp fires  you will hear of my duel with the six fencing masters and you will be told how singlehanded i charged the austrian hussars of graz and brought their silver kettledrum back upon the crupper of my mare  i can assure you that it was not by accident that i was present last night but it was because colonel lasalle was very anxious to be sure of any prisoners whom he might make as it turned out however i only had the one poor chickenhearted creature whom i handed over to the provostmarshal  and the othertoussac  ah he seems to have been a man of another breed  i could have asked nothing better than to have had him at my swordpoint  but he has escaped  they caught sight of him and fired a pistol or two but he knew the bog too well and they could not follow him  and what will be done to your prisoner i asked  lieutenant gerard shrugged his shoulders  i am very sorry for mademoiselle your cousin said he but a fine girl should not love such a man when there are so many gallant soldiers upon the country side  i hear that the emperor is weary of these endless plottings and that an example will be made of him  whilst the young hussar and i had been talking we had been cantering down the broad white road until we were now quite close to the camp which we could see lying in its arrangement of regiments and brigades beneath us  our approach lay over the high ground so that we could see down into this canvas city with its interminable lines of picketed horses its parks of artillery and its swarms of soldiers  in the centre was a clear space with one very large tent and a cluster of low wooden houses in the middle of it with the tricolour banner waving above them  that is the emperors quarters and the smaller tent there is the headquarters of general ney who commands this corps  you understand that this is only one of several armies dotted along from dunkirk in the north to this which is the most southerly  the emperor goes from one to the other inspecting each in its turn but this is the main body and contains most of the picked troops so that it is we who see most of him especially now that the empress and the court have come to pont de briques  he is in there at the present moment he added in a hushed voice pointing to the great white tent in the centre  the road into the camp ran through a considerable plain which was covered by bodies of cavalry and infantry engaged upon their drill we had heard so much in england about napoleons troops and their feats had appeared so extraordinary that my imagination had prepared me for men of very striking appearance  as a matter of fact the ordinary infantry of the line in their blue coats and white breeches and gaiters were quite little fellows and even their high brasscovered hats and red plumes could not make them very imposing  in spite of their size however they were tough and wiry and after their eighteen months in camp they were trained to the highest pitch of perfection  the ranks were full of veterans and all the underofficers had seen much service while the generals in command have never been equalled in ability so that it was no mean foe which lay with its menacing eyes fixed upon the distant cliffs of england  if pitt had not been able to place the first navy in the world between the two shores the history of europe might be very different today  lieutenant gerard seeing the interest with which i gazed at the manoeuvring troops was good enough to satisfy my curiosity about such of them as approached the road along which we were journeying  those fellows on the black horses with the great blue rugs upon their croups are the cuirassiers said he  they are so heavy that they cannot raise more than a trot so when they charge we manage that there shall be a brigade of chasseurs or hussars behind them to follow up the advantage  who is the civilian who is inspecting them i asked  that is not a civilian but it is general st cyr who is one of those whom they called the spartans of the rhine  they were of opinion that simplicity of life and of dress were part of a good soldier and so they would wear no uniform beyond a simple blue riding coat such as you see st cyr is an excellent officer but he is not popular for he seldom speaks to anyone and he sometimes shuts himself up for days on end in his tent where he plays upon his violin  i think myself that a soldier is none the worse because he enjoys a glass of good wine or has a smart jacket and a few brandenburgs across his chest  for my part i do both and yet those who know me would tell you that it has not harmed my soldiering  you see this infantry upon the left  the men with the yellow facings  precisely  those are oudinots famous grenadiers  and the other grenadiers with the red shoulderknots and the fur hats strapped above their knapsacks are the imperial guard the successors of the old consular guard who won marengo for us  eighteen hundred of them got the cross of honour after the battle  there is the 57th of the line which has been named the terrible and there is the 7th light infantry who come from the pyrenees and who are well known to be the best marchers and the greatest rascals in the army  the light cavalry in green are the horse chasseurs of the guard sometimes called the guides who are said to be the emperors favourite troops although he makes a great mistake if he prefers them to the hussars of bercheny  the other cavalry with the green pelisses are also chasseurs but i cannot tell from here what regiment they are  their colonel handles them admirably they are moving to a flank in open column of halfsquadrons and then wheeling into line to charge  we could not do it better ourselves  and now monsieur de laval here we are at the gates of the camp of boulogne and it is my duty to take you straight to the emperors quarters    chapter x   the anteroom  the camp of boulogne contained at that time one hundred and fifty thousand infantry with fifty thousand cavalry so that its population was second only to paris among the cities of france  it was divided into four sections the right camp the left camp the camp of wimereux and the camp of ambleteuse the whole being about a mile in depth and extending along the seashore for a length of about seven miles  on the land side it was open but on the sea side it was fringed by powerful batteries containing mortars and cannon of a size never seen before these batteries were placed along the edges of the high cliffs and their lofty position increased their range and enabled them to drop their missiles upon the decks of the english ships  it was a pretty sight to ride through the camp for the men had been there for more than a year and had done all that was possible to decorate and ornament their tents  most of them had little gardens in front or around them and the sunburned fellows might be seen as we passed kneeling in their shirtsleeves with their spuds and their wateringcans in the midst of their flowerbeds  others sat in the sunshine at the openings of the tents tying up their queues pipeclaying their belts and polishing their arms hardly bestowing a glance upon us as we passed for patrols of cavalry were coming and going in every direction  the endless lines were formed into streets with their names printed up upon boards  thus we had passed through the rue darcola the rue de kleber the rue degypte and the rue dartillerie volante before we found ourselves in the great central square in which the headquarters of the army were situated  the emperor at this time used to sleep at a village called pont de briques some four miles inland but his days were spent at the camp and his continual councils of war were held there  here also were his ministers and the generals of the army corps which were scattered up and down the coast came thither to make their reports and to receive their orders  for these consultations a plain wooden house had been constructed containing one very large room and three small ones  the pavilion which we had observed from the downs served as an antechamber to the house in which those who sought audience with the emperor might assemble  it was at the door of this where a strong guard of grenadiers announced napoleons presence that my guardian sprang down from his horse and signed to me to follow his example  an officer of the guard took our names and returned to us accompanied by general duroc a thin hard dry man of forty with a formal manner and a suspicious eye  is this monsieur louis de laval he asked with a stiff smile  i bowed  the emperor is very anxious to see you  you are no longer needed lieutenant  i am personally responsible for bringing him safely general  very good  you may come in if you prefer it  and he passed us into the huge tent which was unfurnished save for a row of wooden benches round the sides  a number of men in naval and military uniforms were seated upon these and numerous groups were standing about chatting in subdued tones  at the far end was a door which led into the imperial council chamber  now and then i saw some man in official dress walk up to this door scratch gently upon it with his nail and then as it instantly opened slip discreetly through closing it softly behind him over the whole assembly there hung an air of the court rather than of the camp an atmosphere of awe and of reverence which was the more impressive when it affected these bluff soldiers and sailors the emperor had seemed to me to be formidable in the distance but i found him even more overwhelming now that he was close at hand  you need have no fears monsieur de laval said my companion you are going to have a good reception  how do you know that  from general durocs manner  in these cursed courts if the emperor smiles upon you everyone smiles down to that flunkey in the red velvet coat yonder  but if the emperor frowns why you have only to look at the face of the man who washes the imperial plates and you will see the frown reflected upon it  and the worst of it is that if you are a plainwitted man you may never find out what earned you either the frown or the smile  that is why i had rather wear the shoulderstraps of a lieutenant and be at the side of my squadron with a good horse between my knees and my sabre clanking against my stirrupiron than have monsieur talleyrands grand hotel in the rue saint florentin and his hundred thousand livres of income  i was still wondering whether the hussar could be right and if the smile with which duroc had greeted me could mean that the emperors intentions towards me were friendly when a very tall and handsome young man in a brilliant uniform came towards me  in spite of the change in his dress i recognised him at once as the general savary who had commanded the expedition of the night before  well monsieur de laval said he shaking hands with me very pleasantly you have heard no doubt that this fellow toussac has escaped us  he was really the only one whom we were anxious to seize for the other is evidently a mere dupe and dreamer  but we shall have him yet and between ourselves we shall keep a very strict guard upon the emperors person until we do for master toussac is not a man to be despised  i seemed to feel his great rough thumb upon my chin as i answered that i thought he was a very dangerous man indeed  the emperor will see you presently said savary  he is very busy this morning but he bade me say that you should have an audience he smiled and passed on  assuredly you are getting on whispered gerard  there are a good many men here who would risk something to have savary address them as he addressed you  the emperor is certainly going to do something for you but attention friend for here is monsieur de talleyrand himself coming towards us  a singularlooking person was shuffling in our direction  he was a man about fifty years of age largely made about the shoulders and chest but stooping a good deal and limping heavily in one leg  he walked slowly leaning upon a silverheaded stick and his sober suit of black with silk stockings of the same hue looked strangely staid among the brilliant uniforms which surrounded him  but in spite of his plain dress there was an expression of great authority upon his shrewd face and every one drew back with bows and salutes as he moved across the tent  monsieur louis de laval said he as he stopped in front of me and his cold grey eyes played over me from head to heel  i bowed and with some coldness for i shared the dislike which my father used to profess for this unfrocked priest and perjured politician but his manner was so polished and engaging that it was hard to hold out against it  i knew your cousin de rohan very well indeed said he  we were two rascals together when the world was not quite so serious as it is at present  i believe that you are related to the cardinal de montmorency de laval who is also an old friend of mine  i understand that you are about to offer your services to the emperor  i have come from england for that purpose sir  and met with some little adventure immediately upon your arrival as i understand  i have heard the story of the worthy police agent the two jacobins and the lonely hut  well you have seen the danger to which the emperor is exposed and it may make you the more zealous in his service  where is your uncle monsieur bernac  he is at the castle of grosbois  do you know him well  i had not seen him until yesterday  he is a very useful servant of the emperor butbut he inclined his head downward to my ear some more congenial service will be found for you monsieur de laval and so with a bow he whisked round and tapped his way across the tent again  why my friend you are certainly destined for something great said the hussar lieutenant  monsieur de talleyrand does not waste his smiles and his bows i promise you  he knows which way the wind blows before he flies his kite and i foresee that i shall be asking for your interest to get me my captaincy in this english campaign  ah the council of war is at an end  as he spoke the inner door at the end of the great tent opened and a small knot of men came through dressed in the dark blue coats with trimmings of gold oakleaves which marked the marshals of the empire they were all but one men who had hardly reached their middle age and who in any other army might have been considered fortunate if they had gained the command of a regiment but the continuous wars and the open system by which rules of seniority yielded to merit had opened up a rapid career to a successful soldier  each carried his curved cocked hat under his arm and now leaning upon their swordhilts they fell into a little circle and chatted eagerly among themselves  you are a man of family are you not asked my hussar  i am of the same blood as the de rohans and the montmorencies  so i had understood  well then you will understand that there have been some changes in this country when i tell you that those men who under the emperor are the greatest in the country have been the one a waiter the next a wine smuggler the next a cooper of barrels and the next a house painter  those are the trades which gave us murat massena ney and lannes  aristocrat as i was no names had ever thrilled me as those did and i eagerly asked him to point me out each of these famous soldiers  oh there are many famous soldiers in the room said he  besides he added twisting his moustache there may be junior officers here who have it in them to rise higher than any of them  but there is ney to the right  i saw a man with closecropped red hair and a large squarejowled face such as i have seen upon an english prizefighter  we call him peter the red and sometimes the red lion in the army said my companion  he is said to be the bravest man in the army though i cannot admit that he is braver than some other people whom i could mention  still he is undoubtedly a very good leader  and the general next him i asked  why does he carry his head all upon one side  that is general lannes and he carries his head upon his left shoulder because he was shot through the neck at the siege of st jean dacre he is a gascon like myself and i fear that he gives some ground to those who accuse my countrymen of being a little talkative and quarrelsome  but monsieur smiles  you are mistaken  i thought that perhaps something which i had said might have amused monsieur  i thought that possibly he meant that gascons really were quarrelsome instead of being as i contend the mildest race in francean opinion which i am always ready to uphold in any way which may be suggested  but as i say lannes is a very valiant man though occasionally perhaps a trifle hotheaded  the next man is auguereau  i looked with interest upon the hero of castiglione who had taken command upon the one occasion when napoleons heart and spirit had failed him  he was a man i should judge who would shine rather in war than in peace for with his long goats face and his brandy nose he looked in spite of his golden oakleaves just such a longlegged vulgar swaggering foulmouthed old soldier as every barrackroom can show  he was an older man than the others and his sudden promotion had come too late for him to change  he was always the corporal of the prussian guard under the hat of the french marshal  yes yes he is a rough fellow said gerard in answer to my remark he is one of those whom the emperor had to warn that he wished them to be soldiers only with the army  he and rapp and lefebvre with their big boots and their clanking sabres were too much for the empresss drawingroom at the tuileries  there is vandamme also the dark man with the heavy face  heaven help the english village that he finds his quarters in  it was he who got into trouble because he broke the jaw of a westphalian priest who could not find him a second bottle of tokay  and that is murat i suppose  yes that is murat with the black whiskers and the red thick lips and the brown of egypt upon his face  he is the man for me  my word when you have seen him raving in front of a brigade of light cavalry with his plumes tossing and his sabre flashing you would not wish to see anything finer  i have known a square of grenadiers break and scatter at the very sight of him  in egypt the emperor kept away from him for the arabs would not look at the little general when this fine horseman and swordsman was before them  in my opinion lasalle is the better light cavalry officer but there is no one whom the men will follow as they do murat  and who is the sternlooking man leaning on the oriental sword  oh that is soult  he is the most obstinate man in the world  he argues with the emperor  the handsome man beside him is junot and bernadotte is leaning against the tentpole  i looked with interest at the extraordinary face of this adventurer who after starting with a musket and a knapsack in the ranks was not contented with the baton of a marshal but passed on afterwards to grasp the sceptre of a king  and it might be said of him that unlike his fellows he gained his throne in spite of napoleon rather than by his aid  any man who looked at his singular pronounced features the swarthiness of which proclaimed his half spanish origin must have read in his flashing black eyes and in that huge aggressive nose that he was reserved for a strange destiny  of all the fierce and masterful men who surrounded the emperor there was none with greater gifts and none also whose ambitions he more distrusted than those of jules bernadotte  and yet fierce and masterful as these men were having as auguereau boasted fear neither of god nor of the devil there was something which thrilled or cowed them in the pale smile or black frown of the little man who ruled them  for as i watched them there suddenly came over the assembly a start and hush such as you see in a boys school when the master enters unexpectedly and there near the open doors of his headquarters stood the master himself  even without that sudden silence and the scramble to their feet of those upon the benches i felt that i should have known instantly that he was present  there was a pale luminosity about his ivory face which drew the eye towards it and though his dress might be the plainest of a hundred his appearance would be the first which one would notice  there he was with his little plump heavyshouldered figure his green coat with the red collar and cuffs his white wellformed legs his sword with the gilt hilt and the tortoiseshell scabbard  his head was uncovered showing his thin hair of a ruddy chestnut colour  under one arm was the flat cocked hat with the twopenny tricolour rosette which was already reproduced in his pictures  in his right hand he held a little riding switch with a metal head  he walked slowly forward his face immutable his eyes fixed steadily before him measured inexorable the very personification of destiny  admiral bruix  i do not know if that voice thrilled through every one as it did through me  never had i heard anything more harsh more menacing more sinister  from under his puckered brows his lightblue eyes glanced swiftly round with a sweep like a sabre  i am here sire  a dark grizzled middleaged man in a naval uniform had advanced from the throng  napoleon took three quick little steps towards him in so menacing a fashion that i saw the weatherstained cheeks of the sailor turn a shade paler and he gave a helpless glance round him as if for assistance  how comes it admiral bruix cried the emperor in the same terrible rasping voice that you did not obey my commands last night  i could see that a westerly gale was coming up sire  i knew that he could hardly speak for his agitation i knew that if the ships went out with this lee shore  what right have you to judge sir cried the emperor in a cold fury of indignation  do you conceive that your judgment is to be placed against mine  in matters of navigation sire  in no matters whatsoever  but the tempest sire  did it not prove me to be in the right  what  you still dare to bandy words with me  when i have justice on my side  there was a hush amidst all the great audience  such a heavy silence as comes only when many are waiting and all with bated breath the emperors face was terrible  his cheeks were of a greenish livid tint and there was a singular rotary movement of the muscles of his forehead  it was the countenance of an epileptic  he raised the whip to his shoulder and took a step towards the admiral  you insolent rascal he hissed  it was the italian word coglione which he used and i observed that as his feelings overcame him his french became more and more that of a foreigner  for a moment he seemed to be about to slash the sailor across the face with his whip  the latter took a step back and clapped his hand to his sword  have a care sire said he  for a few instants the tension was terrible  then napoleon brought the whip down with a sharp crack against his own thigh  viceadmiral magon he cried you will in future receive all orders connected with the fleet  admiral bruix you will leave boulogne in twentyfour hours and withdraw to holland   where is lieutenant gerard of the hussars of bercheny  my companions gauntlet sprang to his busby  i ordered you to bring monsieur louis de laval from the castle of grosbois  he is here sire  good you may retire  the lieutenant saluted whisked round upon his heel and clattered away whilst the emperors blue eyes were turned upon me  i had often heard the phrase of eyes looking through you but that piercing gaze did really give one the feeling that it penetrated to ones inmost thoughts but the sternness had all melted out of it and i read a great gentleness and kindness in their expression  you have come to serve me monsieur de laval  yes sire  you have been some time in making up your mind  i was not my own master sire  your father was an aristocrat  yes sire  and a supporter of the bourbons  yes sire  you will find that in france now there are no aristocrats and no jacobins but that we are all frenchmen working for the glory of our country  have you seen louis de bourbon  i have seen him once sire  an insignificantlooking man is he not  no sire i thought him a finelooking man  for a moment i saw a hard gleam of resentment in those changing blue eyes  then he put out his hand and pinched one of my ears  monsieur de laval was not born to be a courtier said he well well louis de bourbon will find that he cannot gain a throne by writing proclamations in london and signing them louis  for my part i found the crown of france lying upon the ground and i lifted it upon my swordpoint  you have lifted france with your sword also sire said talleyrand who stood at his elbow  napoleon looked at his famous minister and i seemed to read suspicion in his eyes  then he turned to his secretary  i leave monsieur de laval in your hands de meneval said he i desire to see him in the council chamber after the inspection of the artillery    chapter xi   the secretary  emperor generals and officials all streamed away to the review leaving me with a gentlelooking largeeyed man in a black suit with very white cambric ruffles who introduced himself to me as monsieur de meneval private secretary to his majesty  we must get some food monsieur de laval said he  it is always well if you have anything to do with the emperor to get your food whenever you have the chance  it may be many hours before he takes a meal and if you are in his presence you have to fast also  i assure you that i have nearly fainted from hunger and from thirst  but how does the emperor manage himself i asked  this monsieur de meneval had such a kindly human appearance that i already felt much at my ease with him  oh he he is a man of iron monsieur de laval  we must not set our watches by his  i have known him work for eighteen hours on end and take nothing but a cup or two of coffee  he wears everybody out around him  even the soldiers cannot keep up with him  i assure you that i look upon it as the very highest honour to have charge of his papers but there are times when it is very trying all the same  sometimes it is eleven oclock at night monsieur de laval and i am writing to his dictation with my head aching for want of sleep  it is dreadful work for he dictates as quickly as he can talk and he never repeats anything  now meneval says he suddenly we shall stop here and have a good nights rest  and then just as i am congratulating myself he adds and we shall continue with the dictation at three tomorrow morning  that is what he means by a good nights rest  but has he no hours for his meals monsieur de meneval i asked as i accompanied the unhappy secretary out of the tent  oh yes he has hours but he will not observe them  you see that it is already long after dinner time but he has gone to this review after the review something else will probably take up his attention and then something else until suddenly in the evening it will occur to him that he has had no dinner  my dinner constant this instant he will cry and poor constant has to see that it is there  but it must be unfit to eat by that time said i  the secretary laughed in the discreet way of a man who has always been obliged to control his emotions  this is the imperial kitchen said he indicating a large tent just outside the headquarters  here is borel the second cook at the door how many pullets today borel  ah monsieur de meneval it is heartrending cried the cook  behold them and drawing back the flap of the entrance he showed us seven dishes each of them containing a cold fowl  the eighth is now on the fire and done to a turn but i hear that his majesty has started for the review so we must put on a ninth  that is how it is managed said my companion as we turned from the tent  i have known twentythree fowls got ready for him before he asked for his meal  that day he called for his dinner at eleven at night  he cares little what he eats or drinks but he will not be kept waiting  half a bottle of chambertin a red mullet or a pullet a la marengo satisfy every need but it is unwise to put pastry or cream upon the table because he is as likely as not to eat it before the fowl ah that is a curious sight is it not  i had halted with an exclamation of astonishment  a groom was cantering a very beautiful arab horse down one of the lanes between the tents as it passed a grenadier who was standing with a small pig under his arm hurled it down under the feet of the horse  the pig squealed vigorously and scuttled away but the horse cantered on without changing its step  what does that mean i asked  that is jardin the head groom breaking in a charger for the emperors use  they are first trained by having a cannon fired in their ears then they are struck suddenly by heavy objects and finally they have the test of the pig being thrown under their feet  the emperor has not a very firm seat and he very often loses himself in a reverie when be is riding so it might not be very safe if the horse were not well trained  do you see that young man asleep at the door of a tent  yes i see him  you would not think that he is at the present moment serving the emperor  it seems a very easy service  i wish all our services were as easy monsieur de laval  that is joseph linden whose foot is the exact size of the emperors  he wears his new boots and shoes for three days before they are given to his master  you can see by the gold buckles that he has a pair on at the present moment  ah monsieur de caulaincourt will you not join us at dinner in my tent  a tall handsome man very elegantly dressed came across and greeted us  it is rare to find you at rest monsieur de meneval  i have no very light task myself as head of the household but i think i have more leisure than you  have we time for dinner before the emperor returns  yes yes here is the tent and everything ready  we can see when the emperor returns and be in the room before he can reach it  this  is camp fare monsieur de laval but no doubt you will excuse it  for my own part i had an excellent appetite for the cutlets and the salad but what i relished above all was to hear the talk of my companions for i was full of curiosity as to everything which concerned this singular man whose genius had elevated him so rapidly to the highest position in the world  the head of his household discussed him with an extraordinary frankness  what do they say of him in england monsieur de laval he asked  nothing very good  so i have gathered from their papers  they drive the emperor frantic and yet he will insist upon reading them  i am willing to lay a wager that the very first thing which he does when he enters london will be to send cavalry detachments to the various newspaper offices and to endeavour to seize the editors  and the next  the next said he laughing will be to issue a long proclamation to prove that we have conquered england entirely for the good of the english and very much against our own inclinations  and then perhaps the emperor will allow the english to understand that if they absolutely demand a protestant for a ruler it is possible that there are a few little points in which he differs from holy church  too bad  too bad cried de meneval looking amused and yet rather frightened at his companions audacity  no doubt for state reasons the emperor had to tamper a little with mahomedanism and i daresay he would attend this church of st pauls as readily as he did the mosque at cairo but it would not do for a ruler to be a bigot  after all the emperor has to think for all  he thinks too much said caulaincourt gravely  he thinks so much that other people in france are getting out of the way of thinking at all  you know what i mean de meneval for you have seen it as much as i have  yes yes answered the secretary  he certainly does not encourage originality among those who surround him  i have heard him say many a time that he desired nothing but mediocrity which was a poor compliment it must be confessed to us who have the honour of serving him  a clever man at his court shows his cleverness best by pretending to be dull said caulaincourt with some bitterness  and yet there are many famous characters there i remarked  if so it is only by concealing their characters that they remain there  his ministers are clerks his generals are superior aidesdecamp  they are all agents  you have this wonderful man in the middle and all around you have so many mirrors which reflect different sides of him  in one you see him as a financier and you call it lebrun  in another you have him as a gendarme and you name it savary or fouche  in yet another he figures as a diplomatist and is called talleyrand  you see different figures but it is really the same man there is a monsieur de caulaincourt for example who arranges the household but he cannot dismiss a servant without permission  it is still always the emperor  and he plays upon us  we must confess de meneval that he plays upon us  in nothing else do i see so clearly his wonderful cleverness  he will not let us be too friendly lest we combine  he has set his marshals against each other until there are hardly two of them on speaking terms  look how davoust hates bernadotte or lannes and bessieres or ney and massena  it is all they can do to keep their sabres in they sheaths when they meet  and then he knows our weak points  savarys thirst for money cambaceress vanity durocs bluntness berthiers foolishness marets insipidity talleyrands mania for speculation they are all so many tools in his hand  i do not know what my own greatest weakness may be but i am sure that he does and that he uses his knowledge  but how he must work i exclaimed  ah you may say so said de meneval  what energy  eighteen hours out of twentyfour for weeks on end  he has presided over the legislative council until they were fainting at their desks  as to me he will be the death of me just as he wore out de bourrienne but i will die at my post without a murmur for if he is hard upon us he is hard upon himself also  he was the man for france said de caulaincourt  he is the very genius of system and of order and of discipline  when one renumbers the chaos in which our poor country found itself after the revolution when no one would be governed and everyone wanted to govern someone else you will understand that only napoleon could have saved us we were all longing for something fixed to secure ourselves to and then we came upon this iron pillar of a man  and what a man he was in those days monsieur de laval  you see him now when he has got all that he can want  he is goodhumoured and easy  but at that time he had got nothing but coveted everything  his glance frightened women he walked the streets like a wolf  people looked after him as he passed  his face was quite differentit was craggy hollowcheeked with an oblique menacing gaze and the jaws of a pike  oh yes this little lieutenant buonaparte from the military school of brienne was a singular figure  there is a man said i when i saw him who will sit upon a throne or kneel upon a scaffold and now look at him  and that is ten years ago i exclaimed  only ten years and they have brought him from a barrackroom to the tuileries  but he was born for it  you could not keep him down de bourrienne told me that when he was a little fellow at brienne he had the grand imperial manner and would praise or blame glare or smile exactly as he does now  have you seen his mother monsieur de laval she is a tragedy queen tall stern reserved silent  there is the spring from which he flowed  i could see in the gentle spanieleyes of the secretary that he was disturbed by the frankness of de caulaincourts remarks  you can tell that we do not live under a very terrible tyranny monsieur de laval said he or we should hardly venture to discuss our ruler so frankly  the fact is that we have said nothing which he would not have listened to with pleasure and perhaps with approval  he has his little frailties or he would not be human but take his qualities as a ruler and i would ask you if there has ever been a man who has justified the choice of a nation so completely  he works harder than any of his subjects  he is a general beloved by his soldiers  he is a master beloved by his servants  he never has a holiday and he is always ready for his work  there is not under the roof of the tuileries a more abstemious eater or drinker  he educated his brothers at his own expense when he was a very poor man and he has caused even his most distant relatives to share in his prosperity  in a word he is economical hardworking and temperate  we read in the london papers about this prince of wales monsieur de laval and i do not think that he comes very well out of the comparison  i thought of the long record of brighton scandals london scandals newmarket scandals and i had to leave george undefended  as i understand it said i it is not the emperors private life but his public ambition that the english attack  the fact is said de caulaincourt that the emperor knows and we all know that there is not room enough in the world for both france and england  one or other must be supreme  if england were once crushed we could then lay the foundations of a permanent peace  italy is ours austria we can crush again as we have crushed her before  germany is divided  russia can expand to the south and east  america we can take at our leisure finding our pretext in louisiana or in canada  there is a world empire waiting for us and there is the only thing that stops us  he pointed out through the opening of the tent at the broad blue channel  far away like snowwhite gulls in the distance were the sails of the blockading fleet  i thought again of what i had seen the night beforethe lights of the ships upon the sea and the glow of the camp upon the shore  the powers of the land and of the ocean were face to face whilst a waiting world stood round to see what would come of it    chapter xii   the man of action  de menevals tent had been pitched in such a way that he could overlook the royal headquarters but whether it was that we were too absorbed in the interest of our conversation or that the emperor had used the other entrance in returning from the review we were suddenly startled by the appearance of a captain dressed in the green jacket of the chasseurs of the guard who had come to say that napoleon was waiting for his secretary  poor de menevals face turned as white as his beautiful ruffles as he sprang to his feet hardly able to speak for agitation  i should have been there he gasped  oh what a misfortune monsieur de caulaincourt you must excuse me  where is my hat and my sword  come monsieur de laval not an instant is to be lost  i could judge from the terror of de meneval as well as from the scene which i had witnessed with admiral bruix what the influence was which the emperor exercised over those who were around him  they were never at their ease always upon the brink of a catastrophe encouraged one day only to be rudely rebuffed the next bullied in public and slighted in private and yet in spite of it all the singular fact remains that they loved him and served him as no monarch has been loved and served  perhaps i had best stay here said i when we had come to the antechamber which was still crowded with people  no no i am responsible for you  you must come with me  oh i trust he is not offended with me  how could he have got in without my seeing him  my frightened companion scratched at the door which was opened instantly by roustem the mameluke who guarded it within  the room into which we passed was of considerable size but was furnished with extreme simplicity  it was papered of a silvergrey colour with a skyblue ceiling in the centre of which was the imperial eagle in gold holding a thunderbolt  in spite of the warm weather a large fire was burning at one side and the air was heavy with heat and the aromatic smell of aloes  in the middle of the room was a large oval table covered with green cloth and littered with a number of letters and papers  a raised writingdesk was at one side of the table and behind it in a green morocco chair with curved arms there sat the emperor  a number of officials were standing round the walls but he took no notice of them in his hand he had a small penknife with which he whittled the wooden knob at the end of his chair  he glanced up as we entered and shook his head coldly at de meneval  i have had to wait for you monsieur de meneval said he  i cannot remember that i ever waited for my late secretary de bourrienne that is enough  no excuses  take this report which i have written in your absence and make a copy of it  poor de meneval took the paper with a shaking hand and carried it to the little side table which was reserved for his use  napoleon rose and paced slowly up and down the room with his hands behind his back and his big round head stooping a little forwards  it was certainly as well that he had a secretary for i observed that in writing this single document he had spattered the whole place with ink and it was obvious that he had twice used his white kerseymere kneebreeches as a penwiper  as for me i stood quietly beside roustem at the door and he took not the slightest notice of my presence  well he cried presently is it ready de meneval  we have something more to do  the secretary half turned in his chair and his face was more agitated than ever  if it please you sire he stammered  well well what is the matter now  if it please you sire i find some little difficulty in reading what you have written  tut tut sir  you see what the report is about  yes sire it is about forage for the cavalry horses  napoleon smiled and the action made his face look quite boyish  you remind me of cambaceres de meneval  when i wrote him an account of the battle of marengo he thought that my letter was a rough plan of the engagement  it is incredible how much difficulty you appear to have in reading what i write  this document has nothing to do with cavalry horses but it contains the instructions to admiral villeneuve as to the concentration of his fleet so as to obtain command of the channel give it to me and i will read it to you  he snatched the paper up in the quick impulsive way which was characteristic of him  but after a long fierce stare he crumpled it up and hurled it under the table  i will dictate it to you said he and pacing up and down the long room he poured forth a torrent of words which poor de meneval his face shining with his exertions strove hard to put upon paper  as he grew excited by his own ideas napoleons voice became shriller his step faster and he seized his right cuff in the fingers of the same hand and twisted his right arm in the singular epileptic gesture which was peculiar to him  but his thoughts and plans were so admirably clear that even i who knew nothing of the matter could readily follow them while above all i was impressed by the marvellous grasp of fact which enabled him to speak with confidence not only of the lineofbattle ships but of the frigates sloops and brigs at ferrol rochefort cadiz carthagena and brest with the exact strength of each in men and in guns while the names and force of the english vessels were equally at his fingers ends  such familiarity would have been remarkable in a naval officer but when i thought that this question of the ships was only one out of fifty with which this man had to deal i began to realise the immense grasp of that capacious mind  he did not appear to be paying the least attention to me but it seems that he was really watching me closely for he turned upon me when he had finished his dictation  you appear to be surprised monsieur de laval that i should be able to transact my naval business without having my minister of marine at my elbow but it is one of my rules to know and to do things for myself perhaps if these good bourbons had had the same habit they would not now be living amidst the fogs of england  one must have your majestys memory in order to do it i observed  it is the result of system said he  it is as if i had drawers in my brain so that when i opened one i could close the others  it is seldom that i fail to find what i want there  i have a poor memory for names or dates but an excellent one for facts or faces  there is a good deal to bear in mind monsieur de laval  for example i have as you have seen my one little drawer full of the ships upon the sea  i have another which contains all the harbours and forts of france  as an example i may tell you that when my minister of war was reading me a report of all the coast defences i was able to point out to him that he had omitted two guns in a battery near ostend  in yet another of my braindrawers i have the regiments of france  is that drawer in order marshal berthier  a cleanshaven man who had stood biting his nails in the window bowed at the emperors question  i am sometimes tempted to believe sire that you know the name of every man in the ranks said he  i think that i know most of my old egyptian grumblers said he and then monsieur de laval there is another drawer for canals bridges roads manufactures and every detail of internal administration  the law finance italy the colonies holland all these things demand drawers of their own  in these days monsieur de laval france asks something more of its ruler than that he should carry eight yards of ermine with dignity or ride after a stag in the forest of fontainebleau  i thought of the helpless gentle pompous louis whom my father had once taken me to visit and i understood that france after her convulsions and her sufferings did indeed require another and a stronger head  do you not think so monsieur de laval asked the emperor  he had halted for a moment by the fire and was grinding his dainty goldbuckled shoe into one of the burning logs  you have come to a very wise decision said he when i had answered his question  but you have always been of this way of thinking have you not  is it not true that you once defended me when some young englishman was drinking toasts to my downfall at an inn in this village in which you lived  i remembered the incident although i could not imagine how it had reached his ears  why should you have done this  i did it on impulse sire  on impulse he cried in a tone of contempt  i do not know what people mean when they say that they do things upon impulse in charenton things are doubtless done upon impulse but not amongst sane people  why should you risk your life over there in defending me when at the time you had nothing to hope for from me  it was because i felt that you stood for france sire  during this conversation he had still walked up and down the room twisting his right arm about and occasionally looking at one or other of us with his eyeglass for his sight was so weak that he always needed a single glass indoors and binoculars outside  sometimes he stopped and helped himself to great pinches of snuff from a tortoiseshell box but i observed that none of it ever reached his nose for he dropped it all from between his fingers on to his waistcoat and the floor  my answer seemed to please him for he suddenly seized my ear and pulled it with considerable violence  you are quite right my friend said he  i stand for france just as frederic the second stood for prussia  i will make her the great power of the world so that every monarch in europe will find it necessary to keep a palace in paris and they will all come to hold the train at the coronation of my descendants a spasm of pain passed suddenly over his face  my god for whom am i building  who will be my descendants i heard him mutter and he passed his hand over his forehead  do they seem frightened in england about my approaching invasion he asked suddenly  have you heard them express fears lest i get across the channel  i was forced in truth to say that the only fears which i had ever heard expressed were lest he should not get across  the soldiers are very jealous that the sailors should always have the honour said i  but they have a very small army  nearly every man is a volunteer sire  pooh conscripts he cried and made a motion with his hands as if to sweep them from before him  i will land with a hundred thousand men in kent or in sussex  i will fight a great battle which i will win with a loss of ten thousand men  on the third day i shall be in london i will seize the statesmen the bankers the merchants the newspaper men  i will impose an indemnity of a hundred millions of their pounds i will favour the poor at the expense of the rich and so i shall have a party  i will detach scotland and ireland by giving them constitutions which will put them in a superior condition to england  thus i will sow dissensions everywhere  then as a price for leaving the island i will claim their fleet and their colonies  in this way i shall secure the command of the world to france for at least a century to come  in this short sketch i could perceive the quality which i have since heard remarked in napoleon that his mind could both conceive a large scheme and at the same time evolve those practical details which would seem to bring it within the bounds of possibility  one instant it would be a wild dream of overrunning the east  the next it was a schedule of the ships the ports the stores the troops which would be needed to turn dream into fact  he gripped the heart of a question with the same decision which made him strike straight for an enemys capital the soul of a poet and the mind of a man of business of the first order that is the combination which may make a man dangerous to the world  i think that it may have been his purposefor he never did anything without a purposeto give me an objectlesson of his own capacity for governing with the idea perhaps that i might in turn influence others of the emigres by what i told them  at any rate he left me there to stand and to watch the curious succession of points upon which he had to give an opinion during a few hours  nothing seemed to be either too large or too small for that extraordinary mind  at one instant it was the arrangements for the winter cantonments of two hundred thousand men at the next he was discussing with de caulaincourt the curtailing of the expenses of the household and the possibility of suppressing some of the carriages  it is my desire to be economical at home so as to make a good show abroad said he  for myself when i had the honour to be a sublieutenant i found that i could live very well upon 1200 francs a year and it would be no hardship to me to go back to it  this extravagance of the palace must be stopped  for example i see upon your accounts that 155 cups of coffee are drunk a day which with sugar at 4 francs and coffee at 5 francs a pound come to 20 sous a cup it would be better to make an allowance for coffee  the stable bills are also too high  at the present price of fodder seven or eight francs a week should be enough for each horse in a stable of two hundred i will not have any waste at the tuileries  thus within a few minutes he would pass from a question of milliards to a question of sous and from the management of a empire to that of a stable  from time to time i could observe that he threw a little oblique glance at me as if to ask what i thought of it all and at the time i wondered very much why my approval should be of any consequence to him  but now when i look back and see that my following his fortunes brought over so many others of the young nobility i understand that he saw very much further than i did  well monsieur de laval said he suddenly you have seen something of my methods  are you prepared to enter my service  assuredly sire i answered  i can be a very hard master when i like said he smiling  you were there when i spoke to admiral bruix  we have all our duty to do and discipline is as necessary in the highest as in the lowest ranks but anger with me never rises above here and he drew his hand across his throat  i never permit it to cloud my brain  dr corvisart here would tell you that i have the slowest pulse of all his patients  and that you are the fastest eater sire said a largefaced benevolentlooking person who had been whispering to marshal berthier  ohe you rascal you rake that up against me do you  the doctor will not forgive me because i tell him when i am unwell that i had rather die of the disease than of the remedies  if i eat too fast it is the fault of the state which does not allow me more than a few minutes for my meals  which reminds me that it must be rather after my dinner hour constant  it is four hours after it sire  serve it up then at once  yes sire  monsieur isabey is outside sire with his dolls  ah we shall see them at once  show him in  a man entered who had evidently just arrived from a long journey  under his arm he carried a large flat wickerwork basket  it is two days since i sent for you monsieur isabey  the courier arrived yesterday sire  i have been travelling from paris ever since  have you the models there  yes sire  then you may lay them out on that table  i could not at first imagine what it meant when i saw upon isabey opening his basket that it was crammed with little puppets about a foot high all of them dressed in the most gorgeous silk and velvet costumes with trimmings of ermine and hangings of gold lace  but presently as the designer took them out one by one and placed them on the table i understood that the emperor with his extraordinary passion for detail and for directly controlling everything in his court had had these dolls dressed in order to judge the effect of the gorgeous costumes which had been ordered for his grand functionaries upon state occasions  what is this he asked holding up a little lady in hunting costume of amaranth and gold with a toque and plume of white feathers  that is for the empresss hunt sire  you should have the waist rather lower said napoleon who had very definite opinions about ladies dresses  these cursed fashions seem to be the only thing in my dominions which i cannot regulate  my tailor duchesne takes three inches from my coattails and all the armies and fleets of france cannot prevent him  who is this  he had picked up a very gorgeous figure in a green coat  that is the grand master of the hunt sire  then it is you berthier  how do you like your new costume  and this in red  that is the archchancellor  and the violet  that is the grand chamberlain  the emperor was as much amused as a child with a new toy  he formed little groups of the figures upon the table so that he might have an idea of how the dignitaries would look when they chatted together then he threw them all back into the basket  very good said he  you and david have done your work very well isabey  you will submit these designs to the court outfitters and have an estimate for the expense  you may tell lenormand that if she ventures to send in such an account as the last which she sent to the empress she shall see the inside of vincennes  you would not think it right monsieur de laval to spend twentyfive thousand francs upon a single dress even though it were for mademoiselle eugenie de choiseul  was there anything which this wizard of a man did not know  what could my love affairs be to him amidst the clash of armies and the struggles of nations  when i looked at him half in amazement and half in fear that pleasant boyish smile lit up his pale face and his plump little hand rested for an instant upon my shoulder  his eyes were of a bright blue when he was amused though they would turn dark when he was thoughtful and steelgrey in moments of excitement  you were surprised when i told you a little while ago about your encounter with the englishman in the village inn  you are still more surprised now when i tell you about a certain young lady  you must certainly have thought that i was very badly served by my agents in england if i did not know such important details as these  i cannot conceive sire why such trifles should be reported to you or why you should for one instant remember them  you are certainly a very modest young man and i hope you will not lose that charming quality when you have been for a little time at my court so you think that your own private affairs are of no importance to me  i do not know why they should be sire  what is the name of your greatuncle  he is the cardinal de laval de montmorency  precisely  and where is he  he is in germany  quite soin germany and not at notre dame where i should have placed him  who is your first cousin  the duke de rohan  and where is he  in london  yes in london and not at the tuileries where he might have had what he liked for the asking  i wonder if i were to fall whether i should have followers as faithful as those of the bourbons  would the men that i have made go into exile and refuse all offers until i should return come here berthier he took his favourite by the ear with the caressing gesture which was peculiar to him  could i count upon you you rascaleh  i do not understand you sire  our conversation had been carried on in a voice which had made it inaudible to the other people in the room but now they were all listening to what berthier had to say  if i were driven out would you go into exile also  no sire  diable at least you are frank  i could not go into exile sire  and why  because i should be dead sire  napoleon began to laugh  and there are some who say that our berthier is dullwitted said he well i think i am pretty sure of you berthier for although i am fond of you for reasons of my own i do not think that you would be of much value to anyone else  now i could not say that of you monsieur talleyrand  you would change very quickly to a new master as you have changed from an old one  you have a genius you know for adapting yourself  there was nothing which the emperor loved more than to suddenly produce little scenes of this sort which made everybody very uncomfortable for no one could tell what awkward or compromising question he was going to put to them next  at present however they all forgot their own fears of what might come in their interest at the reply which the famous diplomatist might make to a suggestion which everybody knew to be so true  he stood leaning upon his black ebony stick with his bulky shoulders stooping forward and an amused smile upon his face as if the most innocent of compliments had been addressed to him  one of his few titles to respect is that he always met napoleon upon equal terms and never condescended to fawn upon him or to flatter him  you think i should desert you sire if your enemies offered me more than you have given me  i am perfectly sure that you would  well really i cannot answer for myself sire until the offer has been made  but it will have to be a very large one  you see apart from my very nice hotel in the rue st florentin and the two hundred thousand or so which you are pleased to allow me there is my position as the first minister in europe  really sire unless they put me on the throne i cannot see how i can better my position  no i think i have you pretty safe said napoleon looking hard at him with thoughtful eyes  by the way talleyrand you must either marry madame grand or get rid of her for i cannot have a scandal about the court  i was astounded to hear so delicate and personal a matter discussed in this public way but this also was characteristic of the rule of this extraordinary man who proclaimed that he looked upon delicacy and good taste as two of the fetters with which mediocrity attempted to cripple genius  there was no question of private life from the choosing of a wife to the discarding of a mistress that this young conqueror of thirtysix did not claim the right of discussing and of finally settling  talleyrand broke once more into his benevolent but inscrutable smile  i suppose that it is from early association sire said he but my instincts are to avoid marriage  napoleon began to laugh  i forget sometimes that it is really the bishop of autun to whom i am speaking said he  i think that perhaps i have interest enough with the pope to ask him in return for any little attention which we gave him at the coronation to show you some leniency in this matter  she is a clever woman this madame grand  i have observed that she listens with attention  talleyrand shrugged his rounded shoulders  intellect in a woman is not always an advantage sire  a clever woman compromises her husband a stupid woman only compromises herself  the cleverest woman said napoleon is the woman who is clever enough to conceal her cleverness  the women in france have always been a danger for they are cleverer than the men  they cannot understand that it is their hearts and not their heads that we want  when they have had influence upon a monarch they have invariably ruined his career  look at henry the fourth and louis the fourteenth  they are all ideologists dreamers sentimentalists full of emotion and energy but without logic or foresight  look at that accursed madame de stael  look at the salons of the quartier st germain  their eternal clack clack clack give me more trouble than the fleet of england  why cannot they look after their babies and their needlework  i suppose you think that these are very dreadful opinions monsieur de laval  it was not an easy question to answer so i was silent  you have not at your age become a practical man said the emperor you will understand then  i dare say that i thought as you do at the time when the stupid parisians were saying what a misalliance the widow of the famous general de beauharnais was making by marrying the unknown buonaparte  it was a beautiful dream  there are nine inns in a single days journey between milan and mantua and i wrote a letter to my wife from each of them  nine letters in a daybut one becomes disillusioned monsieur  one learns to accept things as they are  i could not but think what a beautiful young man he must have been before he had learned to accept things as they are  the glamour the romancewhat a bald dead thing is life without it  his own face had clouded over as if that old life had perhaps had a charm which the emperors crown had never given  it may be that those nine letters written in one day at wayside inns had brought him more true joy than all the treaties by which he had torn provinces from his neighbours but the sentiment passed from his face and he came back in his sudden concise fashion to my own affairs  eugenie de choiseul is the niece of the duc de choiseul is she not he asked  yes sire  you are affianced  yes sire  he shook his head impatiently  if you wish to advance yourself in my court monsieur de laval said he you must commit such matters to my care  is it likely that i can look with indifference upon a marriage between emigresan alliance between my enemies  but she shares my opinions sire  ta ta ta at her age one has no opinions  she has the emigre blood in her veins and it will come out  your marriage shall be my care monsieur de laval  and i wish you to come to the pont de briques that you may be presented to the empress  what is it constant  there is a lady outside who desires to see your majesty  shall i tell her to come later  a lady cried the emperor smiling  we do not see many faces in the camp which have not a moustache upon them  who is she  what does she want  her name sire is mademoiselle sibylle bernac  what cried napoleon  it must be the daughter of old bernac of grosbois  by the way monsieur de laval he is your uncle upon your mothers side is he not  i may have flushed with shame as i acknowledged it for the emperor read my feelings  well well he has not a very savoury trade it is true and yet i can assure you that it is one which is very necessary to me  by the way this uncle of yours as i understand holds the estates which should have descended to you does he not  yes sire  his blue eyes flashed suspicion at me  i trust that you are not joining my service merely in the hope of having them restored to you  no sire  it is my ambition to make a career for myself  it is a prouder thing said the emperor to found a family than merely to perpetuate one  i could not restore your estates monsieur de laval for things have come to such a pitch in france that if one once begins restorations the affair is endless  it would shake all public confidence  i have no more devoted adherents than the men who hold land which does not belong to them  as long as they serve me as your uncle serves me the land must remain with them  but what can this young lady require of me  show her in constant  an instant later my cousin sibylle was conducted into the room her face was pale and set but her large dark eyes were filled with resolution and she carried herself like a princess  well mademoiselle why do you come here  what is it that you want asked the emperor in the brusque manner which he adopted to women even if he were wooing them  sibylle glanced round and as our eyes met for an instant i felt that my presence had renewed her courage  she looked bravely at the emperor as she answered him  i come sire to implore a favour of you  your fathers daughter has certainly claims upon me mademoiselle what is it that you wish  i do not ask it in my fathers name but in my own  i implore you sire to spare the life of monsieur lucien lesage who was arrested yesterday upon a charge of treason  he is a student sirea mere dreamer who has lived away from the world and has been made a tool by designing men  a dreamer cried the emperor harshly  they are the most dangerous of all  he took a bundle of notes from his table and glanced them over i presume that he is fortunate enough to be your lover mademoiselle  sibylles pale face flushed and she looked down before the emperors keen sardonic glance  i have his examination here  he does not come well out of it  i confess that from what i see of the young mans character i should not say that he is worthy of your love  i implore you to spare him sire  what you ask is impossible mademoiselle  i have been conspired against from two sidesby the bourbons and by the jacobins  hitherto i have been too longsuffering and they have been encouraged by my patience  since cadoudal and the due denghien died the bourbons have been quiet  now i must teach the same lesson to these others  i was astonished and am still astonished at the passion with which my brave and pure cousin loved this cowardly and lowminded man though it is but in accordance with that strange law which draws the extremes of nature together  as she heard the emperors stern reply the last sign of colour faded from her pale face and her eyes were dimmed with despairing tears which gleamed upon her white cheeks like dew upon the petals of a lily  for gods sake sire  for the love of your mother spare him she cried falling upon her knees at the emperors feet  i will answer for him that he never offends you again  tut tut cried napoleon angrily turning upon his heel and walking impatiently up and down the room  i cannot grant you what you ask mademoiselle  when i say so once it is finished  i cannot have my decisions in high matters of state affected by the intrusion of women the jacobins have been dangerous of late and an example must be made or we shall have the faubourg st antoine upon our hands once more  the emperors set face and firm manner showed it was hopeless and yet my cousin persevered as no one but a woman who pleads for her lover would have dared to do  he is harmless sire  his death will frighten others  spare him and i will answer for his loyalty  what you ask is impossible  constant and i raised her from the ground  that is right monsieur de laval said the emperor  this interview can lead to nothing  remove your cousin from the room  but she had again turned to him with a face which showed that even now all hope had not been abandoned  sire she cried  you say that an example must be made  there is toussac  ah if i could lay my hands upon toussac  he is the dangerous man  it was he and my father who led lucien on if an example must be made it should be an example of the guilty rather than of the innocent  they are both guilty  and besides we have our hands upon the one but not upon the other  but if i could find him  napoleon thought for a moment  if you do said he lesage will be forgiven  but i cannot do it in a day  how long do you ask  a week at the least  then he has a respite of a week  if you can find toussac in the time lesage will be pardoned  if not he will die upon the eighth day  it is enough  monsieur de laval remove your cousin for i have matters of more importance to attend to  i shall expect you one evening at the pont de briques when you are ready to be presented to the empress    chapter xiii   the man of dreams  when i had escorted my cousin sibylle from the presence of the emperor i was surprised to find the same young hussar officer waiting outside who had commanded the guard which had brought me to the camp  well mademoiselle what luck he asked excitedly clanking towards us  for answer sibylle shook her head  ah i feared as much for the emperor is a terrible man  it was brave indeed of you to attempt it  i had rather charge an unshaken square upon a spent horse than ask him for anything  but my heart is heavy mademoiselle that you should have been unsuccessful  his boyish blue eyes filled with tears and his fair moustache drooped in such a deplorable fashion that i could have laughed had the matter been less serious  lieutenant gerard chanced to meet me and escorted me through the camp said my cousin  he has been kind enough to give me sympathy in my trouble  and so do i sibylle i cried you carried yourself like an angel and it is a lucky man who is blessed with your love  i trust that he may be worthy of it  she turned cold and proud in an instant when anyone threw a doubt upon this wretched lover of hers  i know him as neither the emperor nor you can do said she  he has the heart and soul of a poet and he is too highminded to suspect the intrigues to which he has fallen a victim  but as to toussac i should have no pity upon him for i know him to be a murderer five times over and i know also that there will be no peace in france until he has been taken  cousin louis will you help me to do it  the lieutenant had been tugging at his moustache and looking me up and down with a jealous eye  surely mademoiselle you will permit me to help you he cried in a piteous voice  i may need you both said she  i will come to you if i do  now i will ask you to ride with me to the edge of the camp and there to leave me  she had a quick imperative way which came charmingly from those sweet womanly lips  the grey horse upon which i had come to the camp was waiting beside that of the hussar so we were soon in the saddle when we were clear of the huts my cousin turned to us  i had rather go alone now said she  it is understood then that i can rely upon you  entirely said i  to the death cried gerard  it is everything to me to have two brave men at my back said she and so with a smile gave her horse its head and cantered off over the downland in the direction of grosbois  for my part i remained in thought for some time wondering what plan she could have in her head by which she hoped to get upon the track of toussac  a womans wit spurred by the danger of her lover might perhaps succeed where fouche and savary had failed  when at last i turned my horse i found my young hussar still staring after the distant rider  my faith  there is the woman for you etienne he kept repeating what an eye  what a smile  what a rider  and she is not afraid of the emperor  oh etienne here is the woman who is worthy of you  these were the little sentences which he kept muttering to himself until she vanished over the hill when he became conscious at last of my presence  you are mademoiselles cousin he asked  you are joined with me in doing something for her  i do not yet know what it is but i am perfectly ready to do it  it is to capture toussac  excellent  in order to save the life of her lover  there was a struggle in the face of the young hussar but his more generous nature won  sapristi i will do even that if it will make her the happier he cried and he shook the hand which i extended towards him  the hussars of bercheny are quartered over yonder where you see the lines of picketed horses  if you will send for lieutenant etienne gerard you will find a sure blade always at your disposal  let me hear from you then and the sooner the better  he shook his bridle and was off with youth and gallantry in every line of him from his red toupet and flowing dolman to the spur which twinkled on his heel  but for four long days no word came from my cousin as to her quest nor did i hear from this grim uncle of mine at the castle of grosbois for myself i had gone into the town of boulogne and had hired such a room as my thin purse could afford over the shop of a baker named vidal next to the church of st augustin in the rue des vents  only last year i went back there under that strange impulse which leads the old to tread once more with dragging feet the same spots which have sounded to the crisp tread of their youth  the room is still there the very pictures and the plaster head of jean bart which used to stand upon the side table  as i stood with my back to the narrow window i had around me every smallest detail upon which my young eyes had looked nor was i conscious that my own heart and feelings had undergone much change  and yet there in the little round glass which faced me was the long drawn weary face of an aged man and out of the window when i turned were the bare and lonely downs which had been peopled by that mighty host of a hundred and fifty thousand men  to think that the grand army should have vanished away like a shredding cloud upon a windy day and yet that every sordid detail of a bourgeois lodging should remain unchanged truly if man is not humble it is not for want of having his lesson taught to him by nature  my first care after i had chosen my room was to send to grosbois for that poor little bundle which i had carried ashore with me that squally night from the english lugger  my next was to use the credit which my favourable reception by the emperor and his assurance of employment had given me in order to obtain such a wardrobe as would enable me to appear without discredit among the richly dressed courtiers and soldiers who surrounded him  it was well known that it was his whim that he should himself be the only plainlydressed man in the company and that in the most luxurious times of the bourbons there was never a period when fine linen and a brave coat were more necessary for a man who would keep in favour  a new court and a young empire cannot afford to take anything for granted  it was upon the morning of the fifth day that i received a message from duroc who was the head of the household that i was to attend the emperor at the headquarters in the camp and that a seat in one of the imperial carriages would be at my disposal that i might proceed with the court to pont de briques there to be present at the reception of the empress  when i arrived i was shown at once through the large entrance tent and admitted by constant into the room beyond where the emperor stood with his back to the fire kicking his heels against the grate talleyrand and berthier were in attendance and de meneval the secretary sat at the writingtable  ah monsieur de laval said the emperor with a friendly nod have you heard anything yet of your charming cousin  nothing sire i answered  i fear that her efforts will be in vain  i wish her every success for we have no reason at all to fear this miserable poet while the other is formidable  all the same an example of some sort must be made  the darkness was drawing in and constant had appeared with a taper to light the candles but the emperor ordered him out  i like the twilight said he  no doubt monsieur de laval after your long residence in england you find yourself also most at home in a dim light  i think that the brains of these people must be as dense as their fogs to judge by the nonsense which they write in their accursed papers  with one of those convulsive gestures which accompanied his sudden outbursts of passion he seized a sheaf of late london papers from the table and ground them into the fire with his heel  an editor he cried in the guttural rasping voice which i had heard when i first met him  what is he  a dirty man with a pen in a back office  and he will talk like one of the great powers of europe  i have had enough of this freedom of the press  there are some who would like to see it established in paris  you are among them talleyrand  for my part i see no need for any paper at all except the moniteur by which the government may make known its decisions to the people  i am of opinion sire said the minister that it is better to have open foes than secret ones and that it is less dangerous to shed ink than blood  what matter if your enemies have leave to rave in a few paris papers as long as you are at the head of five hundred thousand armed men  ta ta ta cried the emperor impatiently  you speak as if i had received my crown from my father the late king  but even if i had it would be intolerable this government by newspaper  the bourbons allowed themselves to be criticised and where are they now  had they used their swiss guards as i did the grenadiers upon the eighteenth brumaire what would have become of their precious national assembly there was a time when a bayonet in the stomach of mirabeau might have settled the whole matter  later it took the heads of a king and queen and the blood of a hundred thousand people  he sat down and stretched his plump whiteclad legs towards the fire through the blackened shreds of the english papers the red glow beat upwards upon the beautiful pallid sphinxlike facethe face of a poet of a philosopherof anything rather than of a ruthless and ambitious soldier  i have heard folk remark that no two portraits of the emperor are alike and the fault does not lie with the artists but with the fact that every varying mood made him a different man  but in his prime before his features became heavy i who have seen sixty years of mankind can say that in repose i have never looked upon a more beautiful face  you have no dreams and no illusions talleyrand said he  you are always practical cold and cynical  but with me when i am in the twilight as now or when i hear the sound of the sea my imagination begins to work  it is the same when i hear some musicespecially music which repeats itself again and again like some pieces of passaniello they have a strange effect upon me and i begin to ossianise  i get large ideas and great aspirations  it is at such times that my mind always turns to the east that swarming antheap of the human race where alone it is possible to be very great  i renew my dreams of 98 i think of the possibility of drilling and arming these vast masses of men and of precipitating them upon europe  had i conquered syria i should have done this and the fate of the world was really decided at the siege of acre  with egypt at my feet i already pictured myself approaching india mounted upon an elephant and holding in my hand a new version of the koran which i had myself composed  i have been born too late  to be accepted as a worlds conqueror one must claim to be divine  alexander declared himself to be the son of jupiter and no one questioned it  but the world has grown old and has lost its enthusiasms  what would happen if i were to make the same claim monsieur de talleyrand would smile behind his hand and the parisians would write little lampoons upon the walls  he did not appear to be addressing us but rather to be expressing his thoughts aloud while allowing them to run to the most fantastic and extravagant lengths  this it was which he called ossianising because it recalled to him the wild vague dreams of the gaelic ossian whose poems had always had a fascination for him  de meneval has told me that for an hour at a time he has sometimes talked in this strain of the most intimate thoughts and aspirations of his heart while his courtiers have stood round in silence waiting for the instant when he would return once more to his practical and incisive self  the great ruler said he must have the power of religion behind him as well as the power of the sword  it is more important to command the souls than the bodies of men  the sultan for example is the head of the faith as well as of the army  so were some of the roman emperors my position must be incomplete until this is accomplished  at the present instant there are thirty departments in france where the pope is more powerful than i am  it is only by universal dominion that peace can be assured in the world  when there is only one authority in europe seated at paris and when all the kings are so many lieutenants who hold their crowns from the central power of france it is then that the reign of peace will be established  many powers of equal strength must always lead to struggles until one becomes predominant  her central position her wealth and her history all mark france out as being the power which will control and regulate the others  germany is divided   russia is barbarous  england is insular  france only remains  i began to understand as i listened to him that my friends in england had not been so far wrong when they had declared that as long as he livedthis little thirtysix year old artillerymanthere could not possibly be any peace in the world  he drank some coffee which constant had placed upon the small round table at his elbow  then he leaned back in his chair once more still staring moodily at the red glow of the fire with his chin sunk upon his chest  in those days said he the kings of europe will walk behind the emperor of france in order to hold up his train at his coronation each of them will have to maintain a palace in paris and the city will stretch as far as versailles  these are the plans which i have made for paris if she will show herself to be worthy of them but i have no love for them these parisians and they have none for me for they cannot forget that i turned my guns upon them once before and they know that i am ready to do so again  i have made them admire me and fear me but i have never made them like me  look what i have done for them  where are the treasures of genoa the pictures and statues of venice and of the vatican  they are in the louvre  the spoils of my victories have gone to decorate her  but they must always be changing always chattering  they wave their hats at me now but they would soon be waving their fists if i did not give them something to talk over and to wonder at  when other things are quiet i have the dome of the invalides regilded to keep their thoughts from mischief  louis xiv gave them wars   louis xv gave them the gallantries and scandals of his court  louis xvi gave them nothing so they cut off his head it was you who helped to bring him to the scaffold talleyrand  no sire i was always a moderate  at least you did not regret his death  the less so since it has made room for you sire  nothing could have held me down talleyrand  i was born to reach the highest  it has always been the same with me  i remember when we were arranging the treaty of campo formioi a young general under thirtythere was a high vacant throne with the imperial arms in the commissioners tent  i instantly sprang up the steps and threw myself down upon it i could not endure to think that there was anything above myself  and all the time i knew in my heart all that was going to  happen to me  even in the days when my brother lucien and i lived in a little room upon a few francs a week i knew perfectly well that the day would come when i should stand where i am now  and yet i had no prospects and no reason for any great hopes  i was not clever at school i was only the fortysecond out of fiftyeight  at mathematics i had perhaps some ability but at nothing else  the truth is that i was always dreaming when the others were working  there was nothing to encourage my ambition for the only thing which i inherited from my father was a weak stomach  once when i was very young i went up to paris with my father and my sister caroline we were in the rue richelieu and we saw the king pass in his carriage who would have thought that the little boy from corsica who took his hat off and stared was destined to be the next monarch of france and yet even then i felt as if that carriage ought to belong to me what is it constant  the discreet valet bent down and whispered something to the emperor  ah of course said he  it was an appointment  i had forgotten it is she there  yes sire  in the side room  yes sire  talleyrand and berthier exchanged glances and the minister began to move towards the door  no no you can remain here said the emperor  light the lamps constant and have the carriages ready in halfanhour  look over this draft of a letter to the emperor of austria and let me have your observations upon it talleyrand  de meneval there is a lengthy report here as to the new dockyard at brest  extract what is essential from it and leave it upon my desk at five oclock tomorrow morning berthier i will have the whole army into the boats at seven  we will see if they can embark within three hours  monsieur de laval you will wait here until we start for pont de briques  so with a crisp order to each of us he walked with little swift steps across the room and i saw his square green back and white legs framed for an instant in the doorway  there was the flutter of a pink skirt beyond and then the curtains closed behind him  berthier stood biting his nails while talleyrand looked at him with a slight raising of his bushy eyebrows  de meneval with a rueful face was turning over the great bundle of papers which had to be copied by morning  constant with a noiseless tread was lighting the candles upon the sconces round the room  which is it i heard the minister whisper  the girl from the imperial opera said berthier  is the little spanish lady out of favour then  no i think not  she was here yesterday  and the other the countess  she has a cottage at ambleteuse  but we must have no scandal about the court said talleyrand with a sour smile recalling the moral sentiments with which the emperor had reproved him  and now monsieur de laval he added drawing me aside i very much wish to hear from you about the bourbon party in england you must have heard their views  do they imagine that they have any chance of success  and so for ten minutes he plied me with questions which showed me clearly that the emperor had read him aright and that he was determined come what might to be upon the side which won  we were still talking when constant entered hurriedly with a look of anxiety and perplexity which i could not have imagined upon so smooth and imperturbable a face  good heavens monsieur talleyrand he cried clasping and unclasping his hands  such a misfortune  who could have expected it  what is it then constant  oh monsieur i dare not intrude upon the emperor  and yetand yetthe empress is outside and she is coming in    chapter xiv   josephine  at this unexpected announcement talleyrand and berthier looked at each other in silence and for once the trained features of the great diplomatist who lived behind a mask betrayed the fact that he was still capable of emotion  the spasm which passed over them was caused however rather by mischievous amusement than by consternation while berthierwho had an honest affection for both napoleon and josephineran frantically to the door as if to bar the empress from entering constant rushed towards the curtains which screened the emperors room and then losing courage although he was known to be a stouthearted man he came running back to talleyrand for advice  it was too late now however for roustem the mameluke had opened the door and two ladies had entered the room  the first was tall and graceful with a smiling face and an affable though dignified manner  she was dressed in a black velvet cloak with white lace at the neck and sleeves and she wore a black hat with a curling white feather  her companion was shorter with a countenance which would have been plain had it not been for the alert expression and large dark eyes which gave it charm and character  a small black terrier dog had followed them in but the first lady turned and handed the thin steel chain with which she led it to the mameluke attendant  you had better keep fortune outside roustem said she in a peculiarly sweet musical voice  the emperor is not very fond of dogs and if we intrude upon his quarters we cannot do less than consult his tastes  good evening monsieur de talleyrand  madame de remusat and i have driven all along the cliffs and we have stopped as we passed to know if the emperor is coming to pont de briques  but perhaps he has already started  i had expected to find him here  his imperial majesty was here a short time ago said talleyrand bowing and rubbing his hands  i hold my salonsuch a salon as pont de briques is capable ofthis evening and the emperor promised me that he would set his work aside for once and favour us with his presence  i wish we could persuade him to work less monsieur de talleyrand  he has a frame of iron but he cannot continue in this way  these nervous attacks come more frequently upon him  he will insist upon doing everything everything himself  it is noble but it is to be a martyr  i have no doubt that at the present momentbut you have not yet told me where he is monsieur de talleyrand  we expect him every instant your majesty  in that case we shall sit down and await his return  ah monsieur de meneval how i pity you when i see you among all those papers  i was desolate when monsieur de bourrienne deserted the emperor but you have more than taken his place  come up to the fire madame de remusat yes yes i insist upon it for i know that you must be cold  constant come and put the rug under madame de remusats feet  it was by little acts of thoughtfulness and kindness like this that the empress so endeared herself that she had really no enemies in france even among those who were most bitterly opposed to her husband  whether as the consort of the first man in europe or as the lonely divorced woman eating her heart out at malmaison she was always praised and beloved by those who knew her  of all the sacrifices which the emperor ever made to his ambition that of his wife was the one which cost him the greatest struggle and the keenest regret  now as she sat before the fire in the same chair which had so recently been occupied by the emperor i had an opportunity of studying this person whose strange fate had raised her from being the daughter of a lieutenant of artillery to the first position among the women of europe she was six years older than napoleon and on this occasion when i saw her first she was in her fortysecond year but at a little distance or in a discreet light it was no courtiers flattery to say that she might very well have passed for thirty  her tall elegant figure was girlish in its supple slimness and she had an easy and natural grace in every movement which she inherited with her tropical west indian blood  her features were delicate and i have heard that in her youth she was strikingly beautiful but like most creole women she had become passee in early middle age  she had made a brave fight howeverwith art as her allyagainst the attacks of time and her success had been such that when she sat aloof upon a dais or drove past in a procession she might still pass as a lovely woman  in a small room however or in a good light the crude pinks and whites with which she had concealed her sallow cheeks became painfully harsh and artificial  her own natural beauty however still lingered in that last refuge of beautythe eyes which were large dark and sympathetic  her mouth too was small and amiable and her most frequent expression was a smile which seldom broadened into a laugh as she had her own reasons for preferring that her teeth should not be seen  as to her bearing it was so dignified that if this little west indian had come straight from the loins of charlemagne it could not have been improved upon  her walk her glance the sweep of her dress the wave of her handthey had all the happiest mixture of the sweetness of a woman and the condescension of a queen  i watched her with admiration as she leaned forward picking little pieces of aromatic aloes wood out of the basket and throwing them on to the fire  napoleon likes the smell of burning aloes said she  there was never anyone who had such a nose as he for he can detect things which are quite hidden from me  the emperor has an excellent nose for many things said talleyrand the state contractors have found that out to their cost  oh it is dreadful when he comes to examine accountsdreadful monsieur de talleyrand  nothing escapes him  he will make no allowances  everything must be exact  but who is this young gentleman monsieur de talleyrand  i do not think that he has been presented to me  the minister explained in a few words that i had been received into the emperors personal service and josephine congratulated me upon it with the most kindly sympathy  it eases my mind so to know that he has brave and loyal men round him ever since that dreadful affair of the infernal machine i have always been uneasy if he is away from me  he is really safest in time of war for it is only then that he is away from the assassins who hate him and now i understand that a new jacobin plot has only just been discovered  this is the same monsieur de laval who was there when the conspirator was taken said talleyrand  the empress overwhelmed me with questions hardly waiting for the answers in her anxiety  but this dreadful man toussac has not been taken yet she cried have i not heard that a young lady is endeavouring to do what has baffled the secret police and that the freedom of her lover is to be the reward of her success  she is my cousin your imperial majesty  mademoiselle sibylle bernac is her name  you have only been in france a few days monsieur de laval said josephine smiling but it seems to me that all the affairs of the empire are already revolving round you  you must bring this pretty cousin of yoursthe emperor said that she is prettyto court with you and present her to me  madame de remusat you will take a note of the name  the empress had stooped again to the basket of aloes wood which stood beside the fireplace  suddenly i saw her stare hard at something and then with a little cry of surprise she stooped and lifted an object from the carpet  it was the emperors soft flat beaver with the little tricolour cockade  josephine sprang up and looked from the hat in her hand to the imperturbable face of the minister  how is this monsieur de talleyrand she cried and the dark eyes began to shine with anger and suspicion  you said to me that the emperor was out and here is his hat  pardon me your imperial majesty i did not say that he was out  what did you say then  i said that he left the room a short time before  you are endeavouring to conceal something from me she cried with the quick instinct of a woman  i assure you that i tell you all i know  the empresss eyes darted from face to face  marshal berthier she cried i insist upon your telling me this instant where the emperor is and what he is doing  the slowwitted soldier stammered and twisted his cocked hat about  i know no more than monsieur de talleyrand does said he the emperor left us some time ago  by which door  poor berthier was more confused than ever  really your imperial majesty i cannot undertake to say by which door it was that the emperor quitted the apartment  josephines eyes flashed round at me and my heart shrunk within me as i thought that she was about to ask me that same dreadful question  but i had just time to breathe one prayer to the good saint ignatius who has always been gracious to our family and the danger passed  come madame de remusat said she  if these gentlemen will not tell us we shall very soon find out for ourselves  she swept with great dignity towards the curtained door followed at the distance of a few yards by her waiting lady whose frightened face and lagging unwilling steps showed that she perfectly appreciated the situation  indeed the emperors open infidelities and the public scenes to which they gave rise were so notorious that even in ashford they had reached our ears  napoleons selfconfidence and his contempt of the world had the effect of making him careless as to what was thought or said of him while josephine when she was carried away by jealousy lost all the dignity and restraint which usually marked her conduct so between them they gave some embarrassing moments to those who were about them  talleyrand turned away with his fingers over his lips while berthier in an agony of apprehension continued to double up and to twist the cocked hat which he held between his hands  only constant the faithful valet ventured to intervene between his mistress and the fatal door  if your majesty will resume your seat i shall inform the emperor that you are here said he with two deprecating hands outstretched  ah then he is there she cried furiously  i see it all i understand it all  but i will expose himi will reproach him with his perfidy  let me pass constant  how dare you stand in my way  allow me to announce you your majesty  i shall announce myself  with swift undulations of her beautiful figure she darted past the protesting valet parted the curtains threw open the door and vanished into the next room  she had seemed a creature full of fire and of spirit as with a flush which broke through the paint upon her cheeks and with eyes which gleamed with the just anger of an outraged wife she forced her way into her husbands presence  but she was a woman of change and impulse full of little squirts of courage and corresponding reactions into cowardice she had hardly vanished from our sight when there was a harsh roar like an angry beast and next instant josephine came flying into the room again with the emperor inarticulate with passion raving at her heels so frightened was she that she began to run towards the fireplace upon which madame de remusat who had no wish to form a rearguard upon such an occasion began running also and the two of them like a pair of startled hens came rustling and fluttering back to the seats which they had left  there they cowered whilst the emperor with a convulsed face and a torrent of campfire oaths stamped and raged about the room  you constant you he shouted is this the way in which you serve me  have you no sense thenno discretion  am i never to have any privacy  must i eternally submit to be spied upon by women is everyone else to have liberty and i only to have none  as to you josephine this finishes it all  i had hesitations before but now i have none  this brings everything to an end between us  we would all i am sure have given a good deal to slip from the roomat least my own embarrassment far exceeded my interestbut the emperor from his lofty standpoint cared as little about our presence as if we had been so many articles of furniture  in fact it was one of this strange mans peculiarities that it was just those delicate and personal scenes with which privacy is usually associated that he preferred to have in public for he knew that his reproaches had an additional sting when they fell upon other ears besides those of his victim  from his wife to his groom there was not one of those who were about him who did not live in dread of being held up to ridicule and infamy before a smiling crowd whose amusement was only tempered by the reflection that each of them might be the next to endure the same exposure  as to josephine she had taken refuge in a womans last resource and was crying bitterly with her graceful neck stooping towards her knees and her two hands over her face  madame de remusat was weeping also and in every pause of his hoarse scoldingfor his voice was very hoarse and raucous when he was angrythere came the soft hissing and clicking of their sobs  sometimes his fierce taunts would bring some reply from the empress some gentle reproof to him for his gallantries but each remonstrance only excited him to a fresh rush of vituperation  in one of his outbursts he threw his snuffbox with a crash upon the floor as a spoiled child would hurl down its toys  morality he cried morality was not made for me and i was not made for morality  i am a man apart and i accept nobodys conditions i tell you always josephine that these are the foolish phrases of mediocre people who wish to fetter the great  they do not apply to me i will never consent to frame my conduct by the puerile arrangements of society  have you no feeling then sobbed the empress  a great man is not made for feeling  it is for him to decide what he shall do and then to do it without interference from anyone  it is your place josephine to submit to all my fancies and you should think it quite natural that i should allow myself some latitude  it was a favourite device of the emperors when he was in the wrong upon one point to turn the conversation round so as to get upon some other one on which he was in the right  having worked off the first explosion of his passion he now assumed the offensive for in argument as in war his instinct was always to attack  i have been looking over lenormands accounts josephine said he are you aware how many dresses you have had last year you have had a hundred and fortyno lessand many of them cost as much as twentyfive thousand livres  i am told that you have six hundred dresses in your wardrobes many of which have hardly ever been used  madame de remusat knows that what i say is true  she cannot deny it  you like me to dress well napoleon  i will not have such monstrous extravagance  i could have two regiments of cuirassiers or a fleet of frigates with the money which you squander upon foolish silks and furs  it might turn the fortunes of a campaign  then again josephine who gave you permission to order that parure of diamonds and sapphires from lefebvre  the bill has been sent to me and i have refused to pay for it  if he applies again i shall have him marched to prison between a file of grenadiers and your milliner shall accompany him there  the emperors fits of anger although tempestuous were never very prolonged  the curious convulsive wriggle of one of his arms which always showed when he was excited gradually died away and after looking for some time at the papers of de menevalwho had written away like an automaton during all this uproarhe came across to the fire with a smile upon his lips and a brow from which the shadow had departed  you have no excuse for extravagance josephine said he laying his hand upon her shoulder  diamonds and fine dresses are very necessary to an ugly woman in order to make her attractive but you cannot need them for such a purpose  you had no fine dresses when first i saw you in the rue chautereine and yet there was no woman in the world who ever attracted me so  why will you vex me josephine and make me say things which seem unkind  drive back little one to pont de briques and see that you do not catch cold  you will come to the salon napoleon asked the empress whose bitterest resentment seemed to vanish in an instant at the first kindly touch from his hand  she still held her handkerchief before her eyes but it was chiefly i think to conceal the effect which her tears had had upon her cheeks  yes yes i will come  our carriages will follow yours  see the ladies into the berline constant  have you ordered the embarkation of the troops berthier come here talleyrand for i wish to describe my views about the future of spain and portugal  monsieur de laval you may escort the empress to pont de briques where i shall see you at the reception    chapter xv   the reception of the empress  pont de briques is but a small village and this sudden arrival of the court which was to remain for some weeks had crammed it with visitors it would have been very much simpler to have come to boulogne where there were more suitable buildings and better accommodation but napoleon had named pont de briques so pont de briques it had to be the word impossible was not permitted amongst those who had to carry out his wishes  so an army of cooks and footmen settled upon the little place and then there arrived the dignitaries of the new empire and then the ladies of the court and then their admirers from the camp the empress had a chateau for her accommodation  the rest quartered themselves in cottages or where they best might and waited ardently for the moment which was to take them back to the comforts of versailles or fontainebleau  the empress had graciously offered me a seat in her berline and all the way to the village entirely forgetful apparently of the scene through which she passed she chatted away asking me a thousand personal questions about myself and my affairs for a kindly curiosity in the doings of everyone around her was one of her most marked characteristics  especially was she interested in eugenie and as the subject was one upon which i was equally interested in talking it ended in a rhapsody upon my part amid little sympathetic ejaculations from the empress and titterings from madame de remusat  but you must certainly bring her over to the court cried the kindly woman  such a paragon of beauty and of virtue must not be allowed to waste herself in this english village  have you spoken about her to the emperor  i found that he knew all about her your majesty  he knows all about everything  oh what a man he is  you heard him about those diamonds and sapphires  lefebvre gave me his word that no one should know of it but ourselves and that i should pay at my leisure and yet you see that the emperor knew  but what did he say monsieur de laval  he said that my marriage should be his affair  josephine shook her head and groaned  but this is serious monsieur de laval  he is capable of singling out any one of the ladies of the court and marrying you to her within a week  it is a subject upon which he will not listen to argument  he has brought about some extraordinary matches in this way  but i will speak to the emperor before i return to paris and i will see what i can arrange for you  i was still endeavouring to thank her for her sympathy and kindness when the berline rattled up the drive and pulled up at the entrance to the chateau where the knot of scarlet footmen and the bearskins of two sentries from the guards announced the imperial quarters  the empress and her lady hurried away to prepare their toilets for the evening and i was shown at once into the salon in which the guests had already begun to assemble  this was a large square room furnished as modestly as the sittingroom of a provincial gentleman would be likely to be  the wallpaper was gloomy and the furniture was of dark mahogany upholstered in faded blue nankeen but there were numerous candles in candelabra upon the tables and in sconces upon the walls which gave an air of festivity even to these sombre surroundings  out of the large central room were several smaller ones in which cardtables had been laid out and the doorways between had been draped with oriental chintz  a number of ladies and gentlemen were standing about the former in the high evening dresses to which the emperor had given his sanction the latter about equally divided between the civilians in black court costumes and the soldiers in their uniforms  bright colours and graceful draperies predominated for in spite of his lectures about economy the emperor was very harsh to any lady who did not dress in a manner which would sustain the brilliancy of his court  the prevailing fashions gave an opening to taste and to display for the simple classical costumes had died out with the republic and oriental dresses had taken their place as a compliment to the conqueror of egypt  lucretia had changed to zuleika and the salons which had reflected the austerity of old rome had turned suddenly into so many eastern harems  on entering the room i had retired into a corner fearing that i should find none there whom i knew but someone plucked at my arm and turning round i found myself looking into the yellow inscrutable face of my uncle bernac  he seized my unresponsive hand and wrung it with a false cordiality  my dear louis said he  it was really the hope of meeting you here which brought me over from grosboisalthough you can understand that living so far from paris i cannot afford to miss such an opportunity of showing myself at court  nevertheless i can assure you that it was of you principally that i was thinking  i hear that you have had a splendid reception from the emperor and that you have been taken into his personal service  i had spoken to him about you and i made him fully realise that if he treats you well he is likely to coax some of the other young emigres into his service  i was convinced that he was lying but none the less i had to bow and utter a few words of cold thanks  i see that you still bear me some grudge for what passed between us the other day said he but really my dear louis you have no occasion to do so  it was your own good which i had chiefly at heart  i am neither a young nor a strong man louis and my profession as you have seen is a dangerous one  there is my child and there is my estate  who takes one takes both  sibylle is a charming girl and you must not allow yourself to be prejudiced against her by any ill temper which she may have shown towards me  i will confess that she had some reason to be annoyed at the turn which things had taken  but i hope to hear that you have now thought better upon this matter  i have never thought about it at all and i beg that you will not discuss it said i curtly  he stood in deep thought for a few moments and then he raised his evil face and his cruel grey eyes to mine  well well that is settled then said he  but you cannot bear me a grudge for having wished you to be my successor  be reasonable louis you must acknowledge that you would now be six feet deep in the saltmarsh with your neck broken if i had not stood your friend at some risk to myself  is that not true  you had your own motive for that said i  very likely  but none the less i saved you  why should you bear me ill will  it is no fault of mine if i hold your estate  it is not on account of that  why is it then  i could have explained that it was because he had betrayed his comrades because his daughter hated him because he had illused his wife because my father regarded him as the source of all his troublesbut the salon of the empress was no place for a family quarrel so i merely shrugged my shoulders and was silent  well i am very sorry said he for i had the best of intentions towards you   i could have advanced you for there are few men in france who exercise more influence  but i have one request to make to you  what is that sir  i have a number of personal articles belonging to your fatherhis sword his seals a deskful of letters some silver platesuch things in short as you would wish to keep in memory of him  i should be glad if you will come to grosboisif it is only for one nightand look over these things choosing what you wish to take away  my conscience will then be clear about them  i promised readily that i would do so  and when would you come he asked eagerly  something in the tone of his voice aroused my suspicions and glancing at him i saw exultation in his eyes  i remembered the warning of sibylle  i cannot come until i have learned what my duties with the emperor are to be  when that is settled i shall come  very good  next week perhaps or the week afterwards  i shall expect you eagerly louis  i rely upon your promise for a laval was never known to break one  with another unanswered squeeze of my hand he slipped off among the crowd which was growing denser every instant in the salon  i was standing in silence thinking over this sinister invitation of my uncles when i heard my own name and looking up i saw de caulaincourt with his brown handsome face and tall elegant figure making his way towards me  it is your first entrance at court is it not monsieur de laval said he in his highbred cordial manner you should not feel lonely for there are certainly many friends of your father here who will be overjoyed to make the acquaintance of your fathers son  from what de meneval told me i gather that you know hardly anyoneeven by sight  i know the marshals said i i saw them all at the council in the emperors tent  there is ney with the red head  and there is lefebvre with his singular mouth and bernadotte with the beak of a bird of prey  precisely  and that is rapp with the round bullet head  he is talking to junot the handsome dark man with the whiskers  these poor soldiers are very unhappy  why so i asked  because they are all men who have risen from nothing  this society and etiquette terrifies them much more than all the dangers of war when they can hear their sabres clashing against their big boots they feel at home but when they have to stand about with their cocked hats under their arms and have to pick their spurs out of the ladies trains and talk about davids picture or passaniellos opera it prostrates them  the emperor will not even permit them to swear although he has no scruples upon his own account  he tells them to be soldiers with the army and courtiers with the court but the poor fellows cannot help being soldiers all the time   look at rapp with his twenty wounds endeavouring to exchange little delicate drolleries with that young lady  there you see he has said something which would have passed very well with a vivandiere but it has made her fly to her mamma and he is scratching his head for he cannot imagine how he has offended her  who is the beautiful woman with the white dress and the tiara of diamonds i asked  that is madame murat who is the sister of the emperor  caroline is beautiful but she is not as pretty as her sister marie whom you see over yonder in the corner  do you see the tall stately darkeyed old lady with whom she is talking  that is napoleons mothera wonderful woman the source of all their strength shrewd brave vigorous forcing respect from everyone who knows her  she is as careful and as saving as when she was the wife of a small country gentleman in corsica and it is no secret that she has little confidence in the permanence of the present state of things and that she is always laying by for an evil day  the emperor does not know whether to be amused or exasperated by her precautions  well murat i suppose we shall see you riding across the kentish hopfields before long  the famous soldier had paused opposite to us and shook hands with my companion  his elegant wellknit figure large fiery eyes and noble bearing made this innkeepers boy a man who would have drawn attention and admiration to himself in any assembly in europe  his mop of curly hair and thick red lips gave that touch of character and individuality to his appearance which redeem a handsome face from insipidity  i am told that it is devilish bad country for cavalryall cut up into hedges and ditches said he  the roads are good but the fields are impossible  i hope that we are going soon monsieur de caulaincourt for our men will all settle down as gardeners if this continues they are learning more about wateringpots and spuds than about horses and sabres  the army i hear is to embark tomorrow  yes yes but you know very well that they will disembark again upon the wrong side of the channel  unless villeneuve scatters the english fleet nothing can be attempted  constant tells me that the emperor was whistling malbrook all the time that he was dressing this morning and that usually comes before a move  it was very clever of constant to tell what tune it was which the emperor was whistling said murat laughing  for my part i do not think that he knows the difference between the malbrook and the marseillaise  ah here is the empressand how charming she is looking  josephine had entered with several of her ladies in her train and the whole assembly rose to do her honour  the empress was dressed in an evening gown of rosecoloured tulle spangled with silver starsan effect which might have seemed meretricious and theatrical in another woman but which she carried off with great grace and dignity  a little sheaf of diamond wheatears rose above her head and swayed gently as she walked  no one could entertain more charmingly than she for she moved about among the people with her amiable smile setting everybody at their ease by her kindly natural manner and by the conviction which she gave them that she was thoroughly at her ease herself  how amiable she is i exclaimed  who could help loving her  there is only one family which can resist her said de caulaincourt glancing round to see that murat was out of hearing  look at the faces of the emperors sisters  i was shocked when i followed his direction to see the malignant glances with which these two beautiful women were following the empress as she walked about the room  they whispered together and tittered maliciously  then madame murat turned to her mother behind her and the stern old lady tossed her haughty head in derision and contempt  they feel that napoleon is theirs and that they ought to have everything  they cannot bear to think that she is her imperial majesty and they are only her highness  they all hate her joseph lucienall of them  when they had to carry her train at the coronation they tried to trip her up and the emperor had to interfere  oh yes they have the real corsican blood and they are not very comfortable people to get along with  but in spite of the evident hatred of her husbands family the empress appeared to be entirely unconcerned and at her ease as she strolled about among the groups of her guests with a kindly glance and a pleasant word for each of them  a tall soldierly man brownfaced and moustached walked beside her and she occasionally laid her hand with a caressing motion upon his arm  that is her son eugene de beauharnais said my companion  her son i exclaimed for he seemed to me to be the older of the two  de caulaincourt smiled at my surprise  you know she married beauharnais when she was very youngin fact she was hardly sixteen  she has been sitting in her boudoir while her son has been baking in egypt and syria so that they have pretty well bridged over the gap between them  do you see the tall handsome cleanshaven man who has just kissed josephines hand  that is talma the famous actor  he once helped napoleon at a critical moment of his career and the emperor has never forgotten the debt which the consul contracted  that is really the secret of talleyrands power  he lent napoleon a hundred thousand francs before he set out for egypt and now however much he distrusts him the emperor cannot forget that old kindness  i have never known him to abandon a friend or to forgive an enemy  if you have once served him well you may do what you like afterwards  there is one of his coachmen who is drunk from morning to night  but he gained the cross at marengo and so he is safe  de caulaincourt had moved on to speak with some lady and i was again left to my own thoughts which turned upon this extraordinary man who presented himself at one moment as a hero and at another as a spoiled child with his nobler and his worse side alternating so rapidly that i had no sooner made up my mind about him than some new revelation would destroy my views and drive me to some fresh conclusion  that he was necessary to france was evident and that in serving him one was serving ones country  but was it an honour or a penance to serve him  was he worthy merely of obedience or might love and esteem be added to it these were the questions which we found it difficult to answerand some of us will never have answered them up to the end of time  the company had now lost all appearance of formality and even the soldiers seemed to be at their ease  many had gone into the side rooms where they had formed tables for whist and for vingtetun  for my own part i was quite entertained by watching the people the beautiful women the handsome men the bearers of names which had been heard of in no previous generation but which now rung round the world  immediately in front of me were ney lannes and murat chatting together and laughing with the freedom of the camp  of the three two were destined to be executed in cold blood and the third to die upon the battlefield but no coming shadow ever cast a gloom upon their cheery fullblooded lives  a small silent middleaged man who looked unhappy and ill at ease had been leaning against the wall beside me  seeing that he was as great a stranger as myself i addressed some observation to him to which he replied with great goodwill but in the most execrable french  you dont happen to understand english he asked  ive never met one living soul in this country who did  oh yes i understand it very well for i have lived most of my life over yonder  but surely you are not english sir  i understood that every englishman in france was under lock and key ever since the breach of the treaty of amiens  no i am not english he answered i am an american  my name is robert fulton and i have to come to these receptions because it is the only way in which i can keep myself in the memory of the emperor who is examining some inventions of mine which will make great changes in naval warfare  having nothing else to do i asked this curious american what his inventions might be and his replies very soon convinced me that i had to do with a madman  he had some idea of making a ship go against the wind and against the current by means of coal or wood which was to be burned inside of her  there was some other nonsense about floating barrels full of gunpowder which would blow a ship to pieces if she struck against them  i listened to him at the time with an indulgent smile but now looking back from the point of vantage of my old age i can see that not all the warriors and statesmen in that roomno not even the emperor himselfhave had as great an effect upon the history of the world as that silent american who looked so drab and so commonplace among the goldslashed uniforms and the oriental dresses  but suddenly our conversation was interrupted by a hush in the room such a cold uncomfortable hush as comes over a roomful of happy romping children when a gravefaced elder comes amongst them the chatting and the laughter died away  the sound of the rustling cards and of the clicking counters had ceased in the other rooms everyone men and women had risen to their feet with a constrained expectant expression upon their faces  and there in the doorway were the pale face and the green coat with the red cordon across the white waistcoat  there was no saying how he might behave upon these occasions sometimes he was capable of being the merriest and most talkative of the company but this was rather in his consular than in his imperial days on the other hand he might be absolutely ferocious with an insulting observation for everyone with whom he came in contact  as a rule he was between these two extremes silent morose ill at ease shooting out curt little remarks which made everyone uncomfortable  there was always a sigh of relief when he would pass from one room into the next  on this occasion he seemed to have not wholly recovered from the storm of the afternoon and he looked about him with a brooding eye and a lowering brow  it chanced that i was not very far from the door and that his glance fell upon me  come here monsieur de laval said he  he laid his hand upon my shoulder and turned to a big gaunt man who had accompanied him into the room  look here cambaceres you simpleton said he  you always said that the old families would never come back and that they would settle in england as the huguenots have done  you see that as usual you have miscalculated for here is the heir of the de lavals come to offer his services  monsieur de laval you are now my aidedecamp and i beg you to keep with me wherever i go  this was promotion indeed and yet i had sense enough to know that it was not for my own sweet sake that the emperor had done it but in order to encourage others to follow me  my conscience approved what i had done for no sordid motive and nothing but the love of my country had prompted me but now as i walked round behind napoleon i felt humiliated and ashamed like a prisoner led behind the car of his captor  and soon there was something else to make me ashamed and that was the conduct of him whose servant i had become  his manners were outrageous as he had himself said it was his nature to be always first and this being so he resented those courtesies and gallantries by which men are accustomed to disguise from women the fact that they are the weaker sex the emperor unlike louis xiv felt that even a temporary and conventional attitude of humility towards a woman was too great a condescension from his own absolute supremacy  chivalry was among those conditions of society which he refused to accept  to the soldiers he was amiable enough with a nod and a joke for each of them  to his sisters also he said a few words though rather in the tone of a drill sergeant to a pair of recruits  it was only when the empress had joined him that his illhumour came to a head  i wish you would not wear those wisps of pink about your head josephine said he pettishly  all that women have to think about is how to dress themselves and yet they cannot even do that with moderation or taste  if i see you again in such a thing i will thrust it in the fire as i did your shawl the other day  you are so hard to please napoleon  you like one day what you cannot abide the next  but i will certainly change it if it offends you said josephine with admirable patience  the emperor took a few steps between the people who had formed a lane for us to pass through  then he stopped and looked over his shoulder at the empress  how often have i told you josephine that i cannot tolerate fat women  i always bear it in mind napoleon  then why is madame de chevreux present  but surely napoleon madame is not very fat  she is fatter than she should be  i should prefer not to see her who is this  he had paused before a young lady in a blue dress whose knees seemed to be giving way under her as the terrible emperor transfixed her with his searching eyes  this is mademoiselle de bergerot  how old are you  twentythree sire  it is time that you were married  every woman should be married at twentythree  how is it that you are not married  the poor girl appeared to be incapable of answering so the empress gently remarked that it was to the young men that that question should be addressed  oh that is the difficulty is it said the emperor  we must look about and find a husband for you  he turned and to my horror i found his eyes fixed with a questioning gaze upon my face  we have to find you a wife also monsieur de laval said he  well well we shall seewe shall see  what is your name to a quiet refined man in black  i am gretry the musician  yes yes i remember you  i have seen you a hundred times but i can never recall your name  who are you  i am joseph de chenier  of course  i have seen your tragedy  i have forgotten the name of it but it was not good  you have written some other poetry have you not  yes sire  i had your permission to dedicate my last volume to you  very likely but i have not had time to read it  it is a pity that we have no poets now in france for the deeds of the last few years would have given a subject for a homer or a virgil  it seems that i can create kingdoms but not poets  whom do you consider to be the greatest french writer  racine sire  then you are a blockhead for corneille was infinitely greater  i have no ear for metre or trivialities of the kind but i can sympathise with the spirit of poetry and i am conscious that corneille is far the greatest of poets  i would have made him my prime minister had he had the good fortune to live in my epoch  it is his intellect which i admire his knowledge of the human heart and his profound feeling are you writing anything at present  i am writing a tragedy upon henry iv sire  it will not do sir  it is too near the present day and i will not have politics upon the stage  write a play about alexander  what is your name  he had pitched upon the same person whom he had already addressed  i am still gretry the musician said he meekly  the emperor flushed for an instant at the implied rebuke  he said nothing however but passed on to where several ladies were standing together near the door of the cardroom  well madame said he to the nearest of them i hope you are behaving rather better  when last i heard from paris your doings were furnishing the quartier st germain with a good deal of amusement and gossip  i beg that your majesty will explain what you mean said she with spirit  they had coupled your name with that of colonel lasalle  it is a foul calumny sire  very possibly but it is awkward when so many calumnies cluster round one person  you are certainly a most unfortunate lady in that respect you had a scandal once before with general rapps aidedecamp  this must come to an end  what is your name he continued turning to another  mademoiselle de perigord  your age  twenty  you are very thin and your elbows are red  my god madame boismaison are we never to see anything but this same grey gown and the red turban with the diamond crescent  i have never worn it before sire  then you had another the same for i am weary of the sight of it let me never see you in it again  monsieur de remusat i make you a good allowance  why do you not spend it  i do sire  i hear that you have been putting down your carriage  i do not give you money to hoard in a bank but i give it to you that you may keep up a fitting appearance with it  let me hear that your carriage is back in the coachhouse when i return to paris  junot you rascal i hear that you have been gambling and losing  the most infernal run of luck sire said the soldier i give you my word that the ace fell four times running  ta ta you are a child with no sense of the value of money  how much do you owe  forty thousand sire  well well go to lebrun and see what he can do for you  after all we were together at toulon  a thousand thanks sire  tut  you and rapp and lasalle are the spoiled children of the army but no more cards you rascal  i do not like low dresses madame picard  they spoil even pretty women but in you they are inexcusable now josephine i am going to my room and you can come in half an hour and read me to sleep  i am tired tonight but i came to your salon since you desired that i should help you in welcoming and entertaining your guests  you can remain here monsieur de laval for your presence will not be necessary until i send you my orders  and so the door closed behind him and with a long sigh of relief from everyone from the empress to the waiter with the negus the friendly chatter began once more with the click of the counters and the rustle of the cards just as they had been before he came to help in the entertainment    chapter xvi   the library of grosbois  and now my friends i am coming to the end of those singular adventures which i encountered upon my arrival in france adventures which might have been of some interest in themselves had i not introduced the figure of the emperor who has eclipsed them all as completely as the sun eclipses the stars  even now you see after all these years in an old mans memoirs the emperor is still true to his traditions and will not brook any opposition  as i draw his words and his deeds i feel that my own poor story withers before them  and yet if it had not been for that story i should not have had an excuse for describing to you my first and most vivid impressions of him and so it has served a purpose after all you must bear with me now while i tell you of our expedition to the red mill and of what befell in the library of grosbois  two days had passed away since the reception of the empress josephine and only one remained of the time which had been allowed to my cousin sibylle in which she might save her lover and capture the terrible toussac  for my own part i was not so very anxious that she should save this craven lover of hers whose handsome face belied the poor spirit within him  and yet this lonely beautiful woman with the strong will and the loyal heart had touched my feelings and i felt that i would help her to anythingeven against my own better judgment if she should desire it  it was then with a mixture of feelings that late in the afternoon i saw her and general savary enter the little room in which i lodged at boulogne  one glance at her flushed cheeks and triumphant eyes told me that she was confident in her own success  i told you that i would find him cousin louis she cried i have come straight to you because you said that you would help in the taking of him  mademoiselle insists upon it that i should not use soldiers said savary shrugging his shoulders  no no no she cried with vehemence  it has to be done with discretion and at the sight of a soldier he would fly to some hidingplace where you would never be able to follow him  i cannot afford to run a risk  there is too much already at stake  in such an affair three men are as useful as thirty said savary i should not in any case have employed more  you say that you have another friend lieutenant  lieutenant gerard of the hussars of bercheny  quite so  there is not a more gallant officer in the grand army than etienne gerard  the three of us monsieur de laval should be equal to any adventure  i am at your disposal  tell us then mademoiselle where toussac is hiding  he is hiding at the red mill  but we have searched it i assure you that he is not there  when did you search it  two days ago  then he has come there since  i knew that jeanne portal loved him i have watched her for six days  last night she stole down to the red mill with a basket of wine and fruit  all the morning i have seen her eyes sweeping the country side and i have read the terror in them whenever she has seen the twinkle of a bayonet  i am as sure that toussac is in the mill as if i had seen him with my own eyes  in that case there is not an instant to be lost cried savary  if he knows of a boat upon the coast he is as likely as not to slip away after dark and make his escape for england  from the red mill one can see all the surrounding country and mademoiselle is right in thinking that a large body of soldiers would only warn him to escape  what do you propose then i asked  that you meet us at the south gate of the camp in an hours time dressed as you are  you might be any gentleman travelling upon the high road  i shall see gerard and we shall adopt some suitable disguise bring your pistols for it is with the most desperate man in france we have to do  we shall have a horse at your disposal  the setting sun lay dull and red upon the western horizon and the white chalk cliffs of the french coast had all flushed into pink when i found myself once more at the gate of the boulogne camp  there was no sign of my companions but a tall man dressed in a blue coat with brass buttons like a small country farmer was tightening the girth of a magnificent black horse whilst a little further on a slim young ostler was waiting by the roadside holding the bridles of two others  it was only when i recognised one of the pair as the horse which i had ridden on my first coming to camp that i answered the smile upon the keen handsome face of the ostler and saw the swarthy features of savary under the broadbrimmed hat of the farmer  i think that we may travel without fearing to excite suspicion said he  crook that straight back of yours a little gerard  and now we shall push upon our way or we may find that we are too late  my life has had its share of adventures and yet somehow this ride stands out above the others  there over the waters i could dimly see the loom of the english coast with its suggestions of dreamy villages humming bees and the pealing of sunday bells  i thought of the long white high street of ashford with its red brick houses and the inn with the great swinging sign all my life had been spent in these peaceful surroundings and now here i was with a spirited horse between my knees two pistols peeping out of my holsters and a commission upon which my whole future might depend to arrest the most redoubtable conspirator in france  no wonder that looking back over many dangers and many vicissitudes it is still that evening ride over the short crisp turf of the downs which stands out most clearly in my memory  one becomes blase to adventure as one becomes blase to all else which the world can give save only the simple joys of home and to taste the full relish of such an expedition one must approach it with the hot blood of youth still throbbing in ones veins  our route when we had left the uplands of boulogne behind us lay along the skirts of that desolate marsh in which i had wandered and so inland through plains of fern and bramble until the familiar black keep of the castle of grosbois rose upon the left  then under the guidance of savary we struck to the right down a sunken road and so over the shoulder of a hill until on a further slope beyond we saw the old windmill black against the evening sky  its upper window burned red like a spot of blood in the last rays of the setting sun  close by the door stood a cart full of grain sacks with the shafts pointing downwards and the horse grazing at some distance  as we gazed a woman appeared upon the downs and stared round with her hand over her eyes  see that said savary eagerly  he is there sure enough or why should they be on their guard  let us take this road which winds round the hill and they will not see us until we are at the very door  should we not gallop forward i suggested  the ground is too cut up  the longer way is the safer  as long as we are upon the road they cannot tell us from any other travellers  we walked our horses along the path therefore with as unconcerned an air as we could assume  but a sharp exclamation made us glance suddenly round and there was the woman standing on a hillock by the roadside and gazing down at us with a face that was rigid with suspicion  the sight of the military bearing of my companions changed all her fear into certainties  in an instant she had whipped the shawl from her shoulders and was waving it frantically over her head  with a hearty curse savary spurred his horse up the bank and galloped straight for the mill with gerard and myself at his heels  it was only just in time  we were still a hundred paces from the door when a man sprang out from it and gazed about him his head whisking this way and that  there could be no mistaking the huge bristling beard the broad chest and the rounded shoulders of toussac  a glance showed him that we would ride him down before he could get away and he sprang back into the mill closing the heavy door with a clang behind him  the window gerard the window cried  savary  there was a small square window opening into the basement room of the mill  the young hussar disengaged himself from the saddle and flew through it as the clown goes through the hoops at franconis an instant later he had opened the door for us with the blood streaming from his face and hands  he has fled up the stair said he  then we need be in no hurry since he cannot pass us said savary as we sprang from our horses  you have carried his first line of entrenchments most gallantly lieutenant gerard  i hope you are not hurt  a few scratches general nothing more  get your pistols then  where is the miller  here i am said a squat rough little fellow appearing in the open doorway  what do you mean you brigands by entering my mill in this fashion  i am sitting reading my paper and smoking my pipe of coltsfoot as my custom is about this time of the evening and suddenly without a word a man comes flying through my window covers me with glass and opens my door to his friends outside  ive had trouble enough with my one lodger all day without three more of you turning up  you have the conspirator toussac in your house  toussac cried the miller  nothing of the kind  his name is maurice and he is a merchant in silks  he is the man we want  we come in the emperors name  the millers jaw dropped as he listened  i dont know who he is but he offered a good price for a bed and i asked no more questions  in these days one cannot expect a certificate of character from every lodger  but of course if it is a matter of state why it is not for me to interfere  but to do him justice he was a quiet gentleman enough until he had that letter just now  what letter  be careful what you say you rascal for your own head may find its way into the sawdust basket  it was a woman who brought it  i can only tell you what i know he has been talking like a madman ever since  it made my blood run cold to hear him  theres someone whom he swears he will murder  i shall be very glad to see the last of him  now gentlemen said savary drawing his sword we may leave our horses here  there is no window for forty feet so he cannot escape from us  if you will see that your pistols are primed we shall soon bring the fellow to terms  the stair was a narrow winding one made of wood which led to a small loft lighted from a slit in the wall  some remains of wood and a litter of straw showed that this was where toussac had spent his day  there was however no sign of him now and it was evident that he had ascended the next flight of steps we climbed them only to find our way barred by a heavy door  surrender toussac cried savary  it is useless to attempt to escape us  a hoarse laugh sounded from behind the door  i am not a man who surrenders  but i will make a bargain with you i have a small matter of business to do tonight  if you will leave me alone i will give you my solemn pledge to surrender at the camp tomorrow  i have a little debt that i wish to pay  it is only today that i understood to whom i owed it  what you ask is impossible  it would save you a great deal of trouble  we cannot grant such a request  you must surrender  youll have some work first  come come you cannot escape us  put your shoulders against the door now all together  there was the hot flash of a pistol from the keyhole and a bullet smacked against the wall between us  we hurled ourselves against the door  it was massive but rotten with age  with a splintering and rending it gave way before us  we rushed in weapons in hand to find ourselves in an empty room  where the devil has he got to cried savary glaring round him this is the top room of all  there is nothing above it  it was a square empty space with a few cornbags littered about  at the further side was an open window and beside it lay a pistol still smoking from the discharge  we all rushed across and as we craned our heads over a simultaneous cry of astonishment escaped from us  the distance to the ground was so great that no one could have survived the fall but toussac had taken advantage of the presence of that cart full of grainsacks which i have described as having lain close to the mill  this had both shortened the distance and given him an excellent means of breaking the fall  even so however the shock had been tremendous and as we looked out he was lying panting heavily upon the top of the bags  hearing our cry however he looked up shook his fist defiantly and rolling from the cart he sprang on to the back of savarys black horse and galloped off across the downs his great beard flying in the wind untouched by the pistol bullets with which we tried to bring him down  how we flew down those creaking wooden stairs and out through the open door of the mill  quick as we were he had a good start and by the time gerard and i were in the saddle he had become a tiny man upon a small horse galloping up the green slope of the opposite hill the shades of evening too were drawing in and upon his left was the huge saltmarsh where we should have found it difficult to follow him the chances were certainly in his favour  and yet he never swerved from his course but kept straight on across the downs on a line which took him farther and farther from the sea  every instant we feared to see him dart away in the morass but still he held his horses head against the hillside  what could he be making for  he never pulled rein and never glanced round but flew onwards like a man with a definite goal in view  lieutenant gerard and i were lighter men and our mounts were as good as his so that it was not long before we began to gain upon him  if we could only keep him in sight it was certain that we should ride him down but there was always the danger that he might use his knowledge of the country to throw us off his track  as we sank beneath each hill my heart sank also to rise again with renewed hope as we caught sight of him once more galloping in front of us  but at last that which i had feared befell us  we were not more than a couple of hundred paces behind him when we lost all trace of him he had vanished behind some rolling ground and we could see nothing of him when we reached the summit  there is a road there to the left cried gerard whose gascon blood was aflame with excitement  on my friend on let us keep to the left  wait a moment i cried  there is a bridlepath upon the right and it is as likely that he took that  then do you take one and i the other  one moment i hear the sound of hoofs  yes yes it is his horse  a great black horse which was certainly that of general savary had broken out suddenly through a dense tangle of brambles in front of us the saddle was empty  he has found some hidingplace here amongst the brambles i cried  gerard had already sprung from his horse and was leading him through the bushes  i followed his example and in a minute or two we made our way down a winding path into a deep chalk quarry  there is no sign of him cried gerard  he has escaped us  but suddenly i had understood it all  his furious rage which the miller had described to us was caused no doubt by his learning how he came to be betrayed upon the night of his arrival  this sweetheart of his had in some way discovered it and had let him know  his promise to deliver himself up tomorrow was in order to give him time to have his revenge upon my uncle  and now with one idea in his head he had ridden to this chalk quarry   of course it must be the same chalk quarry into which the underground passage of grosbois opened and no doubt during his treasonable meetings with my uncle he had learned the secret  twice i hit upon the wrong spot but at the third trial i gained the face of the cliff made my way between it and the bushes and found the narrow opening which was hardly visible in the gathering darkness  during our search savary had overtaken us on foot so now leaving our horses in the chalkpit my two companions followed me through the narrow entrance tunnel and on into the larger and older passage beyond  we had no lights and it was as black as pitch within so i stumbled forward as best i might feeling my way by keeping one hand upon the side wall and tripping occasionally over the stones which were scattered along the path  it had seemed no very great distance when my uncle had led the way with the light but now what with the darkness and what with the uncertainty and the tension of our feelings it appeared to be a long journey and savarys deep voice at my elbow growled out questions as to how many more miles we were to travel in this moleheap  hush whispered gerard  i hear someone in front of us  we stood listening in breathless silence  then far away through the darkness i heard the sound of a door creaking upon its hinges  on on cried savary eagerly  the rascal is there sure enough this time at least we have got him  but for my part i had my fears  i remembered that my uncle had opened the door which led into the castle by some secret catch  this sound which we had heard seemed to show that toussac had also known how to open it  but suppose that he had closed it behind him  i remembered its size and the iron clampings which bound it together  it was possible that even at the last moment we might find ourselves face to face with an insuperable obstacle  on and on we hurried in the dark and then suddenly i could have raised a shout of joy for there in the distance was a yellow glimmer of light only visible in contrast with the black darkness which lay between  the door was open  in his mad thirst for vengeance toussac had never given a thought to the pursuers at his heels  and now we need no longer grope  it was a race along the passage and up the winding stair through the second door and into the stoneflagged corridor of the castle of grosbois with the oillamp still burning at the end of it  a frightful crya longdrawn scream of terror and of painrang through it as we entered  he is killing him  he is killing him cried a voice and a woman servant rushed madly out into the passage  help help he is killing monsieur bernac  where is he shouted savary  there the library  the door with the green curtain  again that horrible cry rang out dying down to a harsh croaking  it ended in a loud sharp snick as when one cracks ones joint but many times louder  i knew only too well what that dreadful sound portended we rushed together into the room but the hardened savary and the daredevil hussar both recoiled in horror from the sight which met our gaze  my uncle had been seated writing at his desk with his back to the door when his murderer had entered  no doubt it was at the first glance over his shoulder that he had raised the scream when he saw that terrible hairy face coming in upon him while the second cry may have been when those great hands clutched at his head  he had never risen from his chairperhaps he had been too paralysed by fearand he still sat with his back to the door  but what struck the colour from our cheeks was that his head had been turned completely round so that his horribly distorted purple face looked squarely at us from between his shoulders often in my dreams that thin face with the bulging grey eyes and the shockingly open mouth comes to disturb me  beside him stood toussac his face flushed with triumph and his great arms folded across his chest  well my friends said he you are too late you see  i have paid my debts after all  surrender cried savary  shoot away shoot away he cried drumming his hands upon his breast you dont suppose i fear your miserable pellets do you  oh you imagine you will take me alive  ill soon knock that idea out of your heads  in an instant he had swung a heavy chair over his head and was rushing furiously at us  we all fired our pistols into him together but nothing could stop that thunderbolt of a man  with the blood spurting from his wounds he lashed madly out with his chair but his eyesight happily failed him and his swashing blow came down upon the corner of the table with a crash which broke it into fragments  then with a mad bellow of rage he sprang upon savary tore him down to the ground and had his hand upon his chin before gerard and i could seize him by the arms  we were three strong men but he was as strong as all of us put together for again and again he shook himself free and again and again we got our grip upon him once more  but he was losing blood fast every instant his huge strength ebbed away  with a supreme effort he staggered to his feet the three of us hanging on to him like hounds on to a bear  then with a shout of rage and despair which thundered through the whole castle his knees gave way under him and he fell in a huge inert heap upon the floor his black beard bristling up towards the ceiling  we all stood panting round ready to spring upon him if he should move but it was over  he was dead  savary deadly pale was leaning with his hand to his side against the table  it was not for nothing that those mighty arms had been thrown round him  i feel as if i had been hugged by a bear said he  well there is one dangerous man the less in france and the emperor has lost one of his enemies  and yet he was a brave man too  what a soldier he would have made said gerard thoughtfully  what a quartermaster for the hussars of bercheny  he must have been a very foolish person to set his will against that of the emperor  i had seated myself sick and dazed upon the settee for scenes of bloodshed were new to me then and this one had been enough to shock the most hardened  savary gave us all a little cognac from his flask and then tearing down one of the curtains he laid it over the terrible figure of my uncle bernac  we can do nothing here said he  i must get back and report to the emperor as soon as possible  but all these papers of bernacs must be seized for many of them bear upon this and other conspiracies  as he spoke he gathered together a number of documents which were scattered about the tableamong the others a letter which lay before him upon the desk and which he had apparently just finished at the time of toussacs irruption  hullo whats this said savary glancing over it  i fancy that our friend bernac was a dangerous man also  my dear catullei beg of you to send me by the very first mail another phial of the same tasteless essence which you sent three years ago  i mean the almond decoction which leaves no traces  i have particular reasons for wanting it in the course of next week so i implore you not to delay  you may rely upon my interest with the emperor whenever you have occasion to demand it  addressed to a chemist in amiens said savary turning over the letter  a poisoner then on the top of his other virtues  i wonder for whom this essence of almonds which leaves no trace was intended  i wonder said i  after all he was my uncle and he was dead so why should i say further    chapter xvii   the end  general savary rode straight to pont de briques to report to the emperor while gerard returned with me to my lodgings to share a bottle of wine  i had expected to find my cousin sibylle there but to my surprise there was no sign of her nor had she left any word to tell us whither she had gone  it was just after daybreak in the morning when i woke to find an equerry of the emperor with his hand upon my shoulder  the emperor desires to see you monsieur de laval said he  where  at the pont de briques  i knew that promptitude was the first requisite for those who hoped to advance themselves in his service  in ten minutes i was in the saddle and in half an hour i was at the chateau  i was conducted upstairs to a room in which were the emperor and josephine she reclining upon a sofa in a charming dressinggown of pink and lace he striding about in his energetic fashion dressed in the curious costume which he assumed before his official hours had beguna white sleeping suit red turkish slippers and a white bandanna handkerchief tied round his head the whole giving him the appearance of a west indian planter  from the strong smell of eaudecologne i judged that he had just come from his bath  he was in the best of humours and she as usual reflected him so that they were two smiling faces which were turned upon me as i was announced  it was hard to believe that it was this man with the kindly expression and the genial eye who had come like an east wind into the receptionroom the other night and left a trail of wet cheeks and downcast faces wherever he had passed  you have made an excellent debut as aidedecamp said he savary has told me all that has occurred and nothing could have been better arranged  i have not time to think of such things myself but my wife will sleep more soundly now that she knows that this toussac is out of the way  yes yes he was a terrible man cried the empress  so was that georges cadoudal  they were both terrible men  i have my star josephine said napoleon patting her upon the head i see my own career lying before me and i know exactly what i am destined to do  nothing can harm me until my work is accomplished the arabs are believers in fate and the arabs are in the right  then why should you plan napoleon if everything is to be decided by fate  because it is fated that i should plan you little stupid  dont you see that that is part of fate also that i should have a brain which is capable of planning  i am always building behind a scaffolding and no one can see what i am building until i have finished  i never look forward for less than two years and i have been busy all morning monsieur de laval in planning out the events which will occur in the autumn and winter of 1807  by the way that goodlooking cousin of yours appears to have managed this affair very cleverly  she is a very fine girl to be wasted upon such a creature as the lucien lesage who has been screaming for mercy for a week past  do you not think that it is a great pity  i acknowledged that i did  it is always so with womenideologists dreamers carried away by whims and imaginings  they are like the easterns who cannot conceive that a man is a fine soldier unless he has a formidable presence i could not get the egyptians to believe that i was a greater general than kleber because he had the body of a porter and the head of a hairdresser  so it is with this poor creature lesage who will be made a hero by women because he has an oval face and the eyes of a calf do you imagine that if she were to see him in his true colours it would turn her against him  i am convinced of it sire  from the little that i have seen of my cousin i am sure that no one could have a greater contempt for cowardice or for meanness  you speak warmly sir  you are not by chance just a little touched yourself by this fair cousin of yours  sire i have already told you  ta ta ta but she is across the water and many things have happened since then  constant had entered the room  he has been admitted sire  very good  we shall move into the next room  josephine you shall come too for it is your business rather than mine  the room into which we passed was a long narrow one  there were two windows at one side but the curtains had been drawn almost across so that the light was not very good  at the further door was roustem the mameluke and beside him with arms folded and his face sunk downwards in an attitude of shame and contrition there was standing the very man of whom we had been talking  he looked up with scared eyes and started with fear when he saw the emperor approaching him  napoleon stood with legs apart and his hands behind his back and looked at him long and searchingly  well my fine fellow said he at last you have burned your fingers and i do not fancy that you will come near the fire again  or do you perhaps think of continuing with politics as a profession  if your majesty will overlook what i have done lesage stammered i shall faithfully promise you that i will be your most loyal servant until the day of my death  hum said the emperor spilling a pinch of snuff over the front of his white jacket  there is some sense in what you say for no one makes so good a servant as the man who has had a thorough fright  but i am a very exacting master  i do not care what you require of me  everything will be welcome if you will only give me your forgiveness  for example said the emperor  it is one of my whims that when a man enters my service i shall marry him to whom i like  do you agree to that  there was a struggle upon the poets face and he clasped and unclasped his hands  may i ask sire  you may ask nothing  but there are circumstances sire  there there that is enough cried the emperor harshly turning upon his heel  i do not argue i order  there is a young lady mademoiselle de bergerot for whom i desire a husband  will you marry her or will you return to prison  again there was the struggle in the mans face and he was silent twitching and writhing in his indecision  it is enough cried the emperor  roustem call the guard  no no sire do not send me back to prison  the guard roustem  i will do it sire  i will do it  i will marry whomever you please  you villain cried a voice and there was sibylle standing in the opening of the curtains at one of the windows  her face was pale with anger and her eyes shining with scorn the parting curtains framed her tall slim figure which leaned forwards in her fury of passion she had forgotten the emperor the empress everything in her revulsion of feeling against this craven whom she had loved  they told me what you were she cried  i would not believe them i could not believe themfor i did not know that there was upon this earth a thing so contemptible  they said that they would prove it and i defied them to do so and now i see you as you are  thank god that i have found you out in time  and to think that for your sake i have brought about the death of a man who was worth a hundred of you  oh i am rightly punished for an unwomanly act  toussac has had his revenge  enough said the emperor sternly  constant lead mademoiselle bernac into the next room  as to you sir i do not think that i can condemn any lady of my court to take such a man as a husband  suffice it that you have been shown in your true colours and that mademoiselle bernac has been cured of a foolish infatuation  roustem remove the prisoner  there monsieur de laval said the emperor when the wretched lesage had been conducted from the room  we have not done such a bad piece of work between the coffee and the breakfast  it was your idea josephine and i give you credit for it  but now de laval i feel that we owe you some recompense for having set the young aristocrats a good example and for having had a share in this toussac business  you have certainly acted very well  i ask no recompense sire said i with an uneasy sense of what was coming  it is your modesty that speaks  but i have already decided upon your reward  you shall have such an allowance as will permit you to keep up a proper appearance as my aidedecamp and i have determined to marry you suitably to one of the ladiesinwaiting of the empress my heart turned to lead within me  but sire i stammered this is impossible  oh you have no occasion to hesitate  the lady is of excellent family and she is not wanting in personal charm  in a word the affair is settled and the marriage takes place upon thursday  but it is impossible sire i repeated  impossible  when you have been longer in my service sir you will understand that that is a word which i do not tolerate  i tell you that it is settled  my love is given to another sire  it is not possible for me to change  indeed said the emperor coldly  if you persist in such a resolution you cannot expect to retain your place in my household  here was the whole structure which my ambition had planned out crumbling hopelessly about my ears  and yet what was there for me to do  it is the bitterest moment of my life sire said i and yet i must be true to the promise which i have given  if i have to be a beggar by the roadside i shall none the less marry eugenie de choiseul or no one  the empress had risen and had approached the window  well at least before you make up your mind monsieur de laval said she i should certainly take a look at this ladyinwaiting of mine whom you refuse with such indignation  with a quick rasping of rings she drew back the curtain of the second window  a woman was standing in the recess  she took a step forward into the room and thenand then with a cry and a spring my arms were round her and hers round me and i was standing like a man in a dream looking down into the sweet laughing eyes of my eugenie  it was not until i had kissed her and kissed her again upon her lips her cheeks her hair that i could persuade myself that she was indeed really there  let us leave them said the voice of the empress behind me  come napoleon  it makes me sad  it reminds me too much of the old days in the rue chautereine  so there is an end of my little romance for the emperors plans were as usual carried out and we were married upon the thursday as he had said  that long and allpowerful arm had plucked her out from the kentish town and had brought her across the channel in order to make sure of my allegiance and to strengthen the court by the presence of a de choiseul  as to my cousin sibylle it shall be written some day how she married the gallant lieutenant gerard many years afterwards when he had become the chief of a brigade and one of the most noted cavalry leaders in all the armies of france  some day also i may tell how i came back into my rightful inheritance of grosbois which is still darkened to me by the thought of that terrible uncle of mine and of what happened that night when toussac stood at bay in the library but enough of me and of my small fortunes  you have already heard more of them perhaps than you care for  as to the emperor some faint shadow of whom i have tried in these pages to raise before you you have heard from history how despairing of gaining command of the channel and fearing to attempt an invasion which might be cut off from behind he abandoned the camp of boulogne you have heard also how with this very army which was meant for england he struck down austria and russia in one year and prussia in the next  from the day that i entered his service until that on which he sailed forth over the atlantic never to return i have faithfully shared his fortunes rising with his star and sinking with it also and yet as i look back at my old master i find it very difficult to say if he was a very good man or a very bad one  i only know that he was a very great one and that the things in which he dealt were also so great that it is impossible to judge him by any ordinary standard let him rest silently then in his great red tomb at the invalides for the workmans work is done and the mighty hand which moulded france and traced the lines of modern europe has crumbled into dust  the fates have used him and the fates have thrown him away but still it lives the memory of the little man in the grey coat and still it moves the thoughts and actions of men  some have written to praise and some to blame but for my own part i have tried to do neither one nor the other but only to tell the impression which he made upon me in those faroff days when the army of england lay at boulogne and i came back once more to my castle of grosbois   the end
