fsa joan of arc john ohagan joan of arc   janet tuckey joan of arc the maid    translators preface  to arrive at a just estimate of a renowned mans character one must judge it by the standards of his time not ours judged by the standards of one century the noblest characters of an earlier one lose much of their luster judged by the standards of today there is probably no illustrious man of four or five centuries ago whose character could meet the test at all points but the character of joan of arc is unique it can be measured by the standards of all times without misgiving or apprehension as to the result judged by any of them it is still flawless it is still ideally perfect it still occupies the loftiest place possible to human attainment a loftier one than has been reached by any other mere mortal  when we reflect that her century was the brutalest the wickedest the rottenest in history since the darkest ages we are lost in wonder at the miracle of such a product from such a soil the contrast between her and her century is the contrast between day and night she was truthful when lying was the common speech of men she was honest when honesty was become a lost virtue she was a keeper of promises when the keeping of a promise was expected of no one she gave her great mind to great thoughts and great purposes when other great minds wasted themselves upon pretty fancies or upon poor ambitions she was modest and fine and delicate when to be loud and coarse might be said to be universal she was full of pity when a merciless cruelty was the rule she was steadfast when stability was unknown and honorable in an age which had forgotten what honor was she was a rock of convictions in a time when men believed in nothing and scoffed at all things she was unfailingly true to an age that was false to the core she maintained her personal dignity unimpaired in an age of fawnings and servilities she was of a dauntless courage when hope and courage had perished in the hearts of her nation she was spotlessly pure in mind and body when society in the highest places was foul in bothshe was all these things in an age when crime was the common business of lords and princes and when the highest personages in christendom were able to astonish even that infamous era and make it stand aghast at the spectacle of their atrocious lives black with unimaginable treacheries butcheries and beastialities  she was perhaps the only entirely unselfish person whose name has a place in profane history no vestige or suggestion of selfseeking can be found in any word or deed of hers when she had rescued her king from his vagabondage and set his crown upon his head she was offered rewards and honors but she refused them all and would take nothing all she would take for herselfif the king would grant itwas leave to go back to her village home and tend her sheep again and feel her mothers arms about her and be her housemaid and helper the selfishness of this unspoiled general of victorious armies companion of princes and idol of an applauding and grateful nation reached but that far and no farther  the work wrought by joan of arc may fairly be regarded as ranking any recorded in history when one considers the conditions under which it was undertaken the obstacles in the way and the means at her disposal caesar carried conquests far but he did it with the trained and confident veterans of rome and was a trained soldier himself and napoleon swept away the disciplined armies of europe but he also was a trained soldier and he began his work with patriot battalions inflamed and inspired by the miracleworking new breath of liberty breathed upon them by the revolutioneager young apprentices to the splendid trade of war not old and broken menatarms despairing survivors of an agelong accumulation of monotonous defeats but joan of arc a mere child in years ignorant unlettered a poor village girl unknown and without influence found a great nation lying in chains helpless and hopeless under an alien domination its treasury bankrupt its soldiers disheartened and dispersed all spirit torpid all courage dead in the hearts of the people through long years of foreign and domestic outrage and oppression their king cowed resigned to its fate and preparing to fly the country and she laid her hand upon this nation this corpse and it rose and followed her she led it from victory to victory she turned back the tide of the hundred years war she fatally crippled the english power and died with the earned title of deliverer of france which she bears to this day  and for all reward the french king whom she had crowned stood supine and indifferent while french priests took the noble child the most innocent the most lovely the most adorable the ages have produced and burned her alive at the stake      a peculiarity of joan of arcs history  the details of the life of joan of arc form a biography which is unique among the worlds biographies in one respect it is the only story of a human life which comes to us under oath the only one which comes to us from the witnessstand the official records of the great trial of 1431 and of the process of rehabilitation of a quarter of a century later are still preserved in the national archives of france and they furnish with remarkable fullness the facts of her life the history of no other life of that remote time is known with either the certainty or the comprehensiveness that attaches to hers  the sieur louis de conte is faithful to her official history in his personal recollections and thus far his trustworthiness is unimpeachable but his mass of added particulars must depend for credit upon his word alone  the translator    the sieur louis de conte  to his greatgreatgrand nephews and nieces  this is the year 1492 i am eightytwo years of age the things i am going to tell you are things which i saw myself as a child and as a youth  in all the tales and songs and histories of joan of arc which you and the rest of the world read and sing and study in the books wrought in the late invented art of printing mention is made of me the sieur louis de contei was her page and secretary i was with her from the beginning until the end  i was reared in the same village with her i played with her every day when we were little children together just as you play with your mates now that we perceive how great she was now that her name fills the whole world it seems strange that what i am saying is true for it is as if a perishable paltry candle should speak of the eternal sun riding in the heavens and say he was gossip and housemate to me when we were candles together and yet it is true just as i say i was her playmate and i fought at her side in the wars to this day i carry in my mind fine and clear the picture of that dear little figure with breast bent to the flying horses neck charging at the head of the armies of france her hair streaming back her silver mail plowing steadily deeper and deeper into the thick of the battle sometimes nearly drowned from sight by tossing heads of horses uplifted swordarms windblow plumes and intercepting shields i was with her to the end and when that black day came whose accusing shadow will lie always upon the memory of the mitered french slaves of england who were her assassins and upon france who stood idle and essayed no rescue my hand was the last she touched in life  as the years and the decades drifted by and the spectacle of the marvelous childs meteor flight across the war firmament of france and its extinction in the smokeclouds of the stake receded deeper and deeper into the past and grew ever more strange and wonderful and divine and pathetic i came to comprehend and recognize her at last for what she wasthe most noble life that was ever born into this world save only one      book i in domremy    chapter 1 when wolves ran free in paris  i the sieur louis de conte was born in neufchateau on the 6th of january 1410 that is to say exactly two years before joan of arc was born in domremy my family had fled to those distant regions from the neighborhood of paris in the first years of the century in politics they were armagnacspatriots they were for our own french king crazy and impotent as he was the burgundian party who were for the english had stripped them and done it well they took everything but my fathers small nobility and when he reached neufchateau he reached it in poverty and with a broken spirit but the political atmosphere there was the sort he liked and that was something he came to a region of comparative quiet he left behind him a region peopled with furies madmen devils where slaughter was a daily pastime and no mans life safe for a moment in paris mobs roared through the streets nightly sacking burning killing unmolested uninterrupted the sun rose upon wrecked and smoking buildings and upon mutilated corpses lying here there and yonder about the streets just as they fell and stripped naked by thieves the unholy gleaners after the mob none had the courage to gather these dead for burial they were left there to rot and create plagues  and plagues they did create epidemics swept away the people like flies and the burials were conducted secretly and by night for public funerals were not allowed lest the revelation of the magnitude of the plagues work unman the people and plunge them into despair then came finally the bitterest winter which had visited france in five hundred years famine pestilence slaughter ice snowparis had all these at once the dead lay in heaps about the streets and wolves entered the city in daylight and devoured them  ah france had fallen lowso low for more than three quarters of a century the english fangs had been bedded in her flesh and so cowed had her armies become by ceaseless rout and defeat that it was said and accepted that the mere sight of an english army was sufficient to put a french one to flight  when i was five years old the prodigious disaster of agincourt fell upon france and although the english king went home to enjoy his glory he left the country prostrate and a prey to roving bands of free companions in the service of the burgundian party and one of these bands came raiding through neufchateau one night and by the light of our burning roofthatch i saw all that were dear to me in this world save an elder brother your ancestor left behind with the court butchered while they begged for mercy and heard the butchers laugh at their prayers and mimic their pleadings i was overlooked and escaped without hurt when the savages were gone i crept out and cried the night away watching the burning houses and i was all alone except for the company of the dead and the wounded for the rest had taken flight and hidden themselves  i was sent to domremy to the priest whose housekeeper became a loving mother to me the priest in the course of time taught me to read and write and he and i were the only persons in the village who possessed this learning  at the time that the house of this good priest guillaume fronte became my home i was six years old we lived close by the village church and the small garden of joans parents was behind the church as to that family there were jacques darc the father his wife isabel romee three sonsjacques ten years old pierre eight and jean seven joan four and her baby sister catherine about a year old i had these children for playmates from the beginning i had some other playmates besidesparticularly four boys pierre morel etienne roze noel rainguesson and edmond aubrey whose father was maire at that time also two girls about joans age who by and by became her favorites one was named haumetter the other was called little mengette these girls were common peasant children like joan herself when they grew up both married common laborers their estate was lowly enough you see yet a time came many years after when no passing stranger howsoever great he might be failed to go and pay his reverence to those two humble old women who had been honored in their youth by the friendship of joan of arc  these were all good children just of the ordinary peasant type not bright of courseyou would not expect thatbut goodhearted and companionable obedient to their parents and the priest and as they grew up they became properly stocked with narrowness and prejudices got at second hand from their elders and adopted without reserve and without examination alsowhich goes without saying their religion was inherited their politics the same john huss and his sort might find fault with the church in domremy it disturbed nobodys faith and when the split came when i was fourteen and we had three popes at once nobody in domremy was worried about how to choose among themthe pope of rome was the right one a pope outside of rome was no pope at all every human creature in the village was an armagnaca patriotand if we children hotly hated nothing else in the world we did certainly hate the english and burgundian name and polity in that way      chapter 2 the fairy tree of domremy  our domremy was like any other humble little hamlet of that remote time and region it was a maze of crooked narrow lanes and alleys shaded and sheltered by the overhanging thatch roofs of the barnlike houses the houses were dimly lighted by woodenshuttered windowsthat is holes in the walls which served for windows the floors were dirt and there was very little furniture sheep and cattle grazing was the main industry all the young folks tended flocks  the situation was beautiful from one edge of the village a flowery plain extended in a wide sweep to the riverthe meuse from the rear edge of the village a grassy slope rose gradually and at the top was the great oak foresta forest that was deep and gloomy and dense and full of interest for us children for many murders had been done in it by outlaws in old times and in still earlier times prodigious dragons that spouted fire and poisonous vapors from their nostrils had their homes in there in fact one was still living in there in our own time it was as long as a tree and had a body as big around as a tierce and scales like overlapping great tiles and deep ruby eyes as large as a cavaliers hat and an anchorfluke on its tail as big as i dont know what but very big even unusually so for a dragon as everybody said who knew about dragons it was thought that this dragon was of a brilliant blue color with gold mottlings but no one had ever seen it therefore this was not known to be so it was only an opinion it was not my opinion i think there is no sense in forming an opinion when there is no evidence to form it on if you build a person without any bones in him he may look fair enough to the eye but he will be limber and cannot stand up and i consider that evidence is the bones of an opinion but i will take up this matter more at large at another time and try to make the justness of my position appear as to that dragon i always held the belief that its color was gold and without blue for that has always been the color of dragons that this dragon lay but a little way within the wood at one time is shown by the fact that pierre morel was in there one day and smelt it and recognized it by the smell it gives one a horrid idea of how near to us the deadliest danger can be and we not suspect it  in the earliest times a hundred knights from many remote places in the earth would have gone in there one after another to kill the dragon and get the reward but in our time that method had gone out and the priest had become the one that abolished dragons pere guillaume fronte did it in this case he had a procession with candles and incense and banners and marched around the edge of the wood and exorcised the dragon and it was never heard of again although it was the opinion of many that the smell never wholly passed away not that any had ever smelt the smell again for none had it was only an opinion like that otherand lacked bones you see i know that the creature was there before the exorcism but whether it was there afterward or not is a thing which i cannot be so positive about  in a noble open space carpeted with grass on the high ground toward vaucouleurs stood a most majestic beech tree with widereaching arms and a grand spread of shade and by it a limpid spring of cold water and on summer days the children went thereoh every summer for more than five hundred yearswent there and sang and danced around the tree for hours together refreshing themselves at the spring from time to time and it was most lovely and enjoyable also they made wreaths of flowers and hung them upon the tree and about the spring to please the fairies that lived there for they liked that being idle innocent little creatures as all fairies are and fond of anything delicate and pretty like wild flowers put together in that way and in return for this attention the fairies did any friendly thing they could for the children such as keeping the spring always full and clear and cold and driving away serpents and insects that sting and so there was never any unkindness between the fairies and the children during more than five hundred yearstradition said a thousandbut only the warmest affection and the most perfect trust and confidence and whenever a child died the fairies mourned just as that childs playmates did and the sign of it was there to see for before the dawn on the day of the funeral they hung a little immortelle over the place where that child was used to sit under the tree i know this to be true by my own eyes it is not hearsay and the reason it was known that the fairies did it was thisthat it was made all of black flowers of a sort not known in france anywhere  now from time immemorial all children reared in domremy were called the children of the tree and they loved that name for it carried with it a mystic privilege not granted to any others of the children of this world which was this whenever one of these came to die then beyond the vague and formless images drifting through his darkening mind rose soft and rich and fair a vision of the treeif all was well with his soul that was what some said others said the vision came in two ways once as a warning one or two years in advance of death when the soul was the captive of sin and then the tree appeared in its desolate winter aspectthen that soul was smitten with an awful fear if repentance came and purity of life the vision came again this time summerclad and beautiful but if it were otherwise with that soul the vision was withheld and it passed from life knowing its doom still others said that the vision came but once and then only to the sinless dying forlorn in distant lands and pitifully longing for some last dear reminder of their home and what reminder of it could go to their hearts like the picture of the tree that was the darling of their love and the comrade of their joys and comforter of their small griefs all through the divine days of their vanished youth  now the several traditions were as i have said some believing one and some another one of them i knew to be the truth and that was the last one i do not say anything against the others i think they were true but i only know that the last one was and it is my thought that if one keep to the things he knows and not trouble about the things which he cannot be sure about he will have the steadier mind for itand there is profit in that i know that when the children of the tree die in a far land thenif they be at peace with godthey turn their longing eyes toward home and there farshining as through a rift in a cloud that curtains heaven they see the soft picture of the fairy tree clothed in a dream of golden light and they see the bloomy mead sloping away to the river and to their perishing nostrils is blown faint and sweet the fragrance of the flowers of home and then the vision fades and passesbut they know they know and by their transfigured faces you know also you who stand looking on yes you know the message that has come and that it has come from heaven  joan and i believed alike about this matter but pierre morel and jacques darc and many others believed that the vision appeared twiceto a sinner in fact they and many others said they knew it probably because their fathers had known it and had told them for one gets most things at second hand in this world  now one thing that does make it quite likely that there were really two apparitions of the tree is this fact from the most ancient times if one saw a villager of ours with his face ashwhite and rigid with a ghastly fright it was common for every one to whisper to his neighbor ah he is in sin and has got his warning and the neighbor would shudder at the thought and whisper back yes poor soul he has seen the tree  such evidences as these have their weight they are not to be put aside with a wave of the hand a thing that is backed by the cumulative evidence of centuries naturally gets nearer and nearer to being proof all the time and if this continue and continue it will some day become authorityand authority is a bedded rock and will abide  in my long life i have seen several cases where the tree appeared announcing a death which was still far away but in none of these was the person in a state of sin no the apparition was in these cases only a special grace in place of deferring the tidings of that souls redemption till the day of death the apparition brought them long before and with them peacepeace that might no more be disturbedthe eternal peace of god i myself old and broken wait with serenity for i have seen the vision of the tree i have seen it and am content  always from the remotest times when the children joined hands and danced around the fairy tree they sang a song which was the trees song the song of larbre fee de bourlemont they sang it to a quaint sweet aira solacing sweet air which has gone murmuring through my dreaming spirit all my life when i was weary and troubled resting me and carrying me through night and distance home again no stranger can know or feel what that song has been through the drifting centuries to exiled children of the tree homeless and heavy of heart in countries foreign to their speech and ways you will think it a simple thing that song and poor perchance but if you will remember what it was to us and what it brought before our eyes when it floated through our memories then you will respect it and you will understand how the water wells up in our eyes and makes all things dim and our voices break and we cannot sing the last lines  and when in exile wandring we shall fainting yearn for glimpse of thee oh rise upon our sight  and you will remember that joan of arc sang this song with us around the tree when she was a little child and always loved it and that hallows it yes you will grant that        larbre fee de bourlemont       song of the children       now what has kept your leaves so green      arbre fee de bourlemont       the childrens tears they brought each grief      and you did comfort them and cheer      their bruised hearts and steal a tear      that healed rose a leaf       and what has built you up so strong      arbre fee de bourlemont       the childrens love theyve loved you long      ten hundred years in sooth      theyve nourished you with praise and song      and warmed your heart and kept it young      a thousand years of youth       bide always green in our young hearts      arbre fee de bourlemont      and we shall always youthful be      not heeding time his flight      and when in exile wandring we      shall fainting yearn for glimpse of thee      oh rise upon our sight   the fairies were still there when we were children but we never saw them because a hundred years before that the priest of domremy had held a religious function under the tree and denounced them as being bloodkin to the fiend and barred them from redemption and then he warned them never to show themselves again nor hang any more immortelles on pain of perpetual banishment from that parish  all the children pleaded for the fairies and said they were their good friends and dear to them and never did them any harm but the priest would not listen and said it was sin and shame to have such friends the children mourned and could not be comforted and they made an agreement among themselves that they would always continue to hang flowerwreaths on the tree as a perpetual sign to the fairies that they were still loved and remembered though lost to sight  but late one night a great misfortune befell edmond aubreys mother passed by the tree and the fairies were stealing a dance not thinking anybody was by and they were so busy and so intoxicated with the wild happiness of it and with the bumpers of dew sharpened up with honey which they had been drinking that they noticed nothing so dame aubrey stood there astonished and admiring and saw the little fantastic atoms holding hands as many as three hundred of them tearing around in a great ring half as big as an ordinary bedroom and leaning away back and spreading their mouths with laughter and song which she could hear quite distinctly and kicking their legs up as much as three inches from the ground in perfect abandon and hilarityoh the very maddest and witchingest dance the woman ever saw  but in about a minute or two minutes the poor little ruined creatures discovered her they burst out in one heartbreaking squeak of grief and terror and fled every which way with their wee hazelnut fists in their eyes and crying and so disappeared  the heartless womanno the foolish woman she was not heartless but only thoughtlesswent straight home and told the neighbors all about it whilst we the small friends of the fairies were asleep and not witting the calamity that was come upon us and all unconscious that we ought to be up and trying to stop these fatal tongues in the morning everybody knew and the disaster was complete for where everybody knows a thing the priest knows it of course we all flocked to pere fronte crying and beggingand he had to cry too seeing our sorrow for he had a most kind and gentle nature and he did not want to banish the fairies and said so but said he had no choice for it had been decreed that if they ever revealed themselves to man again they must go this all happened at the worst time possible for joan of arc was ill of a fever and out of her head and what could we do who had not her gifts of reasoning and persuasion we flew in a swarm to her bed and cried out joan wake wake there is no moment to lose come and plead for the fairiescome and save them only you can do it  but her mind was wandering she did not know what we said nor what we meant so we went away knowing all was lost yes all was lost forever lost the faithful friends of the children for five hundred years must go and never come back any more  it was a bitter day for us that day that pere fronte held the function under the tree and banished the fairies we could not wear mourning that any could have noticed it would not have been allowed so we had to be content with some poor small rag of black tied upon our garments where it made no show but in our hearts we wore mourning big and noble and occupying all the room for our hearts were ours they could not get at them to prevent that  the great treelarbre fee de bourlemont was its beautiful namewas never afterward quite as much to us as it had been before but it was always dear is dear to me yet when i go there now once a year in my old age to sit under it and bring back the lost playmates of my youth and group them about me and look upon their faces through my tears and break my heart oh my god no the place was not quite the same afterward in one or two ways it could not be for the fairies protection being gone the spring lost much of its freshness and coldness and more than twothirds of its volume and the banished serpents and stinging insects returned and multiplied and became a torment and have remained so to this day  when that wise little child joan got well we realized how much her illness had cost us for we found that we had been right in believing she could save the fairies she burst into a great storm of anger for so little a creature and went straight to pere fronte and stood up before him where he sat and made reverence and said  the fairies were to go if they showed themselves to people again is it not so  yes that was it dear  if a man comes prying into a persons room at midnight when that person is halfnaked will you be so unjust as to say that that person is showing himself to that man  wellno the good priest looked a little troubled and uneasy when he said it  is a sin a sin anyway even if one did not intend to commit it  pere fronte threw up his hands and cried out  oh my poor little child i see all my fault and he drew her to his side and put an arm around her and tried to make his peace with her but her temper was up so high that she could not get it down right away but buried her head against his breast and broke out crying and said  then the fairies committed no sin for there was no intention to commit one they not knowing that any one was by and because they were little creatures and could not speak for themselves and say the law was against the intention not against the innocent act because they had no friend to think that simple thing for them and say it they have been sent away from their home forever and it was wrong wrong to do it  the good father hugged her yet closer to his side and said  oh out of the mouths of babes and sucklings the heedless and unthinking are condemned would god i could bring the little creatures back for your sake and mine yes and mine for i have been unjust there there dont crynobody could be sorrier than your poor old frienddont cry dear  but i cant stop right away ive got to and it is no little matter this thing that you have done is being sorry penance enough for such an act  pere fronte turned away his face for it would have hurt her to see him laugh and said  oh thou remorseless but most just accuser no it is not i will put on sackcloth and ashes thereare you satisfied  joans sobs began to diminish and she presently looked up at the old man through her tears and said in her simple way  yes that will doif it will clear you  pere fronte would have been moved to laugh again perhaps if he had not remembered in time that he had made a contract and not a very agreeable one it must be fulfilled so he got up and went to the fireplace joan watching him with deep interest and took a shovelful of cold ashes and was going to empty them on his old gray head when a better idea came to him and he said  would you mind helping me dear  how father  he got down on his knees and bent his head low and said  take the ashes and put them on my head for me  the matter ended there of course the victory was with the priest one can imagine how the idea of such a profanation would strike joan or any other child in the village she ran and dropped upon her knees by his side and said  oh it is dreadful i didnt know that that was what one meant by sackcloth and ashesdo please get up father  but i cant until i am forgiven do you forgive me  i oh you have done nothing to me father it is yourself that must forgive yourself for wronging those poor things please get up father wont you  but i am worse off now than i was before i thought i was earning your forgiveness but if it is my own i cant be lenient it would not become me now what can i do find me some way out of this with your wise little head  the pere would not stir for all joans pleadings she was about to cry again then she had an idea and seized the shovel and deluged her own head with the ashes stammering out through her chokings and suffocations  therenow it is done oh please get up father  the old man both touched and amused gathered her to his breast and said  oh you incomparable child its a humble martyrdom and not of a sort presentable in a picture but the right and true spirit is in it that i testify  then he brushed the ashes out of her hair and helped her scour her face and neck and properly tidy herself up he was in fine spirits now and ready for further argument so he took his seat and drew joan to his side again and said  joan you were used to make wreaths there at the fairy tree with the other children is it not so  that was the way he always started out when he was going to corner me up and catch me in somethingjust that gentle indifferent way that fools a person so and leads him into the trap he never noticing which way he is traveling until he is in and the door shut on him he enjoyed that i knew he was going to drop corn along in front of joan now joan answered  yes father  did you hang them on the tree  no father  didnt hang them there  no  why didnt you  iwell i didnt wish to  didnt wish to  no father  what did you do with them  i hung them in the church  why didnt you want to hang them in the tree  because it was said that the fairies were of kin to the fiend and that it was sinful to show them honor  did you believe it was wrong to honor them so  yes i thought it must be wrong  then if it was wrong to honor them in that way and if they were of kin to the fiend they could be dangerous company for you and the other children couldnt they  i suppose soyes i think so  he studied a minute and i judged he was going to spring his trap and he did he said  then the matter stands like this they were banned creatures of fearful origin they could be dangerous company for the children now give me a rational reason dear if you can think of any why you call it a wrong to drive them into banishment and why you would have saved them from it in a word what loss have you suffered by it  how stupid of him to go and throw his case away like that i could have boxed his ears for vexation if he had been a boy he was going along all right until he ruined everything by winding up in that foolish and fatal way what had she lost by it was he never going to find out what kind of a child joan of arc was was he never going to learn that things which merely concerned her own gain or loss she cared nothing about could he never get the simple fact into his head that the sure way and the only way to rouse her up and set her on fire was to show her where some other person was going to suffer wrong or hurt or loss why he had gone and set a trap for himselfthat was all he had accomplished  the minute those words were out of his mouth her temper was up the indignant tears rose in her eyes and she burst out on him with an energy and passion which astonished him but didnt astonish me for i knew he had fired a mine when he touched off his illchosen climax  oh father how can you talk like that who owns france  god and the king  not satan  satan my child this is the footstool of the most highsatan owns no handful of its soil  then who gave those poor creatures their home god who protected them in it all those centuries god who allowed them to dance and play there all those centuries and found no fault with it god who disapproved of gods approval and put a threat upon them a man who caught them again in harmless sports that god allowed and a man forbade and carried out that threat and drove the poor things away from the home the good god gave them in his mercy and his pity and sent down his rain and dew and sunshine upon it five hundred years in token of his peace it was their hometheirs by the grace of god and his good heart and no man had a right to rob them of it and they were the gentlest truest friends that children ever had and did them sweet and loving service all these five long centuries and never any hurt or harm and the children loved them and now they mourn for them and there is no healing for their grief and what had the children done that they should suffer this cruel stroke the poor fairies could have been dangerous company for the children yes but never had been and could is no argument kinsmen of the fiend what of it kinsmen of the fiend have rights and these had and children have rights and these had and if i had been there i would have spokeni would have begged for the children and the fiends and stayed your hand and saved them all but nowoh now all is lost everything is lost and there is no help more  then she finished with a blast at that idea that fairy kinsmen of the fiend ought to be shunned and denied human sympathy and friendship because salvation was barred against them she said that for that very reason people ought to pity them and do every humane and loving thing they could to make them forget the hard fate that had been put upon them by accident of birth and no fault of their own poor little creatures she said what can a persons heart be made of that can pity a christians child and yet cant pity a devils child that a thousand times more needs it  she had torn loose from pere fronte and was crying with her knuckles in her eyes and stamping her small feet in a fury and now she burst out of the place and was gone before we could gather our senses together out of this storm of words and this whirlwind of passion  the pere had got upon his feet toward the last and now he stood there passing his hand back and forth across his forehead like a person who is dazed and troubled then he turned and wandered toward the door of his little workroom and as he passed through it i heard him murmur sorrowfully  ah me poor children poor fiends they have rights and she said truei never thought of that god forgive me i am to blame  when i heard that i knew i was right in the thought that he had set a trap for himself it was so and he had walked into it you see i seemed to feel encouraged and wondered if mayhap i might get him into one but upon reflection my heart went down for this was not my gift      chapter 3 all aflame with love of france  speaking of this matter reminds me of many incidents many things that i could tell but i think i will not try to do it now it will be more to my present humor to call back a little glimpse of the simple and colorless good times we used to have in our village homes in those peaceful daysespecially in the winter in the summer we children were out on the breezy uplands with the flocks from dawn till night and then there was noisy frolicking and all that but winter was the cozy time winter was the snug time often we gathered in old jacques darcs big dirtfloored apartment with a great fire going and played games and sang songs and told fortunes and listened to the old villagers tell tales and histories and lies and one thing and another till twelve oclock at night  one winters night we were gathered thereit was the winter that for years afterward they called the hard winterand that particular night was a sharp one it blew a gale outside and the screaming of the wind was a stirring sound and i think i may say it was beautiful for i think it is great and fine and beautiful to hear the wind rage and storm and blow its clarions like that when you are inside and comfortable and we were we had a roaring fire and the pleasant spitspit of the snow and sleet falling in it down the chimney and the yarning and laughing and singing went on at a noble rate till about ten oclock and then we had a supper of hot porridge and beans and meal cakes with butter and appetites to match  little joan sat on a box apart and had her bowl and bread on another one and her pets around her helping she had more than was usual of them or economical because all the outcast cats came and took up with her and homeless or unlovable animals of other kinds heard about it and came and these spread the matter to the other creatures and they came also and as the birds and the other timid wild things of the woods were not afraid of her but always had an idea she was a friend when they came across her and generally struck up an acquaintance with her to get invited to the house she always had samples of those breeds in stock she was hospitable to them all for an animal was an animal to her and dear by mere reason of being an animal no matter about its sort or social station and as she would allow of no cages no collars no fetters but left the creatures free to come and go as they liked that contented them and they came but they didnt go to any extent and so they were a marvelous nuisance and made jacques darc swear a good deal but his wife said god gave the child the instinct and knew what he was doing when he did it therefore it must have its course it would be no sound prudence to meddle with his affairs when no invitation had been extended so the pets were left in peace and here they were as i have said rabbits birds squirrels cats and other reptiles all around the child and full of interest in her supper and helping what they could there was a very small squirrel on her shoulder sitting up as those creatures do and turning a rocky fragment of prehistoric chestnutcake over and over in its knotty hands and hunting for the less indurated places and giving its elevated bushy tail a flirt and its pointed ears a toss when it found onesignifying thankfulness and surpriseand then it filed that place off with those two slender front teeth which a squirrel carries for that purpose and not for ornament for ornamental they never could be as any will admit that have noticed them  everything was going fine and breezy and hilarious but then there came an interruption for somebody hammered on the door it was one of those ragged roadstragglersthe eternal wars kept the country full of them he came in all over snow and stamped his feet and shook and brushed himself and shut the door and took off his limp ruin of a hat and slapped it once or twice against his leg to knock off its fleece of snow and then glanced around on the company with a pleased look upon his thin face and a most yearning and famished one in his eye when it fell upon the victuals and then he gave us a humble and conciliatory salutation and said it was a blessed thing to have a fire like that on such a night and a roof overhead like this and that rich food to eat and loving friends to talk withah yes this was true and god help the homeless and such as must trudge the roads in this weather  nobody said anything the embarrassed poor creature stood there and appealed to one face after the other with his eyes and found no welcome in any the smile on his own face flickering and fading and perishing meanwhile then he dropped his gaze the muscles of his face began to twitch and he put up his hand to cover this womanish sign of weakness  sit down  this thunderblast was from old jacques darc and joan was the object of it the stranger was startled and took his hand away and there was joan standing before him offering him her bowl of porridge the man said  god almighty bless you my darling and then the tears came and ran down his cheeks but he was afraid to take the bowl  do you hear me sit down i say  there could not be a child more easy to persuade than joan but this was not the way her father had not the art neither could he learn it joan said  father he is hungry i can see it  let him work for food then we are being eaten out of house and home by his like and i have said i would endure it no more and will keep my word he has the face of a rascal anyhow and a villain sit down i tell you  i know not if he is a rascal or no but he is hungry father and shall have my porridgei do not need it  if you dont obey me illrascals are not entitled to help from honest people and no bite nor sup shall they have in this house joan  she set her bowl down on the box and came over and stood before her scowling father and said  father if you will not let me then it must be as you say but i would that you would thinkthen you would see that it is not right to punish one part of him for what the other part has done for it is that poor strangers head that does the evil things but it is not his head that is hungry it is his stomach and it has done no harm to anybody but is without blame and innocent not having any way to do a wrong even if it was minded to it please let  what an idea it is the most idiotic speech i ever heard  but aubrey the maire broke in he being fond of an argument and having a pretty gift in that regard as all acknowledged rising in his place and leaning his knuckles upon the table and looking about him with easy dignity after the manner of such as be orators he began smooth and persuasive  i will differ with you there gossip and will undertake to show the companyhere he looked around upon us and nodded his head in a confident waythat there is a grain of sense in what the child has said for look you it is of a certainty most true and demonstrable that it is a mans head that is master and supreme ruler over his whole body is that granted will any deny it he glanced around again everybody indicated assent very well then that being the case no part of the body is responsible for the result when it carries out an order delivered to it by the head ergo the head is alone responsible for crimes done by a mans hands or feet or stomachdo you get the idea am i right thus far everybody said yes and said it with enthusiasm and some said one to another that the maire was in great form tonight and at his very bestwhich pleased the maire exceedingly and made his eyes sparkle with pleasure for he overheard these things so he went on in the same fertile and brilliant way now then we will consider what the term responsibility means and how it affects the case in point responsibility makes a man responsible for only those things for which he is properly responsibleand he waved his spoon around in a wide sweep to indicate the comprehensive nature of that class of responsibilities which render people responsible and several exclaimed admiringly he is righthe has put that whole tangled thing into a nutshellit is wonderful after a little pause to give the interest opportunity to gather and grow he went on very good let us suppose the case of a pair of tongs that falls upon a mans foot causing a cruel hurt will you claim that the tongs are punishable for that the question is answered i see by your faces that you would call such a claim absurd now why is it absurd it is absurd because there being no reasoning facultythat is to say no faculty of personal commandin a pair of tongs personal responsibility for the acts of the tongs is wholly absent from the tongs and therefore responsibility being absent punishment cannot ensue am i right a hearty burst of applause was his answer now then we arrive at a mans stomach consider how exactly how marvelously indeed its situation corresponds to that of a pair of tongs listenand take careful note i beg you can a mans stomach plan a murder no can it plan a theft no can it plan an incendiary fire no now answer mecan a pair of tongs there were admiring shouts of no and the cases are just exact and dont he do it splendid now then friends and neighbors a stomach which cannot plan a crime cannot be a principal in the commission of itthat is plain as you see the matter is narrowed down by that much we will narrow it further can a stomach of its own motion assist at a crime the answer is no because command is absent the reasoning faculty is absent volition is absentas in the case of the tongs we perceive now do we not that the stomach is totally irresponsible for crimes committed either in whole or in part by it he got a rousing cheer for response then what do we arrive at as our verdict clearly this that there is no such thing in this world as a guilty stomach that in the body of the veriest rascal resides a pure and innocent stomach that whatever its owner may do it at least should be sacred in our eyes and that while god gives us minds to think just and charitable and honorable thoughts it should be and is our privilege as well as our duty not only to feed the hungry stomach that resides in a rascal having pity for its sorrow and its need but to do it gladly gratefully in recognition of its sturdy and loyal maintenance of its purity and innocence in the midst of temptation and in company so repugnant to its better feelings i am done  well you never saw such an effect they rosethe whole house rosean clapped and cheered and praised him to the skies and one after another still clapping and shouting they crowded forward some with moisture in their eyes and wrung his hands and said such glorious things to him that he was clear overcome with pride and happiness and couldnt say a word for his voice would have broken sure it was splendid to see and everybody said he had never come up to that speech in his life before and never could do it again eloquence is a power there is no question of that even old jacques darc was carried away for once in his life and shouted out  its all right joangive him the porridge  she was embarrassed and did not seem to know what to say and so didnt say anything it was because she had given the man the porridge long ago and he had already eaten it all up when she was asked why she had not waited until a decision was arrived at she said the mans stomach was very hungry and it would not have been wise to wait since she could not tell what the decision would be now that was a good and thoughtful idea for a child  the man was not a rascal at all he was a very good fellow only he was out of luck and surely that was no crime at that time in france now that his stomach was proved to be innocent it was allowed to make itself at home and as soon as it was well filled and needed nothing more the man unwound his tongue and turned it loose and it was really a noble one to go he had been in the wars for years and the things he told and the way he told them fired everybodys patriotism away up high and set all hearts to thumping and all pulses to leaping then before anybody rightly knew how the change was made he was leading us a sublime march through the ancient glories of france and in fancy we saw the titanic forms of the twelve paladins rise out of the mists of the past and face their fate we heard the tread of the innumerable hosts sweeping down to shut them in we saw this human tide flow and ebb ebb and flow and waste away before that little band of heroes we saw each detail pass before us of that most stupendous most disastrous yet most adored and glorious day in french legendary history here and there and yonder across that vast field of the dead and dying we saw this and that and the other paladin dealing his prodigious blows with weary arm and failing strength and one by one we saw them fall till only one remainedhe that was without peer he whose name gives name to the song of songs the song which no frenchman can hear and keep his feelings down and his pride of country cool then grandest and pitifulest scene of all we saw his own pathetic death and our stillness as we sat with parted lips and breathless hanging upon this mans words gave us a sense of the awful stillness that reigned in that field of slaughter when that last surviving soul had passed  and now in this solemn hush the stranger gave joan a pat or two on the head and said  little maidwhom god keepyou have brought me from death to life this night now listen here is your reward and at that supreme time for such a heartmelting soulrousing surprise without another word he lifted up the most noble and pathetic voice that was ever heard and began to pour out the great song of roland  think of that with a french audience all stirred up and ready oh where was your spoken eloquence now what was it to this how fine he looked how stately how inspired as he stood there with that mighty chant welling from his lips and his heart his whole body transfigured and his rags along with it  everybody rose and stood while he sang and their faces glowed and their eyes burned and the tears came and flowed down their cheeks and their forms began to sway unconsciously to the swing of the song and their bosoms to heave and pant and moanings broke out and deep ejaculations and when the last verse was reached and roland lay dying all alone with his face to the field and to his slain lying there in heaps and winrows and took off and held up his gauntlet to god with his failing hand and breathed his beautiful prayer with his paling pips all burst out in sobs and wailings but when the final great note died out and the song was done they all flung themselves in a body at the singer stark mad with love of him and love of france and pride in her great deeds and old renown and smothered him with their embracings but joan was there first hugged close to his breast and covering his face with idolatrous kisses  the storm raged on outside but that was no matter this was the strangers home now for as long as he might please      chapter 4 joan tames the mad man  all children have nicknames and we had ours we got one apiece early and they stuck to us but joan was richer in this matter for as time went on she earned a second and then a third and so on and we gave them to her first and last she had as many as half a dozen several of these she never lost peasantgirls are bashful naturally but she surpassed the rule so far and colored so easily and was so easily embarrassed in the presence of strangers that we nicknamed her the bashful we were all patriots but she was called the patriot because our warmest feeling for our country was cold beside hers also she was called the beautiful and this was not merely because of the extraordinary beauty of her face and form but because of the loveliness of her character these names she kept and one otherthe brave  we grew along up in that plodding and peaceful region and got to be goodsized boys and girlsbig enough in fact to begin to know as much about the wars raging perpetually to the west and north of us as our elders and also to feel as stirred up over the occasional news from these red fields as they did i remember certain of these days very clearly one tuesday a crowd of us were romping and singing around the fairy tree and hanging garlands on it in memory of our lost little fairy friends when little mengette cried out  look what is that  when one exclaims like that in a way that shows astonishment and apprehension he gets attention all the panting breasts and flushed faces flocked together and all the eager eyes were turned in one directiondown the slope toward the village  its a black flag  a black flag nois it  you can see for yourself that it is nothing else  it is a black flag sure now has any ever seen the like of that before  what can it mean  mean it means something dreadfulwhat else  that is nothing to the point anybody knows that without the telling but whatthat is the question  it is a chance that he that bears it can answer as well as any that are here if you contain yourself till he comes  he runs well who is it  some named one some another but presently all saw that it was etienne roze called the sunflower because he had yellow hair and a round pockmarked face his ancestors had been germans some centuries ago he came straining up the slope now and then projecting his flagstick aloft and giving his black symbol of woe a wave in the air whilst all eyes watched him all tongues discussed him and every heart beat faster and faster with impatience to know his news at last he sprang among us and struck his flagstick into the ground saying  there stand there and represent france while i get my breath she needs no other flag now  all the giddy chatter stopped it was as if one had announced a death in that chilly hush there was no sound audible but the panting of the breathblown boy when he was presently able to speak he said  black news is come a treaty has been made at troyes between france and the english and burgundians by it france is betrayed and delivered over tied hand and foot to the enemy it is the work of the duke of burgundy and that shedevil the queen of france it marries henry of england to catharine of france  is not this a lie marries the daughter of france to the butcher of agincourt it is not to be believed you have not heard aright  if you cannot believe that jacques darc then you have a difficult task indeed before you for worse is to come any child that is born of that marriageif even a girlis to inherit the thrones of both england and france and this double ownership is to remain with its posterity forever  now that is certainly a lie for it runs counter to our salic law and so is not legal and cannot have effect said edmond aubrey called the paladin because of the armies he was always going to eat up some day he would have said more but he was drowned out by the clamors of the others who all burst into a fury over this feature of the treaty all talking at once and nobody hearing anybody until presently haumette persuaded them to be still saying  it is not fair to break him up so in his tale pray let him go on you find fault with his history because it seems to be lies that were reason for satisfactionthat kind of liesnot discontent tell the rest etienne  there is but this to tell our king charles vi is to reign until he dies then henry v of england is to be regent of france until a child of his shall be old enough to  that man is to reign over usthe butcher it is lies all lies cried the paladin besides look youwhat becomes of our dauphin what says the treaty about him  nothing it takes away his throne and makes him an outcast  then everybody shouted at once and said the news was a lie and all began to get cheerful again saying our king would have to sign the treaty to make it good and that he would not do seeing how it serves his own son  but the sunflower said i will ask you this would the queen sign a treaty disinheriting her son  that viper certainly nobody is talking of her nobody expects better of her there is no villainy she will stick at if it feed her spite and she hates her son her signing it is of no consequence the king must sign  i will ask you another thing what is the kings condition mad isnt he  yes and his people love him all the more for it it brings him near to them by his sufferings and pitying him makes them love him  you say right jacques darc well what would you of one that is mad does he know what he does no does he do what others make him do yes now then i tell you he has signed the treaty  who made him do it  you know without my telling the queen  then there was another uproareverybody talking at once and all heaping execrations upon the queens head finally jacques darc said  but many reports come that are not true nothing so shameful as this has ever come before nothing that cuts so deep nothing that has dragged france so low therefore there is hope that this tale is but another idle rumor where did you get it  the color went out of his sister joans face she dreaded the answer and her instinct was right  the cure of maxey brought it  there was a general gasp we knew him you see for a trusty man  did he believe it  the hearts almost stopped beating then came the answer  he did and that is not all he said he knew it to be true  some of the girls began to sob the boys were struck silent the distress in joans face was like that which one sees in the face of a dumb animal that has received a mortal hurt the animal bears it making no complaint she bore it also saying no word her brother jacques put his hand on her head and caressed her hair to indicate his sympathy and she gathered the hand to her lips and kissed it for thanks not saying anything presently the reaction came and the boys began to talk noel rainguesson said  oh are we never going to be men we do grow along so slowly and france never needed soldiers as she needs them now to wipe out this black insult  i hate youth said pierre morel called the dragonfly because his eyes stuck out so youve always got to wait and wait and waitand here are the great wars wasting away for a hundred years and you never get a chance if i could only be a soldier now  as for me im not going to wait much longer said the paladin and when i do start youll hear from me i promise you that there are some who in storming a castle prefer to be in the rear but as for me give me the front or none i will have none in front of me but the officers  even the girls got the war spirit and marie dupont said  i would i were a man i would start this minute and looked very proud of herself and glanced about for applause  so would i said cecile letellier sniffing the air like a warhorse that smells the battle i warrant you i would not turn back from the field though all england were in front of me  pooh said the paladin girls can brag but thats all they are good for let a thousand of them come face to face with a handful of soldiers once if you want to see what running is like heres little joannext shell be threatening to go for a soldier  the idea was so funny and got such a good laugh that the paladin gave it another trial and said why you can just see hersee her plunge into battle like any old veteran yes indeed and not a poor shabby common soldier like us but an officeran officer mind you with armor on and the bars of a steel helmet to blush behind and hide her embarrassment when she finds an army in front of her that she hasnt been introduced to an officer why shell be a captain a captain i tell you with a hundred men at her backor maybe girls oh no commonsoldier business for her and dear me when she starts for that other army youll think theres a hurricane blowing it away  well he kept it up like that till he made their sides ache with laughing which was quite natural for certainly it was a very funny ideaat that timei mean the idea of that gentle little creature that wouldnt hurt a fly and couldnt bear the sight of blood and was so girlish and shrinking in all ways rushing into battle with a gang of soldiers at her back poor thing she sat there confused and ashamed to be so laughed at and yet at that very minute there was something about to happen which would change the aspect of things and make those young people see that when it comes to laughing the person that laughs last has the best chance for just then a face which we all knew and all feared projected itself from behind the fairy tree and the thought that shot through us all was crazy benoist has gotten loose from his cage and we are as good as dead this ragged and hairy and horrible creature glided out from behind the tree and raised an ax as he came we all broke and fled this way and that the girls screaming and crying no not all all but joan she stood up and faced the man and remained so as we reached the wood that borders the grassy clearing and jumped into its shelter two or three of us glanced back to see if benoist was gaining on us and that is what we sawjoan standing and the maniac gliding stealthily toward her with his ax lifted the sight was sickening we stood where we were trembling and not able to move i did not want to see the murder done and yet i could not take my eyes away now i saw joan step forward to meet the man though i believed my eyes must be deceiving me then i saw him stop he threatened her with his ax as if to warn her not to come further but she paid no heed but went steadily on until she was right in front of himright under his ax then she stopped and seemed to begin to talk with him it made me sick yes giddy and everything swam around me and i could not see anything for a timewhether long or brief i do not know when this passed and i looked again joan was walking by the mans side toward the village holding him by his hand the ax was in her other hand  one by one the boys and girls crept out and we stood there gazing openmouthed till those two entered the village and were hid from sight it was then that we named her the brave  we left the black flag there to continue its mournful office for we had other matter to think of now we started for the village on a run to give warning and get joan out of her peril though for one after seeing what i had seen it seemed to me that while joan had the ax the mans chance was not the best of the two when we arrived the danger was past the madman was in custody all the people were flocking to the little square in front of the church to talk and exclaim and wonder over the event and it even made the town forget the black news of the treaty for two or three hours  all the women kept hugging and kissing joan and praising her and crying and the men patted her on the head and said they wished she was a man they would send her to the wars and never doubt but that she would strike some blows that would be heard of she had to tear herself away and go and hide this glory was so trying to her diffidence  of course the people began to ask us for the particulars i was so ashamed that i made an excuse to the first comer and got privately away and went back to the fairy tree to get relief from the embarrassment of those questionings there i found joan but she was there to get relief from the embarrassment of glory one by one the others shirked the inquirers and joined us in our refuge then we gathered around joan and asked her how she had dared to do that thing she was very modest about it and said  you make a great thing of it but you mistake it was not a great matter it was not as if i had been a stranger to the man i know him and have known him long and he knows me and likes me i have fed him through the bars of his cage many times and last december when they chopped off two of his fingers to remind him to stop seizing and wounding people passing by i dressed his hand every day till it was well again  that is all well enough said little mengette but he is a madman dear and so his likings and his gratitude and friendliness go for nothing when his rage is up you did a perilous thing  of course you did said the sunflower didnt he threaten to kill you with the ax  yes  didnt he threaten you more than once  yes  didnt you feel afraid  noat least not muchvery little  why didnt you  she thought a moment then said quite simply  i dont know  it made everybody laugh then the sunflower said it was like a lamb trying to think out how it had come to eat a wolf but had to give it up  cecile letellier asked why didnt you run when we did  because it was necessary to get him to his cage else he would kill some one then he would come to the like harm himself  it is noticeable that this remark which implies that joan was entirely forgetful of herself and her own danger and had thought and wrought for the preservation of other people alone was not challenged or criticized or commented upon by anybody there but was taken by all as matter of course and true it shows how clearly her character was defined and how well it was known and established  there was silence for a time and perhaps we were all thinking of the same thingnamely what a poor figure we had cut in that adventure as contrasted with joans performance i tried to think up some good way of explaining why i had run away and left a little girl at the mercy of a maniac armed with an ax but all of the explanations that offered themselves to me seemed so cheap and shabby that i gave the matter up and remained still but others were less wise noel rainguesson fidgeted awhile then broke out with a remark which showed what his mind had been running on  the fact is i was taken by surprise that is the reason if i had had a moment to think i would no more have thought of running that i would think of running from a baby for after all what is theophile benoist that i should seem to be afraid of him pooh the idea of being afraid of that poor thing i only wish he would come along nowid show you  so do i cried pierre morel if i wouldnt make him climb this tree quicker thanwell youd see what i would do taking a person by surprise that waywhy i never meant to run not in earnest i mean i never thought of running in earnest i only wanted to have some fun and when i saw joan standing there and him threatening her it was all i could do to restrain myself from going there and just tearing the livers and lights out of him i wanted to do it bad enough and if it was to do over again i would if ever he comes fooling around me again ill  oh hush said the paladin breaking in with an air of disdain the way you people talk a person would think theres something heroic about standing up and facing down that poor remnant of a man why its nothing theres small glory to be got in facing him down i should say why i wouldnt want any better fun than to face down a hundred like him if he was to come along here now i would walk up to him just as i am nowi wouldnt care if he had a thousand axesand say  and so he went on and on telling the brave things he would say and the wonders he would do and the others put in a word from time to time describing over again the gory marvels they would do if ever that madman ventured to cross their path again for next time they would be ready for him and would soon teach him that if he thought he could surprise them twice because he had surprised them once he would find himself very seriously mistaken thats all  and so in the end they all got back their selfrespect yes and even added somewhat to it indeed when the sitting broke up they had a finer opinion of themselves than they had ever had before      chapter 5 domremy pillaged and burned  they were peaceful and pleasant those young and smoothly flowing days of ours that is that was the case as a rule we being remote from the seat of war but at intervals roving bands approached near enough for us to see the flush in the sky at night which marked where they were burning some farmstead or village and we all knew or at least felt that some day they would come yet nearer and we should have our turn this dull dread lay upon our spirits like a physical weight it was greatly augmented a couple of years after the treaty of troyes  it was truly a dismal year for france one day we had been over to have one of our occasional pitched battles with those hated burgundian boys of the village of maxey and had been whipped and were arriving on our side of the river after dark bruised and weary when we heard the bell ringing the tocsin we ran all the way and when we got to the square we found it crowded with the excited villagers and weirdly lighted by smoking and flaring torches  on the steps of the church stood a stranger a burgundian priest who was telling the people news which made them weep and rave and rage and curse by turns he said our old mad king was dead and that now we and france and the crown were the property of an english baby lying in his cradle in london and he urged us to give that child our allegiance and be its faithful servants and wellwishers and said we should now have a strong and stable government at last and that in a little time the english armies would start on their last march and it would be a brief one for all that it would need to do would be to conquer what odds and ends of our country yet remained under that rare and almost forgotten rag the banner of france  the people stormed and raged at him and you could see dozens of them stretch their fists above the sea of torchlighted faces and shake them at him and it was all a wild picture and stirring to look at and the priest was a firstrate part of it too for he stood there in the strong glare and looked down on those angry people in the blandest and most indifferent way so that while you wanted to burn him at the stake you still admired the aggravating coolness of him and his windingup was the coolest thing of all for he told them how at the funeral of our old king the french kingatarms had broken his staff of office over the coffin of charles vi and his dynasty at the same time saying in a loud voice god grant long life to henry king of france and england our sovereign lord and then he asked them to join him in a hearty amen to that the people were white with wrath and it tied their tongues for the moment and they could not speak but joan was standing close by and she looked up in his face and said in her sober earnest way  i would i might see thy head struck from thy bodythen after a pause and crossing herselfif it were the will of god  this is worth remembering and i will tell you why it is the only harsh speech joan ever uttered in her life when i shall have revealed to you the storms she went through and the wrongs and persecutions then you will see that it was wonderful that she said but one bitter thing while she lived  from the day that that dreary news came we had one scare after another the marauders coming almost to our doors every now and then so that we lived in everincreasing apprehension and yet were somehow mercifully spared from actual attack but at last our turn did really come this was in the spring of 28 the burgundians swarmed in with a great noise in the middle of a dark night and we had to jump up and fly for our lives we took the road to neufchateau and rushed along in the wildest disorder everybody trying to get ahead and thus the movements of all were impeded but joan had a cool headthe only cool head thereand she took command and brought order out of that chaos she did her work quickly and with decision and despatch and soon turned the panic flight into a quite steadygoing march you will grant that for so young a person and a girl at that this was a good piece of work  she was sixteen now shapely and graceful and of a beauty so extraordinary that i might allow myself any extravagance of language in describing it and yet have no fear of going beyond the truth there was in her face a sweetness and serenity and purity that justly reflected her spiritual nature she was deeply religious and this is a thing which sometimes gives a melancholy cast to a persons countenance but it was not so in her case her religion made her inwardly content and joyous and if she was troubled at times and showed the pain of it in her face and bearing it came of distress for her country no part of it was chargeable to her religion  a considerable part of our village was destroyed and when it became safe for us to venture back there we realized what other people had been suffering in all the various quarters of france for many yearsyes decades of years for the first time we saw wrecked and smokeblackened homes and in the lanes and alleys carcasses of dumb creatures that had been slaughtered in pure wantonnessamong them calves and lambs that had been pets of the children and it was pity to see the children lament over them  and then the taxes the taxes everybody thought of that that burden would fall heavy now in the communes crippled condition and all faces grew long with the thought of it joan said  paying taxes with naught to pay them with is what the rest of france has been doing these many years but we never knew the bitterness of that before we shall know it now  and so she went on talking about it and growing more and more troubled about it until one could see that it was filling all her mind  at last we came upon a dreadful object it was the madmanhacked and stabbed to death in his iron cage in the corner of the square it was a bloody and dreadful sight hardly any of us young people had ever seen a man before who had lost his life by violence so this cadaver had an awful fascination for us we could not take our eyes from it i mean it had that sort of fascination for all of us but one that one was joan she turned away in horror and could not be persuaded to go near it again thereit is a striking reminder that we are but creatures of use and custom yes and it is a reminder too of how harshly and unfairly fate deals with us sometimes for it was so ordered that the very ones among us who were most fascinated with mutilated and bloody death were to live their lives in peace while that other who had a native and deep horror of it must presently go forth and have it as a familiar spectacle every day on the field of battle  you may well believe that we had plenty of matter for talk now since the raiding of our village seemed by long odds the greatest event that had really ever occurred in the world for although these dull peasants may have thought they recognized the bigness of some of the previous occurrences that had filtered from the worlds history dimly into their minds the truth is that they hadnt one biting little fact visible to their eyes of flesh and felt in their own personal vitals became at once more prodigious to them than the grandest remote episode in the worlds history which they had got at second hand and by hearsay it amuses me now when i recall how our elders talked then they fumed and fretted in a fine fashion  ah yes said old jacques darc things are come to a pretty pass indeed the king must be informed of this it is time that he cease from idleness and dreaming and get at his proper business he meant our young disinherited king the hunted refugee charles vii  you say well said the maire he should be informed and that at once it is an outrage that such things would be permitted why we are not safe in our beds and he taking his ease yonder it shall be made known indeed it shallall france shall hear of it  to hear them talk one would have imagined that all the previous ten thousand sackings and burnings in france had been but fables and this one the only fact it is always the way words will answer as long as it is only a persons neighbor who is in trouble but when that person gets into trouble himself it is time that the king rise up and do something  the big event filled us young people with talk too we let it flow in a steady stream while we tended the flocks we were beginning to feel pretty important now for i was eighteen and the other youths were from one to four years olderyoung men in fact one day the paladin was arrogantly criticizing the patriot generals of france and said  look at dunois bastard of orleanscall him a general just put me in his place oncenever mind what i would do it is not for me to say i have no stomach for talk my way is to act and let others do the talkingbut just put me in his place once thats all and look at saintraillespooh and that blustering la hire now what a general that is  it shocked everybody to hear these great names so flippantly handled for to us these renowned soldiers were almost gods in their faroff splendor they rose upon our imaginations dim and huge shadowy and awful and it was a fearful thing to hear them spoken of as if they were mere men and their acts open to comment and criticism the color rose in joans face and she said  i know not how any can be so hardy as to use such words regarding these sublime men who are the very pillars of the french state supporting it with their strength and preserving it at daily cost of their blood as for me i could count myself honored past all deserving if i might be allowed but the privilege of looking upon them onceat a distance i mean for it would not become one of my degree to approach them too near  the paladin was disconcerted for a moment seeing by the faces around him that joan had put into words what the others felt then he pulled his complacency together and fell to faultfinding again joans brother jean said  if you dont like what our generals do why dont you go to the great wars yourself and better their work you are always talking about going to the wars but you dont go  look you said the paladin it is easy to say that now i will tell you why i remain chafing here in a bloodless tranquillity which my reputation teaches you is repulsive to my nature i do not go because i am not a gentleman that is the whole reason what can one private soldier do in a contest like this nothing he is not permitted to rise from the ranks if i were a gentleman would i remain here not one moment i can save franceah you may laugh but i know what is in me i know what is hid under this peasant cap i can save france and i stand ready to do it but not under these present conditions if they want me let them send for me otherwise let them take the consequences i shall not budge but as an officer  alas poor francefrance is lost said pierre darc  since you sniff so at others why dont you go to the wars yourself pierre darc  oh i havent been sent for either i am no more a gentleman than you yet i will go i promise to go i promise to go as a private under your orderswhen you are sent for  they all laughed and the dragonfly said  so soon then you need to begin to get ready you might be called for in five yearswho knows yes in my opinion youll march for the wars in five years  he will go sooner said joan she said it in a low voice and musingly but several heard it  how do you know that joan said the dragonfly with a surprised look but jean darc broke in and said  i want to go myself but as i am rather young yet i also will wait and march when the paladin is sent for  no said joan he will go with pierre  she said it as one who talks to himself aloud without knowing it and none heard it but me i glanced at her and saw that her knittingneedles were idle in her hands and that her face had a dreamy and absent look in it there were fleeting movements of her lips as if she might be occasionally saying parts of sentences to herself but there was no sound for i was the nearest person to her and i heard nothing but i set my ears open for those two speeches had affected me uncannily i being superstitious and easily troubled by any little thing of a strange and unusual sort  noel rainguesson said  there is one way to let france have a chance for her salvation weve got one gentleman in the commune at any rate why cant the scholar change name and condition with the paladin then he can be an officer france will send for him then and he will sweep these english and burgundian armies into the sea like flies  i was the scholar that was my nickname because i could read and write there was a chorus of approval and the sunflower said  that is the very thingit settles every difficulty the sieur de conte will easily agree to that yes he will march at the back of captain paladin and die early covered with commonsoldier glory  he will march with jean and pierre and live till these wars are forgotten joan muttered and at the eleventh hour noel and the paladin will join these but not of their own desire the voice was so low that i was not perfectly sure that these were the words but they seemed to be it makes one feel creepy to hear such things  come now noel continued its all arranged theres nothing to do but organize under the paladins banner and go forth and rescue france youll all join  all said yes except jacques darc who said  ill ask you to excuse me it is pleasant to talk war and i am with you there and ive always thought i should go soldiering about this time but the look of our wrecked village and that carvedup and bloody madman have taught me that i am not made for such work and such sights i could never be at home in that trade face swords and the big guns and death it isnt in me no no count me out and besides im the eldest son and deputy prop and protector of the family since you are going to carry jean and pierre to the wars somebody must be left behind to take care of our joan and her sister i shall stay at home and grow old in peace and tranquillity  he will stay at home but not grow old murmured joan  the talk rattled on in the gay and careless fashion privileged to youth and we got the paladin to map out his campaigns and fight his battles and win his victories and extinguish the english and put our king upon his throne and set his crown upon his head then we asked him what he was going to answer when the king should require him to name his reward the paladin had it all arranged in his head and brought it out promptly  he shall give me a dukedom name me premier peer and make me hereditary lord high constable of france  and marry you to a princessyoure not going to leave that out are you  the paladin colored a trifle and said brusquely  he may keep his princessesi can marry more to my taste  meaning joan though nobody suspected it at that time if any had the paladin would have been finely ridiculed for his vanity there was no fit mate in that village for joan of arc every one would have said that  in turn each person present was required to say what reward he would demand of the king if he could change places with the paladin and do the wonders the paladin was going to do the answers were given in fun and each of us tried to outdo his predecessors in the extravagance of the reward he would claim but when it came to joans turn and they rallied her out of her dreams and asked her to testify they had to explain to her what the question was for her thought had been absent and she had heard none of this latter part of our talk she supposed they wanted a serious answer and she gave it she sat considering some moments then she said  if the dauphin out of his grace and nobleness should say to me now that i am rich and am come to my own again choose and have i should kneel and ask him to give command that our village should nevermore be taxed  it was so simple and out of her heart that it touched us and we did not laugh but fell to thinking we did not laugh but there came a day when we remembered that speech with a mournful pride and were glad that we had not laughed perceiving then how honest her words had been and seeing how faithfully she made them good when the time came asking just that boon of the king and refusing to take even any least thing for herself      chapter 6 joan and archangel michael  all through her childhood and up to the middle of her fourteenth year joan had been the most lighthearted creature and the merriest in the village with a hopskipandjump gait and a happy and catching laugh and this disposition supplemented by her warm and sympathetic nature and frank and winning ways had made her everybodys pet she had been a hot patriot all this time and sometimes the war news had sobered her spirits and wrung her heart and made her acquainted with tears but always when these interruptions had run their course her spirits rose and she was her old self again  but now for a whole year and a half she had been mainly grave not melancholy but given to thought abstraction dreams she was carrying france upon her heart and she found the burden not light i knew that this was her trouble but others attributed her abstraction to religious ecstasy for she did not share her thinkings with the village at large yet gave me glimpses of them and so i knew better than the rest what was absorbing her interest many a time the idea crossed my mind that she had a secreta secret which she was keeping wholly to herself as well from me as from the others this idea had come to me because several times she had cut a sentence in two and changed the subject when apparently she was on the verge of a revelation of some sort i was to find this secret out but not just yet  the day after the conversation which i have been reporting we were together in the pastures and fell to talking about france as usual for her sake i had always talked hopefully before but that was mere lying for really there was not anything to hang a rag of hope for france upon now it was such a pain to lie to her and cost me such shame to offer this treachery to one so snowpure from lying and treachery and even from suspicion of such baseness in others as she was that i was resolved to face about now and begin over again and never insult her more with deception i started on the new policy by sayingstill opening up with a small lie of course for habit is habit and not to be flung out of the window by any man but coaxed downstairs a step at a time  joan i have been thinking the thing all over last night and have concluded that we have been in the wrong all this time that the case of france is desperate that it has been desperate ever since agincourt and that today it is more than desperate it is hopeless  i did not look her in the face while i was saying it it could not be expected of a person to break her heart to crush her hope with a so frankly brutal speech as that without one charitable soft place in itit seemed a shameful thing and it was but when it was out the weight gone and my conscience rising to the surface i glanced at her face to see the result  there was none to see at least none that i was expecting there was a barely perceptible suggestion of wonder in her serious eyes but that was all and she said in her simple and placid way  the case of france hopeless why should you think that tell me  it is a most pleasant thing to find that what you thought would inflict a hurt upon one whom you honor has not done it i was relieved now and could say all my say without any furtivenesses and without embarrassment so i began  let us put sentiment and patriotic illusions aside and look at the facts in the face what do they say they speak as plainly as the figures in a merchants accountbook one has only to add the two columns up to see that the french house is bankrupt that onehalf of its property is already in the english sheriffs hands and the other half in nobodysexcept those of irresponsible raiders and robbers confessing allegiance to nobody our king is shut up with his favorites and fools in inglorious idleness and poverty in a narrow little patch of the kingdoma sort of back lot as one may sayand has no authority there or anywhere else hasnt a farthing to his name nor a regiment of soldiers he is not fighting he is not intending to fight he means to make no further resistance in truth there is but one thing that he is intending to dogive the whole thing up pitch his crown into the sewer and run away to scotland there are the facts are they correct  yes they are correct  then it is as i have said one needs but to add them together in order to realize what they mean  she asked in an ordinary level tone  whatthat the case of france is hopeless  necessarily in face of these facts doubt of it is impossible  how can you say that how can you feel like that  how can i how could i think or feel in any other way in the circumstances joan with these fatal figures before you have you really any hope for francereally and actually  hopeoh more than that france will win her freedom and keep it do not doubt it  it seemed to me that her clear intellect must surely be clouded today it must be so or she would see that those figures could mean only one thing perhaps if i marshaled them again she would see so i said  joan your heart which worships france is beguiling your head you are not perceiving the importance of these figures herei want to make a picture of them here on the ground with a stick now this rough outline is france through its middle east and west i draw a river  yes the loire  now then this whole northern half of the country is in the tight grip of the english  yes  and this whole southern half is really in nobodys hands at allas our king confesses by meditating desertion and flight to a foreign land england has armies here opposition is dead she can assume full possession whenever she may choose in very truth all france is gone france is already lost france has ceased to exist what was france is now but a british province is this true  her voice was low and just touched with emotion but distinct  yes it is true  very well now add this clinching fact and surely the sum is complete when have french soldiers won a victory scotch soldiers under the french flag have won a barren fight or two a few years back but i am speaking of french ones since eight thousand englishmen nearly annihilated sixty thousand frenchmen a dozen years ago at agincourt french courage has been paralyzed and so it is a common saying today that if you confront fifty french soldiers with five english ones the french will run  it is a pity but even these things are true  then certainly the day for hoping is past  i believed the case would be clear to her now i thought it could not fail to be clear to her and that she would say herself that there was no longer any ground for hope but i was mistaken and disappointed also she said without any doubt in her tone  france will rise again you shall see  risewith this burden of english armies on her back  she will cast it off she will trample it under foot this with spirit  without soldiers to fight with  the drums will summon them they will answer and they will march  march to the rear as usual  no to the frontever to the frontalways to the front you shall see  and the pauper king  he will mount his thronehe will wear his crown  well of a truth this makes ones head dizzy why if i could believe that in thirty years from now the english domination would be broken and the french monarchs head find itself hooped with a real crown of sovereignty  both will have happened before two years are sped  indeed and who is going to perform all these sublime impossibilities  god  it was a reverent low note but it rang clear  what could have put those strange ideas in her head this question kept running in my mind during two or three days it was inevitable that i should think of madness what other way was there to account for such things grieving and brooding over the woes of france had weakened that strong mind and filled it with fantastic phantomsyes that must be it  but i watched her and tested her and it was not so her eye was clear and sane her ways were natural her speech direct and to the point no there was nothing the matter with her mind it was still the soundest in the village and the best she went on thinking for others planning for others sacrificing herself for others just as always before she went on ministering to her sick and to her poor and still stood ready to give the wayfarer her bed and content herself with the floor there was a secret somewhere but madness was not the key to it this was plain  now the key did presently come into my hands and the way that it happened was this you have heard all the world talk of this matter which i am about to speak of but you have not heard an eyewitness talk of it before  i was coming from over the ridge one dayit was the 15th of may 28and when i got to the edge of the oak forest and was about to step out of it upon the turfy open space in which the haunted beech tree stood i happened to cast a glance from cover firstthen i took a step backward and stood in the shelter and concealment of the foliage for i had caught sight of joan and thought i would devise some sort of playful surprise for her think of itthat trivial conceit was neighbor with but a scarcely measurable interval of time between to an event destined to endure forever in histories and songs  the day was overcast and all that grassy space wherein the tree stood lay in a soft rich shadow joan sat on a natural seat formed by gnarled great roots of the tree her hands lay loosely one reposing in the other in her lap her head was bent a little toward the ground and her air was that of one who is lost to thought steeped in dreams and not conscious of herself or of the world and now i saw a most strange thing for i saw a white shadow come slowly gliding along the grass toward the tree it was of grand proportionsa robed form with wingsand the whiteness of this shadow was not like any other whiteness that we know of except it be the whiteness of lightnings but even the lightnings are not so intense as it was for one can look at them without hurt whereas this brilliancy was so blinding that it pained my eyes and brought the water into them i uncovered my head perceiving that i was in the presence of something not of this world my breath grew faint and difficult because of the terror and the awe that possessed me  another strange thing the wood had been silentsmitten with that deep stillness which comes when a stormcloud darkens a forest and the wild creatures lose heart and are afraid but now all the birds burst forth into song and the joy the rapture the ecstasy of it was beyond belief and was so eloquent and so moving withal that it was plain it was an act of worship with the first note of those birds joan cast herself upon her knees and bent her head low and crossed her hands upon her breast  she had not seen the shadow yet had the song of the birds told her it was coming it had that look to me then the like of this must have happened before yes there might be no doubt of that  the shadow approached joan slowly the extremity of it reached her flowed over her clothed her in its awful splendor in that immortal light her face only humanly beautiful before became divine flooded with that transforming glory her mean peasant habit was become like to the raiment of the sunclothed children of god as we see them thronging the terraces of the throne in our dreams and imaginings  presently she rose and stood with her head still bowed a little and with her arms down and the ends of her fingers lightly laced together in front of her and standing so all drenched with that wonderful light and yet apparently not knowing it she seemed to listenbut i heard nothing after a little she raised her head and looked up as one might look up toward the face of a giant and then clasped her hands and lifted them high imploringly and began to plead i heard some of the words i heard her say  but i am so young oh so young to leave my mother and my home and go out into the strange world to undertake a thing so great ah how can i talk with men be comrade with mensoldiers it would give me over to insult and rude usage and contempt how can i go to the great wars and lead armiesi a girl and ignorant of such things knowing nothing of arms nor how to mount a horse nor ride it yetif it is commanded  her voice sank a little and was broken by sobs and i made out no more of her words then i came to myself i reflected that i had been intruding upon a mystery of godand what might my punishment be i was afraid and went deeper into the wood then i carved a mark in the bark of a tree saying to myself it may be that i am dreaming and have not seen this vision at all i will come again when i know that i am awake and not dreaming and see if this mark is still here then i shall know      chapter 7 she delivers the divine command  i heard my name called it was joans voice it startled me for how could she know i was there i said to myself it is part of the dream it is all dreamvoice vision and all the fairies have done this so i crossed myself and pronounced the name of god to break the enchantment i knew i was awake now and free from the spell for no spell can withstand this exorcism then i heard my name called again and i stepped at once from under cover and there indeed was joan but not looking as she had looked in the dream for she was not crying now but was looking as she had used to look a year and a half before when her heart was light and her spirits high her oldtime energy and fire were back and a something like exaltation showed itself in her face and bearing it was almost as if she had been in a trance all that time and had come awake again really it was just as if she had been away and lost and was come back to us at last and i was so glad that i felt like running to call everybody and have them flock around her and give her welcome i ran to her excited and said  ah joan ive got such a wonderful thing to tell you about you would never imagine it ive had a dream and in the dream i saw you right here where you are standing now and  but she put up her hand and said  it was not a dream  it gave me a shock and i began to feel afraid again  not a dream i said how can you know about it joan  are you dreaming now  ii suppose not i think i am not  indeed you are not i know you are not and yow were not dreaming when you cut the mark in the tree  i felt myself turning cold with fright for now i knew of a certainty that i had not been dreaming but had really been in the presence of a dread something not of this world then i remembered that my sinful feet were upon holy groundthe ground where that celestial shadow had rested i moved quickly away smitten to the bones with fear joan followed and said  do not be afraid indeed there is no need come with me we will sit by the spring and i will tell you all my secret  when she was ready to begin i checked her and said  first tell me this you could not see me in the wood how did you know i cut a mark in the tree  wait a little i will soon come to that then you will see  but tell me one thing now what was that awful shadow that i saw  i will tell you but do not be disturbed you are not in danger it was the shadow of an archangelmichael the chief and lord of the armies of heaven  i could but cross myself and tremble for having polluted that ground with my feet  you were not afraid joan did you see his facedid you see his form  yes i was not afraid because this was not the first time i was afraid the first time  when was that joan  it is nearly three years ago now  so long have you seen him many times  yes many times  it is this then that has changed you it was this that made you thoughtful and not as you were before i see it now why did you not tell us about it  it was not permitted it is permitted now and soon i shall tell all but only you now it must remain a secret for a few days still  has none seen that white shadow before but me  no one it has fallen upon me before when you and others were present but none could see it today it has been otherwise and i was told why but it will not be visible again to any  it was a sign to me thenand a sign with a meaning of some kind  yes but i may not speak of that  strangethat that dazzling light could rest upon an object before ones eyes and not be visible  with it comes speech also several saints come attended by myriads of angels and they speak to me i hear their voices but others do not they are very dear to memy voices that is what i call them to myself  joan what do they tell you  all manner of thingsabout france i mean  what things have they been used to tell you  she sighed and said  disastersonly disasters and misfortunes and humiliation there was naught else to foretell  they spoke of them to you beforehand yes so that i knew what was going to happen before it happened it made me graveas you saw it could not be otherwise but always there was a word of hope too more than that france was to be rescued and made great and free again but how and by whomthat was not told not until today as she said those last words a sudden deep glow shone in her eyes which i was to see there many times in afterdays when the bugles sounded the charge and learn to call it the battlelight her breast heaved and the color rose in her face but today i know god has chosen the meanest of his creatures for this work and by his command and in his protection and by his strength not mine i am to lead his armies and win back france and set the crown upon the head of his servant that is dauphin and shall be king  i was amazed and said  you joan you a child lead armies  yes for one little moment or two the thought crushed me for it is as you sayi am only a child a child and ignorantignorant of everything that pertains to war and not fitted for the rough life of camps and the companionship of soldiers but those weak moments passed they will not come again i am enlisted i will not turn back god helping me till the english grip is loosed from the throat of france my voices have never told me lies they have not lied today they say i am to go to robert de baudricourt governor of vaucouleurs and he will give me menatarms for escort and send me to the king a year from now a blow will be struck which will be the beginning of the end and the end will follow swiftly  where will it be struck  my voices have not said nor what will happen this present year before it is struck it is appointed me to strike it that is all i know and follow it with others sharp and swift undoing in ten weeks englands long years of costly labor and setting the crown upon the dauphins headfor such is gods will my voices have said it and shall i doubt it no it will be as they have said for they say only that which is true  these were tremendous sayings they were impossibilities to my reason but to my heart they rang true and so while my reason doubted my heart believedbelieved and held fast to the belief from that day presently i said  joan i believe the things which you have said and now i am glad that i am to march with you to the great warsthat is if it is with you i am to march when i go  she looked surprised and said  it is true that you will be with me when i go to the wars but how did you know  i shall march with you and so also will jean and pierre but not jacques  all trueit is so ordered as was revealed to me lately but i did not know until today that the marching would be with me or that i should march at all how did you know these things  i told her when it was that she had said them but she did not remember about it so then i knew that she had been asleep or in a trance or an ecstasy of some kind at that time she bade me keep these and the other revelations to myself for the present and i said i would and kept the faith i promised  none who met joan that day failed to notice the change that had come over her she moved and spoke with energy and decision there was a strange new fire in her eye and also a something wholly new and remarkable in her carriage and in the set of her head this new light in the eye and this new bearing were born of the authority and leadership which had this day been vested in her by the decree of god and they asserted that authority as plainly as speech could have done it yet without ostentation or bravado this calm consciousness of command and calm unconscious outward expression of it remained with her thenceforth until her mission was accomplished  like the other villagers she had always accorded me the deference due my rank but now without word said on either side she and i changed places she gave orders not suggestions i received them with the deference due a superior and obeyed them without comment in the evening she said to me  i leave before dawn no one will know it but you i go to speak with the governor of vaucouleurs as commanded who will despise me and treat me rudely and perhaps refuse my prayer at this time i go first to burey to persuade my uncle laxart to go with me it not being meet that i go alone i may need you in vaucouleurs for if the governor will not receive me i will dictate a letter to him and so must have some one by me who knows the art of how to write and spell the words you will go from here tomorrow in the afternoon and remain in vaucouleurs until i need you  i said i would obey and she went her way you see how clear a head she had and what a just and level judgment she did not order me to go with her no she would not subject her good name to gossiping remark she knew that the governor being a noble would grant me another noble audience but no you see she would not have that either a poor peasantgirl presenting a petition through a young noblemanhow would that look she always protected her modesty from hurt and so for reward she carried her good name unsmirched to the end i knew what i must do now if i would have her approval go to vaucouleurs keep out of her sight and be ready when wanted  i went the next afternoon and took an obscure lodging the next day i called at the castle and paid my respects to the governor who invited me to dine with him at noon of the following day he was an ideal soldier of the time tall brawny grayheaded rough full of strange oaths acquired here and there and yonder in the wars and treasured as if they were decorations he had been used to the camp all his life and to his notion war was gods best gift to man he had his steel cuirass on and wore boots that came above his knees and was equipped with a huge sword and when i looked at this martial figure and heard the marvelous oaths and guessed how little of poetry and sentiment might be looked for in this quarter i hoped the little peasantgirl would not get the privilege of confronting this battery but would have to content herself with the dictated letter  i came again to the castle the next day at noon and was conducted to the great dininghall and seated by the side of the governor at a small table which was raised a couple of steps higher than the general table at the small table sat several other guests besides myself and at the general table sat the chief officers of the garrison at the entrance door stood a guard of halberdiers in morion and breastplate  as for talk there was but one topic of coursethe desperate situation of france there was a rumor some one said that salisbury was making preparations to march against orleans it raised a turmoil of excited conversation and opinions fell thick and fast some believed he would march at once others that he could not accomplish the investment before fall others that the siege would be long and bravely contested but upon one thing all voices agreed that orleans must eventually fall and with it france with that the prolonged discussion ended and there was silence every man seemed to sink himself in his own thoughts and to forget where he was this sudden and profound stillness where before had been so much animation was impressive and solemn now came a servant and whispered something to the governor who said  would talk with me  yes your excellency  hm a strange idea certainly bring them in  it was joan and her uncle laxart at the spectacle of the great people the courage oozed out of the poor old peasant and he stopped midway and would come no further but remained there with his red nightcap crushed in his hands and bowing humbly here there and everywhere stupefied with embarrassment and fear but joan came steadily forward erect and selfpossessed and stood before the governor she recognized me but in no way indicated it there was a buzz of admiration even the governor contributing to it for i heard him mutter by gods grace it is a beautiful creature he inspected her critically a moment or two then said  well what is your errand my child  my message is to you robert de baudricourt governor of vaucouleurs and it is this that you will send and tell the dauphin to wait and not give battle to his enemies for god will presently send him help  this strange speech amazed the company and many murmured the poor young thing is demented the governor scowled and said  what nonsense is this the kingor the dauphin as you call himneeds no message of that sort he will wait give yourself no uneasiness as to that what further do you desire to say to me  this to beg that you will give me an escort of menatarms and send me to the dauphin  what for  that he may make me his general for it is appointed that i shall drive the english out of france and set the crown upon his head  whatyou why you are but a child  yet am i appointed to do it nevertheless  indeed and when will all this happen  next year he will be crowned and after that will remain master of france  there was a great and general burst of laughter and when it had subsided the governor said  who has sent you with these extravagant messages  my lord  what lord  the king of heaven  many murmured ah poor thing poor thing and others ah her mind is but a wreck the governor hailed laxart and said  harkyetake this mad child home and whip her soundly that is the best cure for her ailment  as joan was moving away she turned and said with simplicity  you refuse me the soldiers i know not why for it is my lord that has commanded you yes it is he that has made the command therefore i must come again and yet again then i shall have the menatarms  there was a great deal of wondering talk after she was gone and the guards and servants passed the talk to the town the town passed it to the country domremy was already buzzing with it when we got back      chapter 8 why the scorners relented  human nature is the same everywhere it defies success it has nothing but scorn for defeat the village considered that joan had disgraced it with her grotesque performance and its ridiculous failure so all the tongues were busy with the matter and as bilious and bitter as they were busy insomuch that if the tongues had been teeth she would not have survived her persecutions those persons who did not scold did what was worse and harder to bear for they ridiculed her and mocked at her and ceased neither day nor night from their witticisms and jeerings and laughter haumette and little mengette and i stood by her but the storm was too strong for her other friends and they avoided her being ashamed to be seen with her because she was so unpopular and because of the sting of the taunts that assailed them on her account she shed tears in secret but none in public in public she carried herself with serenity and showed no distress nor any resentmentconduct which should have softened the feeling against her but it did not her father was so incensed that he could not talk in measured terms about her wild project of going to the wars like a man he had dreamed of her doing such a thing some time before and now he remembered that dream with apprehension and anger and said that rather than see her unsex herself and go away with the armies he would require her brothers to drown her and that if they should refuse he would do it with his own hands  but none of these things shook her purpose in the least her parents kept a strict watch upon her to keep her from leaving the village but she said her time was not yet that when the time to go was come she should know it and then the keepers would watch in vain  the summer wasted along and when it was seen that her purpose continued steadfast the parents were glad of a chance which finally offered itself for bringing her projects to an end through marriage the paladin had the effrontery to pretend that she had engaged herself to him several years before and now he claimed a ratification of the engagement  she said his statement was not true and refused to marry him she was cited to appear before the ecclesiastical court at toul to answer for her perversity when she declined to have counsel and elected to conduct her case herself her parents and all her illwishers rejoiced and looked upon her as already defeated and that was natural enough for who would expect that an ignorant peasantgirl of sixteen would be otherwise than frightened and tonguetied when standing for the first time in presence of the practised doctors of the law and surrounded by the cold solemnities of a court yet all these people were mistaken they flocked to toul to see and enjoy this fright and embarrassment and defeat and they had their trouble for their pains she was modest tranquil and quite at her ease she called no witnesses saying she would content herself with examining the witnesses for the prosecution when they had testified she rose and reviewed their testimony in a few words pronounced it vague confused and of no force then she placed the paladin again on the stand and began to search him his previous testimony went rag by rag to ruin under her ingenious hands until at last he stood bare so to speak he that had come so richly clothed in fraud and falsehood his counsel began an argument but the court declined to hear it and threw out the case adding a few words of grave compliment for joan and referring to her as this marvelous child  after this victory with this high praise from so imposing a source added the fickle village turned again and gave joan countenance compliment and peace her mother took her back to her heart and even her father relented and said he was proud of her but the time hung heavy on her hands nevertheless for the siege of orleans was begun the clouds lowered darker and darker over france and still her voices said wait and gave her no direct commands the winter set in and wore tediously along but at last there was a change      book ii in court and camp    chapter 1 joan says goodby  the 5th of january 1429 joan came to me with her uncle laxart and said  the time is come my voices are not vague now but clear and they have told me what to do in two months i shall be with the dauphin  her spirits were high and her bearing martial i caught the infection and felt a great impulse stirring in me that was like what one feels when he hears the roll of the drums and the tramp of marching men  i believe it i said  i also believe it said laxart if she had told me before that she was commanded of god to rescue france i should not have believed i should have let her seek the governor by her own ways and held myself clear of meddling in the matter not doubting she was mad but i have seen her stand before those nobles and mighty men unafraid and say her say and she had not been able to do that but by the help of god that i know therefore with all humbleness i am at her command to do with me as she will  my uncle is very good to me joan said i sent and asked him to come and persuade my mother to let him take me home with him to tend his wife who is not well it is arranged and we go at dawn tomorrow from his house i shall go soon to vaucouleurs and wait and strive until my prayer is granted who were the two cavaliers who sat to your left at the governors table that day  one was the sieur jean de novelonpont de metz the other the sieur bertrand de poulengy  good metalgood metal both i marked them for men of mine what is it i see in your face doubt  i was teaching myself to speak the truth to her not trimming it or polishing it so i said  they considered you out of your head and said so it is true they pitied you for being in such misfortune but still they held you to be mad  this did not seem to trouble her in any way or wound her she only said  the wise change their minds when they perceive that they have been in error these will they will march with me i shall see them presently  you seem to doubt again do you doubt  nno not now i was remembering that it was a year ago and that they did not belong here but only chanced to stop a day on their journey  they will come again but as to matters now in hand i came to leave with you some instructions you will follow me in a few days order your affairs for you will be absent long  will jean and pierre go with me  no they would refuse now but presently they will come and with them they will bring my parents blessing and likewise their consent that i take up my mission i shall be stronger thenstronger for that for lack of it i am weak now she paused a little while and the tears gathered in her eyes then she went on i would say goodby to little mengette bring her outside the village at dawn she must go with me a little of the way  and haumette  she broke down and began to cry saying  no oh noshe is too dear to me i could not bear it knowing i should never look upon her face again  next morning i brought mengette and we four walked along the road in the cold dawn till the village was far behind then the two girls said their goodbys clinging about each others neck and pouring out their grief in loving words and tears a pitiful sight to see and joan took one long look back upon the distant village and the fairy tree and the oak forest and the flowery plain and the river as if she was trying to print these scenes on her memory so that they would abide there always and not fade for she knew she would not see them any more in this life then she turned and went from us sobbing bitterly it was her birthday and mine she was seventeen years old      chapter 2 the governor speeds joan  after a few days laxart took joan to vaucouleurs and found lodging and guardianship for her with catherine royer a wheelwrights wife an honest and good woman joan went to mass regularly she helped do the housework earning her keep in that way and if any wished to talk with her about her missionand many didshe talked freely making no concealments regarding the matter now i was soon housed near by and witnessed the effects which followed at once the tidings spread that a young girl was come who was appointed of god to save france the common people flocked in crowds to look at her and speak with her and her fair young loveliness won the half of their belief and her deep earnestness and transparent sincerity won the other half the welltodo remained away and scoffed but that is their way  next a prophecy of merlins more than eight hundred years old was called to mind which said that in a far future time france would be lost by a woman and restored by a woman france was now for the first time lostand by a woman isabel of bavaria her base queen doubtless this fair and pure young girl was commissioned of heaven to complete the prophecy  this gave the growing interest a new and powerful impulse the excitement rose higher and higher and hope and faith along with it and so from vaucouleurs wave after wave of this inspiring enthusiasm flowed out over the land far and wide invading all the villages and refreshing and revivifying the perishing children of france and from these villages came people who wanted to see for themselves hear for themselves and they did see and hear and believe they filled the town they more than filled it inns and lodgings were packed and yet half of the inflow had to go without shelter and still they came winter as it was for when a mans soul is starving what does he care for meat and roof so he can but get that nobler hunger fed day after day and still day after day the great tide rose domremy was dazed amazed stupefied and said to itself was this worldwonder in our familiar midst all these years and we too dull to see it jean and pierre went out from the village stared at and envied like the great and fortunate of the earth and their progress to vaucouleurs was like a triumph all the countryside flocking to see and salute the brothers of one with whom angels had spoken face to face and into whose hands by command of god they had delivered the destinies of france  the brothers brought the parents blessing and godspeed to joan and their promise to bring it to her in person later and so with this culminating happiness in her heart and the high hope it inspired she went and confronted the governor again but he was no more tractable than he had been before he refused to send her to the king she was disappointed but in no degree discouraged she said  i must still come to you until i get the menatarms for so it is commanded and i may not disobey i must go to the dauphin though i go on my knees  i and the two brothers were with joan daily to see the people that came and hear what they said and one day sure enough the sieur jean de metz came he talked with her in a petting and playful way as one talks with children and said  what are you doing here my little maid will they drive the king out of france and shall we all turn english  she answered him in her tranquil serious way  i am come to bid robert de baudricourt take or send me to the king but he does not heed my words  ah you have an admirable persistence truly a whole year has not turned you from your wish i saw you when you came before  joan said as tranquilly as before  it is not a wish it is a purpose he will grant it i can wait  ah perhaps it will not be wise to make too sure of that my child these governors are stubborn people to deal with in case he shall not grant your prayer  he will grant it he must it is not a matter of choice  the gentlemans playful mood began to disappearone could see that by his face joans earnestness was affecting him it always happened that people who began in jest with her ended by being in earnest they soon began to perceive depths in her that they had not suspected and then her manifest sincerity and the rocklike steadfastness of her convictions were forces which cowed levity and it could not maintain its selfrespect in their presence the sieur de metz was thoughtful for a moment or two then he began quite soberly  is it necessary that you go to the king soonthat is i mean  before midlent even though i wear away my legs to the knees  she said it with that sort of repressed fieriness that means so much when a persons heart is in a thing you could see the response in that noblemans face you could see his eye light up there was sympathy there he said most earnestly  god knows i think you should have the menatarms and that somewhat would come of it what is it that you would do what is your hope and purpose  to rescue france and it is appointed that i shall do it for no one else in the world neither kings nor dukes no any other can recover the kingdom of france and there is no help but in me  the words had a pleading and pathetic sound and they touched that good nobleman i saw it plainly joan dropped her voice a little and said but indeed i would rather spin with my poor mother for this is not my calling but i must go and do it for it is my lords will  who is your lord  he is god  then the sieur de metz following the impressive old feudal fashion knelt and laid his hands within joans in sign of fealty and made oath that by gods help he himself would take her to the king  the next day came the sieur bertrand de poulengy and he also pledged his oath and knightly honor to abide with her and follow her witherosever she might lead  this day too toward evening a great rumor went flying abroad through the townnamely that the very governor himself was going to visit the young girl in her humble lodgings so in the morning the streets and lanes were packed with people waiting to see if this strange thing would indeed happen and happen it did the governor rode in state attended by his guards and the news of it went everywhere and made a great sensation and modified the scoffings of the people of quality and raised joans credit higher than ever  the governor had made up his mind to one thing joan was either a witch or a saint and he meant to find out which it was so he brought a priest with him to exorcise the devil that was in her in case there was one there the priest performed his office but found no devil he merely hurt joans feelings and offended her piety without need for he had already confessed her before this and should have known if he knew anything that devils cannot abide the confessional but utter cries of anguish and the most profane and furious cursings whenever they are confronted with that holy office  the governor went away troubled and full of thought and not knowing what to do and while he pondered and studied several days went by and the 14th of february was come then joan went to the castle and said  in gods name robert de baudricourt you are too slow about sending me and have caused damage thereby for this day the dauphins cause has lost a battle near orleans and will suffer yet greater injury if you do not send me to him soon  the governor was perplexed by this speech and said  today child today how can you know what has happened in that region today it would take eight or ten days for the word to come  my voices have brought the word to me and it is true a battle was lost today and you are in fault to delay me so  the governor walked the floor awhile talking within himself but letting a great oath fall outside now and then and finally he said  harkye go in peace and wait if it shall turn out as you say i will give you the letter and send you to the king and not otherwise  joan said with fervor  now god be thanked these waiting days are almost done in nine days you will fetch me the letter  already the people of vaucouleurs had given her a horse and had armed and equipped her as a soldier she got no chance to try the horse and see if she could ride it for her great first duty was to abide at her post and lift up the hopes and spirits of all who would come to talk with her and prepare them to help in the rescue and regeneration of the kingdom this occupied every waking moment she had but it was no matter there was nothing she could not learnand in the briefest time too her horse would find this out in the first hour meantime the brothers and i took the horse in turn and began to learn to ride and we had teaching in the use of the sword and other arms also  on the 20th joan called her small army togetherthe two knights and her two brothers and mefor a private council of war no it was not a council that is not the right name for she did not consult with us she merely gave us orders she mapped out the course she would travel toward the king and did it like a person perfectly versed in geography and this itinerary of daily marches was so arranged as to avoid here and there peculiarly dangerous regions by flank movementswhich showed that she knew her political geography as intimately as she knew her physical geography yet she had never had a days schooling of course and was without education i was astonished but thought her voices must have taught her but upon reflection i saw that this was not so by her references to what this and that and the other person had told her i perceived that she had been diligently questioning those crowds of visiting strangers and that out of them she had patiently dug all this mass of invaluable knowledge the two knights were filled with wonder at her good sense and sagacity  she commanded us to make preparations to travel by night and sleep by day in concealment as almost the whole of our long journey would be through the enemys country  also she commanded that we should keep the date of our departure a secret since she meant to get away unobserved otherwise we should be sent off with a grand demonstration which would advertise us to the enemy and we should be ambushed and captured somewhere finally she said  nothing remains now but that i confide to you the date of our departure so that you may make all needful preparation in time leaving nothing to be done in haste and badly at the last moment we march the 23d at eleven of the clock at night  then we were dismissed the two knights were startledyes and troubled and the sieur bertrand said  even if the governor shall really furnish the letter and the escort he still may not do it in time to meet the date she has chosen then how can she venture to name that date it is a great riska great risk to select and decide upon the date in this state of uncertainty  i said  since she has named the 23d we may trust her the voices have told her i think we shall do best to obey  we did obey joans parents were notified to come before the 23d but prudence forbade that they be told why this limit was named  all day the 23d she glanced up wistfully whenever new bodies of strangers entered the house but her parents did not appear still she was not discouraged but hoped on but when night fell at last her hopes perished and the tears came however she dashed them away and said  it was to be so no doubt no doubt it was so ordered i must bear it and will  de metz tried to comfort her by saying  the governor sends no word it may be that they will come tomorrow and  he got no further for she interrupted him saying  to what good end we start at eleven tonight  and it was so at ten the governor came with his guard and arms with horses and equipment for me and for the brothers and gave joan a letter to the king then he took off his sword and belted it about her waist with his own hands and said  you said true child the battle was lost on the day you said so i have kept my word now gocome of it what may  joan gave him thanks and he went his way  the lost battle was the famous disaster that is called in history the battle of the herrings  all the lights in the house were at once put out and a little while after when the streets had become dark and still we crept stealthily through them and out at the western gate and rode away under whip and spur      chapter 3 the paladin groans and boasts  we were twentyfive strong and well equipped we rode in double file joan and her brothers in the center of the column with jean de metz at the head of it and the sieur bertrand at its extreme rear in two or three hours we should be in the enemys country and then none would venture to desert by and by we began to hear groans and sobs and execrations from different points along the line and upon inquiry found that six of our men were peasants who had never ridden a horse before and were finding it very difficult to stay in their saddles and moreover were now beginning to suffer considerable bodily torture they had been seized by the governor at the last moment and pressed into the service to make up the tale and he had placed a veteran alongside of each with orders to help him stick to the saddle and kill him if he tried to desert  these poor devils had kept quiet as long as they could but their physical miseries were become so sharp by this time that they were obliged to give them vent but we were within the enemys country now so there was no help for them they must continue the march though joan said that if they chose to take the risk they might depart they preferred to stay with us we modified our pace now and moved cautiously and the new men were warned to keep their sorrows to themselves and not get the command into danger with their curses and lamentations  toward dawn we rode deep into a forest and soon all but the sentries were sound asleep in spite of the cold ground and the frosty air  i woke at noon out of such a solid and stupefying sleep that at first my wits were all astray and i did not know where i was nor what had been happening then my senses cleared and i remembered as i lay there thinking over the strange events of the past month or two the thought came into my mind greatly surprising me that one of joans prophecies had failed for where were noel and the paladin who were to join us at the eleventh hour by this time you see i had gotten used to expecting everything joan said to come true so being disturbed and troubled by these thoughts i opened my eyes well there stood the paladin leaning against a tree and looking down on me how often that happens you think of a person or speak of a person and there he stands before you and you not dreaming he is near it looks as if his being near is really the thing that makes you think of him and not just an accident as people imagine well be that as it may there was the paladin anyway looking down in my face and waiting for me to wake i was ever so glad to see him and jumped up and shook him by the hand and led him a little way from the camphe limping like a crippleand told him to sit down and said  now where have you dropped down from and how did you happen to light in this place and what do the soldierclothes mean tell me all about it  he answered  i marched with you last night  no to myself i said the prophecy has not all failedhalf of it has come true yes i did i hurried up from domremy to join and was within a half a minute of being too late in fact i was too late but i begged so hard that the governor was touched by my brave devotion to my countrys causethose are the words he usedand so he yielded and allowed me to come  i thought to myself this is a lie he is one of those six the governor recruited by force at the last moment i know it for joans prophecy said he would join at the eleventh hour but not by his own desire then i said aloud  i am glad you came it is a noble cause and one should not sit at home in times like these  sit at home i could no more do it than the thunderstone could stay hid in the clouds when the storm calls it  that is the right talk it sounds like you  that pleased him  im glad you know me some dont but they will presently they will know me well enough before i get done with this war  that is what i think i believe that wherever danger confronts you you will make yourself conspicuous  he was charmed with this speech and it swelled him up like a bladder he said  if i know myselfand i think i domy performances in this campaign will give you occasion more than once to remember those words  i were a fool to doubt it that i know  i shall not be at my best being but a common soldier still the country will hear of me if i were where i belong if i were in the place of la hire or saintrailles or the bastard of orleanswell i say nothing i am not of the talking kind like noel rainguesson and his sort i thank god but it will be something i take ita novelty in this world i should sayto raise the fame of a private soldier above theirs and extinguish the glory of their names with its shadow  why look here my friend i said do you know that you have hit out a most remarkable idea there do you realize the gigantic proportions of it for look you to be a general of vast renown what is that nothinghistory is clogged and confused with them one cannot keep their names in his memory there are so many but a common soldier of supreme renownwhy he would stand alone he would the be one moon in a firmament of mustardseed stars his name would outlast the human race my friend who gave you that idea  he was ready to burst with happiness but he suppressed betrayal of it as well as he could he simply waved the compliment aside with his hand and said with complacency  it is nothing i have them oftenideas like thatand even greater ones i do not consider this one much  you astonish me you do indeed so it is really your own  quite and there is plenty more where it came fromtapping his head with his finger and taking occasion at the same time to cant his morion over his right ear which gave him a very selfsatisfied airi do not need to borrow my ideas like noel rainguesson  speaking of noel when did you see him last  half an hour ago he is sleeping yonder like a corpse rode with us last night  i felt a great upleap in my heart and said to myself now i am at rest and glad i will never doubt her prophecies again then i said aloud  it gives me joy it makes me proud of our village there is not keeping our lionhearts at home in these great times i see that  lionheart whothat baby why he begged like a dog to be let off cried and said he wanted to go to his mother him a lionheartthat tumblebug  dear me why i supposed he volunteered of course didnt he  oh yes he volunteered the way people do to the headsman why when he found i was coming up from domremy to volunteer he asked me to let him come along in my protection and see the crowds and the excitement well we arrived and saw the torches filing out at the castle and ran there and the governor had him seized along with four more and he begged to be let off and i begged for his place and at last the governor allowed me to join but wouldnt let noel off because he was disgusted with him he was such a crybaby yes and much good hell do the kings service hell eat for six and run for sixteen i hate a pygmy with half a heart and nine stomachs  why this is very surprising news to me and i am sorry and disappointed to hear it i thought he was a very manly fellow  the paladin gave me an outraged look and said  i dont see how you can talk like that im sure i dont i dont see how you could have got such a notion i dont dislike him and im not saying these things out of prejudice for i dont allow myself to have prejudices against people i like him and have always comraded with him from the cradle but he must allow me to speak my mind about his faults and i am willing he shall speak his about mine if i have any and true enough maybe i have but i reckon theyll bear inspectioni have that idea anyway a manly fellow you should have heard him whine and wail and swear last night because the saddle hurt him why didnt the saddle hurt me poohi was as much at home in it as if i had been born there and yet it was the first time i was ever on a horse all those old soldiers admired my riding they said they had never seen anything like it but himwhy they had to hold him on all the time  an odor as of breakfast came stealing through the wood the paladin unconsciously inflated his nostrils in lustful response and got up and limped painfully away saying he must go and look to his horse  at bottom he was all right and a goodhearted giant without any harm in him for it is no harm to bark if one stops there and does not bite and it is no harm to be an ass if one is content to bray and not kick if this vast structure of brawn and muscle and vanity and foolishness seemed to have a libelous tongue what of it there was no malice behind it and besides the defect was not of his own creation it was the work of noel rainguesson who had nurtured it fostered it built it up and perfected it for the entertainment he got out of it his careless light heart had to have somebody to nag and chaff and make fun of the paladin had only needed development in order to meet its requirements consequently the development was taken in hand and diligently attended to and looked after gnatandbull fashion for years to the neglect and damage of far more important concerns the result was an unqualified success noel prized the society of the paladin above everybody elses the paladin preferred anybodys to noels the big fellow was often seen with the little fellow but it was for the same reason that the bull is often seen with the gnat  with the first opportunity i had a talk with noel i welcomed him to our expedition and said  it was fine and brave of you to volunteer noel  his eye twinkled and he answered  yes it was rather fine i think still the credit doesnt all belong to me i had help  who helped you  the governor  how  well ill tell you the whole thing i came up from domremy to see the crowds and the general show for i hadnt ever had any experience of such things of course and this was a great opportunity but i hadnt any mind to volunteer i overtook the paladin on the road and let him have my company the rest of the way although he did not want it and said so and while we were gawking and blinking in the glare of the governors torches they seized us and four more and added us to the escort and that is really how i came to volunteer but after all i wasnt sorry remembering how dull life would have been in the village without the paladin  how did he feel about it was he satisfied  i think he was glad  why  because he said he wasnt he was taken by surprise you see and it is not likely that he could tell the truth without preparation not that he would have prepared if he had had the chance for i do not think he would i am not charging him with that in the same space of time that he could prepare to speak the truth he could also prepare to lie besides his judgment would be cool then and would warn him against fooling with new methods in an emergency no i am sure he was glad because he said he wasnt  do you think he was very glad  yes i know he was he begged like a slave and bawled for his mother he said his health was delicate and he didnt know how to ride a horse and he knew he couldnt outlive the first march but really he wasnt looking as delicate as he was feeling there was a cask of wine there a proper lift for four men the governors temper got afire and he delivered an oath at him that knocked up the dust where it struck the ground and told him to shoulder that cask or he would carve him to cutlets and send him home in a basket the paladin did it and that secured his promotion to a privacy in the escort without any further debate  yes you seem to make it quite plain that he was glad to jointhat is if your premises are right that you start from how did he stand the march last night  about as i did if he made the more noise it was the privilege of his bulk we stayed in our saddles because we had help we are equally lame today and if he likes to sit down let him i prefer to stand      chapter 4 joan leads us through the enemy  we were called to quarters and subjected to a searching inspection by joan then she made a short little talk in which she said that even the rude business of war could be conducted better without profanity and other brutalities of speech than with them and that she should strictly require us to remember and apply this admonition she ordered half an hours horsemanship drill for the novices then and appointed one of the veterans to conduct it it was a ridiculous exhibition but we learned something and joan was satisfied and complimented us she did not take any instruction herself or go through the evolutions and manoeuvres but merely sat her horse like a martial little statue and looked on that was sufficient for her you see she would not miss or forget a detail of the lesson she would take it all in with her eye and her mind and apply it afterward with as much certainty and confidence as if she had already practised it  we now made three night marches of twelve or thirteen leagues each riding in peace and undisturbed being taken for a roving band of free companions countryfolk were glad to have that sort of people go by without stopping still they were very wearying marches and not comfortable for the bridges were few and the streams many and as we had to ford them we found the water dismally cold and afterward had to bed ourselves still wet on the frosty or snowy ground and get warm as we might and sleep if we could for it would not have been prudent to build fires our energies languished under these hardships and deadly fatigues but joans did not her step kept its spring and firmness and her eye its fire we could only wonder at this we could not explain it  but if we had had hard times before i know not what to call the five nights that now followed for the marches were as fatiguing the baths as cold and we were ambuscaded seven times in addition and lost two novices and three veterans in the resulting fights the news had leaked out and gone abroad that the inspired virgin of vaucouleurs was making for the king with an escort and all the roads were being watched now  these five nights disheartened the command a good deal this was aggravated by a discovery which noel made and which he promptly made known at headquarters some of the men had been trying to understand why joan continued to be alert vigorous and confident while the strongest men in the company were fagged with the heavy marches and exposure and were become morose and irritable there it shows you how men can have eyes and yet not see all their lives those men had seen their own womenfolks hitched up with a cow and dragging the plow in the fields while the men did the driving they had also seen other evidences that women have far more endurance and patience and fortitude than menbut what good had their seeing these things been to them none it had taught them nothing they were still surprised to see a girl of seventeen bear the fatigues of war better than trained veterans of the army moreover they did not reflect that a great soul with a great purpose can make a weak body strong and keep it so and here was the greatest soul in the universe but how could they know that those dumb creatures no they knew nothing and their reasonings were of a piece with their ignorance they argued and discussed among themselves with noel listening and arrived at the decision that joan was a witch and had her strange pluck and strength from satan so they made a plan to watch for a safe opportunity to take her life  to have secret plottings of this sort going on in our midst was a very serious business of course and the knights asked joans permission to hang the plotters but she refused without hesitancy she said  neither these men nor any others can take my life before my mission is accomplished therefore why should i have their blood upon my hands i will inform them of this and also admonish them call them before me  when they came she made that statement to them in a plain matteroffact way and just as if the thought never entered her mind that any one could doubt it after she had given her word that it was true the men were evidently amazed and impressed to hear her say such a thing in such a sure and confident way for prophecies boldly uttered never fall barren on superstitious ears yes this speech certainly impressed them but her closing remark impressed them still more it was for the ringleader and joan said it sorrowfully  it is a pity that you should plot anothers death when your own is so close at hand  that mans horse stumbled and fell on him in the first ford which we crossed that night and he was drowned before we could help him we had no more conspiracies  this night was harassed with ambuscades but we got through without having any men killed one more night would carry us over the hostile frontier if we had good luck and we saw the night close down with a good deal of solicitude always before we had been more or less reluctant to start out into the gloom and the silence to be frozen in the fords and persecuted by the enemy but this time we were impatient to get under way and have it over although there was promise of more and harder fighting than any of the previous nights had furnished moreover in front of us about three leagues there was a deep stream with a frail wooden bridge over it and as a cold rain mixed with snow had been falling steadily all day we were anxious to find out whether we were in a trap or not if the swollen stream had washed away the bridge we might properly consider ourselves trapped and cut off from escape  as soon as it was dark we filed out from the depth of the forest where we had been hidden and began the march from the time that we had begun to encounter ambushes joan had ridden at the head of the column and she took this post now by the time we had gone a league the rain and snow had turned to sleet and under the impulse of the stormwind it lashed my face like whips and i envied joan and the knights who could close their visors and shut up their heads in their helmets as in a box now out of the pitchy darkness and close at hand came the sharp command  halt  we obeyed i made out a dim mass in front of us which might be a body of horsemen but one could not be sure a man rode up and said to joan in a tone of reproof  well you have taken your time truly and what have you found out is she still behind us or in front  joan answered in a level voice  she is still behind  this news softened the strangers tone he said  if you know that to be true you have not lost your time captain but are you sure how do you know  because i have seen her  seen her seen the virgin herself  yes i have been in her camp  is it possible captain raymond i ask you to pardon me for speaking in that tone just now you have performed a daring and admirable service where was she camped  in the forest not more than a league from here  good i was afraid we might be still behind her but now that we know she is behind us everything is safe she is our game we will hang her you shall hang her yourself no one has so well earned the privilege of abolishing this pestilent limb of satan  i do not know how to thank you sufficiently if we catch her i  if i will take care of that give yourself no uneasiness all i want is just a look at her to see what the imp is like that has been able to make all this noise then you and the halter may have her how many men has she  i counted but eighteen but she may have had two or three pickets out  is that all it wont be a mouthful for my force is it true that she is only a girl  yes she is not more than seventeen  it passes belief is she robust or slender  slender  the officer pondered a moment or two then he said  was she preparing to break camp  not when i had my last glimpse of her  what was she doing  she was talking quietly with an officer  quietly not giving orders  no talking as quietly as we are now  that is good she is feeling a false security she would have been restless and fussy elseit is the way of her sex when danger is about as she was making no preparation to break camp  she certainly was not when i saw her last  and was chatting quietly and at her ease it means that this weather is not to her taste nightmarching in sleet and wind is not for chits of seventeen no she will stay where she is she has my thanks we will camp ourselves here is as good a place as any let us get about it  if you command itcertainly but she has two knights with her they might force her to march particularly if the weather should improve  i was scared and impatient to be getting out of this peril and it distressed and worried me to have joan apparently set herself to work to make delay and increase the dangerstill i thought she probably knew better than i what to do the officer said  well in that case we are here to block the way  yes if they come this way but if they should send out spies and find out enough to make them want to try for the bridge through the woods is it best to allow the bridge to stand  it made me shiver to hear her  the officer considered awhile then said  it might be well enough to send a force to destroy the bridge i was intending to occupy it with the whole command but that is not necessary now  joan said tranquilly  with your permission i will go and destroy it myself  ah now i saw her idea and was glad she had had the cleverness to invent it and the ability to keep her head cool and think of it in that tight place the officer replied  you have it captain and my thanks with you to do it it will be well done i could send another in your place but not a better  they saluted and we moved forward i breathed freer a dozen times i had imagined i heard the hoofbeats of the real captain raymonds troop arriving behind us and had been sitting on pins and needles all the while that that conversation was dragging along i breathed freer but was still not comfortable for joan had given only the simple command forward consequently we moved in a walk moved in a dead walk past a dim and lengthening column of enemies at our side the suspense was exhausting yet it lasted but a short while for when the enemys bugles sang the dismount joan gave the word to trot and that was a great relief to me she was always at herself you see before the command to dismount had been given somebody might have wanted the countersign somewhere along that line if we came flying by at speed but now we seemed to be on our way to our allotted camping position so we were allowed to pass unchallenged the further we went the more formidable was the strength revealed by the hostile force perhaps it was only a hundred or two but to me it seemed a thousand when we passed the last of these people i was thankful and the deeper we plowed into the darkness beyond them the better i felt i came nearer and nearer to feeling good for an hour then we found the bridge still standing and i felt entirely good we crossed it and destroyed it and then i feltbut i cannot describe what i felt one has to feel it himself in order to know what it is like  we had expected to hear the rush of a pursuing force behind us for we thought that the real captain raymond would arrive and suggest that perhaps the troop that had been mistaken for his belonged to the virgin of vaucouleurs but he must have been delayed seriously for when we resumed our march beyond the river there were no sounds behind us except those which the storm was furnishing  i said that joan had harvested a good many compliments intended for captain raymond and that he would find nothing of a crop left but a dry stubble of reprimands when he got back and a commander just in the humor to superintend the gathering of it in  joan said  it will be as you say no doubt for the commander took a troop for granted in the night and unchallenged and would have camped without sending a force to destroy the bridge if he had been left unadvised and none are so ready to find fault with others as those who do things worthy of blame themselves  the sieur bertrand was amused at joans naive way of referring to her advice as if it had been a valuable present to a hostile leader who was saved by it from making a censurable blunder of omission and then he went on to admire how ingeniously she had deceived that man and yet had not told him anything that was not the truth this troubled joan and she said  i thought he was deceiving himself i forbore to tell him lies for that would have been wrong but if my truths deceived him perhaps that made them lies and i am to blame i would god i knew if i have done wrong  she was assured that she had done right and that in the perils and necessities of war deceptions that help ones own cause and hurt the enemys were always permissible but she was not quite satisfied with that and thought that even when a great cause was in danger one ought to have the privilege of trying honorable ways first jean said  joan you told us yourself that you were going to uncle laxarts to nurse his wife but you didnt say you were going further yet you did go on to vaucouleurs there  i see now said joan sorrowfully i told no lie yet i deceived i had tried all other ways first but i could not get away and i had to get away my mission required it i did wrong i think and am to blame  she was silent a moment turning the matter over in her mind then she added with quiet decision but the thing itself was right and i would do it again  it seemed an overnice distinction but nobody said anything if we had known her as well as she knew herself and as her later history revealed her to us we should have perceived that she had a clear meaning there and that her position was not identical with ours as we were supposing but occupied a higher plane she would sacrifice herselfand her best self that is her truthfulnessto save her cause but only that she would not buy her life at that cost whereas our warethics permitted the purchase of our lives or any mere military advantage small or great by deception her saying seemed a commonplace at the time the essence of its meaning escaping us but one sees now that it contained a principle which lifted it above that and made it great and fine  presently the wind died down the sleet stopped falling and the cold was less severe the road was become a bog and the horses labored through it at a walkthey could do no better as the heavy time wore on exhaustion overcame us and we slept in our saddles not even the dangers that threatened us could keep us awake  this tenth night seemed longer than any of the others and of course it was the hardest because we had been accumulating fatigue from the beginning and had more of it on hand now than at any previous time but we were not molested again when the dull dawn came at last we saw a river before us and we knew it was the loire we entered the town of gien and knew we were in a friendly land with the hostiles all behind us that was a glad morning for us  we were a worn and bedraggled and shabbylooking troop and still as always joan was the freshest of us all in both body and spirits we had averaged above thirteen leagues a night by tortuous and wretched roads it was a remarkable march and shows what men can do when they have a leader with a determined purpose and a resolution that never flags      chapter 5 we pierce the last ambuscades  we rested and otherwise refreshed ourselves two or three hours at gien but by that time the news was abroad that the young girl commissioned of god to deliver france was come wherefore such a press of people flocked to our quarters to get sight of her that it seemed best to seek a quieter place so we pushed on and halted at a small village called fierbois  we were now within six leagues of the king who was at the castle of chinon joan dictated a letter to him at once and i wrote it in it she said she had come a hundred and fifty leagues to bring him good news and begged the privilege of delivering it in person she added that although she had never seen him she would know him in any disguise and would point him out  the two knights rode away at once with the letter the troop slept all the afternoon and after supper we felt pretty fresh and fine especially our little group of young domremians we had the comfortable taproom of the village inn to ourselves and for the first time in ten unspeakably long days were exempt from bodings and terrors and hardships and fatiguing labors the paladin was suddenly become his ancient self again and was swaggering up and down a very monument of selfcomplacency noel rainguesson said  i think it is wonderful the way he has brought us through  who asked jean  why the paladin  the paladin seemed not to hear  what had he to do with it asked pierre darc  everything it was nothing but joans confidence in his discretion that enabled her to keep up her heart she could depend on us and on herself for valor but discretion is the winning thing in war after all discretion is the rarest and loftiest of qualities and he has got more of it than any other man in francemore of it perhaps than any other sixty men in france  now you are getting ready to make a fool of yourself noel rainguesson said the paladin and you want to coil some of that long tongue of yours around your neck and stick the end of it in your ear then youll be the less likely to get into trouble  i didnt know he had more discretion than other people said pierre for discretion argues brains and he hasnt any more brains than the rest of us in my opinion  no you are wrong there discretion hasnt anything to do with brains brains are an obstruction to it for it does not reason it feels perfect discretion means absence of brains discretion is a quality of the heartsolely a quality of the heart it acts upon us through feeling we know this because if it were an intellectual quality it would only perceive a danger for instance where a danger exists whereas  hear him twaddlethe damned idiot muttered the paladin  whereas it being purely a quality of the heart and proceeding by feeling not reason its reach is correspondingly wider and sublimer enabling it to perceive and avoid dangers that havent any existence at all as for instance that night in the fog when the paladin took his horses ears for hostile lances and got off and climbed a tree  its a lie a lie without shadow of foundation and i call upon you all to beware you give credence to the malicious inventions of this ramshackle slandermill that has been doing its best to destroy my character for years and will grind up your own reputations for you next i got off to tighten my saddlegirthi wish i may die in my tracks if it isnt soand whoever wants to believe it can and whoever dont can let it alone  there that is the way with him you see he never can discuss a theme temperately but always flies off the handle and becomes disagreeable and you notice his defect of memory he remembers getting off his horse but forgets all the rest even the tree but that is natural he would remember getting off the horse because he was so used to doing it he always did it when there was an alarm and the clash of arms at the front  why did he choose that time for it asked jean  i dont know to tighten up his girth he thinks to climb a tree i think i saw him climb nine trees in a single night  you saw nothing of the kind a person that can lie like that deserves no ones respect i ask you all to answer me do you believe what this reptile has said  all seemed embarrassed and only pierre replied he said hesitatingly  iwell i hardly know what to say it is a delicate situation it seems offensive to me to refuse to believe a person when he makes so direct a statement and yet i am obliged to say rude as it may appear that i am not able to believe the whole of itno i am not able to believe that you climbed nine trees  there cried the paladin now what do you think of yourself noel rainguesson how many do you believe i climbed pierre  only eight  the laughter that followed inflamed the paladins anger to white heat and he said  i bide my timei bide my time i will reckon with you all i promise you that  dont get him started noel pleaded he is a perfect lion when he gets started i saw enough to teach me that after the third skirmish after it was over i saw him come out of the bushes and attack a dead man singlehanded  it is another lie and i give you fair warning that you are going too far you will see me attack a live one if you are not careful  meaning me of course this wounds me more than any number of injurious and unkind speeches could do in gratitude to ones benefactor  benefactor what do i owe you i should like to know  you owe me your life i stood between the trees and the foe and kept hundreds and thousands of the enemy at bay when they were thirsting for your blood and i did not do it to display my daring i did it because i loved you and could not live without you  thereyou have said enough i will not stay here to listen to these infamies i can endure your lies but not your love keep that corruption for somebody with a stronger stomach than mine and i want to say this before i go that you peoples small performances might appear the better and win you the more glory i hid my own deeds through all the march i went always to the front where the fighting was thickest to be remote from you in order that you might not see and be discouraged by the things i did to the enemy it was my purpose to keep this a secret in my own breast but you force me to reveal it if you ask for my witnesses yonder they lie on the road we have come i found that road mud i paved it with corpses i found that country sterile i fertilized it with blood time and again i was urged to go to the rear because the command could not proceed on account of my dead and yet you you miscreant accuse me of climbing trees pah  and he strode out with a lofty air for the recital of his imaginary deeds had already set him up again and made him feel good  next day we mounted and faced toward chinon orleans was at our back now and close by lying in the strangling grip of the english soon please god we would face about and go to their relief from gien the news had spread to orleans that the peasant maid of vaucouleurs was on her way divinely commissioned to raise the siege the news made a great excitement and raised a great hopethe first breath of hope those poor souls had breathed in five months they sent commissioners at once to the king to beg him to consider this matter and not throw this help lightly away these commissioners were already at chinon by this time  when we were halfway to chinon we happened upon yet one more squad of enemies they burst suddenly out of the woods and in considerable force too but we were not the apprentices we were ten or twelve days before no we were seasoned to this kind of adventure now our hearts did not jump into our throats and our weapons tremble in our hands we had learned to be always in battle array always alert and always ready to deal with any emergency that might turn up we were no more dismayed by the sight of those people than our commander was before they could form joan had delivered the order forward and we were down upon them with a rush they stood no chance they turned tail and scattered we plowing through them as if they had been men of straw that was our last ambuscade and it was probably laid for us by that treacherous rascal the kings own minister and favorite de la tremouille  we housed ourselves in an inn and soon the town came flocking to get a glimpse of the maid  ah the tedious king and his tedious people our two good knights came presently their patience well wearied and reported they and we reverently stoodas becomes persons who are in the presence of kings and the superiors of kingsuntil joan troubled by this mark of homage and respect and not content with it nor yet used to it although we had not permitted ourselves to do otherwise since the day she prophesied that wretched traitors death and he was straightway drowned thus confirming many previous signs that she was indeed an ambassador commissioned of god commanded us to sit then the sieur de metz said to joan  the king has got the letter but they will not let us have speech with him  who is it that forbids  none forbids but there be three or four that are nearest his personschemers and traitors every onethat put obstructions in the way and seek all ways by lies and pretexts to make delay chiefest of these are georges de la tremouille and that plotting fox the archbishop of rheims while they keep the king idle and in bondage to his sports and follies they are great and their importance grows whereas if ever he assert himself and rise and strike for crown and country like a man their reign is done so they but thrive they care not if the crown go to destruction and the king with it  you have spoken with others besides these  not of the court nothe court are the meek slaves of those reptiles and watch their mouths and their actions acting as they act thinking as they think saying as they say wherefore they are cold to us and turn aside and go another way when we appear but we have spoken with the commissioners from orleans they said with heat it is a marvel that any man in such desperate case as is the king can moon around in this torpid way and see his all go to ruin without lifting a finger to stay the disaster what a most strange spectacle it is here he is shut up in this wee corner of the realm like a rat in a trap his royal shelter this huge gloomy tomb of a castle with wormy rags for upholstery and crippled furniture for use a very house of desolation in his treasure forty francs and not a farthing more god be witness no army nor any shadow of one and by contrast with his hungry poverty you behold this crownless pauper and his shoals of fools and favorites tricked out in the gaudiest silks and velvets you shall find in any court in christendom and look you he knows that when our city fallsas fall it surely will except succor come swiftlyfrance falls he knows that when that day comes he will be an outlaw and a fugitive and that behind him the english flag will float unchallenged over every acre of his great heritage he knows these things he knows that our faithful city is fighting all solitary and alone against disease starvation and the sword to stay this awful calamity yet he will not strike one blow to save her he will not hear our prayers he will not even look upon our faces that is what the commissioners said and they are in despair  joan said gently  it is pity but they must not despair the dauphin will hear them presently tell them so  she almost always called the king the dauphin to her mind he was not king yet not being crowned  we will tell them so and it will content them for they believe you come from god the archbishop and his confederate have for backer that veteran soldier raoul de gaucourt grand master of the palace a worthy man but simply a soldier with no head for any greater matter he cannot make out to see how a countrygirl ignorant of war can take a sword in her small hand and win victories where the trained generals of france have looked for defeats only for fifty yearsand always found them and so he lifts his frosty mustache and scoffs  when god fights it is but small matter whether the hand that bears his sword is big or little he will perceive this in time is there none in that castle of chinon who favors us  yes the kings motherinlaw yolande queen of sicily who is wise and good she spoke with the sieur bertrand  she favors us and she hates those others the kings beguilers said bertrand she was full of interest and asked a thousand questions all of which i answered according to my ability then she sat thinking over these replies until i thought she was lost in a dream and would wake no more but it was not so at last she said slowly and as if she were talking to herself a child of seventeena girlcountrybreduntaughtignorant of war the use of arms and the conduct of battlesmodest gentle shrinkingyet throws away her shepherds crook and clothes herself in steel and fights her way through a hundred and fifty leagues of fear and comesshe to whom a king must be a dread and awful presenceand will stand up before such an one and say be not afraid god has sent me to save you ah whence could come a courage and conviction so sublime as this but from very god himself she was silent again awhile thinking and making up her mind then she said and whether she comes of god or no there is that in her heart that raises her above menhigh above all men that breathe in france todayfor in her is that mysterious something that puts heart into soldiers and turns mobs of cowards into armies of fighters that forget what fear is when they are in that presencefighters who go into battle with joy in their eyes and songs on their lips and sweep over the field like a stormthat is the spirit that can save france and that alone come it whence it may it is in her i do truly believe for what else could have borne up that child on that great march and made her despise its dangers and fatigues the king must see her face to faceand shall she dismissed me with those good words and i know her promise will be kept they will delay her all they canthose animalsbut she will not fail in the end  would she were king said the other knight fervently for there is little hope that the king himself can be stirred out of his lethargy he is wholly without hope and is only thinking of throwing away everything and flying to some foreign land the commissioners say there is a spell upon him that makes him hopelessyes and that it is shut up in a mystery which they cannot fathom  i know the mystery said joan with quiet confidence i know it and he knows it but no other but god when i see him i will tell him a secret that will drive away his trouble then he will hold up his head again  i was miserable with curiosity to know what it was that she would tell him but she did not say and i did not expect she would she was but a child it is true but she was not a chatterer to tell great matters and make herself important to little people no she was reserved and kept things to herself as the truly great always do  the next day queen yolande got one victory over the kings keepers for in spite of their protestations and obstructions she procured an audience for our two knights and they made the most they could out of their opportunity they told the king what a spotless and beautiful character joan was and how great and noble a spirit animated her and they implored him to trust in her believe in her and have faith that she was sent to save france they begged him to consent to see her he was strongly moved to do this and promised that he would not drop the matter out of his mind but would consult with his council about it this began to look encouraging two hours later there was a great stir below and the innkeeper came flying up to say a commission of illustrious ecclesiastics was come from the kingfrom the king his very self understandthink of this vast honor to his humble little hostelryand he was so overcome with the glory of it that he could hardly find breath enough in his excited body to put the facts into words they were come from the king to speak with the maid of vaucouleurs then he flew downstairs and presently appeared again backing into the room and bowing to the ground with every step in front of four imposing and austere bishops and their train of servants  joan rose and we all stood the bishops took seats and for a while no word was said for it was their prerogative to speak first and they were so astonished to see what a child it was that was making such a noise in the world and degrading personages of their dignity to the base function of ambassadors to her in her plebeian tavern that they could not find any words to say at first then presently their spokesman told joan they were aware that she had a message for the king wherefore she was now commanded to put it into words briefly and without waste of time or embroideries of speech  as for me i could hardly contain my joyour message was to reach the king at last and there was the same joy and pride and exultation in the faces of our knights too and in those of joans brothers and i knew that they were all prayingas i wasthat the awe which we felt in the presence of these great dignitaries and which would have tied our tongues and locked our jaws would not affect her in the like degree but that she would be enabled to word her message well and with little stumbling and so make a favorable impression here where it would be so valuable and so important  ah dear how little we were expecting what happened then we were aghast to hear her say what she said she was standing in a reverent attitude with her head down and her hands clasped in front of her for she was always reverent toward the consecrated servants of god when the spokesman had finished she raised her head and set her calm eye on those faces not any more disturbed by their state and grandeur than a princess would have been and said with all her ordinary simplicity and modesty of voice and manner  ye will forgive me reverend sirs but i have no message save for the kings ear alone  those surprised men were dumb for a moment and their faces flushed darkly then the spokesman said  hark ye to you fling the kings command in his face and refuse to deliver this message of yours to his servants appointed to receive it  god has appointed me to receive it and anothers commandment may not take precedence of that i pray you let me have speech for his grace the dauphin  forbear this folly and come at your message deliver it and waste no more time about it  you err indeed most reverend fathers in god and it is not well i am not come hither to talk but to deliver orleans and lead the dauphin to his good city of rheims and set the crown upon his head  is that the message you send to the king  but joan only said in the simple fashion which was her wont  ye will pardon me for reminding you againbut i have no message to send to any one  the kings messengers rose in deep anger and swept out of the place without further words we and joan kneeling as they passed  our countenances were vacant our hearts full of a sense of disaster our precious opportunity was thrown away we could not understand joans conduct she who had been so wise until this fatal hour at last the sieur bertrand found courage to ask her why she had let this great chance to get her message to the king go by  who sent them here she asked  the king  who moved the king to send them she waited for an answer none came for we began to see what was in her mindso she answered herself the dauphins council moved him to it are they enemies to me and to the dauphins weal or are they friends  enemies answered the sieur bertrand  if one would have a message go sound and ungarbled does one choose traitors and tricksters to send it by  i saw that we had been fools and she wise they saw it too so none found anything to say then she went on  they had but small wit that contrived this trap they thought to get my message and seem to deliver it straight yet deftly twist it from its purpose you know that one part of my message is but thisto move the dauphin by argument and reasonings to give me menatarms and send me to the siege if an enemy carried these in the right words the exact words and no word missing yet left out the persuasions of gesture and supplicating tone and beseeching looks that inform the words and make them live where were the value of that argumentwhom could it convince be patient the dauphin will hear me presently have no fear  the sieur de metz nodded his head several times and muttered as to himself  she was right and wise and we are but dull fools when all is said  it was just my thought i could have said it myself and indeed it was the thought of all there present a sort of awe crept over us to think how that untaught girl taken suddenly and unprepared was yet able to penetrate the cunning devices of a kings trained advisers and defeat them marveling over this and astonished at it we fell silent and spoke no more we had come to know that she was great in courage fortitude endurance patience conviction fidelity to all dutiesin all things indeed that make a good and trusty soldier and perfect him for his post now we were beginning to feel that maybe there were greatnesses in her brain that were even greater than these great qualities of the heart it set us thinking  what joan did that day bore fruit the very day after the king was obliged to respect the spirit of a young girl who could hold her own and stand her ground like that and he asserted himself sufficiently to put his respect into an act instead of into polite and empty words he moved joan out of that poor inn and housed her with us her servants in the castle of courdray personally confiding her to the care of madame de bellier wife of old raoul de gaucourt master of the palace of course this royal attention had an immediate result all the great lords and ladies of the court began to flock there to see and listen to the wonderful girlsoldier that all the world was talking about and who had answered the kings mandate with a bland refusal to obey joan charmed them every one with her sweetness and simplicity and unconscious eloquence and all the best and capablest among them recognized that there was an indefinable something about her that testified that she was not made of common clay that she was built on a grander plan than the mass of mankind and moved on a loftier plane these spread her fame she always made friends and advocates that way neither the high nor the low could come within the sound of her voice and the sight of her face and go out from her presence indifferent      chapter 6 joan convinces the king  well anything to make delay the kings council advised him against arriving at a decision in our matter too precipitately he arrive at a decision too precipitately so they sent a committee of priestsalways priestsinto lorraine to inquire into joans character and historya matter which would consume several weeks of course you see how fastidious they were it was as if people should come to put out the fire when a mans house was burning down and they waited till they could send into another country to find out if he had always kept the sabbath or not before letting him try  so the days poked along dreary for us young people in some ways but not in all for we had one great anticipation in front of us we had never seen a king and now some day we should have that prodigious spectacle to see and to treasure in our memories all our lives so we were on the lookout and always eager and watching for the chance the others were doomed to wait longer than i as it turned out one day great news camethe orleans commissioners with yolande and our knights had at last turned the councils position and persuaded the king to see joan  joan received the immense news gratefully but without losing her head but with us others it was otherwise we could not eat or sleep or do any rational thing for the excitement and the glory of it during two days our pair of noble knights were in distress and trepidation on joans account for the audience was to be at night and they were afraid that joan would be so paralyzed by the glare of light from the long files of torches the solemn pomps and ceremonies the great concourse of renowned personages the brilliant costumes and the other splendors of the court that she a simple countrymaid and all unused to such things would be overcome by these terrors and make a piteous failure  no doubt i could have comforted them but i was not free to speak would joan be disturbed by this cheap spectacle this tinsel show with its small king and his butterfly dukeletsshe who had spoken face to face with the princes of heaven the familiars of god and seen their retinue of angels stretching back into the remoteness of the sky myriads upon myriads like a measureless fan of light a glory like the glory of the sun streaming from each of those innumerable heads the massed radiance filling the deeps of space with a blinding splendor i thought not  queen yolande wanted joan to make the best possible impression upon the king and the court so she was strenuous to have her clothed in the richest stuffs wrought upon the princeliest pattern and set off with jewels but in that she had to be disappointed of course joan not being persuadable to it but begging to be simply and sincerely dressed as became a servant of god and one sent upon a mission of a serious sort and grave political import so then the gracious queen imagined and contrived that simple and witching costume which i have described to you so many times and which i cannot think of even now in my dull age without being moved just as rhythmical and exquisite music moves one for that was music that dressthat is what it wasmusic that one saw with the eyes and felt in the heart yes she was a poem she was a dream she was a spirit when she was clothed in that  she kept that raiment always and wore it several times upon occasions of state and it is preserved to this day in the treasury of orleans with two of her swords and her banner and other things now sacred because they had belonged to her  at the appointed time the count of vendome a great lord of the court came richly clothed with his train of servants and assistants to conduct joan to the king and the two knights and i went with her being entitled to this privilege by reason of our official positions near her person  when we entered the great audiencehall there it all was just as i have already painted it here were ranks of guards in shining armor and with polished halberds two sides of the hall were like flowergardens for variety of color and the magnificence of the costumes light streamed upon these masses of color from two hundred and fifty flambeaux there was a wide free space down the middle of the hall and at the end of it was a throne royally canopied and upon it sat a crowned and sceptered figure nobly clothed and blazing with jewels  it is true that joan had been hindered and put off a good while but now that she was admitted to an audience at last she was received with honors granted to only the greatest personages at the entrance door stood four heralds in a row in splendid tabards with long slender silver trumpets at their mouths with square silken banners depending from them embroidered with the arms of france as joan and the count passed by these trumpets gave forth in unison one long rich note and as we moved down the hall under the pictured and gilded vaulting this was repeated at every fifty feet of our progresssix times in all it made our good knights proud and happy and they held themselves erect and stiffened their stride and looked fine and soldierly they were not expecting this beautiful and honorable tribute to our little countrymaid  joan walked two yards behind the count we three walked two yards behind joan our solemn march ended when we were as yet some eight or ten steps from the throne the count made a deep obeisance pronounced joans name then bowed again and moved to his place among a group of officials near the throne i was devouring the crowned personage with all my eyes and my heart almost stood still with awe  the eyes of all others were fixed upon joan in a gaze of wonder which was half worship and which seemed to say how sweethow lovelyhow divine all lips were parted and motionless which was a sure sign that those people who seldom forget themselves had forgotten themselves now and were not conscious of anything but the one object they were gazing upon they had the look of people who are under the enchantment of a vision  then they presently began to come to life again rousing themselves out of the spell and shaking it off as one drives away little by little a clinging drowsiness or intoxication now they fixed their attention upon joan with a strong new interest of another sort they were full of curiosity to see what she would dothey having a secret and particular reason for this curiosity so they watched this is what they saw  she made no obeisance nor even any slight inclination of her head but stood looking toward the throne in silence that was all there was to see at present  i glanced up at de metz and was shocked at the paleness of his face i whispered and said  what is it man what is it  his answering whisper was so weak i could hardly catch it  they have taken advantage of the hint in her letter to play a trick upon her she will err and they will laugh at her that is not the king that sits there  then i glanced at joan she was still gazing steadfastly toward the throne and i had the curious fancy that even her shoulders and the back of her head expressed bewilderment now she turned her head slowly and her eye wandered along the lines of standing courtiers till it fell upon a young man who was very quietly dressed then her face lighted joyously and she ran and threw herself at his feet and clasped his knees exclaiming in that soft melodious voice which was her birthright and was now charged with deep and tender feeling  god of his grace give you long life o dear and gentle dauphin  in his astonishment and exultation de metz cried out  by the shadow of god it is an amazing thing then he mashed all the bones of my hand in his grateful grip and added with a proud shake of his mane now what have these painted infidels to say  meantime the young person in the plain clothes was saying to joan  ah you mistake my child i am not the king there he is and he pointed to the throne  the knights face clouded and he muttered in grief and indignation  ah it is a shame to use her so but for this lie she had gone through safe i will go and proclaim to all the house what  stay where you are whispered i and the sieur bertrand in a breath and made him stop in his place  joan did not stir from her knees but still lifted her happy face toward the king and said  no gracious liege you are he and none other  de metzs troubles vanished away and he said  verily she was not guessing she knew now how could she know it is a miracle i am content and will meddle no more for i perceive that she is equal to her occasions having that in her head that cannot profitably be helped by the vacancy that is in mine  this interruption of his lost me a remark or two of the other talk however i caught the kings next question  but tell me who you are and what would you  i am called joan the maid and am sent to say that the king of heaven wills that you be crowned and consecrated in your good city of rheims and be thereafter lieutenant of the lord of heaven who is king of france and he willeth also that you set me at my appointed work and give me menatarms after a slight pause she added her eye lighting at the sound of her words for then will i raise the siege of orleans and break the english power  the young monarchs amused face sobered a little when this martial speech fell upon that sick air like a breath blown from embattled camps and fields of war and this trifling smile presently faded wholly away and disappeared he was grave now and thoughtful after a little he waved his hand lightly and all the people fell away and left those two by themselves in a vacant space the knights and i moved to the opposite side of the hall and stood there we saw joan rise at a sign then she and the king talked privately together  all that host had been consumed with curiosity to see what joan would do well they had seen and now they were full of astonishment to see that she had really performed that strange miracle according to the promise in her letter and they were fully as much astonished to find that she was not overcome by the pomps and splendors about her but was even more tranquil and at her ease in holding speech with a monarch than ever they themselves had been with all their practice and experience  as for our two knights they were inflated beyond measure with pride in joan but nearly dumb as to speech they not being able to think out any way to account for her managing to carry herself through this imposing ordeal without ever a mistake or an awkwardness of any kind to mar the grace and credit of her great performance  the talk between joan and the king was long and earnest and held in low voices we could not hear but we had our eyes and could note effects and presently we and all the house noted one effect which was memorable and striking and has been set down in memoirs and histories and in testimony at the process of rehabilitation by some who witnessed it for all knew it was big with meaning though none knew what that meaning was at that time of course for suddenly we saw the king shake off his indolent attitude and straighten up like a man and at the same time look immeasurably astonished it was as if joan had told him something almost too wonderful for belief and yet of a most uplifting and welcome nature  it was long before we found out the secret of this conversation but we know it now and all the world knows it that part of the talk was like thisas one may read in all histories the perplexed king asked joan for a sign he wanted to believe in her and her mission and that her voices were supernatural and endowed with knowledge hidden from mortals but how could he do this unless these voices could prove their claim in some absolutely unassailable way it was then that joan said  i will give you a sign and you shall no more doubt there is a secret trouble in your heart which you speak of to nonea doubt which wastes away your courage and makes you dream of throwing all away and fleeing from your realm within this little while you have been praying in your own breast that god of his grace would resolve that doubt even if the doing of it must show you that no kingly right is lodged in you  it was that that amazed the king for it was as she had said his prayer was the secret of his own breast and none but god could know about it so he said  the sign is sufficient i know now that these voices are of god they have said true in this matter if they have said more tell it mei will believe  they have resolved that doubt and i bring their very words which are these thou art lawful heir to the king thy father and true heir of france god has spoken it now lift up thy head and doubt no more but give me menatarms and let me get about my work  telling him he was of lawful birth was what straightened him up and made a man of him for a moment removing his doubts upon that head and convincing him of his royal right and if any could have hanged his hindering and pestiferous council and set him free he would have answered joans prayer and set her in the field but no those creatures were only checked not checkmated they could invent some more delays  we had been made proud by the honors which had so distinguished joans entrance into that placehonors restricted to personages of very high rank and worthbut that pride was as nothing compared with the pride we had in the honor done her upon leaving it for whereas those first honors were shown only to the great these last up to this time had been shown only to the royal the king himself led joan by the hand down the great hall to the door the glittering multitude standing and making reverence as they passed and the silver trumpets sounding those rich notes of theirs then he dismissed her with gracious words bending low over her hand and kissing it alwaysfrom all companies high or lowshe went forth richer in honor and esteem than when she came  and the king did another handsome thing by joan for he sent us back to courdray castle torchlighted and in state under escort of his own troophis guard of honorthe only soldiers he had and finely equipped and bedizened they were too though they hadnt seen the color of their wages since they were children as a body might say the wonders which joan had been performing before the king had been carried all around by this time so the road was so packed with people who wanted to get a sight of her that we could hardly dig through and as for talking together we couldnt all attempts at talk being drowned in the storm of shoutings and huzzas that broke out all along as we passed and kept abreast of us like a wave the whole way      chapter 7 our paladin in his glory  we were doomed to suffer tedious waits and delays and we settled ourselves down to our fate and bore it with a dreary patience counting the slow hours and the dull days and hoping for a turn when god should please to send it the paladin was the only exceptionthat is to say he was the only one who was happy and had no heavy times this was partly owing to the satisfaction he got out of his clothes he bought them at second handa spanish cavaliers complete suit widebrimmed hat with flowing plumes lace collar and cuffs faded velvet doublet and trunks short cloak hung from the shoulder funneltopped buskins long rapier and all thata graceful and picturesque costume and the paladins great frame was the right place to hang it for effect he wore it when off duty and when he swaggered by with one hand resting on the hilt of his rapier and twirling his new mustache with the other everybody stopped to look and admire and well they might for he was a fine and stately contrast to the small french gentlemen of the day squeezed into the trivial french costume of the time  he was king bee of the little village that snuggled under the shelter of the frowning towers and bastions of courdray castle and acknowledged lord of the taproom of the inn when he opened his mouth there he got a hearing those simple artisans and peasants listened with deep and wondering interest for he was a traveler and had seen the worldall of it that lay between chinon and domremy at any rateand that was a wide stretch more of it than they might ever hope to see and he had been in battle and knew how to paint its shock and struggle its perils and surprises with an art that was all his own he was cock of that walk hero of that hostelry he drew custom as honey draws flies so he was the pet of the innkeeper and of his wife and daughter and they were his obliged and willing servants  most people who have the narrative giftthat great and rare endowmenthave with it the defect of telling their choice things over the same way every time and this injures them and causes them to sound stale and wearisome after several repetitions but it was not so with the paladin whose art was of a finer sort it was more stirring and interesting to hear him tell about a battle the tenth time than it was the first time because he did not tell it twice the same way but always made a new battle of it and a better one with more casualties on the enemys side each time and more general wreck and disaster all around and more widows and orphans and suffering in the neighborhood where it happened he could not tell his battles apart himself except by their names and by the time he had told one of then ten times it had grown so that there wasnt room enough in france for it any more but was lapping over the edges but up to that point the audience would not allow him to substitute a new battle knowing that the old ones were the best and sure to improve as long as france could hold them and so instead of saying to him as they would have said to another give us something fresh we are fatigued with that old thing they would say with one voice and with a strong interest tell about the surprise at beaulieu againtell it three or four times that is a compliment which few narrative experts have heard in their lifetime  at first when the paladin heard us tell about the glories of the royal audience he was brokenhearted because he was not taken with us to it next his talk was full of what he would have done if he had been there and within two days he was telling what he did do when he was there his mill was fairly started now and could be trusted to take care of its affair within three nights afterward all his battles were taking a rest for already his worshipers in the taproom were so infatuated with the great tale of the royal audience that they would have nothing else and so besotted with it were they that they would have cried if they could not have gotten it  noel rainguesson hid himself and heard it and came and told me and after that we went together to listen bribing the inn hostess to let us have her little private parlor where we could stand at the wickets in the door and see and hear  the taproom was large yet had a snug and cozy look with its inviting little tables and chairs scattered irregularly over its red brick floor and its great fire flaming and crackling in the wide chimney it was a comfortable place to be in on such chilly and blustering march nights as these and a goodly company had taken shelter there and were sipping their wine in contentment and gossiping one with another in a neighborly way while they waited for the historian the host the hostess and their pretty daughter were flying here and there and yonder among the tables and doing their best to keep up with the orders the room was about forty feet square and a space or aisle down the center of it had been kept vacant and reserved for the paladins needs at the end of it was a platform ten or twelve feet wide with a big chair and a small table on it and three steps leading up to it  among the winesippers were many familiar faces the cobbler the farrier the blacksmith the wheelwright the armorer the maltster the weaver the baker the millers man with his dusty coat and so on and conscious and important as a matter of course was the barbersurgeon for he is that in all villages as he has to pull everybodys teeth and purge and bleed all the grown people once a month to keep their health sound he knows everybody and by constant contact with all sorts of folk becomes a master of etiquette and manners and a conversationalist of large facility there were plenty of carriers drovers and their sort and journeymen artisans  when the paladin presently came sauntering indolently in he was received with a cheer and the barber hustled forward and greeted him with several low and most graceful and courtly bows also taking his hand and touching his lips to it then he called in a loud voice for a stoup of wine for the paladin and when the hosts daughter brought it up on the platform and dropped her courtesy and departed the barber called after her and told her to add the wine to his score this won him ejaculations of approval which pleased him very much and made his little rateyes shine and such applause is right and proper for when we do a liberal and gallant thing it is but natural that we should wish to see notice taken of it  the barber called upon the people to rise and drink the paladins health and they did it with alacrity and affectionate heartiness clashing their metal flagons together with a simultaneous crash and heightening the effect with a resounding cheer it was a fine thing to see how that young swashbuckler had made himself so popular in a strange land in so little a while and without other helps to his advancement than just his tongue and the talent to use it given him by goda talent which was but one talent in the beginning but was now become ten through husbandry and the increment and usufruct that do naturally follow that and reward it as by a law  the people sat down and began to hammer on the tables with their flagons and call for the kings audiencethe kings audiencethe kings audience the paladin stood there in one of his best attitudes with his plumed great hat tipped over to the left the folds of his short cloak drooping from his shoulder and the one hand resting upon the hilt of his rapier and the other lifting his beaker as the noise died down he made a stately sort of a bow which he had picked up somewhere then fetched his beaker with a sweep to his lips and tilted his head back and drained it to the bottom the barber jumped for it and set it upon the paladins table then the paladin began to walk up and down his platform with a great deal of dignity and quite at his ease and as he walked he talked and every little while stopped and stood facing his house and so standing continued his talk  we went three nights in succession it was plain that there was a charm about the performance that was apart from the mere interest which attaches to lying it was presently discoverable that this charm lay in the paladins sincerity he was not lying consciously he believed what he was saying to him his initial statements were facts and whenever he enlarged a statement the enlargement became a fact too he put his heart into his extravagant narrative just as a poet puts his heart into a heroic fiction and his earnestness disarmed criticismdisarmed it as far as he himself was concerned nobody believed his narrative but all believed that he believed it  he made his enlargements without flourish without emphasis and so casually that often one failed to notice that a change had been made he spoke of the governor of vaucouleurs the first night simply as the governor of vaucouleurs he spoke of him the second night as his uncle the governor of vaucouleurs the third night he was his father he did not seem to know that he was making these extraordinary changes they dropped from his lips in a quite natural and effortless way by his first nights account the governor merely attached him to the maids military escort in a general and unofficial way the second night his uncle the governor sent him with the maid as lieutenant of her rear guard the third night his father the governor put the whole command maid and all in his special charge the first night the governor spoke of him as a youth without name or ancestry but destined to achieve both the second night his uncle the governor spoke of him as the latest and worthiest lineal descendent of the chiefest and noblest of the twelve paladins of charlemagne the third night he spoke of him as the lineal descendent of the whole dozen in three nights he promoted the count of vendome from a fresh acquaintance to a schoolmate and then brotherinlaw  at the kings audience everything grew in the same way first the four silver trumpets were twelve then thirtyfive finally ninetysix and by that time he had thrown in so many drums and cymbals that he had to lengthen the hall from five hundred feet to nine hundred to accommodate them under his hand the people present multiplied in the same large way  the first two nights he contented himself with merely describing and exaggerating the chief dramatic incident of the audience but the third night he added illustration to description he throned the barber in his own high chair to represent the sham king then he told how the court watched the maid with intense interest and suppressed merriment expecting to see her fooled by the deception and get herself swept permanently out of credit by the storm of scornful laughter which would follow he worked this scene up till he got his house in a burning fever of excitement and anticipation then came his climax turning to the barber he said  but mark you what she did she gazed steadfastly upon that shams villain face as i now gaze upon yoursthis being her noble and simple attitude just as i stand nowthen turned shethusto me and stretching her arm outsoand pointing with her finger she said in that firm calm tone which she was used to use in directing the conduct of a battle pluck me this false knave from the throne i striding forward as i do now took him by the collar and lifted him out and held him aloftthusas if he had been but a child the house rose shouting stamping and banging with their flagons and went fairly mad over this magnificent exhibition of strengthand there was not the shadow of a laugh anywhere though the spectacle of the limp but proud barber hanging there in the air like a puppy held by the scruff of its neck was a thing that had nothing of solemnity about it then i set him down upon his feetthusbeing minded to get him by a better hold and heave him out of the window but she bid me forbear so by that error he escaped with his life  then she turned her about and viewed the throng with those eyes of hers which are the clearshining windows whence her immortal wisdom looketh out upon the world resolving its falsities and coming at the kernel of truth that is hid within them and presently they fell upon a young man modestly clothed and him she proclaimed for what he truly was saying i am thy servantthou art the king then all were astonished and a great shout went up the whole six thousand joining in it so that the walls rocked with the volume and the tumult of it  he made a fine and picturesque thing of the marchout from the audience augmenting the glories of it to the last limit of the impossibilities then he took from his finger and held up a brass nut from a bolthead which the head ostler at the castle had given him that morning and made his conclusionthus  then the king dismissed the maid most graciouslyas indeed was her desertand turning to me said take this signetring son of the paladins and command me with it in your day of need and look you said he touching my temple preserve this brain france has use for it and look well to its casket also for i foresee that it will be hooped with a ducal coronet one day i took the ring and knelt and kissed his hand saying sire where glory calls there will i be found where danger and death are thickest that is my native air when france and the throne need helpwell i say nothing for i am not of the talking sortlet my deeds speak for me it is all i ask  so ended the most fortunate and memorable episode so big with future weal for the crown and the nation and unto god be the thanks rise fill your flagons nowto france and the kingdrink  they emptied them to the bottom then burst into cheers and huzzas and kept it up as much as two minutes the paladin standing at stately ease the while and smiling benignantly from his platform      chapter 8 joan persuades her inquisitors  when joan told the king what that deep secret was that was torturing his heart his doubts were cleared away he believed she was sent of god and if he had been let alone he would have set her upon her great mission at once but he was not let alone tremouille and the holy fox of rheims knew their man all they needed to say was thisand they said it  your highness says her voices have revealed to you by her mouth a secret known only to yourself and god how can you know that her voices are not of satan and she his mouthpiecefor does not satan know the secrets of men and use his knowledge for the destruction of their souls it is a dangerous business and your highness will do well not to proceed in it without probing the matter to the bottom  that was enough it shriveled up the kings little soul like a raisin with terrors and apprehensions and straightway he privately appointed a commission of bishops to visit and question joan daily until they should find out whether her supernatural helps hailed from heaven or from hell  the kings relative the duke of alencon three years prisoner of war to the english was in these days released from captivity through promise of a great ransom and the name and fame of the maid having reached himfor the same filled all mouths now and penetrated to all partshe came to chinon to see with his own eyes what manner of creature she might be the king sent for joan and introduced her to the duke she said in her simple fashion  you are welcome the more of the blood of france that is joined to this cause the better for the cause and it  then the two talked together and there was just the usual result when they departed the duke was her friend and advocate  joan attended the kings mass the next day and afterward dined with the king and the duke the king was learning to prize her company and value her conversation and that might well be for like other kings he was used to getting nothing out of peoples talk but guarded phrases colorless and noncommittal or carefully tinted to tally with the color of what he said himself and so this kind of conversation only vexes and bores and is wearisome but joans talk was fresh and free sincere and honest and unmarred by timorous selfwatching and constraint she said the very thing that was in her mind and said it in a plain straightforward way one can believe that to the king this must have been like fresh cold water from the mountains to parched lips used to the water of the sunbaked puddles of the plain  after dinner joan so charmed the duke with her horsemanship and lance practice in the meadows by the castle of chinon whither the king also had come to look on that he made her a present of a great black warsteed  every day the commission of bishops came and questioned joan about her voices and her mission and then went to the king with their report these pryings accomplished but little she told as much as she considered advisable and kept the rest to herself both threats and trickeries were wasted upon her she did not care for the threats and the traps caught nothing she was perfectly frank and childlike about these things she knew the bishops were sent by the king that their questions were the kings questions and that by all law and custom a kings questions must be answered yet she told the king in her naive way at his own table one day that she answered only such of those questions as suited her  the bishops finally concluded that they couldnt tell whether joan was sent by god or not they were cautious you see there were two powerful parties at court therefore to make a decision either way would infallibly embroil them with one of those parties so it seemed to them wisest to roost on the fence and shift the burden to other shoulders and that is what they did they made final report that joans case was beyond their powers and recommended that it be put into the hands of the learned and illustrious doctors of the university of poitiers then they retired from the field leaving behind them this little item of testimony wrung from them by joans wise reticence they said she was a gentle and simple little shepherdess very candid but not given to talking  it was quite truein their case but if they could have looked back and seen her with us in the happy pastures of domremy they would have perceived that she had a tongue that could go fast enough when no harm could come of her words  so we traveled to poitiers to endure there three weeks of tedious delay while this poor child was being daily questioned and badgered before a great bench ofwhat military expertssince what she had come to apply for was an army and the privilege of leading it to battle against the enemies of france oh no it was a great bench of priests and monksprofoundly leaned and astute casuistsrenowned professors of theology instead of setting a military commission to find out if this valorous little soldier could win victories they set a company of holy hairsplitters and phrasemongers to work to find out if the soldier was sound in her piety and had no doctrinal leaks the rats were devouring the house but instead of examining the cats teeth and claws they only concerned themselves to find out if it was a holy cat if it was a pious cat a moral cat all right never mind about the other capacities they were of no consequence  joan was as sweetly selfpossessed and tranquil before this grim tribunal with its robed celebrities its solemn state and imposing ceremonials as if she were but a spectator and not herself on trial she sat there solitary on her bench untroubled and disconcerted the science of the sages with her sublime ignorancean ignorance which was a fortress arts wiles the learning drawn from books and all like missiles rebounded from its unconscious masonry and fell to the ground harmless they could not dislodge the garrison which was withinjoans serene great heart and spirit the guards and keepers of her mission  she answered all questions frankly and she told all the story of her visions and of her experiences with the angels and what they said to her and the manner of the telling was so unaffected and so earnest and sincere and made it all seem so lifelike and real that even that hard practical court forgot itself and sat motionless and mute listening with a charmed and wondering interest to the end and if you would have other testimony than mine look in the histories and you will find where an eyewitness giving sworn testimony in the rehabilitation process says that she told that tale with a noble dignity and simplicity and as to its effect says in substance what i have said seventeen she wasseventeen and all alone on her bench by herself yet was not afraid but faced that great company of erudite doctors of law and theology and by the help of no art learned in the schools but using only the enchantments which were hers by nature of youth sincerity a voice soft and musical and an eloquence whose source was the heart not the head she laid that spell upon them now was not that a beautiful thing to see if i could i would put it before you just as i saw it then i know what you would say  as i have told you she could not read one day they harried and pestered her with arguments reasonings objections and other windy and wordy trivialities gathered out of the works of this and that and the other great theological authority until at last her patience vanished and she turned upon them sharply and said  i dont know a from b but i know this that i am come by command of the lord of heaven to deliver orleans from the english power and crown the king of rheims and the matters ye are puttering over are of no consequence  necessarily those were trying days for her and wearing for everybody that took part but her share was the hardest for she had no holidays but must be always on hand and stay the long hours through whereas this that and the other inquisitor could absent himself and rest up from his fatigues when he got worn out and yet she showed no wear no weariness and but seldom let fly her temper as a rule she put her day through calm alert patient fencing with those veteran masters of scholarly swordplay and coming out always without a scratch  one day a dominican sprung upon her a question which made everybody cock up his ears with interest as for me i trembled and said to myself she is done this time poor joan for there is no way of answering this the sly dominican began in this wayin a sort of indolent fashion as if the thing he was about was a matter of no moment  you assert that god has willed to deliver france from this english bondage  yes he has willed it  you wish for menatarms so that you may go to the relief of orleans i believe  yesand the sooner the better  god is allpowerful and able to do whatsoever thing he wills to do is it not so  most surely none doubts it  the dominican lifted his head suddenly and sprung that question i have spoken of with exultation  then answer me this if he has willed to deliver france and is able to do whatsoever he wills where is the need for menatarms  there was a fine stir and commotion when he said that and a sudden thrusting forward of heads and putting up of hands to ears to catch the answer and the dominican wagged his head with satisfaction and looked about him collecting his applause for it shone in every face but joan was not disturbed there was no note of disquiet in her voice when she answered  he helps who help themselves the sons of france will fight the battles but he will give the victory  you could see a light of admiration sweep the house from face to face like a ray from the sun even the dominican himself looked pleased to see his masterstroke so neatly parried and i heard a venerable bishop mutter in the phrasing common to priest and people in that robust time by god the child has said true he willed that goliath should be slain and he sent a child like this to do it  another day when the inquisition had dragged along until everybody looked drowsy and tired but joan brother seguin professor of theology at the university of poitiers who was a sour and sarcastic man fell to plying joan with all sorts of nagging questions in his bastard limousin frenchfor he was from limoges finally he said  how is it that you understand those angels what language did they speak  french  indeed how pleasant to know that our language is so honored good french  yesperfect  perfect eh well certainly you ought to know it was even better than your own eh  as to that ii believe i cannot say said she and was going on but stopped then she added almost as if she were saying it to herself still it was an improvement on yours  i knew there was a chuckle back of her eyes for all their innocence everybody shouted brother seguin was nettled and asked brusquely  do you believe in god  joan answered with an irritating nonchalance  oh well yesbetter than you it is likely  brother seguin lost his patience and heaped sarcasm after sarcasm upon her and finally burst out in angry earnest exclaiming  very well i can tell you this you whose belief in god is so great god has not willed that any shall believe in you without a sign where is your signshow it  this roused joan and she was on her feet in a moment and flung out her retort with spirit  i have not come to poitiers to show signs and do miracles send me to orleans and you shall have signs enough give me menatarmsfew or manyand let me go  the fire was leaping from her eyesah the heroic little figure cant you see her there was a great burst of acclamations and she sat down blushing for it was not in her delicate nature to like being conspicuous  this speech and that episode about the french language scored two points against brother seguin while he scored nothing against joan yet sour man as he was he was a manly man and honest as you can see by the histories for at the rehabilitation he could have hidden those unlucky incidents if he had chosen but he didnt do it but spoke them right out in his evidence  on one of the latter days of that threeweeks session the gowned scholars and professors made one grand assault all along the line fairly overwhelming joan with objections and arguments culled from the writings of every ancient and illustrious authority of the roman church she was wellnigh smothered but at last she shook herself free and struck back crying out  listen the book of god is worth more than all these ye cite and i stand upon it and i tell ye there are things in that book that not one among ye can read with all your learning  from the first she was the guest by invitation of the dame de rabateau wife of a councilor of the parliament of poitiers and to that house the great ladies of the city came nightly to see joan and talk with her and not these only but the old lawyers councilors and scholars of the parliament and the university and these grave men accustomed to weigh every strange and questionable thing and cautiously consider it and turn it about this way and that and still doubt it came night after night and night after night falling ever deeper and deeper under the influence of that mysterious something that spell that elusive and unwordable fascination which was the supremest endowment of joan of arc that winning and persuasive and convincing something which high and low alike recognized and felt but which neither high nor low could explain or describe and one by one they all surrendered saying this child is sent of god  all day long joan in the great court and subject to its rigid rules of procedure was at a disadvantage her judges had things their own way but at night she held court herself and matters were reversed she presiding with her tongue free and her same judges there before her there could not be but one result all the objections and hindrances they could build around her with their hard labors of the day she would charm away at night in the end she carried her judges with her in a mass and got her great verdict without a dissenting voice  the court was a sight to see when the president of it read it from his throne for all the great people of the town were there who could get admission and find room first there were some solemn ceremonies proper and usual at such times then when there was silence again the reading followed penetrating the deep hush so that every word was heard in even the remotest parts of the house  it is found and is hereby declared that joan of arc called the maid is a good christian and a good catholic that there is nothing in her person or her words contrary to the faith and that the king may and ought to accept the succor she offers for to repel it would be to offend the holy spirit and render him unworthy of the air of god  the court rose and then the storm of plaudits burst forth unrebuked dying down and bursting forth again and again and i lost sight of joan for she was swallowed up in a great tide of people who rushed to congratulate her and pour out benedictions upon her and upon the cause of france now solemnly and irrevocably delivered into her little hands      chapter 9 she is made generalinchief  it was indeed a great day and a stirring thing to see  she had won it was a mistake of tremouille and her other illwishers to let her hold court those nights  the commission of priests sent to lorraine ostensibly to inquire into joans characterin fact to weary her with delays and wear out her purpose and make her give it uparrived back and reported her character perfect our affairs were in full career now you see  the verdict made a prodigious stir dead france woke suddenly to life wherever the great news traveled whereas before the spiritless and cowed people hung their heads and slunk away if one mentioned war to them now they came clamoring to be enlisted under the banner of the maid of vaucouleurs and the roaring of warsongs and the thundering of the drums filled all the air i remembered now what she had said that time there in our village when i proved by facts and statistics that frances case was hopeless and nothing could ever rouse the people from their lethargy  they will hear the drumsand they will answer they will march  it has been said that misfortunes never come one at a time but in a body in our case it was the same with good luck having got a start it came flooding in tide after tide our next wave of it was of this sort there had been grave doubts among the priests as to whether the church ought to permit a female soldier to dress like a man but now came a verdict on that head two of the greatest scholars and theologians of the timeone of whom had been chancellor of the university of parisrendered it they decided that since joan must do the work of a man and a soldier it is just and legitimate that her apparel should conform to the situation  it was a great point gained the churchs authority to dress as a man oh yes wave on wave the good luck came sweeping in never mind about the smaller waves let us come to the largest one of all the wave that swept us small fry quite off our feet and almost drowned us with joy the day of the great verdict couriers had been despatched to the king with it and the next morning bright and early the clear notes of a bugle came floating to us on the crisp air and we pricked up our ears and began to count them onetwothree pause onetwo pause onetwothree againand out we skipped and went flying for that formula was used only when the kings heraldatarms would deliver a proclamation to the people as we hurried along people came racing out of every street and house and alley men women and children all flushed excited and throwing lacking articles of clothing on as they ran still those clear notes pealed out and still the rush of people increased till the whole town was abroad and streaming along the principal street at last we reached the square which was now packed with citizens and there high on the pedestal of the great cross we saw the herald in his brilliant costume with his servitors about him the next moment he began his delivery in the powerful voice proper to his office  know all men and take heed therefore that the most high the most illustrious charles by the grace of god king of france hath been pleased to confer upon his wellbeloved servant joan of arc called the maid the title emoluments authorities and dignity of generalinchief of the armies of france  here a thousand caps flew in the air and the multitude burst into a hurricane of cheers that raged and raged till it seemed as if it would never come to an end but at last it did then the herald went on and finishedand hath appointed to be her lieutenant and chief of staff a prince of his royal house his grace the duke of alencon  that was the end and the hurricane began again and was split up into innumerable strips by the blowers of it and wafted through all the lanes and streets of the town  general of the armies of france with a prince of the blood for subordinate yesterday she was nothingtoday she was this yesterday she was not even a sergeant not even a corporal not even a privatetoday with one step she was at the top yesterday she was less than nobody to the newest recruittoday her command was law to la hire saintrailles the bastard of orleans and all those others veterans of old renown illustrious masters of the trade of war these were the thoughts i was thinking i was trying to realize this strange and wonderful thing that had happened you see  my mind went travelling back and presently lighted upon a picturea picture which was still so new and fresh in my memory that it seemed a matter of only yesterdayand indeed its date was no further back than the first days of january this is what it was a peasantgirl in a faroff village her seventeenth year not yet quite completed and herself and her village as unknown as if they had been on the other side of the globe she had picked up a friendless wanderer somewhere and brought it homea small gray kitten in a forlorn and starving conditionand had fed it and comforted it and got its confidence and made it believe in her and now it was curled up in her lap asleep and she was knitting a coarse stocking and thinkingdreamingabout what one may never know and nowthe kitten had hardly had time to become a cat and yet already the girl is general of the armies of france with a prince of the blood to give orders to and out of her village obscurity her name has climbed up like the sun and is visible from all corners of the land it made me dizzy to think of these things they were so out of the common order and seemed so impossible      chapter 10 the maids sword and banner  joans first official act was to dictate a letter to the english commanders at orleans summoning them to deliver up all strongholds in their possession and depart out of france she must have been thinking it all out before and arranging it in her mind it flowed from her lips so smoothly and framed itself into such vivacious and forcible language still it might not have been so she always had a quick mind and a capable tongue and her faculties were constantly developing in these latter weeks this letter was to be forwarded presently from blois men provisions and money were offering in plenty now and joan appointed blois as a recruitingstation and depot of supplies and ordered up la hire from the front to take charge  the great bastardhim of the ducal house and governor of orleanshad been clamoring for weeks for joan to be sent to him and now came another messenger old daulon a veteran officer a trusty man and fine and honest the king kept him and gave him to joan to be chief of her household and commanded her to appoint the rest of her people herself making their number and dignity accord with the greatness of her office and at the same time he gave order that they should be properly equipped with arms clothing and horses  meantime the king was having a complete suit of armor made for her at tours it was of the finest steel heavily plated with silver richly ornamented with engraved designs and polished like a mirror  joans voices had told her that there was an ancient sword hidden somewhere behind the altar of st catherines at fierbois and she sent de metz to get it the priests knew of no such sword but a search was made and sure enough it was found in that place buried a little way under the ground it had no sheath and was very rusty but the priests polished it up and sent it to tours whither we were now to come they also had a sheath of crimson velvet made for it and the people of tours equipped it with another made of clothofgold but joan meant to carry this sword always in battle so she laid the showy sheaths away and got one made of leather it was generally believed that this sword had belonged to charlemagne but that was only a matter of opinion i wanted to sharpen that old blade but she said it was not necessary as she should never kill anybody and should carry it only as a symbol of authority  at tours she designed her standard and a scotch painter named james power made it it was of the most delicate white boucassin with fringes of silk for device it bore the image of god the father throned in the clouds and holding the world in his hand two angels knelt at his feet presenting lilies inscription jesus maria on the reverse the crown of france supported by two angels  she also caused a smaller standard or pennon to be made whereon was represented an angel offering a lily to the holy virgin  everything was humming there at tours every now and then one heard the bray and crash of military music every little while one heard the measured tramp of marching mensquads of recruits leaving for blois songs and shoutings and huzzas filled the air night and day the town was full of strangers the streets and inns were thronged the bustle of preparation was everywhere and everybody carried a glad and cheerful face around joans headquarters a crowd of people was always massed hoping for a glimpse of the new general and when they got it they went wild but they seldom got it for she was busy planning her campaign receiving reports giving orders despatching couriers and giving what odd moments she could spare to the companies of great folk waiting in the drawingrooms as for us boys we hardly saw her at all she was so occupied  we were in a mixed state of mindsometimes hopeful sometimes not mostly not she had not appointed her household yetthat was our trouble we knew she was being overrun with applications for places in it and that these applications were backed by great names and weighty influence whereas we had nothing of the sort to recommend us she could fill her humblest places with titled folkfolk whose relationships would be a bulwark for her and a valuable support at all times in these circumstances would policy allow her to consider us we were not as cheerful as the rest of the town but were inclined to be depressed and worried sometimes we discussed our slim chances and gave them as good an appearance as we could but the very mention of the subject was anguish to the paladin for whereas we had some little hope he had none at all as a rule noel rainguesson was quite willing to let the dismal matter alone but not when the paladin was present once we were talking the thing over when noel said  cheer up paladin i had a dream last night and you were the only one among us that got an appointment it wasnt a high one but it was an appointment anywaysome kind of a lackey or bodyservant or something of that kind  the paladin roused up and looked almost cheerful for he was a believer in dreams and in anything and everything of a superstitious sort in fact he said with a rising hopefulness  i wish it might come true do you think it will come true  certainly i might almost say i know it will for my dreams hardly ever fail  noel i could hug you if that dream could come true i could indeed to be servant of the first general of france and have all the world hear of it and the news go back to the village and make those gawks stare that always said i wouldnt ever amount to anythingwouldnt it be great do you think it will come true noel dont you believe it will  i do theres my hand on it  noel if it comes true ill never forget youshake again i should be dressed in a noble livery and the news would go to the village and those animals would say him lackey to the generalinchief with the eyes of the whole world on him admiringwell he has shot up into the sky now hasnt he  he began to walk the floor and pile castles in the air so fast and so high that we could hardly keep up with him then all of a sudden all the joy went out of his face and misery took its place and he said  oh dear it is all a mistake it will never come true i forgot that foolish business at toul i have kept out of her sight as much as i could all these weeks hoping she would forget that and forgive itbut i know she never will she cant of course and after all i wasnt to blame i did say she promised to marry me but they put me up to it and persuaded me i swear they did the vast creature was almost crying then he pulled himself together and said remorsefully it was the only lie ive ever told and  he was drowned out with a chorus of groans and outraged exclamations and before he could begin again one of daulons liveried servants appeared and said we were required at headquarters we rose and noel said  therewhat did i tell you i have a presentimentthe spirit of prophecy is upon me she is going to appoint him and we are to go there and do him homage come along  but the paladin was afraid to go so we left him  when we presently stood in the presence in front of a crowd of glittering officers of the army joan greeted us with a winning smile and said she appointed all of us to places in her household for she wanted her old friends by her it was a beautiful surprise to have ourselves honored like this when she could have had people of birth and consequence instead but we couldnt find our tongues to say so she was become so great and so high above us now one at a time we stepped forward and each received his warrant from the hand of our chief daulon all of us had honorable places the two knights stood highest then joans two brothers i was first page and secretary a young gentleman named raimond was second page noel was her messenger she had two heralds and also a chaplain and almoner whose name was jean pasquerel she had previously appointed a maitre dhotel and a number of domestics now she looked around and said  but where is the paladin  the sieur bertrand said  he thought he was not sent for your excellency  now that is not well let him be called  the paladin entered humbly enough he ventured no farther than just within the door he stopped there looking embarrassed and afraid then joan spoke pleasantly and said  i watched you on the road you began badly but improved of old you were a fantastic talker but there is a man in you and i will bring it out it was fine to see the paladins face light up when she said that will you follow where i lead  into the fire he said and i said to myself by the ring of that i think she has turned this braggart into a hero it is another of her miracles i make no doubt of it  i believe you said joan heretake my banner you will ride with me in every field and when france is saved you will give it me back  he took the banner which is now the most precious of the memorials that remain of joan of arc and his voice was unsteady with emotion when he said  if i ever disgrace this trust my comrades here will know how to do a friends office upon my body and this charge i lay upon them as knowing they will not fail me      chapter 11 the war march is begun  noel and i went back togethersilent at first and impressed  finally noel came up out of his thinkings and said  the first shall be last and the last firsttheres authority for this surprise but at the same time wasnt it a lofty hoist for our big bull  it truly was i am not over being stunned yet it was the greatest place in her gift  yes it was there are many generals and she can create more but there is only one standardbearer  true it is the most conspicuous place in the army after her own  and the most coveted and honorable sons of two dukes tried to get it as we know and of all people in the world this majestic windmill carries it off well isnt it a gigantic promotion when you come to look at it  theres no doubt about it its a kind of copy of joans own in miniature  i dont know how to account for itdo you  yeswithout any trouble at allthat is i think i do  noel was surprised at that and glanced up quickly as if to see if i was in earnest he said  i thought you couldnt be in earnest but i see you are if you can make me understand this puzzle do it tell me what the explanation is  i believe i can you have noticed that our chief knight says a good many wise things and has a thoughtful head on his shoulders one day riding along we were talking about joans great talents and he said but greatest of all her gifts she has the seeing eye i said like an unthinking fool the seeing eyei shouldnt count on that for muchi suppose we all have it no he said very few have it then he explained and made his meaning clear he said the common eye sees only the outside of things and judges by that but the seeing eye pierces through and reads the heart and the soul finding there capacities which the outside didnt indicate or promise and which the other kind of eye couldnt detect he said the mightiest military genius must fail and come to nothing if it have not the seeing eyethat is to say if it cannot read men and select its subordinates with an infallible judgment it sees as by intuition that this man is good for strategy that one for dash and daredevil assault the other for patient bulldog persistence and it appoints each to his right place and wins while the commander without the seeing eye would give to each the others place and lose he was right about joan and i saw it when she was a child and the tramp came one night her father and all of us took him for a rascal but she saw the honest man through the rags when i dined with the governor of vaucouleurs so long ago i saw nothing in our two knights though i sat with them and talked with them two hours joan was there five minutes and neither spoke with them nor heard them speak yet she marked them for men of worth and fidelity and they have confirmed her judgment whom has she sent for to take charge of this thundering rabble of new recruits at blois made up of old disbanded armagnac raiders unspeakable hellions every one why she has sent for satan himselfthat is to say la hirethat military hurricane that godless swashbuckler that lurid conflagration of blasphemy that vesuvius of profanity forever in eruption does he know how to deal with that mob of roaring devils better than any man that lives for he is the head devil of this world his own self he is the match of the whole of them combined and probably the father of most of them she places him in temporary command until she can get to blois herselfand then why then she will certainly take them in hand personally or i dont know her as well as i ought to after all these years of intimacy that will be a sight to seethat fair spirit in her white armor delivering her will to that muckheap that ragpile that abandoned refuse of perdition  la hire cried noel our hero of all these yearsi do want to see that man  i too his name stirs me just as it did when i was a little boy  i want to hear him swear  of course i would rather hear him swear than another man pray he is the frankest man there is and the naivest once when he was rebuked for pillaging on his raids he said it was nothing said he if god the father were a soldier he would rob i judge he is the right man to take temporary charge there at blois joan has cast the seeing eye upon him you see  which brings us back to where we started i have an honest affection for the paladin and not merely because he is a good fellow but because he is my childi made him what he is the windiest blusterer and most catholic liar in the kingdom im glad of his luck but i hadnt the seeing eye i shouldnt have chosen him for the most dangerous post in the army i should have placed him in the rear to kill the wounded and violate the dead  well we shall see joan probably knows what is in him better than we do and ill give you another idea when a person in joan of arcs position tells a man he is brave he believes it and believing it is enough in fact to believe yourself brave is to be brave it is the one only essential thing  now youve hit it cried noel shes got the creating mouth as well as the seeing eye ah yes that is the thing france was cowed and a coward joan of arc has spoken and france is marching with her head up  i was summoned now to write a letter from joans dictation during the next day and night our several uniforms were made by the tailors and our new armor provided we were beautiful to look upon now whether clothed for peace or war clothed for peace in costly stuffs and rich colors the paladin was a tower dyed with the glories of the sunset plumed and sashed and ironclad for war he was a still statelier thing to look at  orders had been issued for the march toward blois it was a clear sharp beautiful morning as our showy great company trotted out in column riding two and two joan and the duke of alencon in the lead daulon and the big standardbearer next and so on we made a handsome spectacle as you may well imagine and as we plowed through the cheering crowds with joan bowing her plumed head to left and right and the sun glinting from her silver mail the spectators realized that the curtain was rolling up before their eyes upon the first act of a prodigious drama and their rising hopes were expressed in an enthusiasm that increased with each moment until at last one seemed to even physically feel the concussion of the huzzas as well as hear them far down the street we heard the softened strains of windblown music and saw a cloud of lancers moving the sun glowing with a subdued light upon the massed armor but striking bright upon the soaring lanceheadsa vaguely luminous nebula so to speak with a constellation twinkling above itand that was our guard of honor it joined us the procession was complete the first warmarch of joan of arc was begun the curtain was up      chapter 12 joan puts heart in her army  we were at blois three days oh that camp it is one of the treasures of my memory order there was no more order among those brigands than there is among the wolves and the hyenas they went roaring and drinking about whooping shouting swearing and entertaining themselves with all manner of rude and riotous horseplay and the place was full of loud and lewd women and they were no whit behind the men for romps and noise and fantastics  it was in the midst of this wild mob that noel and i had our first glimpse of la hire he answered to our dearest dreams he was of great size and of martial bearing he was cased in mail from head to heel with a bushel of swishing plumes on his helmet and at his side the vast sword of the time  he was on his way to pay his respects in state to joan and as he passed through the camp he was restoring order and proclaiming that the maid had come and he would have no such spectacle as this exposed to the head of the army his way of creating order was his own not borrowed he did it with his great fists as he moved along swearing and admonishing he let drive this way that way and the other and wherever his blow landed a man went down  damn you he said staggering and cursing around like this and the commanderinchief in the camp straighten up and he laid the man flat what his idea of straightening up was was his own secret  we followed the veteran to headquarters listening observing admiringyes devouring you may say the pet hero of the boys of france from our cradles up to that happy day and their idol and ours i called to mind how joan had once rebuked the paladin there in the pastures of domremy for uttering lightly those mighty names la hire and the bastard of orleans and how she said that if she could but be permitted to stand afar off and let her eyes rest once upon those great men she would hold it a privilege they were to her and the other girls just what they were to the boys well here was one of them at lastand what was his errand it was hard to realize it and yet it was true he was coming to uncover his head before her and take her orders  while he was quieting a considerable group of his brigands in his soothing way near headquarters we stepped on ahead and got a glimpse of joans military family the great chiefs of the army for they had all arrived now there they were six officers of wide renown handsome men in beautiful armor but the lord high admiral of france was the handsomest of them all and had the most gallant bearing  when la hire entered one could see the surprise in his face at joans beauty and extreme youth and one could see too by joans glad smile that it made her happy to get sight of this hero of her childhood at last la hire bowed low with his helmet in his gauntleted hand and made a bluff but handsome little speech with hardly an oath in it and one could see that those two took to each other on the spot  the visit of ceremony was soon over and the others went away but la hire stayed and he and joan sat there and he sipped her wine and they talked and laughed together like old friends and presently she gave him some instructions in his quality as master of the camp which made his breath stand still for to begin with she said that all those loose women must pack out of the place at once she wouldnt allow one of them to remain next the rough carousing must stop drinking must be brought within proper and strictly defined limits and discipline must take the place of disorder and finally she climaxed the list of surprises with thiswhich nearly lifted him out of his armor  every man who joins my standard must confess before the priest and absolve himself from sin and all accepted recruits must be present at divine service twice a day  la hire could not say a word for a good part of a minute then he said in deep dejection  oh sweet child they were littered in hell these poor darlings of mine attend mass why dear heart theyll see us both damned first  and he went on pouring out a most pathetic stream of arguments and blasphemy which broke joan all up and made her laugh as she had not laughed since she played in the domremy pastures it was good to hear  but she stuck to her point so the soldier yielded and said all right if such were the orders he must obey and would do the best that was in him then he refreshed himself with a lurid explosion of oaths and said that if any man in the camp refused to renounce sin and lead a pious life he would knock his head off that started joan off again she was really having a good time you see but she would not consent to that form of conversions she said they must be voluntary  la hire said that that was all right he wasnt going to kill the voluntary ones but only the others  no matter none of them must be killedjoan couldnt have it she said that to give a man a chance to volunteer on pain of death if he didnt left him more or less trammeled and she wanted him to be entirely free  so the soldier sighed and said he would advertise the mass but said he doubted if there was a man in camp that was any more likely to go to it than he was himself then there was another surprise for him for joan said  but dear man you are going  i impossible oh this is lunacy  oh no it isnt you are going to the servicetwice a day  oh am i dreaming am i drunkor is my hearing playing me false why i would rather go to  never mind where in the morning you are going to begin and after that it will come easy now dont look downhearted like that soon you wont mind it  la hire tried to cheer up but he was not able to do it he sighed like a zephyr and presently said  well ill do it for you but before i would do it for another i swear i  but dont swear break it off  break it off it is impossible i beg you totowhyoh my general it is my native speech  he begged so hard for grace for his impediment that joan left him one fragment of it she said he might swear by his baton the symbol of his generalship  he promised that he would swear only by his baton when in her presence and would try to modify himself elsewhere but doubted he could manage it now that it was so old and stubborn a habit and such a solace and support to his declining years  that tough old lion went away from there a good deal tamed and civilizednot to say softened and sweetened for perhaps those expressions would hardly fit him noel and i believed that when he was away from joans influence his old aversions would come up so strong in him that he could not master them and so wouldnt go to mass but we got up early in the morning to see  satan was converted you see well the rest followed joan rode up and down that camp and wherever that fair young form appeared in its shining armor with that sweet face to grace the vision and perfect it the rude host seemed to think they saw the god of war in person descended out of the clouds and first they wondered then they worshiped after that she could do with them what she would  in three days it was a clean camp and orderly and those barbarians were herding to divine service twice a day like good children the women were gone la hire was stunned by these marvels he could not understand them he went outside the camp when he wanted to swear he was that sort of a mansinful by nature and habit but full of superstitious respect for holy places  the enthusiasm of the reformed army for joan its devotion to her and the hot desire she had aroused in it to be led against the enemy exceeded any manifestations of this sort which la hire had ever seen before in his long career his admiration of it all and his wonder over the mystery and miracle of it were beyond his power to put into words he had held this army cheap before but his pride and confidence in it knew no limits now he said  two or three days ago it was afraid of a henroost one could storm the gates of hell with it now  joan and he were inseparable and a quaint and pleasant contrast they made he was so big she so little he was so gray and so far along in his pilgrimage of life she so youthful his face was so bronzed and scarred hers so fair and pink so fresh and smooth she was so gracious and he so stern she was so pure so innocent he such a cyclopedia of sin in her eye was stored all charity and compassion in his lightnings when her glance fell upon you it seemed to bring benediction and the peace of god but with his it was different generally  they rode through the camp a dozen times a day visiting every corner of it observing inspecting perfecting and wherever they appeared the enthusiasm broke forth they rode side by side he a great figure of brawn and muscle she a little masterwork of roundness and grace he a fortress of rusty iron she a shining statuette of silver and when the reformed raiders and bandits caught sight of them they spoke out with affection and welcome in their voices and said  there they comesatan and the page of christ  all the three days that we were in blois joan worked earnestly and tirelessly to bring la hire to godto rescue him from the bondage of sinto breathe into his stormy heart the serenity and peace of religion she urged she begged she implored him to pray he stood out three days of our stay begging about piteously to be let offto be let off from just that one thing that impossible thing he would do anything elseanythingcommand and he would obeyhe would go through the fire for her if she said the wordbut spare him this only this for he couldnt pray had never prayed he was ignorant of how to frame a prayer he had no words to put it in  and yetcan any believe itshe carried even that point she won that incredible victory she made la hire pray it shows i think that nothing was impossible to joan of arc yes he stood there before her and put up his mailed hands and made a prayer and it was not borrowed but was his very own he had none to help him frame it he made it out of his own headsaying  fair sir god i pray you to do by la hire as he would do by you if you were la hire and he were god 1  then he put on his helmet and marched out of joans tent as satisfied with himself as any one might be who had arranged a perplexed and difficult business to the content and admiration of all the parties concerned in the matter  if i had know that he had been praying i could have understood why he was feeling so superior but of course i could not know that  i was coming to the tent at that moment and saw him come out and saw him march away in that large fashion and indeed it was fine and beautiful to see but when i got to the tent door i stopped and stepped back grieved and shocked for i heard joan crying as i mistakenly thoughtcrying as if she could not contain nor endure the anguish of her soul crying as if she would die but it was not so she was laughinglaughing at la hires prayer  it was not until sixandthirty years afterward that i found that out and thenoh then i only cried when that picture of young carefree mirth rose before me out of the blur and mists of that longvanished time for there had come a day between when gods good gift of laughter had gone out from me to come again no more in this life   1 this prayer has been stolen many times and by many nations in the past four hundred and sixty years but it originated with la hire and the fact is of official record in the national archives of france we have the authority of michelet for thistranslator     chapter 13 checked by the folly of the wise  we marched out in great strength and splendor and took the road toward orleans the initial part of joans great dream was realizing itself at last it was the first time that any of us youngsters had ever seen an army and it was a most stately and imposing spectacle to us it was indeed an inspiring sight that interminable column stretching away into the fading distances and curving itself in and out of the crookedness of the road like a mighty serpent joan rode at the head of it with her personal staff then came a body of priests singing the veni creator the banner of the cross rising out of their midst after these the glinting forest of spears the several divisions were commanded by the great armagnac generals la hire and marshal de boussac the sire de retz florent dilliers and poton de saintrailles  each in his degree was tough and there were three degreestough tougher toughestand la hire was the last by a shade but only a shade they were just illustrious official brigands the whole party and by long habits of lawlessness they had lost all acquaintanceship with obedience if they had ever had any  but what was the good of saying that these independent birds knew no law they seldom obeyed the king they never obeyed him when it didnt suit them to do it would they obey the maid in the first place they wouldnt know how to obey her or anybody else and in the second place it was of course not possible for them to take her military character seriouslythat countrygirl of seventeen who had been trained for the complex and terrible business of warhow by tending sheep  they had no idea of obeying her except in cases where their veteran military knowledge and experience showed them that the thing she required was sound and right when gauged by the regular military standards were they to blame for this attitude i should think not old warworn captains are hardheaded practical men they do not easily believe in the ability of ignorant children to plan campaigns and command armies no general that ever lived could have taken joan seriously militarily before she raised the siege of orleans and followed it with the great campaign of the loire  did they consider joan valueless far from it they valued her as the fruitful earth values the sunthey fully believed she could produce the crop but that it was in their line of business not hers to take it off they had a deep and superstitious reverence for her as being endowed with a mysterious supernatural something that was able to do a mighty thing which they were powerless to doblow the breath of life and valor into the dead corpses of cowed armies and turn them into heroes  to their minds they were everything with her but nothing without her she could inspire the soldiers and fit them for battlebut fight the battle herself oh nonsensethat was their function they the generals would fight the battles joan would give the victory that was their ideaan unconscious paraphrase of joans reply to the dominican  so they began by playing a deception upon her she had a clear idea of how she meant to proceed it was her purpose to march boldly upon orleans by the north bank of the loire she gave that order to her generals they said to themselves the idea is insaneit is blunder no 1 it is what might have been expected of this child who is ignorant of war they privately sent the word to the bastard of orleans he also recognized the insanity of itat least he thought he didand privately advised the generals to get around the order in some way  they did it by deceiving joan she trusted those people she was not expecting this sort of treatment and was not on the lookout for it it was a lesson to her she saw to it that the game was not played a second time  why was joans idea insane from the generals point of view but not from hers because her plan was to raise the siege immediately by fighting while theirs was to besiege the besiegers and starve them out by closing their communicationsa plan which would require months in the consummation  the english had built a fence of strong fortresses called bastilles around orleansfortresses which closed all the gates of the city but one to the french generals the idea of trying to fight their way past those fortresses and lead the army into orleans was preposterous they believed that the result would be the armys destruction one may not doubt that their opinion was militarily soundno would have been but for one circumstance which they overlooked that was this the english soldiers were in a demoralized condition of superstitious terror they had become satisfied that the maid was in league with satan by reason of this a good deal of their courage had oozed out and vanished on the other hand the maids soldiers were full of courage enthusiasm and zeal  joan could have marched by the english forts however it was not to be she had been cheated out of her first chance to strike a heavy blow for her country  in camp that night she slept in her armor on the ground it was a cold night and she was nearly as stiff as her armor itself when we resumed the march in the morning for iron is not good material for a blanket however her joy in being now so far on her way to the theater of her mission was fire enough to warm her and it soon did it  her enthusiasm and impatience rose higher and higher with every mile of progress but at last we reached olivet and down it went and indignation took its place for she saw the trick that had been played upon herthe river lay between us and orleans  she was for attacking one of the three bastilles that were on our side of the river and forcing access to the bridge which it guarded a project which if successful would raise the siege instantly but the longingrained fear of the english came upon her generals and they implored her not to make the attempt the soldiers wanted to attack but had to suffer disappointment so we moved on and came to a halt at a point opposite checy six miles above orleans  dunois bastard of orleans with a body of knights and citizens came up from the city to welcome joan joan was still burning with resentment over the trick that had been put upon her and was not in the mood for soft speeches even to revered military idols of her childhood she said  are you the bastard  yes i am he and am right glad of your coming  and did you advise that i be brought by this side of the river instead of straight to talbot and the english  her high manner abashed him and he was not able to answer with anything like a confident promptness but with many hesitations and partial excuses he managed to get out the confession that for what he and the council had regarded as imperative military reasons they so advised  in gods name said joan my lords counsel is safer and wiser than yours you thought to deceive me but you have deceived yourselves for i bring you the best help that ever knight or city had for it is gods help not sent for love of me but by gods pleasure at the prayer of st louis and st charlemagne he has had pity on orleans and will not suffer the enemy to have both the duke of orleans and his city the provisions to save the starving people are here the boats are below the city the wind is contrary they cannot come up hither now then tell me in gods name you who are so wise what that council of yours was thinking about to invent this foolish difficulty  dunois and the rest fumbled around the matter a moment then gave in and conceded that a blunder had been made  yes a blunder has been made said joan and except god take your proper work upon himself and change the wind and correct your blunder for you there is none else that can devise a remedy  some of these people began to perceive that with all her technical ignorance she had practical good sense and that with all her native sweetness and charm she was not the right kind of a person to play with  presently god did take the blunder in hand and by his grace the wind did change so the fleet of boats came up and went away loaded with provisions and cattle and conveyed that welcome succor to the hungry city managing the matter successfully under protection of a sortie from the walls against the bastille of st loup then joan began on the bastard again  you see here the army  yes  it is here on this side by advice of your council  yes  now in gods name can that wise council explain why it is better to have it here than it would be to have it in the bottom of the sea  dunois made some wandering attempts to explain the inexplicable and excuse the inexcusable but joan cut him short and said  answer me this good sirhas the army any value on this side of the river  the bastard confessed that it hadntthat is in view of the plan of campaign which she had devised and decreed  and yet knowing this you had the hardihood to disobey my orders since the armys place is on the other side will you explain to me how it is to get there  the whole size of the needless muddle was apparent evasions were of no use therefore dunois admitted that there was no way to correct the blunder but to send the army all the way back to blois and let it begin over again and come up on the other side this time according to joans original plan  any other girl after winning such a triumph as this over a veteran soldier of old renown might have exulted a little and been excusable for it but joan showed no disposition of this sort she dropped a word or two of grief over the precious time that must be lost then began at once to issue commands for the march back she sorrowed to see her army go for she said its heart was great and its enthusiasm high and that with it at her back she did not fear to face all the might of england  all arrangements having been completed for the return of the main body of the army she took the bastard and la hire and a thousand men and went down to orleans where all the town was in a fever of impatience to have sight of her face it was eight in the evening when she and the troops rode in at the burgundy gate with the paladin preceding her with her standard she was riding a white horse and she carried in her hand the sacred sword of fierbois you should have seen orleans then what a picture it was such black seas of people such a starry firmament of torches such roaring whirlwinds of welcome such booming of bells and thundering of cannon it was as if the world was come to an end everywhere in the glare of the torches one saw rank upon rank of upturned white faces the mouths wide open shouting and the unchecked tears running down joan forged her slow way through the solid masses her mailed form projecting above the pavement of heads like a silver statue the people about her struggled along gazing up at her through their tears with the rapt look of men and women who believe they are seeing one who is divine and always her feet were being kissed by grateful folk and such as failed of that privilege touched her horse and then kissed their fingers  nothing that joan did escaped notice everything she did was commented upon and applauded you could hear the remarks going all the time  thereshes smilingsee  now shes taking her little plumed cap off to somebodyah its fine and graceful  shes patting that woman on the head with her gauntlet  oh she was born on a horsesee her turn in her saddle and kiss the hilt of her sword to the ladies in the window that threw the flowers down  now theres a poor woman lifting up a childshes kissed itoh shes divine  what a dainty little figure it is and what a lovely faceand such color and animation  joans slender long banner streaming backward had an accidentthe fringe caught fire from a torch she leaned forward and crushed the flame in her hand  shes not afraid of fire nor anything they shouted and delivered a storm of admiring applause that made everything quake  she rode to the cathedral and gave thanks to god and the people crammed the place and added their devotions to hers then she took up her march again and picked her slow way through the crowds and the wilderness of torches to the house of jacques boucher treasurer of the duke of orleans where she was to be the guest of his wife as long as she stayed in the city and have his young daughter for comrade and roommate the delirium of the people went on the rest of the night and with it the clamor of the joybells and the welcoming cannon  joan of arc had stepped upon her stage at last and was ready to begin      chapter 14 what the english answered  she was ready but must sit down and wait until there was an army to work with  next morning saturday april 30 1429 she set about inquiring after the messenger who carried her proclamation to the english from bloisthe one which she had dictated at poitiers here is a copy of it it is a remarkable document for several reasons for its matteroffact directness for its high spirit and forcible diction and for its naive confidence in her ability to achieve the prodigious task which she had laid upon herself or which had been laid upon herwhich you please all through it you seem to see the pomps of war and hear the rumbling of the drums in it joans warrior soul is revealed and for the moment the soft little shepherdess has disappeared from your view this untaught countrydamsel unused to dictating anything at all to anybody much less documents of state to kings and generals poured out this procession of vigorous sentences as fluently as if this sort of work had been her trade from childhood  jesus maria king of england and you duke of bedford who call yourself regent of france william de la pole earl of suffolk and you thomas lord scales who style yourselves lieutenants of the said bedforddo right to the king of heaven render to the maid who is sent by god the keys of all the good towns you have taken and violated in france she is sent hither by god to restore the blood royal she is very ready to make peace if you will do her right by giving up france and paying for what you have held and you archers companions of war noble and otherwise who are before the good city of orleans begone into your own land in gods name or expect news from the maid who will shortly go to see you to your very great hurt king of england if you do not so i am chief of war and whenever i shall find your people in france i will drive them out willing or not willing and if they do not obey i will slay them all but if they obey i will have them to mercy i am come hither by god the king of heaven body for body to put you out of france in spite of those who would work treason and mischief against the kingdom think not you shall ever hold the kingdom from the king of heaven the son of the blessed mary king charles shall hold it for god wills it so and has revealed it to him by the maid if you believe not the news sent by god through the maid wherever we shall meet you we will strike boldly and make such a noise as has not been in france these thousand years be sure that god can send more strength to the maid than you can bring to any assault against her and her good menatarms and then we shall see who has the better right the king of heaven or you duke of bedford the maid prays you not to bring about your own destruction if you do her right you may yet go in her company where the french shall do the finest deed that has been done in christendom and if you do not you shall be reminded shortly of your great wrongs  in that closing sentence she invites them to go on crusade with her to rescue the holy sepulcher no answer had been returned to this proclamation and the messenger himself had not come back  so now she sent her two heralds with a new letter warning the english to raise the siege and requiring them to restore that missing messenger the heralds came back without him all they brought was notice from the english to joan that they would presently catch her and burn her if she did not clear out now while she had a chance and go back to her proper trade of minding cows  she held her peace only saying it was a pity that the english would persist in inviting present disaster and eventual destruction when she was doing all she could to get them out of the country with their lives still in their bodies  presently she thought of an arrangement that might be acceptable and said to the heralds go back and say to lord talbot this from me come out of your bastilles with your host and i will come with mine if i beat you go in peace out of france if you beat me burn me according to your desire  i did not hear this but dunois did and spoke of it the challenge was refused  sunday morning her voices or some instinct gave her a warning and she sent dunois to blois to take command of the army and hurry it to orleans it was a wise move for he found regnault de chartres and some more of the kings pet rascals there trying their best to disperse the army and crippling all the efforts of joans generals to head it for orleans they were a fine lot those miscreants they turned their attention to dunois now but he had balked joan once with unpleasant results to himself and was not minded to meddle in that way again he soon had the army moving      chapter 15 my exquisite poem goes to smash  we of the personal staff were in fairyland now during the few days that we waited for the return of the army we went into society to our two knights this was not a novelty but to us young villagers it was a new and wonderful life any position of any sort near the person of the maid of vaucouleurs conferred high distinction upon the holder and caused his society to be courted and so the darc brothers and noel and the paladin humble peasants at home were gentlemen here personages of weight and influence it was fine to see how soon their country diffidences and awkwardnesses melted away under this pleasant sun of deference and disappeared and how lightly and easily they took to their new atmosphere the paladin was as happy as it was possible for any one in this earth to be his tongue went all the time and daily he got new delight out of hearing himself talk he began to enlarge his ancestry and spread it out all around and ennoble it right and left and it was not long until it consisted almost entirely of dukes he worked up his old battles and tricked them out with fresh splendors also with new terrors for he added artillery now we had seen cannon for the first time at bloisa few pieceshere there was plenty of it and now and then we had the impressive spectacle of a huge english bastille hidden from sight in a mountain of smoke from its own guns with lances of red flame darting through it and this grand picture along with the quaking thunders pounding away in the heart of it inflamed the paladins imagination and enabled him to dress out those ambuscadeskirmishes of ours with a sublimity which made it impossible for any to recognize them at all except people who had not been there  you may suspect that there was a special inspiration for these great efforts of the paladins and there was it was the daughter of the house catherine boucher who was eighteen and gentle and lovely in her ways and very beautiful i think she might have been as beautiful as joan herself if she had had joans eyes but that could never be there was never but that one pair there will never be another joans eyes were deep and rich and wonderful beyond anything merely earthly they spoke all the languagesthey had no need of words they produced all effectsand just by a glance just a single glance a glance that could convict a liar of his lie and make him confess it that could bring down a proud mans pride and make him humble that could put courage into a coward and strike dead the courage of the bravest that could appease resentments and real hatreds that could make the doubter believe and the hopeless hope again that could purify the impure mind that could persuadeah there it ispersuasion that is the word what or who is it that it couldnt persuade the maniac of domremythe fairybanishing priestthe reverend tribunal of toulthe doubting and superstitious laxartthe obstinate veteran of vaucouleursthe characterless heir of francethe sages and scholars of the parliament and university of poitiersthe darling of satan la hirethe masterless bastard of orleans accustomed to acknowledge no way as right and rational but his ownthese were the trophies of that great gift that made her the wonder and mystery that she was  we mingled companionably with the great folk who flocked to the big house to make joans acquaintance and they made much of us and we lived in the clouds so to speak but what we preferred even to this happiness was the quieter occasions when the formal guests were gone and the family and a few dozen of its familiar friends were gathered together for a social good time it was then that we did our best we five youngsters with such fascinations as we had and the chief object of them was catherine none of us had ever been in love before and now we had the misfortune to all fall in love with the same person at the same timewhich was the first moment we saw her she was a merry heart and full of life and i still remember tenderly those few evenings that i was permitted to have my share of her dear society and of comradeship with that little company of charming people  the paladin made us all jealous the first night for when he got fairly started on those battles of his he had everything to himself and there was no use in anybody elses trying to get any attention those people had been living in the midst of real war for seven months and to hear this windy giant lay out his imaginary campaigns and fairly swim in blood and spatter it all around entertained them to the verge of the grave catherine was like to die for pure enjoyment she didnt laugh loudwe of course wished she wouldbut kept in the shelter of a fan and shook until there was danger that she would unhitch her ribs from her spine then when the paladin had got done with a battle and we began to feel thankful and hope for a change she would speak up in a way that was so sweet and persuasive that it rankled in me and ask him about some detail or other in the early part of his battle which she said had greatly interested her and would he be so good as to describe that part again and with a little more particularitywhich of course precipitated the whole battle on us again with a hundred lies added that had been overlooked before  i do not know how to make you realize the pain i suffered i had never been jealous before and it seemed intolerable that this creature should have this good fortune which he was so ill entitled to and i have to sit and see myself neglected when i was so longing for the least little attention out of the thousand that this beloved girl was lavishing on him i was near her and tried two or three times to get started on some of the things that i had done in those battlesand i felt ashamed of myself too for stooping to such a businessbut she cared for nothing but his battles and could not be got to listen and presently when one of my attempts caused her to lose some precious rag or other of his mendacities and she asked him to repeat thus bringing on a new engagement of course and increasing the havoc and carnage tenfold i felt so humiliated by this pitiful miscarriage of mine that i gave up and tried no more  the others were as outraged by the paladins selfish conduct as i wasand by his grand luck too of courseperhaps indeed that was the main hurt we talked our trouble over together which was natural for rivals become brothers when a common affliction assails them and a common enemy bears off the victory  each of us could do things that would please and get notice if it were not for this person who occupied all the time and gave others no chance i had made a poem taking a whole night to ita poem in which i most happily and delicately celebrated that sweet girls charms without mentioning her name but any one could see who was meant for the bare titlethe rose of orleanswould reveal that as it seemed to me it pictured this pure and dainty white rose as growing up out of the rude soil of war and looking abroad out of its tender eyes upon the horrid machinery of death and thennote this conceitit blushes for the sinful nature of man and turns red in a single night becomes a red rose you seea rose that was white before the idea was my own and quite new then it sent its sweet perfume out over the embattled city and when the beleaguering forces smelt it they laid down their arms and wept this was also my own idea and new that closed that part of the poem then i put her into the similitude of the firmamentnot the whole of it but only part that is to say she was the moon and all the constellations were following her about their hearts in flames for love of her but she would not halt she would not listen for twas thought she loved another twas thought she loved a poor unworthy suppliant who was upon the earth facing danger death and possible mutilation in the bloody field waging relentless war against a heartless foe to save her from an all too early grave and her city from destruction and when the sad pursuing constellations came to know and realize the bitter sorrow that was come upon themnote this ideatheir hearts broke and their tears gushed forth filling the vault of heaven with a fiery splendor for those tears were falling stars it was a rash idea but beautiful beautiful and pathetic wonderfully pathetic the way i had it with the rhyme and all to help at the end of each verse there was a twoline refrain pitying the poor earthly lover separated so far and perhaps forever from her he loved so well and growing always paler and weaker and thinner in his agony as he neared the cruel gravethe most touching thingeven the boys themselves could hardly keep back their tears the way noel said those lines there were eight fourline stanzas in the first end of the poemthe end about the rose the horticultural end as you may say if that is not too large a name for such a little poemand eight in the astronomical endsixteen stanzas altogether and i could have made it a hundred and fifty if i had wanted to i was so inspired and so all swelled up with beautiful thoughts and fancies but that would have been too many to sing or recite before a company that way whereas sixteen was just right and could be done over again if desired the boys were amazed that i could make such a poem as that out of my own head and so was i of course it being as much a surprise to me as it could be to anybody for i did not know that it was in me if any had asked me a single day before if it was in me i should have told them frankly no it was not  that is the way with us we may go on half of our life not knowing such a thing is in us when in reality it was there all the time and all we needed was something to turn up that would call for it indeed it was always so without family my grandfather had a cancer and they never knew what was the matter with him till he died and he didnt know himself it is wonderful how gifts and diseases can be concealed in that way all that was necessary in my case was for this lovely and inspiring girl to cross my path and out came the poem and no more trouble to me to word it and rhyme it and perfect it than it is to stone a dog no i should have said it was not in me but it was  the boys couldnt say enough about it they were so charmed and astonished the thing that pleased them the most was the way it would do the paladins business for him they forgot everything in their anxiety to get him shelved and silenced noel rainguesson was clear beside himself with admiration of the poem and wished he could do such a thing but it was out of his line and he couldnt of course he had it by heart in half an hour and there was never anything so pathetic and beautiful as the way he recited it for that was just his giftthat and mimicry he could recite anything better than anybody in the world and he could take of la hire to the very lifeor anybody else for that matter now i never could recite worth a farthing and when i tried with this poem the boys wouldnt let me finish they would have nobody but noel so then as i wanted the poem to make the best possible impression on catherine and the company i told noel he might do the reciting never was anybody so delighted he could hardly believe that i was in earnest but i was i said that to have them know that i was the author of it would be enough for me the boys were full of exultation and noel said if he could just get one chance at those people it would be all he would ask he would make them realize that there was something higher and finer than warlies to be had here  but how to get the opportunitythat was the difficulty we invented several schemes that promised fairly and at last we hit upon one that was sure that was to let the paladin get a good start in a manufactured battle and then send in a false call for him and as soon as he was out of the room have noel take his place and finish the battle himself in the paladins own style imitated to a shade that would get great applause and win the houses favor and put it in the right mood to hear the poem the two triumphs together with finish the standardbearermodify him anyway to a certainty and give the rest of us a chance for the future  so the next night i kept out of the way until the paladin had got his start and was sweeping down upon the enemy like a whirlwind at the head of his corps then i stepped within the door in my official uniform and announced that a messenger from general la hires quarters desired speech with the standardbearer he left the room and noel took his place and said that the interruption was to be deplored but that fortunately he was personally acquainted with the details of the battle himself and if permitted would be glad to state them to the company then without waiting for the permission he turned himself to the paladina dwarfed paladin of coursewith manner tones gestures attitudes everything exact and went right on with the battle and it would be impossible to imagine a more perfectly and minutely ridiculous imitation than he furnished to those shrieking people they went into spasms convulsions frenzies of laughter and the tears flowed down their cheeks in rivulets the more they laughed the more inspired noel grew with his theme and the greater marvels he worked till really the laughter was not properly laughing any more but screaming blessedest feature of all catherine boucher was dying with ecstasies and presently there was little left of her but gasps and suffocations victory it was a perfect agincourt  the paladin was gone only a couple of minutes he found out at once that a trick had been played on him so he came back when he approached the door he heard noel ranting in there and recognized the state of the case so he remained near the door but out of sight and heard the performance through to the end the applause noel got when he finished was wonderful and they kept it up and kept it up clapping their hands like mad and shouting to him to do it over again  but noel was clever he knew the very best background for a poem of deep and refined sentiment and pathetic melancholy was one where great and satisfying merriment had prepared the spirit for the powerful contrast  so he paused until all was quiet then his face grew grave and assumed an impressive aspect and at once all faces sobered in sympathy and took on a look of wondering and expectant interest now he began in a low but distinct voice the opening verses of the rose as he breathed the rhythmic measures forth and one gracious line after another fell upon those enchanted ears in that deep hush one could catch on every hand halfaudible ejaculations of how lovelyhow beautifulhow exquisite  by this time the paladin who had gone away for a moment with the opening of the poem was back again and had stepped within the door he stood there now resting his great frame against the wall and gazing toward the reciter like one entranced when noel got to the second part and that heartbreaking refrain began to melt and move all listeners the paladin began to wipe away tears with the back of first one hand and then the other the next time the refrain was repeated he got to snuffling and sort of half sobbing and went to wiping his eyes with the sleeves of his doublet he was so conspicuous that he embarrassed noel a little and also had an ill effect upon the audience with the next repetition he broke quite down and began to cry like a calf which ruined all the effect and started many to the audience to laughing then he went on from bad to worse until i never saw such a spectacle for he fetched out a towel from under his doublet and began to swab his eyes with it and let go the most infernal bellowings mixed up with sobbings and groanings and retchings and barkings and coughings and snortings and screamings and howlingsand he twisted himself about on his heels and squirmed this way and that still pouring out that brutal clamor and flourishing his towel in the air and swabbing again and wringing it out hear you couldnt hear yourself think noel was wholly drowned out and silenced and those people were laughing the very lungs out of themselves it was the most degrading sight that ever was now i heard the clanketyclank that platearmor makes when the man that is in it is running and then alongside my head there burst out the most inhuman explosion of laughter that ever rent the drum of a persons ear and i looked and it was la hire and the stood there with his gauntlets on his hips and his head tilted back and his jaws spread to that degree to let out his hurricanes and his thunders that it amounted to indecent exposure for you could see everything that was in him only one thing more and worse could happen and it happened at the other door i saw the flurry and bustle and bowings and scrapings of officials and flunkeys which means that some great personage is comingthen joan of arc stepped in and the house rose yes and tried to shut its indecorous mouth and make itself grave and proper but when it saw the maid herself go to laughing it thanked god for this mercy and the earthquake that followed  such things make a life of bitterness and i do not wish to dwell upon them the effect of the poem was spoiled      chapter 16 the finding of the dwarf  this episode disagreed with me and i was not able to leave my bed the next day the others were in the same condition but for this one or another of us might have had the good luck that fell to the paladins share that day but it is observable that god in his compassion sends the good luck to such as are ill equipped with gifts as compensation for their defect but requires such as are more fortunately endowed to get by labor and talent what those others get by chance it was noel who said this and it seemed to me to be well and justly thought  the paladin going about the town all the day in order to be followed and admired and overhear the people say in an awed voice sshlook it is the standardbearer of joan of arc had speech with all sorts and conditions of folk and he learned from some boatmen that there was a stir of some kind going on in the bastilles on the other side of the river and in the evening seeking further he found a deserter from the fortress called the augustins who said that the english were going to send me over to strengthen the garrisons on our side during the darkness of the night and were exulting greatly for they meant to spring upon dunois and the army when it was passing the bastilles and destroy it a thing quite easy to do since the witch would not be there and without her presence the army would do like the french armies of these many years pastdrop their weapons and run when they saw an english face  it was ten at night when the paladin brought this news and asked leave to speak to joan and i was up and on duty then it was a bitter stroke to me to see what a chance i had lost joan made searching inquiries and satisfied herself that the word was true then she made this annoying remark  you have done well and you have my thanks it may be that you have prevented a disaster your name and service shall receive official mention  then he bowed low and when he rose he was eleven feet high as he swelled out past me he covertly pulled down the corner of his eye with his finger and muttered part of that defiled refrain oh tears ah tears oh sad sweet tearsname in general orderspersonal mention to the king you see  i wished joan could have seen his conduct but she was busy thinking what she would do then she had me fetch the knight jean de metz and in a minute he was off for la hires quarters with orders for him and the lord de villars and florent dilliers to report to her at five oclock next morning with five hundred picked men well mounted the histories say half past four but it is not true i heard the order given  we were on our way at five to the minute and encountered the head of the arriving column between six and seven a couple of leagues from the city dunois was pleased for the army had begun to get restive and show uneasiness now that it was getting so near to the dreaded bastilles but that all disappeared now as the word ran down the line with a huzza that swept along the length of it like a wave that the maid was come dunois asked her to halt and let the column pass in review so that the men could be sure that the reports of her presence was not a ruse to revive their courage so she took position at the side of the road with her staff and the battalions swung by with a martial stride huzzaing joan was armed except her head she was wearing the cunning little velvet cap with the mass of curved white ostrich plumes tumbling over its edges which the city of orleans had given her the night she arrivedthe one that is in the picture that hangs in the hotel de ville at rouen she was looking about fifteen the sight of soldiers always set her blood to leaping and lit the fires in her eyes and brought the warm rich color to her cheeks it was then that you saw that she was too beautiful to be of the earth or at any rate that there was a subtle something somewhere about her beauty that differed it from the human types of your experience and exalted it above them  in the train of wains laden with supplies a man lay on top of the goods he was stretched out on his back and his hands were tied together with ropes and also his ankles joan signed to the officer in charge of that division of the train to come to her and he rode up and saluted  what is he that is bound there she asked  a prisoner general  what is his offense  he is a deserter  what is to be done with him  he will be hanged but it was not convenient on the march and there was no hurry  tell me about him  he is a good soldier but he asked leave to go and see his wife who was dying he said but it could not be granted so he went without leave meanwhile the march began and he only overtook us yesterday evening  overtook you did he come of his own will  yes it was of his own will  he a deserter name of god bring him to me  the officer rode forward and loosed the mans feet and brought him back with his hands still tied what a figure he wasa good seven feet high and built for business he had a strong face he had an unkempt shock of black hair which showed up a striking way when the officer removed his morion for him for weapon he had a big ax in his broad leathern belt standing by joans horse he made joan look littler than ever for his head was about on a level with her own his face was profoundly melancholy all interest in life seemed to be dead in the man joan said  hold up your hands  the mans head was down he lifted it when he heard that soft friendly voice and there was a wistful something in his face which made one think that there had been music in it for him and that he would like to hear it again when he raised his hands joan laid her sword to his bonds but the officer said with apprehension  ah madammy general  what is it she said  he is under sentence  yes i know i am responsible for him and she cut the bonds they had lacerated his wrists and they were bleeding ah pitiful she said bloodi do not like it and she shrank from the sight but only for a moment give me something somebody to bandage his wrists with  the officer said  ah my general it is not fitting let me bring another to do it  another de par le dieu you would seek far to find one that can do it better than i for i learned it long ago among both men and beasts and i can tie better than those that did this if i had tied him the ropes had not cut his flesh  the man looked on silent while he was being bandaged stealing a furtive glance at joans face occasionally such as an animal might that is receiving a kindness form an unexpected quarter and is gropingly trying to reconcile the act with its source all the staff had forgotten the huzzaing army drifting by in its rolling clouds of dust to crane their necks and watch the bandaging as if it was the most interesting and absorbing novelty that ever was i have often seen people do like thatget entirely lost in the simplest trifle when it is something that is out of their line now there in poitiers once i saw two bishops and a dozen of those grave and famous scholars grouped together watching a man paint a sign on a shop they didnt breathe they were as good as dead and when it began to sprinkle they didnt know it at first then they noticed it and each man hove a deep sigh and glanced up with a surprised look as wondering to see the others there and how he came to be there himselfbut that is the way with people as i have said there is no way of accounting for people you have to take them as they are  there said joan at last pleased with her success another could have done it no betternot as well i think tell mewhat is it you did tell me all  the giant said  it was this way my angel my mother died then my three little children one after the other all in two years it was the famine others fared soit was gods will i saw them die i had that grace and i buried them then when my poor wifes fate was come i begged for leave to go to hershe who was so dear to meshe who was all i had i begged on my knees but they would not let me could i let her die friendless and alone could i let her die believing i would not come would she let me die and she not comewith her feet free to do it if she would and no cost upon it but only her life ah she would comeshe would come through the fire so i went i saw her she died in my arms i buried her then the army was gone i had trouble to overtake it but my legs are long and there are many hours in a day i overtook it last night  joan said musingly as if she were thinking aloud  it sounds true if true it were no great harm to suspend the law this one timeany would say that it may not be true but if it is true she turned suddenly to the man and said i would see your eyeslook up the eyes of the two met and joan said to the officer this man is pardoned give you good day you may go then she said to the man did you know it was death to come back to the army  yes he said i knew it  then why did you do it  the man said quite simply  because it was death she was all i had there was nothing left to love  ah yes there wasfrance the children of france have always their motherthey cannot be left with nothing to love you shall liveand you shall serve france  i will serve youyou shall fight for france  i will fight for you  you shall be frances soldier  i will be your soldieryou shall give all your heart to france  i will give all my heart to youand all my soul if i have oneand all my strength which is greatfor i was dead and am alive again i had nothing to live for but now i have you are france for me you are my france and i will have no other  joan smiled and was touched and pleased at the mans grave enthusiasmsolemn enthusiasm one may call it for the manner of it was deeper than mere gravityand she said  well it shall be as you will what are you called  the man answered with unsmiling simplicity  they call me the dwarf but i think it is more in jest than otherwise  it made joan laugh and she said  it has something of that look truly what is the office of that vast ax  the soldier replied with the same gravitywhich must have been born to him it sat upon him so naturally  it is to persuade persons to respect france  joan laughed again and said  have you given many lessons  ah indeed yesmany  the pupils behaved to suit you afterward  yes it made them quietquite pleasant and quiet  i should think it would happen so would you like to be my manatarmsorderly sentinel or something like that  if i may  then you shall you shall have proper armor and shall go on teaching your art take one of those led horses there and follow the staff when we move  that is how we came by the dwarf and a good fellow he was joan picked him out on sight but it wasnt a mistake no one could be faithfuler than he was and he was a devil and the son of a devil when he turned himself loose with his ax he was so big that he made the paladin look like an ordinary man he liked to like people therefore people liked him he liked us boys from the start and he liked the knights and liked pretty much everybody he came across but he thought more of a paring of joans fingernail than he did of all the rest of the world put together  yes that is where we got himstretched on the wain going to his death poor chap and nobody to say a good word for him he was a good find why the knights treated him almost like an equalit is the honest truth that is the sort of a man he was they called him the bastille sometimes and sometimes they called him hellfire which was on account of his warm and sumptuous style in battle and you know they wouldnt have given him pet names if they hadnt had a good deal of affection for him  to the dwarf joan was france the spirit of france made fleshhe never got away from that idea that he had started with and god knows it was the true one that was a humble eye to see so great a truth where some others failed to me that seems quite remarkable and yet after all it was in a way just what nations do when they love a great and noble thing they embody itthey want it so that they can see it with their eyes like liberty for instance they are not content with the cloudy abstract idea they make a beautiful statue of it and then their beloved idea is substantial and they can look at it and worship it and so it is as i say to the dwarf joan was our country embodied our country made visible flesh cast in a gracious form when she stood before others they saw joan of arc but he saw france  sometimes he would speak of her by that name it shows you how the idea was embedded in his mind and how real it was to him the world has called our kings by it but i know of none of them who has had so good a right as she to that sublime title  when the march past was finished joan returned to the front and rode at the head of the column when we began to file past those grim bastilles and could glimpse the men within standing to their guns and ready to empty death into our ranks such a faintness came over me and such a sickness that all things seemed to turn dim and swim before my eyes and the other boys looked droopy too i thoughtincluding the paladin although i do not know this for certain because he was ahead of me and i had to keep my eyes out toward the bastille side because i could wince better when i saw what to wince at  but joan was at homein paradise i might say she sat up straight and i could see that she was feeling different from me the awfulest thing was the silence there wasnt a sound but the screaking of the saddles the measured tramplings and the sneezing of the horses afflicted by the smothering dustclouds which they kicked up i wanted to sneeze myself but it seemed to me that i would rather go unsneezed or suffer even a bitterer torture if there is one than attract attention to myself  i was not of a rank to make suggestions or i would have suggested that if we went faster we should get by sooner it seemed to me that it was an illjudged time to be taking a walk just as we were drifting in that suffocating stillness past a great cannon that stood just within a raised portcullis with nothing between me and it but the moat a most uncommon jackass in there split the world with his bray and i fell out of the saddle sir bertrand grabbed me as i went which was well for if i had gone to the ground in my armor i could not have gotten up again by myself the english warders on the battlements laughed a coarse laugh forgetting that every one must begin and that there had been a time when they themselves would have fared no better when shot by a jackass  the english never uttered a challenge nor fired a shot it was said afterward that when their men saw the maid riding at the front and saw how lovely she was their eager courage cooled down in many cases and vanished in the rest they feeling certain that the creature was not mortal but the very child of satan and so the officers were prudent and did not try to make them fight it was said also that some of the officers were affected by the same superstitious fears well in any case they never offered to molest us and we poked by all the grisly fortresses in peace during the march i caught up on my devotions which were in arrears so it was not all loss and no profit for me after all  it was on this march that the histories say dunois told joan that the english were expecting reinforcements under the command of sir john fastolfe and that she turned upon him and said  bastard bastard in gods name i warn you to let me know of his coming as soon as you hear of it for if he passes without my knowledge you shall lose your head  it may be so i dont deny it but i didnt her it if she really said it i think she only meant she would take off his official headdegrade him from his command it was not like her to threaten a comrades life she did have her doubts of her generals and was entitled to them for she was all for storm and assault and they were for holding still and tiring the english out since they did not believe in her way and were experienced old soldiers it would be natural for them to prefer their own and try to get around carrying hers out  but i did hear something that the histories didnt mention and dont know about i heard joan say that now that the garrisons on the other wide had been weakened to strengthen those on our side the most effective point of operations had shifted to the south shore so she meant to go over there and storm the forts which held the bridge end and that would open up communication with our own dominions and raise the siege the generals began to balk privately right away but they only baffled and delayed her and that for only four days  all orleans met the army at the gate and huzzaed it through the bannered streets to its various quarters but nobody had to rock it to sleep it slumped down dogtired for dunois had rushed it without mercy and for the next twentyfour hours it would be quiet all but the snoring      chapter 17 sweet fruit of bitter truth  when we got home breakfast for us minor fry was waiting in our messroom and the family honored us by coming in to eat it with us the nice old treasurer and in fact all three were flatteringly eager to hear about our adventures nobody asked the paladin to begin but he did begin because now that his specially ordained and peculiar military rank set him above everybody on the personal staff but old daulon who didnt eat with us he didnt care a farthing for the knights nobility no mine but took precedence in the talk whenever it suited him which was all the time because he was born that way he said  god be thanked we found the army in admirable condition i think i have never seen a finer body of animals  animals said miss catherine  i will explain to you what he means said noel he  i will trouble you not to trouble yourself to explain anything for me said the paladin loftily i have reason to think  that is his way said noel always when he thinks he has reason to think he thinks he does think but this is an error he didnt see the army i noticed him and he didnt see it he was troubled by his old complaint  whats his old complaint catherine asked  prudence i said seeing my chance to help  but it was not a fortunate remark for the paladin said  it probably isnt your turn to criticize peoples prudenceyou who fall out of the saddle when a donkey brays  they all laughed and i was ashamed of myself for my hasty smartness i said  it isnt quite fair for you to say i fell out on account of the donkeys braying it was emotion just ordinary emotion  very well if you want to call it that i am not objecting what would you call it sir bertrand  well itwell whatever it was it was excusable i think all of you have learned how to behave in hot handtohand engagements and you dont need to be ashamed of your record in that matter but to walk along in front of death with ones hands idle and no noise no music and nothing going on is a very trying situation if i were you de conte i would name the emotion its nothing to be ashamed of  it was as straight and sensible a speech as ever i heard and i was grateful for the opening it gave me so i came out and said  it was fearand thank you for the honest idea too  it was the cleanest and best way out said the old treasurer youve done well my lad  that made me comfortable and when miss catherine said its what i think too i was grateful to myself for getting into that scrape  sir jean de metz said  we were all in a body together when the donkey brayed and it was dismally still at the time i dont see how any young campaigner could escape some little touch of that emotion  he looked about him with a pleasant expression of inquiry on his good face and as each pair of eyes in turn met his head they were in nodded a confession even the paladin delivered his nod that surprised everybody and saved the standardbearers credit it was clever of him nobody believed he could tell the truth that way without practice or would tell that particular sort of a truth either with or without practice i suppose he judged it would favorably impress the family then the old treasurer said  passing the forts in that trying way required the same sort of nerve that a person must have when ghosts are about him in the dark i should think what does the standardbearer think  well i dont quite know about that sir ive often thought i would like to see a ghost if i  would you exclaimed the young lady weve got one would you try that one will you  she was so eager and pretty that the paladin said straight out that he would and then as none of the rest had bravery enough to expose the fear that was in him one volunteered after the other with a prompt mouth and a sick heart till all were shipped for the voyage then the girl clapped her hands in glee and the parents were gratified too saying that the ghosts of their house had been a dread and a misery to them and their forebears for generations and nobody had ever been found yet who was willing to confront them and find out what their trouble was so that the family could heal it and content the poor specters and beguile them to tranquillity and peace      chapter 18 joans first battlefield  about noon i was chatting with madame boucher nothing was going on all was quiet when catherine boucher suddenly entered in great excitement and said  fly sir fly the maid was doing in her chair in my room when she sprang up and cried out french blood is flowingmy arms give me my arms her giant was on guard at the door and he brought daulon who began to arm her and i and the giant have been warning the staff flyand stay by her and if there really is a battle keep her out of itdont let her risk herselfthere is no needif the men know she is near and looking on it is all that is necessary keep her out of the fightdont fail of this  i started on a run saying sarcasticallyfor i was always fond of sarcasm and it was said that i had a most neat gift that way  oh yes nothing easier than thatill attend to it  at the furthest end of the house i met joan fully armed hurrying toward the door and she said  ah french blood is being spilt and you did not tell me  indeed i did not know it i said there are no sounds of war everything is quiet your excellency  you will hear warsounds enough in a moment she said and was gone  it was true before one could count five there broke upon the stillness the swelling rush and tramp of an approaching multitude of men and horses with hoarse cries of command and then out of the distance came the muffled deep boomboomboomboom of cannon and straightway that rushing multitude was roaring by the house like a hurricane  our knights and all our staff came flying armed but with no horses ready and we burst out after joan in a body the paladin in the lead with the banner the surging crowd was made up half of citizens and half of soldiers and had no recognized leader when joan was seen a huzza went up and she shouted  a horsea horse  a dozen saddles were at her disposal in a moment she mounted a hundred people shouting  way thereway for the maid of orleans the first time that that immortal name was ever utteredand i praise god was there to hear it the mass divided itself like the waters of the red sea and down this lane joan went skimming like a bird crying forward french heartsfollow me and we came winging in her wake on the rest of the borrowed horses the holy standard streaming above us and the lane closing together in our rear  this was a different thing from the ghastly march past the dismal bastilles no we felt fine now and all awhirl with enthusiasm the explanation of this sudden uprising was this the city and the little garrison so long hopeless and afraid had gone wild over joans coming and could no longer restrain their desire to get at the enemy so without orders from anybody a few hundred soldiers and citizens had plunged out at the burgundy gate on a sudden impulse and made a charge on one of lord talbots most formidable fortressesst loupand were getting the worst of it the news of this had swept through the city and started this new crowd that we were with  as we poured out at the gate we met a force bringing in the wounded from the front the sight moved joan and she said  ah french blood it makes my hair rise to see it  we were soon on the field soon in the midst of the turmoil joan was seeing her first real battle and so were we  it was a battle in the open field for the garrison of st loup had sallied confidently out to meet the attack being used to victories when witches were not around the sally had been reinforced by troops from the paris bastille and when we approached the french were getting whipped and were falling back but when joan came charging through the disorder with her banner displayed crying forward menfollow me there was a change the french turned about and surged forward like a solid wave of the sea and swept the english before them hacking and slashing and being hacked and slashed in a way that was terrible to see  in the field the dwarf had no assignment that is to say he was not under orders to occupy any particular place therefore he chose his place for himself and went ahead of joan and made a road for her it was horrible to see the iron helmets fly into fragments under his dreadful ax he called it cracking nuts and it looked like that he made a good road and paved it well with flesh and iron joan and the rest of us followed it so briskly that we outspeeded our forces and had the english behind us as well as before the knights commanded us to face outward around joan which we did and then there was work done that was fine to see one was obliged to respect the paladin now being right under joans exalting and transforming eye he forgot his native prudence he forgot his diffidence in the presence of danger he forgot what fear was and he never laid about him in his imaginary battles in a more tremendous way that he did in this real one and wherever he struck there was an enemy the less  we were in that close place only a few minutes then our forces to the rear broke through with a great shout and joined us and then the english fought a retreating fight but in a fine and gallant way and we drove them to their fortress foot by foot they facing us all the time and their reserves on the walls raining showers of arrows crossbow bolts and stone cannonballs upon us  the bulk of the enemy got safely within the works and left us outside with piles of french and english dead and wounded for companya sickening sight an awful sight to us youngsters for our little ambush fights in february had been in the night and the blood and the mutilations and the dead faces were mercifully dim whereas we saw these things now for the first time in all their naked ghastliness  now arrived dunois from the city and plunged through the battle on his foamflecked horse and galloped up to joan saluting and uttering handsome compliments as he came he waved his hand toward the distant walls of the city where a multitude of flags were flaunting gaily in the wind and said the populace were up there observing her fortunate performance and rejoicing over it and added that she and the forces would have a great reception now  now hardly now bastard not yet  why not yet is there more to be done  more bastard we have but begun we will take this fortress  ah you cant be serious we cant take this place let me urge you not to make the attempt it is too desperate let me order the forces back  joans heart was overflowing with the joys and enthusiasms of war and it made her impatient to hear such talk she cried out  bastard bastard will ye play always with these english now verily i tell you we will not budge until this place is ours we will carry it by storm sound the charge  ah my general  waste no more time manlet the bugles sound the assault and we saw that strange deep light in her eye which we named the battlelight and learned to know so well in later fields  the martial notes pealed out the troops answered with a yell and down they came against that formidable work whose outlines were lost in its own cannonsmoke and whose sides were spouting flame and thunder  we suffered repulse after repulse but joan was here and there and everywhere encouraging the men and she kept them to their work during three hours the tide ebbed and flowed flowed and ebbed but at last la hire who was now come made a final and resistless charge and the bastille st loup was ours we gutted it taking all its stores and artillery and then destroyed it  when all our host was shouting itself hoarse with rejoicings and there went up a cry for the general for they wanted to praise her and glorify her and do her homage for her victory we had trouble to find her and when we did find her she was off by herself sitting among a ruck of corpses with her face in her hands cryingfor she was a young girl you know and her hero heart was a young girls heart too with the pity and the tenderness that are natural to it she was thinking of the mothers of those dead friends and enemies  among the prisoners were a number of priests and joan took these under her protection and saved their lives it was urged that they were most probably combatants in disguise but she said  as to that how can any tell they wear the livery of god and if even one of these wears it rightfully surely it were better that all the guilty should escape than that we have upon our hands the blood of that innocent man i will lodge them where i lodge and feed them and sent them away in safety  we marched back to the city with our crop of cannon and prisoners on view and our banners displayed here was the first substantial bit of warwork the imprisoned people had seen in the seven months that the siege had endured the first chance they had had to rejoice over a french exploit you may guess that they made good use of it they and the bells went mad joan was their darling now and the press of people struggling and shouldering each other to get a glimpse of her was so great that we could hardly push our way through the streets at all her new name had gone all about and was on everybodys lips the holy maid of vaucouleurs was a forgotten title the city had claimed her for its own and she was the maid of orleans now it is a happiness to me to remember that i heard that name the first time it was ever uttered between that first utterance and the last time it will be uttered on this earthah think how many moldering ages will lie in that gap  the boucher family welcomed her back as if she had been a child of the house and saved from death against all hope or probability they chided her for going into the battle and exposing herself to danger during all those hours they could not realize that she had meant to carry her warriorship so far and asked her if it had really been her purpose to go right into the turmoil of the fight or hadnt she got swept into it by accident and the rush of the troops they begged her to be more careful another time it was good advice maybe but it fell upon pretty unfruitful soil      chapter 19 we burst in upon ghosts  being worn out with the long fight we all slept the rest of the afternoon away and two or three hours into the night then we got up refreshed and had supper as for me i could have been willing to let the matter of the ghost drop and the others were of a like mind no doubt for they talked diligently of the battle and said nothing of that other thing and indeed it was fine and stirring to hear the paladin rehearse his deeds and see him pile his dead fifteen here eighteen there and thirtyfive yonder but this only postponed the trouble it could not do more he could not go on forever when he had carried the bastille by assault and eaten up the garrison there was nothing for it but to stop unless catherine boucher would give him a new start and have it all done over againas we hoped she would this timebut she was otherwise minded as soon as there was a good opening and a fair chance she brought up her unwelcome subject and we faced it the best we could  we followed her and her parents to the haunted room at eleven oclock with candles and also with torches to place in the sockets on the walls it was a big house with very thick walls and this room was in a remote part of it which had been left unoccupied for nobody knew how many years because of its evil repute  this was a large room like a salon and had a big table in it of enduring oak and well preserved but the chair were wormeaten and the tapestry on the walls was rotten and discolored by age the dusty cobwebs under the ceiling had the look of not having had any business for a century  catherine said  tradition says that these ghosts have never been seenthey have merely been heard it is plain that this room was once larger than it is now and that the wall at this end was built in some bygone time to make and fence off a narrow room there there is no communication anywhere with that narrow room and if it existsand of that there is no reasonable doubtit has no light and no air but is an absolute dungeon wait where you are and take note of what happens  that was all then she and her parents left us when their footfalls had died out in the distance down the empty stone corridors an uncanny silence and solemnity ensued which was dismaler to me than the mute march past the bastilles we sat looking vacantly at each other and it was easy to see that no one there was comfortable the longer we sat so the more deadly still that stillness got to be and when the wind began to moan around the house presently it made me sick and miserable and i wished i had been brave enough to be a coward this time for indeed it is no proper shame to be afraid of ghosts seeing how helpless the living are in their hands and then these ghosts were invisible which made the matter the worse as it seemed to me they might be in the room with us at that momentwe could not know i felt airy touches on my shoulders and my hair and i shrank from them and cringed and was not ashamed to show this fear for i saw the others doing the like and knew that they were feeling those faint contacts too as this went onoh eternities it seemed the time dragged so drearilyall those faces became as wax and i seemed sitting with a congress of the dead  at last faint and far and weird and slow came a boomboombooma distant bell tolling midnight when the last stroke died that depressing stillness followed again and as before i was staring at those waxen faces and feeling those airy touches on my hair and my shoulders once more  one minutetwo minutesthree minutes of this then we heard a long deep groan and everybody sprang up and stood with his legs quaking it came from that little dungeon there was a pause then we herd muffled sobbings mixed with pitiful ejaculations then there was a second voice low and not distinct and the one seemed trying to comfort the other and so the two voices went on with moanings and soft sobbings and ah the tones were so full of compassion and sorry and despair indeed it made ones heart sore to hear it  but those sounds were so real and so human and so moving that the idea of ghosts passed straight out of our minds and sir jean de metz spoke out and said  come we will smash that wall and set those poor captives free here with your ax  the dwarf jumped forward swinging his great ax with both hands and others sprang for torches and brought them  bangwhangslamsmash went the ancient bricks and there was a hole an ox could pass through we plunged within and held up the torches  nothing there but vacancy on the floor lay a rusty sword and a rotten fan  now you know all that i know take the pathetic relics and weave about them the romance of the dungeons longvanished inmates as best you can      chapter 20 joan makes cowards brave victors  the next day joan wanted to go against the enemy again but it was the feast of the ascension and the holy council of bandit generals were too pious to be willing to profane it with bloodshed but privately they profaned it with plottings a sort of industry just in their line they decided to do the only thing proper to do now in the new circumstances of the casefeign an attack on the most important bastille on the orleans side and then if the english weakened the far more important fortresses on the other side of the river to come to its help cross in force and capture those works this would give them the bridge and free communication with the sologne which was french territory they decided to keep this latter part of the program secret from joan  joan intruded and took them by surprise she asked them what they were about and what they had resolved upon they said they had resolved to attack the most important of the english bastilles on the orleans side next morningand there the spokesman stopped joan said  well go on  there is nothing more that is all  am i to believe this that is to say am i to believe that you have lost your wits she turned to dunois and said bastard you have sense answer me this if this attack is made and the bastille taken how much better off would we be than we are now  the bastard hesitated and then began some rambling talk not quite germane to the question joan interrupted him and said  that will not do good bastard you have answered since the bastard is not able to mention any advantage to be gained by taking that bastille and stopping there it is not likely that any of you could better the matter you waste much time here in inventing plans that lead to nothing and making delays that are a damage are you concealing something from me bastard this council has a general plan i take it without going into details what is it  it is the same it was in the beginning seven months agoto get provisions for a long siege then sit down and tire the english out  in the name of god as if seven months was not enough you want to provide for a year of it now ye shall drop these pusillanimous dreamsthe english shall go in three days  several exclaimed  ah general general be prudent  be prudent and starve do ye call that war i tell you this if you do not already know it the new circumstances have changed the face of matters the true point of attack has shifted it is on the other side of the river now one must take the fortifications that command the bridge the english know that if we are not fools and cowards we will try to do that they are grateful for your piety in wasting this day they will reinforce the bridge forts from this side tonight knowing what ought to happen tomorrow you have but lost a day and made our task harder for we will cross and take the bridge forts bastard tell me the truthdoes not this council know that there is no other course for us than the one i am speaking of  dunois conceded that the council did know it to be the most desirable but considered it impracticable and he excused the council as well as he could by saying that inasmuch as nothing was really and rationally to be hoped for but a long continuance of the siege and wearying out of the english they were naturally a little afraid of joans impetuous notions he said  you see we are sure that the waiting game is the best whereas you would carry everything by storm  that i wouldand moreover that i will you have my ordershere and now we will move upon the forts of the south bank tomorrow at dawn  and carry them by storm  yes carry them by storm  la hire came clanking in and heard the last remark he cried out  by my baton that is the music i love to hear yes that is the right time and the beautiful words my generalwe will carry them by storm  he saluted in his large way and came up and shook joan by the hand  some member of the council was heard to say  it follows then that we must begin with the bastille st john and that will give the english time to  joan turned and said  give yourselves no uneasiness about the bastille st john the english will know enough to retire from it and fall back on the bridge bastilles when they see us coming she added with a touch of sarcasm even a warcouncil would know enough to do that itself  then she took her leave la hire made this general remark to the council  she is a child and that is all ye seem to see keep to that superstition if you must but you perceive that this child understands this complex game of war as well as any of you and if you want my opinion without the trouble of asking for it here you have it without ruffles or embroideryby god i think she can teach the best of you how to play it  joan had spoken truly the sagacious english saw that the policy of the french had undergone a revolution that the policy of paltering and dawdling was ended that in place of taking blows blows were ready to be struck now therefore they made ready for the new state of things by transferring heavy reinforcements to the bastilles of the south bank from those of the north  the city learned the great news that once more in french history after all these humiliating years france was going to take the offensive that france so used to retreating was going to advance that france so long accustomed to skulking was going to face about and strike the joy of the people passed all bounds the city walls were black with them to see the army march out in the morning in that strange new positionits front not its tail toward an english camp you shall imagine for yourselves what the excitement was like and how it expressed itself when joan rode out at the head of the host with her banner floating above her  we crossed the five in strong force and a tedious long job it was for the boats were small and not numerous our landing on the island of st aignan was not disputed we threw a bridge of a few boats across the narrow channel thence to the south shore and took up our march in good order and unmolested for although there was a fortress therest johnthe english vacated and destroyed it and fell back on the bridge forts below as soon as our first boats were seen to leave the orleans shore which was what joan had said would happen when she was disputing with the council  we moved down the shore and joan planted her standard before the bastille of the augustins the first of the formidable works that protected the end of the bridge the trumpets sounded the assault and two charges followed in handsome style but we were too weak as yet for our main body was still lagging behind before we could gather for a third assault the garrison of st prive were seen coming up to reinforce the big bastille they came on a run and the augustins sallied out and both forces came against us with a rush and sent our small army flying in a panic and followed us slashing and slaying and shouting jeers and insults at us  joan was doing her best to rally the men but their wits were gone their hearts were dominated for the moment by the oldtime dread of the english joans temper flamed up and she halted and commanded the trumpets to sound the advance then she wheeled about and cried out  if there is but a dozen of you that are not cowards it is enoughfollow me  away she went and after her a few dozen who had heard her words and been inspired by them the pursuing force was astonished to see her sweeping down upon them with this handful of men and it was their turn now to experience a grisly frightsurely this is a witch this is a child of satan that was their thoughtand without stopping to analyze the matter they turned and fled in a panic  our flying squadrons heard the bugle and turned to look and when they saw the maids banner speeding in the other direction and the enemy scrambling ahead of it in disorder their courage returned and they came scouring after us  la hire heard it and hurried his force forward and caught up with us just as we were planting our banner again before the ramparts of the augustins we were strong enough now we had a long and tough piece of work before us but we carried it through before night joan keeping us hard at it and she and la hire saying we were able to take that big bastille and must the english fought likewell they fought like the english when that is said there is no more to say we made assault after assault through the smoke and flame and the deafening cannonblasts and at last as the sun was sinking we carried the place with a rush and planted our standard on its walls  the augustins was ours the tourelles must be ours too if we would free the bridge and raise the siege we had achieved one great undertaking joan was determined to accomplish the other we must lie on our arms where we were hold fast to what we had got and be ready for business in the morning so joan was not minded to let the men be demoralized by pillage and riot and carousings she had the augustins burned with all its stores in it excepting the artillery and ammunition  everybody was tired out with this long days hard work and of course this was the case with joan still she wanted to stay with the army before the tourelles to be ready for the assault in the morning the chiefs argued with her and at last persuaded her to go home and prepare for the great work by taking proper rest and also by having a leech look to a wound which she had received in her foot so we crossed with them and went home  just as usual we found the town in a fury of joy all the bells clanging everybody shouting and several people drunk we never went out or came in without furnishing good and sufficient reasons for one of these pleasant tempests and so the tempest was always on hand there had been a blank absence of reasons for this sort of upheavals for the past seven months therefore the people too to the upheavals with all the more relish on that account      chapter 21 she gently reproves her dear friend  to get away from the usual crowd of visitors and have a rest joan went with catherine straight to the apartment which the two occupied together and there they took their supper and there the wound was dressed but then instead of going to bed joan weary as she was sent the dwarf for me in spite of catherines protests and persuasions she said she had something on her mind and must send a courier to domremy with a letter for our old pere fronte to read to her mother i came and she began to dictate after some loving words and greetings to her mother and family came this  but the thing which moves me to write now is to say that when you presently hear that i am wounded you shall give yourself no concern about it and refuse faith to any that shall try to make you believe it is serious  she was going on when catherine spoke up and said  ah but it will fright her so to read these words strike them out joan strike them out and wait only one daytwo days at mostthen write and say your foot was wounded but is well againfor it surely be well then or very near it dont distress her joan do as i say  a laugh like the laugh of the old days the impulsive free laugh of an untroubled spirit a laugh like a chime of bells was joans answer then she said  my foot why should i write about such a scratch as that i was not thinking of it dear heart  child have you another wound and a worse and have not spoken of it what have you been dreaming about that you  she had jumped up full of vague fears to have the leech called back at once but joan laid her hand upon her arm and made her sit down again saying  there now be tranquil there is no other wound as yet i am writing about one which i shall get when we storm that bastille tomorrow  catherine had the look of one who is trying to understand a puzzling proposition but cannot quite do it she said in a distraught fashion  a wound which you are going to get butbut why grieve your mother when itwhen it may not happen  may not why it will  the puzzle was a puzzle still catherine said in that same abstracted way as before  will it is a strong word i cannot seem tomy mind is not able to take hold of this oh joan such a presentiment is a dreadful thingit takes ones peace and courage all away cast it from youdrive it out it will make your whole night miserable and to no good for we will hope  but it isnt a presentimentit is a fact and it will not make me miserable it is uncertainties that do that but this is not an uncertainty  joan do you know it is going to happen  yes i know it my voices told me  ah said catherine resignedly if they told youbut are you sure it was theyquite sure  yes quite it will happenthere is no doubt  it is dreadful since when have you know it  sincei think it is several weeks joan turned to me louis you will remember how long is it  your excellency spoke of it first to the king in chinon i answered that was as much as seven weeks ago you spoke of it again the 20th of april and also the 22d two weeks ago as i see by my record here  these marvels disturbed catherine profoundly but i had long ceased to be surprised at them one can get used to anything in this world catherine said  and it is to happen tomorrowalways tomorrow is it the same date always there has been no mistake and no confusion  no joan said the 7th of may is the datethere is no other  then you shall not go a step out of this house till that awful day is gone by you will not dream of it joan will youpromise that you will stay with us  but joan was not persuaded she said  it would not help the matter dear good friend the wound is to come and come tomorrow if i do not seek it it will seek me my duty calls me to that place tomorrow i should have to go if my death were waiting for me there shall i stay away for only a wound oh no we must try to do better than that  then you are determined to go  of a certainty yes there is only one thing that i can do for francehearten her soldiers for battle and victory she thought a moment then added however one should not be unreasonable and i would do much to please you who are so good to me do you love france  i wondered what she might be contriving now but i saw no clue catherine said reproachfully  ah what have i done to deserve this question  then you do love france i had not doubted it dear do not be hurt but answer mehave you ever told a lie  in my life i have not wilfully told a liefibs but no lies  that is sufficient you love france and do not tell lies therefore i will trust you i will go or i will stay as you shall decide  oh i thank you from my heart joan how good and dear it is of you to do this for me oh you shall stay and not go  in her delight she flung her arms about joans neck and squandered endearments upon her the least of which would have made me rich but as it was they only made me realize how poor i washow miserably poor in what i would most have prized in this world joan said  then you will send word to my headquarters that i am not going  oh gladly leave that to me  it is good of you and how will you word itfor it must have proper official form shall i word it for you  oh dofor you know about these solemn procedures and stately proprieties and i have had no experience  then word it like this the chief of staff is commanded to make known to the kings forces in garrison and in the field that the generalinchief of the armies of france will not face the english on the morrow she being afraid she may get hurt signed joan of arc by the hand of catherine boucher who loves france  there was a pausea silence of the sort that tortures one into stealing a glance to see how the situation looks and i did that there was a loving smile on joans face but the color was mounting in crimson waves into catherines and her lips were quivering and the tears gathering then she said  oh i am so ashamed of myselfand you are so noble and brave and wise and i am so paltryso paltry and such a fool and she broke down and began to cry and i did so want to take her in my arms and comfort her but joan did it and of course i said nothing joan did it well and most sweetly and tenderly but i could have done it as well though i knew it would be foolish and out of place to suggest such a thing and might make an awkwardness too and be embarrassing to us all so i did not offer and i hope i did right and for the best though i could not know and was many times tortured with doubts afterward as having perhaps let a chance pass which might have changed all my life and made it happier and more beautiful than alas it turned out to be for this reason i grieve yet when i think of that scene and do not like to call it up out of the deeps of my memory because of the pangs it brings  well well a good and wholesome thing is a little harmless fun in this world it tones a body up and keeps him human and prevents him from souring to set that little trap for catherine was as good and effective a way as any to show her what a grotesque thing she was asking of joan it was a funny idea now wasnt it when you look at it all around even catherine dried up her tears and laughed when she thought of the english getting hold of the french commanderinchiefs reason for staying out of a battle she granted that they could have a good time over a thing like that  we got to work on the letter again and of course did not have to strike out the passage about the wound joan was in fine spirits but when she got to sending messages to this that and the other playmate and friend it brought our village and the fairy tree and the flowery plain and the browsing sheep and all the peaceful beauty of our old humble homeplace back and the familiar names began to tremble on her lips and when she got to haumette and little mengette it was no use her voice broke and she couldnt go on she waited a moment then said  give them my lovemy warm lovemy deep loveoh out of my heart of hearts i shall never see our home any more  now came pasquerel joans confessor and introduced a gallant knight the sire de rais who had been sent with a message he said he was instructed to say that the council had decided that enough had been done for the present that it would be safest and best to be content with what god had already done that the city was now well victualed and able to stand a long siege that the wise course must necessarily be to withdraw the troops from the other side of the river and resume the defensivetherefore they had decided accordingly  the incurable cowards exclaimed joan so it was to get me away from my men that they pretended so much solicitude about my fatigue take this message back not to the councili have no speeches for those disguised ladies maidsbut to the bastard and la hire who are men tell them the army is to remain where it is and i hold them responsible if this command miscarries and say the offensive will be resumed in the morning you may go good sir  then she said to her priest  rise early and be by me all the day there will be much work on my hands and i shall be hurt between my neck and my shoulder      chapter 22 the fate of france decided  we were up at dawn and after mass we started in the hall we met the master of the house who was grieved good man to see joan going breakfastless to such a days work and begged her to wait and eat but she couldnt afford the timethat is to say she couldnt afford the patience she being in such a blaze of anxiety to get at that last remaining bastille which stood between her and the completion of the first great step in the rescue and redemption of france boucher put in another plea  but thinkwe poor beleaguered citizens who have hardly known the flavor of fish for these many months have spoil of that sort again and we owe it to you theres a noble shad for breakfast waitbe persuaded  joan said  oh theres going to be fish in plenty when this days work is done the whole riverfront will be yours to do as you please with  ah your excellency will do well that i know but we dont require quite that much even of you you shall have a month for it in place of a day now be beguiledwait and eat theres a saying that he that would cross a river twice in the same day in a boat will do well to eat fish for luck lest he have an accident  that doesnt fit my case for today i cross but once in a boat  oh dont say that arent you coming back to us  yes but not in a boat  how then  by the bridge  listen to thatby the bridge now stop this jesting dear general and do as i would have done you its a noble fish  be good then and save me some for supper and i will bring one of those englishmen with me and he shall have his share  ah well have your way if you must but he that fasts must attempt but little and stop early when shall you be back  when weve raised the siege of orleans forward  we were off the streets were full of citizens and of groups and squads of soldiers but the spectacle was melancholy there was not a smile anywhere but only universal gloom it was as if some vast calamity had smitten all hope and cheer dead we were not used to this and were astonished but when they saw the maid there was an immediate stir and the eager question flew from mouth to mouth  where is she going whither is she bound  joan heard it and called out  whither would ye suppose i am going to take the tourelles  it would not be possible for any to describe how those few words turned that mourning into joyinto exaltationinto frenzy and how a storm of huzzas burst out and swept down the streets in every direction and woke those corpselike multitudes to vivid life and action and turmoil in a moment the soldiers broke from the crowd and came flocking to our standard and many of the citizens ran and got pikes and halberds and joined us as we moved on our numbers increased steadily and the hurrahing continuedyes we moved through a solid cloud of noise as you may say and all the windows on both sides contributed to it for they were filled with excited people  you see the council had closed the burgundy gate and placed a strong force there under that stout soldier raoul de gaucourt bailly of orleans with orders to prevent joan from getting out and resuming the attack on the tourelles and this shameful thing had plunged the city into sorrow and despair but that feeling was gone now they believed the maid was a match for the council and they were right  when we reached the gate joan told gaucourt to open it and let her pass  he said it would be impossible to do this for his orders were from the council and were strict joan said  there is no authority above mine but the kings if you have an order from the king produce it  i cannot claim to have an order from him general  then make way or take the consequences  he began to argue the case for he was like the rest of the tribe always ready to fight with words not acts but in the midst of his gabble joan interrupted with the terse order  charge  we came with a rush and brief work we made of that small job it was good to see the baillys surprise he was not used to this unsentimental promptness he said afterward that he was cut off in the midst of what he was sayingin the midst of an argument by which he could have proved that he could not let joan passan argument which joan could not have answered  still it appears she did answer it said the person he was talking to  we swung through the gate in great style with a vast accession of noise the most of which was laughter and soon our van was over the river and moving down against the tourelles  first we must take a supporting work called a boulevard and which was otherwise nameless before we could assault the great bastille its rear communicated with the bastille by a drawbridge under which ran a swift and deep strip of the loire the boulevard was strong and dunois doubted our ability to take it but joan had no such doubt she pounded it with artillery all the forenoon then about noon she ordered an assault and led it herself we poured into the fosse through the smoke and a tempest of missiles and joan shouting encouragements to her men started to climb a scalingladder when that misfortune happened which we knew was to happenthe iron bolt from an arbaquest struck between her neck and her shoulder and tore its way down through her armor when she felt the sharp pain and saw her blood gushing over her breast she was frightened poor girl and as she sank to the ground she began to cry bitterly  the english sent up a glad shout and came surging down in strong force to take her and then for a few minutes the might of both adversaries was concentrated upon that spot over her and above her english and french fought with desperationfor she stood for france indeed she was france to both sideswhichever won her won france and could keep it forever right there in that small spot and in ten minutes by the clock the fate of france for all time was to be decided and was decided  if the english had captured joan then charles vii would have flown the country the treaty of troyes would have held good and france already english property would have become without further dispute an english province to so remain until judgment day a nationality and a kingdom were at stake there and no more time to decide it in than it takes to hardboil an egg it was the most momentous ten minutes that the clock has ever ticked in france or ever will whenever you read in histories about hours or days or weeks in which the fate of one or another nation hung in the balance do not you fail to remember nor your french hearts to beat the quicker for the remembrance the ten minutes that france called otherwise joan of arc lay bleeding in the fosse that day with two nations struggling over her for her possession  and you will not forget the dwarf for he stood over her and did the work of any six of the others he swung his ax with both hands whenever it came down he said those two words for france and a splintered helmet flew like eggshells and the skull that carried it had learned its manners and would offend the french no more he piled a bulwark of ironclad dead in front of him and fought from behind it and at last when the victory was ours we closed about him shielding him and he ran up a ladder with joan as easily as another man would carry a child and bore her out of the battle a great crowd following and anxious for she was drenched with blood to her feet half of it her own and the other half english for bodies had fallen across her as she lay and had poured their red lifestreams over her one couldnt see the white armor now with that awful dressing over it  the iron bolt was still in the woundsome say it projected out behind the shoulder it may bei did not wish to see and did not try to it was pulled out and the pain made joan cry again poor thing some say she pulled it out herself because others refused saying they could not bear to hurt her as to this i do not know i only know it was pulled out and that the wound was treated with oil and properly dressed  joan lay on the grass weak and suffering hour after hour but still insisting that the fight go on which it did but not to much purpose for it was only under her eye that men were heroes and not afraid they were like the paladin i think he was afraid of his shadowi mean in the afternoon when it was very big and long but when he was under joans eye and the inspiration of her great spirit what was he afraid of nothing in this worldand that is just the truth  toward night dunois gave it up joan heard the bugles  what she cried sounding the retreat  her wound was forgotten in a moment she countermanded the order and sent another to the officer in command of a battery to stand ready to fire five shots in quick succession this was a signal to the force on the orleans side of the river under la hire who was not as some of the histories say with us it was to be given whenever joan should feel sure the boulevard was about to fall into her handsthen that force must make a counterattack on the tourelles by way of the bridge  joan mounted her horse now with her staff about her and when our people saw us coming they raised a great shout and were at once eager for another assault on the boulevard joan rode straight to the fosse where she had received her wound and standing there in the rain of bolts and arrows she ordered the paladin to let her long standard blow free and to note when its fringes should touch the fortress presently he said  it touches  now then said joan to the waiting battalions the place is yoursenter in bugles sound the assault now thenall togethergo  and go it was you never saw anything like it we swarmed up the ladders and over the battlements like a waveand the place was our property why one might live a thousand years and never see so gorgeous a thing as that again there hand to hand we fought like wild beasts for there was no giveup to those englishthere was no way to convince one of those people but to kill him and even then he doubted at least so it was thought in those days and maintained by many  we were busy and never heard the five cannonshots fired but they were fired a moment after joan had ordered the assault and so while we were hammering and being hammered in the smaller fortress the reserve on the orleans side poured across the bridge and attacked the tourelles from that side a fireboat was brought down and moored under the drawbridge which connected the tourelles with our boulevard wherefore when at last we drove our english ahead of us and they tried to cross that drawbridge and join their friends in the tourelles the burning timbers gave way under them and emptied them in a mass into the river in their heavy armorand a pitiful sight it was to see brave men die such a death as that  ah god pity them said joan and wept to see that sorrowful spectacle she said those gentle words and wept those compassionate tears although one of those perishing men had grossly insulted her with a coarse name three days before when she had sent him a message asking him to surrender that was their leader sir williams glasdale a most valorous knight he was clothed all in steel so he plunged under water like a lance and of course came up no more  we soon patched a sort of bridge together and threw ourselves against the last stronghold of the english power that barred orleans from friends and supplies before the sun was quite down joans forever memorable days work was finished her banner floated from the fortress of the tourelles her promise was fulfilled she had raised the siege of orleans  the seven months beleaguerment was ended the thing which the first generals of france had called impossible was accomplished in spite of all that the kings ministers and warcouncils could do to prevent it this little countrymaid at seventeen had carried her immortal task through and had done it in four days  good news travels fast sometimes as well as bad by the time we were ready to start homeward by the bridge the whole city of orleans was one red flame of bonfires and the heavens blushed with satisfaction to see it and the booming and bellowing of cannon and the banging of bells surpassed by great odds anything that even orleans had attempted before in the way of noise  when we arrivedwell there is no describing that why those acres of people that we plowed through shed tears enough to raise the river there was not a face in the glare of those fires that hadnt tears streaming down it and if joans feet had not been protected by iron they would have kissed them off of her welcome welcome to the maid of orleans that was the cry i heard it a hundred thousand times welcome to our maid some of them worded it  no other girl in all history has ever reached such a summit of glory as joan of arc reached that day and do you think it turned her head and that she sat up to enjoy that delicious music of homage and applause no another girl would have done that but not this one that was the greatest heart and the simplest that ever beat she went straight to bed and to sleep like any tired child and when the people found she was wounded and would rest they shut off all passage and traffic in that region and stood guard themselves the whole night through to see that he slumbers were not disturbed they said she has given us peace she shall have peace herself  all knew that that region would be empty of english next day and all said that neither the present citizens nor their posterity would ever cease to hold that day sacred to the memory of joan of arc that word has been true for more than sixty years it will continue so always orleans will never forget the 8th of may nor ever fail to celebrate it it is joan of arcs dayand holy 1   1it is still celebrated every year with civic and military pomps and solemnitiestranslator     chapter 23 joan inspires the tawdry king  in the earliest dawn of morning talbot and his english forces evacuated their bastilles and marched away not stopping to burn destroy or carry off anything but leaving their fortresses just as they were provisioned armed and equipped for a long siege it was difficult for the people to believe that this great thing had really happened that they were actually free once more and might go and come through any gate they pleased with none to molest or forbid that the terrible talbot that scourge of the french that man whose mere name had been able to annul the effectiveness of french armies was gone vanished retreatingdriven away by a girl  the city emptied itself out of every gate the crowds poured they swarmed about the english bastilles like an invasion of ants but noisier than those creatures and carried off the artillery and stores then turned all those dozen fortresses into monster bonfires imitation volcanoes whose lofty columns of thick smoke seemed supporting the arch of the sky  the delight of the children took another form to some of the younger ones seven months was a sort of lifetime they had forgotten what grass was like and the velvety green meadows seemed paradise to their surprised and happy eyes after the long habit of seeing nothing but dirty lanes and streets it was a wonder to themthose spacious reaches of open country to run and dance and tumble and frolic in after their dull and joyless captivity so they scampered far and wide over the fair regions on both sides of the river and came back at eventide weary but laden with flowers and flushed with new health drawn from the fresh country air and the vigorous exercise  after the burnings the grown folk followed joan from church to church and put in the day in thanksgivings for the citys deliverance and at night they feted her and her generals and illuminated the town and high and low gave themselves up to festivities and rejoicings by the time the populace were fairly in bed toward dawn we were in the saddle and away toward tours to report to the king  that was a march which would have turned any ones head but joans we moved between emotional ranks of grateful countrypeople all the way they crowded about joan to touch her feet her horse her armor and they even knelt in the road and kissed her horses hoofprints  the land was full of her praises the most illustrious chiefs of the church wrote to the king extolling the maid comparing her to the saints and heroes of the bible and warning him not to let unbelief ingratitude or other injustice hinder or impair the divine help sent through her one might think there was a touch of prophecy in that and we will let it go at that but to my mind it had its inspiration in those great mens accurate knowledge of the kings trivial and treacherous character  the king had come to tours to meet joan at the present day this poor thing is called charles the victorious on account of victories which other people won for him but in our time we had a private name for him which described him better and was sanctified to him by personal deservingcharles the base when we entered the presence he sat throned with his tinseled snobs and dandies around him he looked like a forked carrot so tightly did his clothing fit him from his waist down he wore shoes with a ropelike pliant toe a foot long that had to be hitched up to the knee to keep it out of the way he had on a crimson velvet cape that came no lower than his elbows on his head he had a tall felt thing like a thimble with a feather it its jeweled band that stuck up like a pen from an inkhorn and from under that thimble his bush of stiff hair stuck down to his shoulders curving outward at the bottom so that the cap and the hair together made the head like a shuttlecock all the materials of his dress were rich and all the colors brilliant in his lap he cuddled a miniature greyhound that snarled lifting its lip and showing its white teeth whenever any slight movement disturbed it the kings dandies were dressed in about the same fashion as himself and when i remembered that joan had called the warcouncil of orleans disguised ladies maids it reminded me of people who squander all their money on a trifle and then havent anything to invest when they come across a better chance that name ought to have been saved for these creatures  joan fell on her knees before the majesty of france and the other frivolous animal in his lapa sight which it pained me to see what had that man done for his country or for anybody in it that she or any other person should kneel to him but sheshe had just done the only great deed that had been done for france in fifty years and had consecrated it with the libation of her blood the positions should have been reversed  however to be fair one must grant that charles acquitted himself very well for the most part on that occasionvery much better than he was in the habit of doing he passed his pup to a courtier and took off his cap to joan as if she had been a queen then he stepped from his throne and raised her and showed quite a spirited and manly joy and gratitude in welcoming her and thanking her for her extraordinary achievement in his service my prejudices are of a later date than that if he had continued as he was at that moment i should not have acquired them  he acted handsomely he said  you shall not kneel to me my matchless general you have wrought royally and royal courtesies are your due noticing that she was pale he said but you must not stand you have lost blood for france and your wound is yet greencome he led her to a seat and sat down by her now then speak out frankly as to one who owes you much and freely confesses it before all this courtly assemblage what shall be your reward name it  i was ashamed of him and yet that was not fair for how could he be expected to know this marvelous child in these few weeks when we who thought we had known her all her life were daily seeing the clouds uncover some new altitudes of her character whose existence was not suspected by us before but we are all that way when we know a thing we have only scorn for other people who dont happen to know it and i was ashamed of these courtiers too for the way they licked their chops so to speak as envying joan her great chance they not knowing her any better than the king did a blush began to rise in joans cheeks at the thought that she was working for her country for pay and she dropped her head and tried to hide her face as girls always do when they find themselves blushing no one knows why they do but they do and the more they blush the more they fail to get reconciled to it and the more they cant bear to have people look at them when they are doing it the king made it a great deal worse by calling attention to it which is the unkindest thing a person can do when a girl is blushing sometimes when there is a big crowd of strangers it is even likely to make her cry if she is as young as joan was god knows the reason for this it is hidden from men as for me i would as soon blush as sneeze in fact i would rather however these meditations are not of consequence i will go on with what i was saying the king rallied her for blushing and this brought up the rest of the blood and turned her face to fire then he was sorry seeing what he had done and tried to make her comfortable by saying the blush was exceeding becoming to her and not to mind itwhich caused even the dog to notice it now so of course the red in joans face turned to purple and the tears overflowed and ran downi could have told anybody that that would happen the king was distressed and saw that the best thing to do would be to get away from this subject so he began to say the finest kind of things about joans capture of the tourelles and presently when she was more composed he mentioned the reward again and pressed her to name it everybody listened with anxious interest to hear what her claim was going to be but when her answer came their faces showed that the thing she asked for was not what they had been expecting  oh dear and gracious dauphin i have but one desireonly one if  do not be afraid my childname it  that you will not delay a day my army is strong and valiant and eager to finish its workmarch with me to rheims and receive your crown you could see the indolent king shrink in his butterfly clothes  to rheimsoh impossible my general we march through the heart of englands power  could those be french faces there not one of them lighted in response to the girls brave proposition but all promptly showed satisfaction in the kings objection leave this silken idleness for the rude contact of war none of these butterflies desired that they passed their jeweled comfitboxes one to another and whispered their content in the head butterflys practical prudence joan pleaded with the king saying  ah i pray you do not throw away this perfect opportunity everything is favorableeverything it is as if the circumstances were specially made for it the spirits of our army are exalted with victory those of the english forces depressed by defeat delay will change this seeing us hesitate to follow up our advantage our men will wonder doubt lose confidence and the english will wonder gather courage and be bold again now is the timepritheee let us march  the king shook his head and la tremouille being asked for an opinion eagerly furnished it  sire all prudence is against it think of the english strongholds along the loire think of those that lie between us and rheims  he was going on but joan cut him short and said turning to him  if we wait they will all be strengthened reinforced will that advantage us  whyno  then what is your suggestionwhat is it that you would propose to do  my judgment is to wait  wait for what  the minister was obliged to hesitate for he knew of no explanation that would sound well moreover he was not used to being catechized in this fashion with the eyes of a crowd of people on him so he was irritated and said  matters of state are not proper matters for public discussion  joan said placidly  i have to beg your pardon my trespass came of ignorance i did not know that matters connected with your department of the government were matters of state  the minister lifted his brows in amused surprise and said with a touch of sarcasm  i am the kings chief minister and yet you had the impression that matters connected with my department are not matters of state pray how is that  joan replied indifferently  because there is no state  no state  no sir there is no state and no use for a minister france is shrunk to a couple of acres of ground a sheriffs constable could take care of it its affairs are not matters of state the term is too large  the king did not blush but burst into a hearty careless laugh and the court laughed too but prudently turned its head and did it silently la tremouille was angry and opened his mouth to speak but the king put up his hand and said  therei take her under the royal protection she has spoken the truth the ungilded truthhow seldom i hear it with all this tinsel on me and all this tinsel about me i am but a sheriff after alla poor shabby twoacre sheriffand you are but a constable and he laughed his cordial laugh again joan my frank honest general will you name your reward i would ennoble you you shall quarter the crown and the lilies of france for blazon and with them your victorious sword to defend themspeak the word  it made an eager buzz of surprise and envy in the assemblage but joan shook her head and said  ah i cannot dear and noble dauphin to be allowed to work for france to spend ones self for france is itself so supreme a reward that nothing can add to itnothing give me the one reward i ask the dearest of all rewards the highest in your giftmarch with me to rheims and receive your crown i will beg it on my knees  but the king put his hand on her arm and there was a really brave awakening in his voice and a manly fire in his eye when he said  no sit you have conquered meit shall be as you  but a warning sign from his minister halted him and he added to the relief of the court  well well we will think of it we will think it over and see does that content you impulsive little soldier  the first part of the speech sent a glow of delight to joans face but the end of it quenched it and she looked sad and the tears gathered in her eyes after a moment she spoke out with what seemed a sort of terrified impulse and said  oh use me i beseech you use methere is but little time  but little time  only a yeari shall last only a year  why child there are fifty good years in that compact little body yet  oh you err indeed you do in one little year the end will come ah the time is so short so short the moments are flying and so much to be done oh use me and quicklyit is life or death for france  even those insects were sobered by her impassioned words the king looked very gravegrave and strongly impressed his eyes lit suddenly with an eloquent fire and he rose and drew his sword and raised it aloft then he brought it slowly down upon joans shoulder and said  ah thou art so simple so true so great so nobleand by this accolade i join thee to the nobility of france thy fitting place and for thy sake i do hereby ennoble all thy family and all thy kin and all their descendants born in wedlock not only in the male but also in the female line and moremore to distinguish thy house and honor it above all others we add a privilege never accorded to any before in the history of these dominions the females of thy line shall have and hold the right to ennoble their husbands when these shall be of inferior degree astonishment and envy flared up in every countenance when the words were uttered which conferred this extraordinary grace the king paused and looked around upon these signs with quite evident satisfaction rise joan of arc now and henceforth surnamed du lis in grateful acknowledgment of the good blow which you have struck for the lilies of france and they and the royal crown and your own victorious sword fit and fair company for each other shall be grouped in you escutcheon and be and remain the symbol of your high nobility forever  as my lady du lis rose the gilded children of privilege pressed forward to welcome her to their sacred ranks and call her by her new name but she was troubled and said these honors were not meet for one of her lowly birth and station and by their kind grace she would remain simple joan of arc nothing moreand so be called  nothing more as if there could be anything more anything higher anything greater my lady du liswhy it was tinsel petty perishable but joan of arc the mere sound of it sets ones pulses leaping      chapter 24 tinsel trappings of nobility  it was vexatious to see what a todo the whole town and next the whole country made over the news joan of arc ennobled by the king people went dizzy with wonder and delight over it you cannot imagine how she was gaped at stared at envied why one would have supposed that some great and fortunate thing had happened to her but we did not think any great things of it to our minds no mere human hand could add a glory to joan of arc to us she was the sun soaring in the heavens and her new nobility a candle atop of it to us it was swallowed up and lost in her own light and she was as indifferent to it and as unconscious of it as the other sun would have been  but it was different with her brothers they were proud and happy in their new dignity which was quite natural and joan was glad it had been conferred when she saw how pleased they were it was a clever thought in the king to outflank her scruples by marching on them under shelter of her love for her family and her kin  jean and pierre sported their coatsofarms right away and their society was courted by everybody the nobles and commons alike the standardbearer said with some touch of bitterness that he could see that they just felt good to be alive they were so soaked with the comfort of their glory and didnt like to sleep at all because when they were asleep they didnt know they were noble and so sleep was a clean loss of time and then he said  they cant take precedence of me in military functions and state ceremonies but when it comes to civil ones and society affairs i judge theyll cuddle coolly in behind you and the knights and noel and i will have to walk behind themhey  yes i said i think you are right  i was just afraid of itjust afraid of it said the standardbearer with a sigh afraid of it im talking like a fool of course i knew it yes i was talking like a fool  noel rainguesson said musingly  yes i noticed something natural about the tone of it  we others laughed  oh you did did you you think you are very clever dont you ill take and wring your neck for you one of these days noel rainguesson  the sieur de metz said  paladin your fears havent reached the top notch they are away below the grand possibilities didnt it occur to you that in civil and society functions they will take precedence of all the rest of the personal staffevery one of us  oh come  youll find its so look at their escutcheon its chiefest feature is the lilies of france its royal man royaldo you understand the size of that the lilies are there by authority of the kingdo you understand the size of that though not in detail and in entirety they do nevertheless substantially quarter the arms of france in their coat imagine it consider it measure the magnitude of it we walk in front of those boys bless you weve done that for the last time in my opinion there isnt a lay lord in this whole region that can walk in front of them except the duke dalencon prince of the blood  you could have knocked the paladin down with a feather he seemed to actually turn pale he worked his lips a moment without getting anything out then it came  i didnt know that nor the half of it how could i ive been an idiot i see it nowive been an idiot i met them this morning and sung out hello to them just as i would to anybody i didnt mean to be illmannered but i didnt know the half of this that youve been telling ive been an ass yes that is all there is to itive been an ass  noel rainguesson said in a kind of weary way  yes that is likely enough but i dont see why you should seem surprised at it  you dont dont you well why dont you  because i dont see any novelty about it with some people it is a condition which is present all the time now you take a condition which is present all the time and the results of that condition will be uniform this uniformity of result will in time become monotonous monotonousness by the law of its being is fatiguing if you had manifested fatigue upon noticing that you had been an ass that would have been logical that would have been rational whereas it seems to me that to manifest surprise was to be again an ass because the condition of intellect that can enable a person to be surprised and stirred by inert monotonousness is a  now that is enough noel rainguesson stop where you are before you get yourself into trouble and dont bother me any more for some days or a week an it please you for i cannot abide your clack  come i like that i didnt want to talk i tried to get out of talking if you didnt want to hear my clack what did you keep intruding your conversation on me for  i i never dreamed of such a thing  well you did it anyway and i have a right to feel hurt and i do feel hurt to have you treat me so it seems to me that when a person goads and crowds and in a manner forces another person to talk it is neither very fair nor very goodmannered to call what he says clack  oh snuffledo and break your heart you poor thing somebody fetch this sick doll a sugarrag look you sir jean de metz do you feel absolutely certain about that thing  what thing  why that jean and pierre are going to take precedence of all the lay noblesse hereabouts except the duke dalencon  i think there is not a doubt of it  the standardbearer was deep in thoughts and dreams a few moments then the silkandvelvet expanse of his vast breast rose and fell with a sigh and he said  dear dear what a lift it is it just shows what luck can do well i dont care i shouldnt care to be a painted accidenti shouldnt value it i am prouder to have climbed up to where i am just by sheer natural merit than i would be to ride the very sun in the zenith and have to reflect that i was nothing but a poor little accident and got shot up there out of somebody elses catapult to me merit is everythingin fact the only thing all else is dross  just then the bugles blew the assembly and that cut our talk short      chapter 25 at lastforward  the days began to waste awayand nothing decided nothing done the army was full of zeal but it was also hungry it got no pay the treasury was getting empty it was becoming impossible to feed it under pressure of privation it began to fall apart and dispersewhich pleased the trifling court exceedingly joans distress was pitiful to see she was obliged to stand helpless while her victorious army dissolved away until hardly the skeleton of it was left  at last one day she went to the castle of loches where the king was idling she found him consulting with three of his councilors robert le maton a former chancellor of france christophe dharcourt and gerard machet the bastard of orleans was present also and it is through him that we know what happened joan threw herself at the kings feet and embraced his knees saying  noble dauphin prithee hold no more of these long and numerous councils but come and come quickly to rheims and receive your crown  christophe dharcourt asked  is it your voices that command you to say that to the king  yes and urgently  then will you not tell us in the kings presence in what way the voices communicate with you  it was another sly attempt to trap joan into indiscreet admissions and dangerous pretensions but nothing came of it joans answer was simple and straightforward and the smooth bishop was not able to find any fault with it she said that when she met with people who doubted the truth of her mission she went aside and prayed complaining of the distrust of these and then the comforting voices were heard at her ear saying soft and low go forward daughter of god and i will help thee then she added when i hear that the joy in my heart oh it is insupportable  the bastard said that when she said these words her face lit up as with a flame and she was like one in an ecstasy  joan pleaded persuaded reasoned gaining ground little by little but opposed step by step by the council she begged she implored leave to march when they could answer nothing further they granted that perhaps it had been a mistake to let the army waste away but how could we help it now how could we march without an army  raise one said joan  but it will take six weeks  no matterbegin let us begin  it is too late without doubt the duke of bedford has been gathering troops to push to the succor of his strongholds on the loire  yes while we have been disbanding oursand pity tis but we must throw away no more time we must bestir ourselves  the king objected that he could not venture toward rheims with those strong places on the loire in his path but joan said  we will break them up then you can march  with that plan the king was willing to venture assent he could sit around out of danger while the road was being cleared  joan came back in great spirits straightway everything was stirring proclamations were issued calling for men a recruitingcamp was established at selles in berry and the commons and the nobles began to flock to it with enthusiasm  a deal of the month of may had been wasted and yet by the 6th of june joan had swept together a new army and was ready to march she had eight thousand men think of that think of gathering together such a body as that in that little region and these were veteran soldiers too in fact most of the men in france were soldiers when you came to that for the wars had lasted generations now yes most frenchmen were soldiers and admirable runners too both by practice and inheritance they had done next to nothing but run for near a century but that was not their fault they had had no fair and proper leadershipat least leaders with a fair and proper chance away back king and court got the habit of being treacherous to the leaders then the leaders easily got the habit of disobeying the king and going their own way each for himself and nobody for the lot nobody could win victories that way hence running became the habit of the french troops and no wonder yet all that those troops needed in order to be good fighters was a leader who would attend strictly to businessa leader with all authority in his hands in place of a tenth of it along with nine other generals equipped with an equal tenth apiece they had a leader rightly clothed with authority now and with a head and heart bent on war of the most intensely businesslike and earnest sortand there would be results no doubt of that they had joan of arc and under that leadership their legs would lose the art and mystery of running  yes joan was in great spirits she was here and there and everywhere all over the camp by day and by night pushing things and wherever she came charging down the lines reviewing the troops it was good to hear them break out and cheer and nobody could help cheering she was such a vision of young bloom and beauty and grace and such an incarnation of pluck and life and go she was growing more and more ideally beautiful every day as was plain to be seenand these were days of development for she was well past seventeen nowin fact she was getting close upon seventeen and a halfindeed just a little woman as you may say  the two young counts de laval arrived one dayfine young fellows allied to the greatest and most illustrious houses of france and they could not rest till they had seen joan of arc so the king sent for them and presented them to her and you may believe she filled the bill of their expectations when they heard that rich voice of hers they must have thought it was a flute and when they saw her deep eyes and her face and the soul that looked out of that face you could see that the sight of her stirred them like a poem like lofty eloquence like martial music one of them wrote home to his people and in his letter he said it seemed something divine to see her and hear her ah yes and it was a true word truer word was never spoken  he saw her when she was ready to begin her march and open the campaign and this is what he said about it  she was clothed all in white armor save her head and in her hand she carried a little battleax and when she was ready to mount her great black horse he reared and plunged and would not let her then she said lead him to the cross this cross was in front of the church close by so they led him there then she mounted and he never budged any more than if he had been tied then she turned toward the door of the church and said in her soft womanly voice you priests and people of the church make processions and pray to god for us then she spurred away under her standard with her little ax in her hand crying forwardmarch one of her brothers who came eight days ago departed with her and he also was clad all in white armor  i was there and i saw it too saw it all just as he pictures it and i see it yetthe little battleax the dainty plumed cap the white armorall in the soft june afternoon i see it just as if it were yesterday and i rode with the staffthe personal staffthe staff of joan of arc  that young count was dying to go too but the king held him back for the present but joan had made him a promise in his letter he said  she told me that when the king starts for rheims i shall go with him but god grant i may not have to wait till then but may have a part in the battles  she made him that promise when she was taking leave of my lady the duchess dalencon the duchess was exacting a promise so it seemed a proper time for others to do the like the duchess was troubled for her husband for she foresaw desperate fighting and she held joan to her breast and stroked her hair lovingly and said  you must watch over him dear and take care of him and send him back to me safe i require it of you i will not let you go till you promise  joan said  i give you the promise with all my heart and it is not just words it is a promise you shall have him back without a hurt do you believe and are you satisfied with me now  the duchess could not speak but she kissed joan on the forehead and so they parted  we left on the 6th and stopped over at romorantin then on the 9th joan entered orleans in state under triumphal arches with the welcoming cannon thundering and seas of welcoming flags fluttering in the breeze the grand staff rode with her clothed in shining splendors of costume and decorations the duke dalencon the bastard of orleans the sire de boussac marshal of france the lord de granville master of the crossbowmen the sire de culan admiral of france ambroise de lor etienne de vignoles called la hire gautier de brusac and other illustrious captains  it was grand times the usual shoutings and packed multitudes the usual crush to get sight of joan but at last we crowded through to our old lodgings and i saw old boucher and the wife and that dear catherine gather joan to their hearts and smother her with kissesand my heart ached for her so for i could have kissed catherine better than anybody and more and longer yet was not thought of for that office and i so famished for it ah she was so beautiful and oh so sweet i had loved her the first day i ever saw her and from that day forth she was sacred to me i have carried her image in my heart for sixtythree yearsall lonely thee yes solitary for it never has had companyand i am grown so old so old but it oh it is as fresh and young and merry and mischievous and lovely and sweet and pure and witching and divine as it was when it crept in there bringing benediction and peace to its habitation so long ago so long agofor it has not aged a day      chapter 26 the last doubts scattered  this time as before the kings last command to the generals was this see to it that you do nothing without the sanction of the maid and this time the command was obeyed and would continue to be obeyed all through the coming great days of the loire campaign  that was a change that was new it broke the traditions it shows you what sort of a reputation as a commanderinchief the child had made for herself in ten days in the field it was a conquering of mens doubts and suspicions and a capturing and solidifying of mens belief and confidence such as the grayest veteran on the grand staff had not been able to achieve in thirty years dont you remember that when at sixteen joan conducted her own case in a grim court of law and won it the old judge spoke of her as this marvelous child it was the right name you see  these veterans were not going to branch out and do things without the sanction of the maidthat is true and it was a great gain but at the same time there were some among them who still trembled at her new and dashing war tactics and earnestly desired to modify them and so during the 10th while joan was slaving away at her plans and issuing order after order with tireless industry the oldtime consultations and arguings and speechifyings were going on among certain of the generals  in the afternoon of that day they came in a body to hold one of these councils of war and while they waited for joan to join them they discussed the situation now this discussion is not set down in the histories but i was there and i will speak of it as knowing you will trust me i not being given to beguiling you with lies  gautier de brusac was spokesman for the timid ones joans side was resolutely upheld by dalencon the bastard la hire the admiral of france the marshal de boussac and all the other really important chiefs  de brusac argued that the situation was very grave that jargeau the first point of attack was formidably strong its imposing walls bristling with artillery with seven thousand picked english veterans behind them and at their head the great earl of suffolk and his two redoubtable brothers the de la poles it seemed to him that the proposal of joan of arc to try to take such a place by storm was a most rash and overdaring idea and she ought to be persuaded to relinquish it in favor of the soberer and safer procedure of investment by regular siege it seemed to him that this fiery and furious new fashion of hurling masses of men against impregnable walls of stone in defiance of the established laws and usages of war was  but he got no further la hire gave his plumed helm an impatient toss and burst out with  by god she knows her trade and none can teach it her  and before he could get out anything more dalencon was on his feet and the bastard of orleans and a half a dozen others all thundering at once and pouring out their indignant displeasure upon any and all that might hold secretly or publicly distrust of the wisdom of the commanderinchief and when they had said their say la hire took a chance again and said  there are some that never know how to change circumstances may change but those people are never able to see that they have got to change too to meet those circumstances all that they know is the one beaten track that their fathers and grandfathers have followed and that they themselves have followed in their turn if an earthquake come and rip the land to chaos and that beaten track now lead over precipices and into morasses those people cant learn that they must strike out a new roadno they will march stupidly along and follow the old one to death and perdition men theres a new state of things and a surpassing military genius has perceived it with her clear eye and a new road is required and that same clear eye has noted where it must go and has marked it out for us the man does not live never has lived never will live that can improve upon it the old state of things was defeat defeat defeatand by consequence we had troops with no dash no heart no hope would you assault stone walls with such nothere was but one way with that kind sit down before a place and wait waitstarve it out if you could the new case is the very opposite it is this men all on fire with pluck and dash and vim and fury and energya restrained conflagration what would you do with it hold it down and let it smolder and perish and go out what would joan of arc do with it turn it loose by the lord god of heaven and earth and let it swallow up the foe in the whirlwind of its fires nothing shows the splendor and wisdom of her military genius like her instant comprehension of the size of the change which has come about and her instant perception of the right and only right way to take advantage of it with her is no sitting down and starving out no dillydallying and fooling around no lazying loafing and going to sleep no it is storm storm storm and still storm storm storm and forever storm storm storm hunt the enemy to his hole then turn her french hurricanes loose and carry him by storm and that is my sort jargeau what of jargeau with its battlements and towers its devastating artillery its seven thousand picked veterans joan of arc is to the fore and by the splendor of god its fate is sealed  oh he carried them there was not another word said about persuading joan to change her tactics they sat talking comfortably enough after that  by and by joan entered and they rose and saluted with their swords and she asked what their pleasure might be la hire said  it is settled my general the matter concerned jargeau there were some who thought we could not take the place  joan laughed her pleasant laugh her merry carefree laugh the laugh that rippled so buoyantly from her lips and made old people feel young again to hear it and she said to the company  have no fearsindeed there is no need nor any occasion for them we will strike the english boldly by assault and you will see then a faraway look came into her eyes and i think that a picture of her home drifted across the vision of her mind for she said very gently and as one who muses but that i know god guides us and will give us success i had liefer keep sheep than endure these perils  we had a homelike farewell supper that eveningjust the personal staff and the family joan had to miss it for the city had given a banquet in her honor and she had gone there in state with the grand staff through a riot of joybells and a sparkling milky way of illuminations  after supper some lively young folk whom we knew came in and we presently forgot that we were soldiers and only remembered that we were boys and girls and full of animal spirits and longpent fun and so there was dancing and games and romps and screams of laughterjust as extravagant and innocent and noisy a good time as ever i had in my life dear dear how long ago it wasand i was young then and outside all the while was the measured tramp of marching battalions belated odds and ends of the french power gathering for the morrows tragedy on the grim stage of war yes in those days we had those contrasts side by side and as i passed along to bed there was another one the big dwarf in brave new armor sat sentry at joans doorthe stern spirit of war made flesh as it wereand on his ample shoulder was curled a kitten asleep      chapter 27 how joan took jargeau  we made a gallant show next day when we filed out through the frowning gates of orleans with banners flying and joan and the grand staff in the van of the long column those two young de lavals were come now and were joined to the grand staff which was well war being their proper trade for they were grandsons of that illustrious fighter bertrand du guesclin constable of france in earlier days louis de bourbon the marshal de rais and the vidame de chartres were added also we had a right to feel a little uneasy for we knew that a force of five thousand men was on its way under sir john fastolfe to reinforce jargeau but i think we were not uneasy nevertheless in truth that force was not yet in our neighborhood sir john was loitering for some reason or other he was not hurrying he was losing precious timefour days at etampes and four more at janville  we reached jargeau and began business at once joan sent forward a heavy force which hurled itself against the outworks in handsome style and gained a footing and fought hard to keep it but it presently began to fall back before a sortie from the city seeing this joan raised her battlecry and led a new assault herself under a furious artillery fire the paladin was struck down at her side wounded but she snatched her standard from his failing hand and plunged on through the ruck of flying missiles cheering her men with encouraging cries and then for a good time one had turmoil and clash of steel and collision and confusion of struggling multitudes and the hoarse bellowing of the guns and then the hiding of it all under a rolling firmament of smokea firmament through which veiled vacancies appeared for a moment now and then giving fitful dim glimpses of the wild tragedy enacting beyond and always at these times one caught sight of that slight figure in white mail which was the center and soul of our hope and trust and whenever we saw that with its back to us and its face to the fight we knew that all was well at last a great shout went upa joyous roar of shoutings in factand that was sign sufficient that the faubourgs were ours  yes they were ours the enemy had been driven back within the walls on the ground which joan had won we camped for night was coming on  joan sent a summons to the english promising that if they surrendered she would allow them to go in peace and take their horses with them nobody knew that she could take that strong place but she knew itknew it well yet she offered that graceoffered it in a time when such a thing was unknown in war in a time when it was custom and usage to massacre the garrison and the inhabitants of captured cities without pity or compunctionyes even to the harmless women and children sometimes there are neighbors all about you who well remember the unspeakable atrocities which charles the bold inflicted upon the men and women and children of dinant when he took that place some years ago it was a unique and kindly grace which joan offered that garrison but that was her way that was her loving and merciful natureshe always did her best to save her enemys life and his soldierly pride when she had the mastery of him  the english asked fifteen days armistice to consider the proposal in and fastolfe coming with five thousand men joan said no but she offered another grace they might take both their horses and their sidearmsbut they must go within the hour  well those bronzed english veterans were pretty hardheaded folk they declined again then joan gave command that her army be made ready to move to the assault at nine in the morning considering the deal of marching and fighting which the men had done that day dalencon thought the hour rather early but joan said it was best so and so must be obeyed then she burst out with one of those enthusiasms which were always burning in her when battle was imminent and said  work work and god will work with us  yes one might say that her motto was work stick to it keep on working for in war she never knew what indolence was and whoever will take that motto and live by it will likely to succeed theres many a way to win in this world but none of them is worth much without good hard work back out of it  i think we should have lost our big standardbearer that day if our bigger dwarf had not been at hand to bring him out of the melee when he was wounded he was unconscious and would have been trampled to death by our own horse if the dwarf had not promptly rescued him and haled him to the rear and safety he recovered and was himself again after two or three hours and then he was happy and proud and made the most of his wound and went swaggering around in his bandages showing off like an innocent bigchildwhich was just what he was he was prouder of being wounded than a really modest person would be of being killed but there was no harm in his vanity and nobody minded it he said he was hit by a stone from a catapulta stone the size of a mans head but the stone grew of course before he got through with it he was claiming that the enemy had flung a building at him  let him alone said noel rainguesson dont interrupt his processes tomorrow it will be a cathedral  he said that privately and sure enough tomorrow it was a cathedral i never saw anybody with such an abandoned imagination  joan was abroad at the crack of dawn galloping here and there and yonder examining the situation minutely and choosing what she considered the most effective positions for her artillery and with such accurate judgment did she place her guns that her lieutenantgenerals admiration of it still survived in his memory when his testimony was taken at the rehabilitation a quarter of a century later  in this testimony the duke dalencon said that at jargeau that morning of the 12th of june she made her dispositions not like a novice but with the sure and clear judgment of a trained general of twenty or thirty years experience  the veteran captains of the armies of france said she was great in war in all ways but greatest of all in her genius for posting and handling artillery  who taught the shepherdgirl to do these marvelsshe who could not read and had had no opportunity to study the complex arts of war i do not know any way to solve such a baffling riddle as that there being no precedent for it nothing in history to compare it with and examine it by for in history there is no great general however gifted who arrived at success otherwise than through able teaching and hard study and some experience it is a riddle which will never be guessed i think these vast powers and capacities were born in her and that she applied them by an intuition which could not err  at eight oclock all movement ceased and with it all sounds all noise a mute expectancy reigned the stillness was something awfulbecause it meant so much there was no air stirring the flags on the towers and ramparts hung straight down like tassels wherever one saw a person that person had stopped what he was doing and was in a waiting attitude a listening attitude we were on a commanding spot clustered around joan not far from us on every hand were the lanes and humble dwellings of these outlying suburbs many people were visibleall were listening not one was moving a man had placed a nail he was about to fasten something with it to the doorpost of his shopbut he had stopped there was his hand reaching up holding the nail and there was his other hand in the act of striking with the hammer but he had forgotten everythinghis head was turned aside listening even children unconsciously stopped in their play i saw a little boy with his hoopstick pointed slanting toward the ground in the act of steering the hoop around the corner and so he had stopped and was listeningthe hoop was rolling away doing its own steering i saw a young girl prettily framed in an open window a wateringpot in her hand and windowboxes of red flowers under its spoutbut the water had ceased to flow the girl was listening everywhere were these impressive petrified forms and everywhere was suspended movement and that awful stillness  joan of arc raised her sword in the air at the signal the silence was torn to rags cannon after cannon vomited flames and smoke and delivered its quaking thunders and we saw answering tongues of fire dart from the towers and walls of the city accompanied by answering deep thunders and in a minute the walls and the towers disappeared and in their place stood vast banks and pyramids of snowy smoke motionless in the dead air the startled girl dropped her wateringpot and clasped her hands together and at that moment a stone cannonball crashed through her fair body  the great artillery duel went on each side hammering away with all its might and it was splendid for smoke and noise and most exalting to ones spirits the poor little town around about us suffered cruelly the cannonballs tore through its slight buildings wrecking them as if they had been built of cards and every moment or two one would see a huge rock come curving through the upper air above the smokeclouds and go plunging down through the roofs fire broke out and columns of flame and smoke rose toward the sky  presently the artillery concussions changed the weather the sky became overcast and a strong wind rose and blew away the smoke that hid the english fortresses  then the spectacle was fine turreted gray walls and towers and streaming bright flags and jets of red fire and gushes of white smoke in long rows all standing out with sharp vividness against the deep leaden background of the sky and then the whizzing missiles began to knock up the dirt all around us and i felt no more interest in the scenery there was one english gun that was getting our position down finer and finer all the time presently joan pointed to it and said  fair duke step out of your tracks or that machine will kill you  the duke dalencon did as he was bid but monsieur du lude rashly took his place and that cannon tore his head off in a moment  joan was watching all along for the right time to order the assault at last about nine oclock she cried out  nowto the assault and the buglers blew the charge  instantly we saw the body of men that had been appointed to this service move forward toward a point where the concentrated fire of our guns had crumbled the upper half of a broad stretch of wall to ruins we saw this force descend into the ditch and begin to plant the scalingladders we were soon with them the lieutenantgeneral thought the assault premature but joan said  ah gentle duke are you afraid do you not know that i have promised to send you home safe  it was warm work in the ditches the walls were crowded with men and they poured avalanches of stones down upon us there was one gigantic englishman who did us more hurt than any dozen of his brethren he always dominated the places easiest of assault and flung down exceedingly troublesome big stones which smashed men and ladders boththen he would near burst himself with laughing over what he had done but the duke settled accounts with him he went and found the famous cannoneer jean le lorrain and said  train your gunkill me this demon  he did it with the first shot he hit the englishman fair in the breast and knocked him backward into the city  the enemys resistance was so effective and so stubborn that our people began to show signs of doubt and dismay seeing this joan raised her inspiring battlecry and descended into the fosse herself the dwarf helping her and the paladin sticking bravely at her side with the standard she started up a scalingladder but a great stone flung from above came crashing down upon her helmet and stretched her wounded and stunned upon the ground but only for a moment the dwarf stood her upon her feet and straightway she started up the ladder again crying  to the assault friends to the assaultthe english are ours it is the appointed hour  there was a grand rush and a fierce roar of warcries and we swarmed over the ramparts like ants the garrison fled we pursued jargeau was ours  the earl of suffolk was hemmed in and surrounded and the duke dalencon and the bastard of orleans demanded that he surrender himself but he was a proud nobleman and came of a proud race he refused to yield his sword to subordinates saying  i will die rather i will surrender to the maid of orleans alone and to no other  and so he did and was courteously and honorably used by her  his two brothers retreated fighting step by step toward the bridge we pressing their despairing forces and cutting them down by scores arrived on the bridge the slaughter still continued alexander de la pole was pushed overboard or fell over and was drowned eleven hundred men had fallen john de la pole decided to give up the struggle but he was nearly as proud and particular as his brother of suffolk as to whom he would surrender to the french officer nearest at hand was guillaume renault who was pressing him closely sir john said to him  are you a gentleman  yes  and a knight  no  then sir john knighted him himself there on the bridge giving him the accolade with english coolness and tranquillity in the midst of that storm of slaughter and mutilation and then bowing with high courtesy took the sword by the blade and laid the hilt of it in the mans hand in token of surrender ah yes a proud tribe those de la poles  it was a grand day a memorable day a most splendid victory we had a crowd of prisoners but joan would not allow them to be hurt we took them with us and marched into orleans next day through the usual tempest of welcome and joy  and this time there was a new tribute to our leader from everywhere in the packed streets the new recruits squeezed their way to her side to touch the sword of joan of arc and draw from it somewhat of that mysterious quality which made it invincible
