first  the dream  1   it was a scene of bitter disputation a hawknosed young man with a pointing finger was prominent his face worked violently his lips moved very rapidly but what he said was inaudible  behind him the little rufous man with the big eyes twitched at his robe and offered suggestions  and behind these two clustered a great multitude of heated excited swarthy faces  the emperor sat on his golden throne in the midst of the gathering commanding silence by gestures speaking inaudibly to them in a tongue the majority did not use and then prevailing they ceased their interruptions and the old man arius took up the debate for a time all those impassioned faces were intent upon him they listened as though they sought occasion and suddenly as if by a preconcerted arrangement they were all thrusting their fingers into their ears and knitting their brows in assumed horror some were crying aloud and making as if to fly some indeed tucked up their garments and fled they spread out into a pattern they were like the little monks who run from st jeromes lion in the picture by carpaccio then one zealot rushed forward and smote the old man heavily upon the mouth  the hall seemed to grow vaster and vaster the disputing infuriated figures multiplied to an innumerable assembly they drove about like snowflakes in a gale they whirled in argumentative couples they spun in eddies of contradiction they made extraordinary patterns and then amidst the cloudy darkness of the unfathomable dome above them there appeared and increased a radiant triangle in which shone an eye the eye and the triangle filled the heavens sent out flickering rays glowed to a blinding incandescence seemed to be speaking words of thunder that were nevertheless inaudible it was as if that thunder filled the heavens it was as if it were nothing but the beating artery in the sleepers ear the attention strained to hear and comprehend and on the very verge of comprehension snapped like a fiddlestring  nicoea  the word remained like a little ash after a flare  the sleeper had awakened and lay very still oppressed by a sense of intellectual effort that had survived the dream in which it had arisen was it so that things had happened the slumbershadowed mind moving obscurely could not determine whether it was so or not had they indeed behaved in this manner when the great mystery was established who said they stopped their ears with their fingers and fled shouting with horror shouting was it eusebius or athanasius or sozomen some letter or apology by athanasius and surely it was impossible that the trinity could have appeared visibly as a triangle and an eye above such an assembly  that was mere dreaming of course was it dreaming after raphael after raphael the drowsy mind wandered into a side issue was the picture that had suggested this dream the one in the vatican where all the fathers of the church are shown disputing together but there surely god and the son themselves were painted with a symbolsome symbolalso but was that disputation about the trinity at all wasnt it rather about a chalice and a dove of course it was a chalice and a dove then where did one see the triangle and the eye and men disputing some such picture there was  what a lot of disputing there had been what endless disputing which had gone on until last night when this very disagreeable young man with the hawk nose and the pointing finger had tackled one when one was sorely fagged and disputed disputed rebuked and disputed answer me this he had said and still ones poor brains disputed and would not rest about the trinity  the brain upon the pillow was now wearily awake it was at once hopelessly awake and active and hopelessly unprogressive it was like some floating stick that had got caught in an eddy in a river going round and round and round and round eternallyeternallyeternally begotten  but what possible meaning do you attach then to such a phrase as eternally begotten  the brain upon the pillow stared hopelessly at this question without an answer without an escape the three repetitions spun round and round became a swiftly revolving triangle like some electric sign that had got beyond control in the midst of which stared an unwinking and resentful eye  2   every one knows that expedient of the sleepless the counting of sheep  you lie quite still you breathe regularly you imagine sheep jumping over a gate one after another you count them quietly and slowly until you count yourself off through a fading string of phantom numbers to number nod  but sheep alas suggest an episcopal crook  and presently a black sheep had got into the succession and was struggling violently with the crook about its leg a hawknosed black sheep full of reproof with disordered hair and a pointing finger a young man with a most disagreeable voice  at which the other sheep took heart and deserting the numbered succession came and sat about the fire in a big drawingroom and argued also in particular there was lady sunderbund a pretty fragile tall woman in the corner richly jewelled who sat with her pretty eyes watching and her lips compressed what had she thought of it she had said very little  it is an unusual thing for a mixed gathering of this sort to argue about the trinity simply because a tired bishop had fallen into their party it was not fair to him to pretend that the atmosphere was a liberal and inquiring one when the young man who had sat still and dormant by the table was in reality a keen and bitter irish roman catholic then the question a questionbegging question was put quite suddenly without preparation or prelude by surprise why bishop was the spermaticos logos identified with the second and not the third person of the trinity  it was indiscreet it was silly to turn upon the speaker and affect an air of disengagement and modernity and to say ah that indeed is the unfortunate aspect of the whole affair  whereupon the fierce young man had exploded with to that is it that you anglicans have come  the whole gathering had given itself up to the disputation lady sunderbund an actress a dancerthough she it is true did not say very mucha novelist a mechanical expert of some sort a railway peer geniuses hairy and celtic people of no clearly definable position but all quite unequal to the task of maintaining that air of reverent vagueness that tenderness of touch which is by all anglican standards imperative in so deep so mysterious and nowadays in mixed society at least so infrequent a discussion  it was like animals breaking down a fence about some sacred spot within a couple of minutes the affair had become highly improper they had raised their voices they had spoken with the utmost familiarity of almost unspeakable things there had been even attempts at epigram athanasian epigrams bent the novelist had doubted if originally there had been a third person in the trinity at all he suggested a reaction from a toomanichaean dualism at some date after the time of st johns gospel he maintained obstinately that that gospel was dualistic  the unpleasant quality of the talk was far more manifest in the retrospect than it had been at the time it had seemed then bold and strange but not impossible now in the cold darkness it seemed sacrilegious and the bishops share which was indeed only the weak yielding of a tired man to an atmosphere he had misjudged became a disgraceful display of levity and bad faith they had baited him some one had said that nowadays every one was an arian knowingly or unknowingly they had not concealed their conviction that the bishop did not really believe in the creeds he uttered  and that unfortunate first admission stuck terribly in his throat  oh why had he made it  3   sleep had gone  the awakened sleeper groaned sat up in the darkness and felt gropingly in this unaccustomed bed and bedroom first for the edge of the bed and then for the electric light that was possibly on the little bedside table  the searching hand touched something a waterbottle the hand resumed its exploration here was something metallic and smooth a stem either above or below there must be a switch  the switch was found grasped and turned  the darkness fled  in a mirror the sleeper saw the reflection of his face and a corner of the bed in which he lay the lamp had a tilted shade that threw a slanting bar of shadow across the field of reflection lighting a rightangled triangle very brightly and leaving the rest obscure the bed was a very great one a bed for the anakim it had a canopy with yellow silk curtains surmounted by a gilded crown of carved wood between the curtains was a mans face cleanshaven pale with disordered brown hair and weary paleblue eyes he was clad in purple pyjamas and the hand that now ran its fingers through the brown hair was long and lean and shapely  beside the bed was a convenient little table bearing the light a waterbottle and glass a bunch of keys a congested pocketbook a goldbanded fountain pen and a gold watch that indicated a quarter past three on the lower edge of the picture in the mirror appeared the back of a gilt chair over which a garment of peculiar construction had been carelessly thrown it was in the form of that sleeveless cassock of purple opening at the side whose lower flap is called a bishops apron the corner of the frogged coat showed behind the chairback and the sash lay crumpled on the floor black doeskin breeches still warmly lined with their pants lay where they had been thrust off at the corner of the bed partly covering black hose and silverbuckled shoes  for a moment the tired gaze of the man in the bed rested upon these evidences of his episcopal dignity then he turned from them to the watch at the bedside  he groaned helplessly  4   these country doctors were no good there wasnt a physician in the diocese he must go to london  he looked into the weary eyes of his reflection and said as one makes a reassuring promise london  he was being worried he was being intolerably worried and he was ill and unable to sustain his positions this doubt this sudden discovery of controversial unsoundness was only one aspect of his general neurasthenia it had been creeping into his mind since the light unden the altar controversy now suddenly it had leapt upon him from his own unwary lips  the immediate trouble arose from his loyalty he had followed the kings example he had become a total abstainer and in addition on his own account he had ceased to smoke and his digestion which princhester had first made sensitive was deranged he was suffering chemically suffering one of those nameless sequences of maladjustments that still defy our ordinary medical science it was afflicting him with a general malaise it was affecting his energy his temper all the balance and comfort of his nerves all day he was weary all night he was wakeful he was estranged from his body he was distressed by a sense of detachment from the things about him by a curious intimation of unreality in everything he experienced and with that went this levity of conscience a heaviness of soul and a levity of conscience that could make him talk as though the creeds did not matteras though nothing mattered  if only he could smoke  he was persuaded that a couple of egyptian cigarettes or three at the outside a day would do wonders in restoring his nervous calm that and just a weak whisky and soda at lunch and dinner suppose now  his conscience his sense of honour deserted him latterly he had had several of these conscienceblanks it was only when they were over that he realized that they had occurred  one might smoke up the chimney he reflected but he had no cigarettes perhaps if he were to slip downstairs  why had he given up smoking  he groaned aloud he and his reflection eyed one another in mutual despair  there came before his memory the image of a boys face a swarthy little boy grinning grinning with a horrible knowingness and pointing his fingeran accusing finger it had been the most exasperating humiliating and shameful incident in the bishops career it was the afternoon for his fortnightly address to the shopgirls church association and he had been seized with a panic fear entirely irrational and unjustifiable that he would not be able to deliver the address the fear had arisen after lunch had gripped his mind and then as now had come the thought if only i could smoke and he had smoked it seemed better to break a vow than fail the association he had fallen to the temptation with a completeness that now filled him with shame and horror he had stalked dunk his valetbutler out of the diningroom had affected to need a book from the bookcase beyond the sideboard had gone insincerely to the sideboard humming from greenlands icy mountains and then glancing over his shoulder had stolen one of his own cigarettes one of the fatter sort with this and his bedroom matches he had gone off to the bottom of the garden among the laurels looked everywhere except above the wall to be sure that he was alone and at last lit up only as he raised his eyes in gratitude for the first blissful inhalation to discover that dreadful little boy peeping at him from the crotch in the yewtree in the next garden as though god had sent him to be a witness  their eyes had met the bishop recalled with an agonized distinctness every moment every error of that shameful encounter he had been too surprised to conceal the state of affairs from the pitiless scrutiny of those youthful eyes he had instantly made as if to put the cigarette behind his back and then as frankly dropped it  his soul would not be more naked at the resurrection the little boy had stared realized the state of affairs slowly but surely pointed his finger  never had two human beings understood each other more completely  a dirty little boy capable no doubt of a thousand kindred scoundrelisms  it seemed ages before the consciencestricken bishop could tear himself from the spot and walk back with such a pretence of dignity as he could muster to the house  and instead of the discourse he had prepared for the shopgirls church association he had preached on temptation and falling and how he knew they had all fallen and how he understood and could sympathize with the bitterness of a secret shame a moving but unsuitable discourse that had already been subjected to misconstruction and severe reproof in the local press of princhester  but the haunting thing in the bishops memory was the face and gesture of the little boy that grubby little finger stabbed him to the heart  oh god he groaned the meanness of it how did i bring myself  he turned out the light convulsively and rolled over in the bed making a sort of cocoon of himself he bored his head into the pillow and groaned and then struggled impatiently to throw the bedclothes off himself then he sat up and talked aloud  i must go to brightonpomfrey he said and get a medical dispensation if i do not smoke  he paused for a long time  then his voice sounded again in the darkness speaking quietly speaking with a note almost of satisfaction  i shall go mad i must smoke or i shall go mad  for a long time he sat up in the great bed with his arms about his knees  5   fearful things came to him things at once dreadfully blasphemous and entirely weakminded  the triangle and the eye became almost visible upon the black background of night they were very angry they were spinning round and round faster and faster because he was a bishop and because really he did not believe fully and completely in the trinity at one and the same time he did not believe in the trinity and was terrified by the anger of the trinity at his unbelief he was afraid he was aghast and oh he was weary  he rubbed his eyes  if i could have a cup of tea he said  then he perceived with surprise that he had not thought of praying what should he say to what could he pray  he tried not to think of that whizzing triangle that seemed now to be nailed like a catherine wheel to the very centre of his forehead and yet at the same time to be at the apex of the universe against thatfor protection against thathe was praying it was by a great effort that at last he pronounced the words  lighten our darkness we beseech thee o lord   presently he had turned up his light and was prowling about the room the clear inky dinginess that comes before the raw dawn of a spring morning found his white face at the window looking out upon the great terrace and the park     chapter the second  the wear and tear of episcopacy  1   it was only in the last few years that the bishop had experienced these nervous and mental crises he was a belated doubter whatever questionings had marked his intellectual adolescence had either been very slight or had been too adequately answered to leave any serious scars upon his convictions  and even now he felt that he was afflicted physically rather than mentally that some protective padding of nervesheath or braincase had worn thin and weak and left him a prey to strange disturbances rather than that any new process of thought was eating into his mind these doubts in his mind were still not really doubts they were rather alien and for the first time uncontrolled movements of his intelligence he had had a sheltered upbringing he was the wellconnected son of a comfortable rectory the only son and sole survivor of a family of three he had been carefully instructed and he had been a willing learner it had been easy and natural to take many things for granted it had been very easy and pleasant for him to take the world as he found it and god as he found him indeed for all his years up to manhood he had been able to take life exactly as in his infancy he took his carefully warmed and prepared bottleunquestioningly and beneficially  and indeed that has been the way with most bishops since bishops began  it is a busy continuous process that turns boys into bishops and it will stand few jars or discords the student of ecclesiastical biography will find that an early vocation has in every age been almost universal among them few are there among these lives that do not display the incipient bishop from the tenderest years bishop how of wakefield composed hymns before he was eleven and archbishop benson when scarcely older possessed a little oratory in which he conducted services anda pleasant touch of the more secular boywhich he protected from a too inquisitive sister by means of a booby trap it is rare that those marked for episcopal dignities go so far into the outer world as archbishop lang of york who began as a barrister this early predestination has always been the common episcopal experience archbishop bensons early attempts at religious services remind one both of st thomas a becket the boy bishop and those early ceremonies of st athanasius which were observed and inquired upon by the good bishop alexander for though still a tender infant st athanasius with perfect correctness and validity was baptizing a number of his innocent playmates and the bishop who had paused to contemplate the sports of the child remained to confirm the zeal of the missionary and as with the bishop of the past so with the bishop of the future the rev h j campbell in his story of his souls pilgrimage has given us a pleasant picture of himself as a child stealing out into the woods to build himself a little altar  such minds as these settled as it were from the outset are either incapable of real scepticism or become sceptical only after catastrophic changes they understand the sceptical mind with difficulty and their beliefs are regarded by the sceptical mind with incredulity they have determined their forms of belief before their years of discretion and once those forms are determined they are not very easily changed within the shell it has adopted the intelligence may be active and lively enough may indeed be extraordinarily active and lively but only within the shell  there is an entire difference in the mental quality of those who are converts to a faith and those who are brought up in it the former know it from outside as well as from within they know not only that it is but also that it is not the latter have a confidence in their creed that is one with their apprehension of sky or air or gravitation it is a primary mental structure and they not only do not doubt but they doubt the good faith of those who do they think that the atheist and agnostic really believe but are impelled by a mysterious obstinacy to deny so it had been with the bishop of princhester not of cunning or design but in simple good faith he had accepted all the inherited assurances of his native rectory and held by church crown empire decorum respectability solvencyand compulsory greek at the little goas his father had done before him if in his undergraduate days he had said a thing or two in the modern vein affected the socialism of william morris and learnt some swinburne by heart it was out of a conscious wildness he did not wish to be a prig he had taken a far more genuine interest in the artistry of ritual  through all the time of his incumbency of the church of the holy innocents st johns wood and of his career as the bishop suffragan of pinner he had never faltered from his profound confidence in those standards of his home he had been kind popular and endlessly active his undergraduate socialism had expanded simply and sincerely into a theory of administrative philanthropy he knew the webbs he was as successful with workingclass audiences as with fashionable congregations his home life with lady ella she was the daughter of the fifth earl of birkenholme and his five little girls was simple beautiful and happy as few homes are in these days of confusion until he became bishop of princhesterhe followed hood the first bishop as the reign of his majesty king edward the peacemaker drew to its closeno anticipation of his coming distress fell across his path  2   he came to princhester an innocent and trustful man the home life at the old rectory of otteringham was still his standard of truth and reality london had not disillusioned him it was a strange waste of people it made him feel like a missionary in infidel parts but it was a kindly waste it was neither antagonistic nor malicious he had always felt there that if he searched his londoner to the bottom he would find the completest recognition of the old rectory and all its data and implications  but princhester was different  princhester made one think that recently there had been a second and much more serious fall  princhester was industrial and unashamed it was a countryside savagely invaded by forges and mine shafts and gaunt black things it was scarred and impeded and discoloured even before that invasion when the heather was not in flower it must have been a black country its people were dour uncandid individuals who slanted their heads and knitted their brows to look at you occasionally one saw woods brown and blistered by the gases from chemical works here and there remained old rectories closely reminiscent of the dear old home at otteringham jostled and elbowed and overshadowed by horrible iron cylinders belching smoke and flame the fine old abbey church of princhester which was the cathedral of the new diocese looked when first he saw it like a lady abbess who had taken to drink and slept in a coal truck she minced apologetically upon the marketplace the parvenu town hall patronized and protected her as if she were a poor relation  the old aristocracy of the countryside was unpicturesquely decayed the branch of the walshinghams lady ellas cousins who lived near pringle was poor proud and ignoble and extremely unpopular the rich people of the country were selfmade and inclined to nonconformity the workingpeople were not strictly speaking a poor they were highly paid badly housed and deeply resentful they went in vast droves to football matches and did not care a rap if it rained the prevailing wind was sarcastic to come here from london was to come from atmospheric bluegreys to ashengreys from smoke and soft smut to grime and black grimness  the bishop had been charmed by the historical associations of princhester when first the see was put before his mind his realization of his diocese was a profound shock  only one hint had he had of what was coming he had met during his season of congratulations lord gatling dining unusually at the athenaeum lord gatling and he did not talk frequently but on this occasion the great racing peer came over to him you will feel like a cherub in a stokehole lord gatling had said  they used to heave lumps of slag at old hoods gaiters said lord gatling  in london a bishops a lord and a lark and nobody minds him said lord gatling but princhester is different it isnt used to bishops welli hope youll get to like em  3   trouble began with a fearful row about the position of the bishops palace hood had always evaded this question and a number of strongwilled selfmade men of wealth and influence full of local patriotism and that competitive spirit which has made england what it is already intensely irritated by hoods prevarications were resolved to pin his successor to an immediate decision of this the new bishop was unaware mindful of a bishops constant need to travel he was disposed to seek a home within easy reach of pringle junction from which nearly every point in the diocese could be simply and easily reached this fell in with lady ellas liking for the rare rural quiet of the kibe valley and the neighbourhood of her cousins the walshinghams unhappily it did not fall in with the inflexible resolution of each and every one of the six leading towns of the see to put up own obtrude boast and swagger about the biggest and showiest thing in episcopal palaces in all industrial england and the new bishop had already taken a short lease and gone some way towards the acquisition of ganford house two miles from pringle before he realized the strength and fury of these local ambitions  at first the magnates and influences seemed to be fighting only among themselves and he was so illadvised as to broach the ganford house project as a compromise that would glorify no one unfairly and leave the erection of an episcopal palace for some future date when he perhaps would have the good fortune to have passed to where beyond these voices there is peace forgetting altogether among other oversights the importance of architects and builders in local affairs his proposal seemed for a time to concentrate the rich passions of the whole countryside upon himself and his wife  because they did not leave lady ella alone the walshinghams were already unpopular in their county on account of a poverty and shyness that made them seem stuck up to successful captains of industry only too ready with the hand of friendship the iron grip indeed of friendship consciously hospitable and eager for admission and endorsements and princhester in particular was under the sway of that enterprising weekly the white blackbird which was illustrated by which indeed monopolized the gifts of that brilliant young caricaturist the snicker  it had seemed natural for lady ella to acquiesce in the proposals of the leading princhester photographer she had always helped where she could in her husbands public work and she had been popular upon her own merits in wealdstone the portrait was abominable enough in itself it dwelt on her chin doubled her age and denied her gentleness but it was a mere startingpoint for the subtle extravagance of the snickers poisonous gift the thing came upon the bishop suddenly from the bookstall at pringle junction  he kept it carefully from lady ella it was only later that he found that a copy of the white blackbird had been sent to her and that she was keeping the horror from him it was in her vein that she should reproach herself for being a vulnerable side to him  even when the bishop capitulated in favour of princhester that decision only opened a fresh trouble for him princhester wanted the palace to be a palace it wanted to combine all the best points of lambeth and fulham with the marble splendours of a good modern bank the bishops architectural tastes on the other hand were rationalistic he was all for building a useful palace in undertones with a green slate roof and long horizontal lines what he wanted more than anything else was a quite remote wing with a lot of bright little bedrooms and a sittingroom and so on complete in itself examination hall and everything with a long intricate connecting passage and several doors to prevent the ordination candidates straying all over the place and getting into the talk and the tea but the diocese wanted a proud archwayand turrets and did not care a rap if the ordination candidates slept about on the carpets in the bishops bedroom ordination candidates were quite outside the sphere of its imagination  and he disappointed princhester with his equipage princhester had a feeling that it deserved more for coming over to the church from nonconformity as it was doing it wanted a bishop in a mitre and a gilt coach it wanted a pastoral crook it wanted something to go with its mace and its mayor and obsessed by the snicker it wanted less of lady ella the cruelty and unreason of these attacks upon his wife distressed the bishop beyond measure and baffled him hopelessly he could not see any means of checking them nor of defending or justifying her against them  the palace was awaiting its tenant but the controversies and bitternesses were still swinging and swaying and developing when king george was being crowned close upon that event came a wave of social discontent the great railway strike a curious sense of social and political instability and the first beginnings of the bishops ill health  4   there came a day of exceptional fatigue and significance  the industrial trouble was a very real distress to the bishop he had a firm belief that it is a function of the church to act as mediator between employer and employed it was a common saying of his that the aim of socialismthe right sort of socialismwas to christianize employment regardless of suspicion on either hand regardless of very distinct hints that he should mind his own business he exerted himself in a search for methods of reconciliation he sought out every one who seemed likely to be influential on either side and did his utmost to discover the conditions of a settlement as far as possible and with the help of a not very efficient chaplain he tried to combine such interviews with his more normal visiting  at times and this was particularly the case on this day he seemed to be discovering nothing but the incurable perversity and militancy of human nature it was a day under an east wind when a steelyblue sky full of colourless light filled a stiffnecked world with whitish high lights and inky shadows these bright harsh days of barometric high pressure in england rouse and thwart every expectation of the happiness of spring and as the bishop drove through the afternoon in a hired fly along a rutted road of slag between fields that were bitterly wired against the sunday trespasser he fell into a despondent meditation upon the political and social outlook  his thoughts were of a sort not uncommon in those days the world was strangely restless since the passing of victoria the great there had been an accumulating uneasiness in the national life it was as if some compact and dignified paperweight had been lifted from peoples ideas and as if at once they had begun to blow about anyhow not that queen victoria had really been a paperweight or any weight at all but it happened that she died as an epoch closed an epoch of tremendous stabilities her son already elderly had followed as the selvedge follows the piece he had passed and left the new age stripped bare in nearly every department of economic and social life now there was upheaval and it was an upheaval very different in character from the radicalism and liberalism of the victorian days there were not only doubt and denial but now there were also impatience and unreason people argued less and acted quicker there was a pride in rebellion for its own sake an indiscipline and disposition to sporadic violence that made it extremely hard to negotiate any reconciliations or compromises behind every extremist it seemed stood a further extremist prepared to go one better  the bishop had spent most of the morning with one of the big employers a tall dark man lean and nervous and obviously tired and worried by the struggle he did not conceal his opinion that the church was meddling with matters quite outside its sphere never had it been conveyed to the bishop before how remote a rich and established englishman could consider the church from reality  youve got no hold on them he said it isnt your sphere  and again theyll listen to youif you speak well but they dont believe you know anything about it and they dont trust your good intentions they wont mind a bit what you say unless you drop something they can use against us  the bishop tried a few phrases he thought there might be something in cooperation in profitsharing in some more permanent relationship between the business and the employee  there isnt said the employer compactly its just the malice of being inferior against the man in control its just the spirit of insubordination and boredom with duty this troubles as old as the devil  but that is exactly the business of the church said the bishop brightly to reconcile men to their duty  by chanting the athanasian creed at em i suppose said the big employer betraying the sneer he had been hiding hitherto  this thing is a fight said the big employer carrying on before the bishop could reply religion had better get out of the streets until this thing is over the men wont listen to reason they dont mean to theyre bit by syndicalism theyre setting out i tell you to be unreasonable and impossible it isnt an argument its a fight they dont want to make friends with the employer they want to make an end to the employer whatever we give them theyll take and press us for more directly we make terms with the leaders the men go behind it its a raid on the whole system they dont mean to work the systemanyhow im the capitalist and the capitalist has to go im to be bundled out of my works and somesome he seemed to be rejecting unsuitable wordsconfounded politician put in much good it would do them but before that happens im going to fight you would  the bishop walked to the window and stood staring at the brilliant spring bulbs in the big employers garden and at a long vista of newlymown lawn under great shapely trees just budding into green  i cant admit he said that these troubles lie outside the sphere of the church  the employer came and stood beside him he felt he was being a little hard on the bishop but he could not see any way of making things easier  one doesnt want sacred things he tried in a scrap like this  weve got to mend things or end things continued the big employer nothing goes on for ever things cant last as they are going on now  then he went on abruptly to something that for a time he had been keeping back  of course just at present the church may do a confounded lot of harm some of you clerical gentlemen are rather too fond of talking socialism and even preaching socialism dont think i want to be overcritical i admit theres no end of things to be said for a proper sort of socialism ruskin and all that were all socialists nowadays idealsexcellent butit gets misunderstood it gives the men a sense of moral support it makes them fancy that they are it encourages them to forget duties and set up preposterous claims class war and all that sort of thing you gentlemen of the clergy dont quite realize that socialism may begin with ruskin and end with karl marx and that from the class war to the commune is just one step  5   from this conversation the bishop had made his way to the vicarage of mogham banks the vicar of mogham banks was a sacerdotal socialist of the most advanced type with the reputation of being closely in touch with the labour extremists he was a man addicted to banners prohibited ornaments special services at unusual hours and processions in the streets his taste in chasubles was loud he gardened in a cassock and it was said he slept in his biretta he certainly slept in a hair shirt and he littered his church with flowers candles side altars confessional boxes requests for prayers for the departed and the like there had already been two kensitite demonstrations at his services and altogether he was a source of considerable anxiety to the bishop the bishop did his best not to know too exactly what was going on at mogham banks sooner or later he felt he would be forced to do somethingand the longer he could put that off the better but the rev morrice deans had promised to get together three or four prominent labour leaders for tea and a frank talk and the opportunity was one not to be missed so the bishop after a hasty and not too digestible lunch in the refreshment room at pringle was now in a fly that smelt of straw and suggested infectious hospital patients on his way through the industryscarred countryside to this second conversation  the countryside had never seemed so scarred to him as it did that day  it was probably the bright hard spring sunshine that emphasized the contrast between that dear england of hedges and homes and the southwest wind in which his imagination lived and the crude presences of a mechanical age never before had the cuttings and heapings the smashing down of trees the obtrusion of corrugated iron and tar the belchings of smoke and the haste seemed so harsh and disregardful of all the bishops world across the fields a line of gaunt iron standards abominably designed carried an electric cable to some unknown end the curve of the hill made them seem a little out of the straight as if they hurried and bent forward furtively  where are they going asked the bishop leaning forward to look out of the window of the fly and then where is it all going  and presently the road was under repair and was being done at a great pace with a huge steamroller mechanically smashed granite and kettles of stinking stuff asphalt or something of that sort that looked and smelt like miltons hell beyond a gaunt hoarding advertised extensively the princhester music hall a mean beastly place that corrupted boys and girls and also it clamoured of tyres and potted meats  the afternoons conference gave him no reassuring answer to his question where is it all going  the afternoons conference did no more than intensify the new and strange sense of alienation from the world that the mornings talk had evoked  the three labour extremists that morrice deans had assembled obviously liked the bishop and found him picturesque and were not above a certain snobbish gratification at the purpletrimmed company they were in but it was clear that they regarded his intervention in the great dispute as if it were a feeble waving from the bank across the waters of a great river  theres an incurable misunderstanding between the modern employer and the modern employed the chief labour spokesman said speaking in a broad accent that completely hid from him and the bishop and every one the fact that he was by far the bestread man of the party disraeli called them the two nations but that was long ago now its a case of two species machinery has made them into different species the employer lives away from his workpeople marries a wife foreign out of a county family or suchlike trains his children from their very birth in a different manner why the growth curve is different for the two species they havent even a common speech between them one looks east and the other looks west how can you expect them to agree of course they wont agree weve got to fight it out they say were their slaves for ever have you ever read lady bells at the works a wellintentioned woman but she gives the whole thing away we say no its our sort and not your sort well do without you well get a little more education and then well do without you were pressing for all we can get and when weve got that well take breath and press for more were the morlocks coming up it isnt our fault that weve differentiated  but you havent understood the drift of christianity said the bishop its just to assert that men are one community and not two  theres not much of that in the creeds said a second labour leader who was a rationalist theres not much of that in the services of the church  the vicar spoke before his bishop and indeed he had plenty of time to speak before his bishop because you will not set yourselves to understand the symbolism of her ritual he said  if the church chooses to speak in riddles said the rationalist  symbols said morrice deans need not be riddles and for a time the talk eddied about this minor issue and the chief labour spokesman and the bishop looked at one another the vicar instanced and explained certain apparently insignificant observances his antagonist was contemptuously polite to these explanations thats all very pratty he said  the bishop wished that fine points of ceremonial might have been left out of the discussion  something much bigger than that was laying hold of his intelligence the realization of a world extravagantly out of hand the sky the wind the telegraph poles had been jabbing in the harsh lesson of these mens voices that the church as people say wasnt in it and that at the same time the church held the one remedy for all this ugliness and contention in its teaching of the universal fatherhood of god and the universal brotherhood of men only for some reason he hadnt the phrases and he hadnt the voice to assert this over their wrangling and their stiff resolution he wanted to think the whole business out thoroughly for the moment he had nothing to say and there was the labour leader opposite waiting smilingly to hear what he had to say so soon as the bout between the vicar and the rationalist was over  6   that morning in the long galleries of the bishops imagination a fresh painting had been added it was a big wall painting rather in the manner of puvis de chavannes and the central figure had been the bishop of princhester himself he had been standing upon the steps of the great door of the cathedral that looks upon the marketplace where the tramlines meet and he had been dressed very magnificently and rather after the older use he had been wearing a tunicle and dalmatic under a chasuble a pectoral cross purple gloves sandals and buskins a mitre and his presentation ring in his hand he had borne his pastoral staff and the clustering pillars and arches of the great doorway were painted with a loving flat particularity that omitted nothing but the sooty tinge of the later discolourations  on his right hand had stood a group of employers very richly dressed in the fashion of the fifteenth century and on the left a rather more numerous group of less decorative artisans with them their wives and children had been shown all greatly impressed by the canonicals every one had been extremely respectful  he had been reconciling the people and blessing them and calling them his sheep and his little children  but all this was so different  neither party resembled sheep or little children in the least degree   the labour leader became impatient with the ritualistic controversy he set his teacup aside out of danger and leant across the corner of the table to the bishop and spoke in a sawing undertone you see he said the church does not talk our language i doubt if it understands our language i doubt if we understand clearly where we are ourselves these things have to be fought out and hammered out its a big dusty dirty noisy job it may be a bloody job before its through you cant suddenly call a halt in the middle of the scrap and have a sort of millennium just because you want it  of course if the church had a plan he said if it had a proposal to make if it had anything more than a few pious palliatives to suggest that might be different but has it  the bishop had a bankrupt feeling on the spur of the moment he could say no more than it offers its mediation  7   full as he was with the preoccupation of these things and so a little slow and inattentive in his movements the bishop had his usual luck at pringle junction and just missed the 727 for princhester he might perhaps have got it by running through the subway and pushing past people but bishops must not run through subways and push past people his mind swore at the mischance even if his lips refrained  he was hungry and tired he would not get to the palace now until long after nine dinner would be over and lady ella would naturally suppose he had dined early with the rev morrice deans very probably there would be nothing ready for him at all  he tried to think he was exercising selfcontrol but indeed all his subconscious self was busy in a manner that would not have disgraced tertullian with the eternal welfare of those city fathers whose obstinacy had fixed the palace at princhester he walked up and down the platform gripping his hands very tightly behind him and maintaining a serene upcast countenance by a steadfast effort it seemed a small matter to him that the placards of the local evening papers should proclaim lloyd georges reconciliation meeting at wombash broken up by suffragettes for a year now he had observed a strict rule against buying the products of the local press and he saw no reason for varying this protective regulation  his mind was full of angry helplessness  was he to blame was the church to blame for its powerlessness in these social disputes could an abler man with a readier eloquence have done more  he envied the cleverness of cardinal manning manning would have got right into the front of this affair he would have accumulated credit for his church and himself  but would he have done much  the bishop wandered along the platform to its end and stood contemplating the convergent ways that gather together beyond the station and plunge into the hillside and the wilderness of sidings and trucks signalboxes huts coalpits electric standards goods sheds turntables and enginehouses that ends in a bluish brickedup cliff against the hill a train rushed with a roar and clatter into the throat of the great tunnel and was immediately silenced its rear lights twinkled and vanished and then out of that huge black throat came wisps of white steam and curled slowly upward like lazy snakes until they caught the slanting sunshine for the first time the day betrayed a softness and touched this scene of black energy to gold all late afternoons are beautiful whatever the day has beenif only there is a gleam of sun and now a kind of mechanical greatness took the place of mere black disorder in the bishops perception of his see it was harsh it was vast and strong it was no lamb he had to rule but a dragon would it ever be given to him to overcome his dragon to lead it home and bless it  he stood at the very end of the platform with his gaitered legs wide apart and his hands folded behind him staring beyond all visible things  should he do something very bold and striking should he invite both men and masters to the cathedral and preach tremendous sermons to them upon these living issues  short sermons of course  but stating the churchs attitude with a new and convincing vigour  he had a vision of the great aisle strangely full and alive and astir the organ notes still echoed in the fretted vaulting as the preacher made his way from the chancel to the pulpit the congregation was tense with expectation and for some reason his mind dwelt for a long time upon the figure of the preacher ascending the steps of the pulpit outside the day was dark and stormy so that the stainedglass windows looked absolutely dead for a little while the preacher prayed then in the attentive silence the tenor of the preacher would begin a thin jet of sound a ray of light in the darkness speaking to all these men as they had never been spoken to before  surely so one might call a halt to all these harsh conflicts so one might lay hands afresh upon these stubborn minds one might win them round to look at christ the master and servant  that he thought would be a good phrase christ the master and servant  members of one body that should be his text at last it was finished the big congregation which had kept so still sighed and stirred the task of reconciliation was as good as done and now to god the father god the son and god the holy ghost  outside the day had become suddenly bright the threatening storm had drifted away and great shafts of coloured light from the pictured windows were smiting like arrows amidst his hearers  this idea of a great sermon upon capital and labour did so powerfully grip the bishops imagination that he came near to losing the 827 train also  he discovered it when it was already in the station he had to walk down the platform very quickly he did not run but his gaiters he felt twinkled more than a bishops should  8   directly he met his wife he realized that he had to hear something important and unpleasant  she stood waiting for him in the inner hall looking very grave and still the light fell upon her pale face and her dark hair and her long white silken dress making her seem more delicate and unworldly than usual and making the bishop feel grimy and sordid  i must have a wash he said though before he had thought of nothing but food i have had nothing to eat since teatimeand that was mostly talk  lady ella considered there are cold things you shall have a tray in the study not in the diningroom eleanor is there i want to tell you something but go upstairs first and wash your poor tired face  nothing serious i hope he asked struck by an unusual quality in her voice  i will tell you she evaded and after a moment of mutual scrutiny he went past her upstairs  since they had come to princhester lady ella had changed very markedly she seemed to her husband to have gained in dignity she was stiller and more restrained a certain faint arrogance a touch of the ruling class manner had dwindled almost to the vanishing point there had been a time when she had inclined to an authoritative hauteur when she had seemed likely to develop into one of those aggressive and interfering old ladies who play so overwhelming a part in british public affairs she had been known to initiate adverse judgments to exercise the snub to cut and humiliate princhester had done much to purge her of such tendencies princhester had made her think abundantly and had put a new and subtler quality into her beauty it had taken away the least little disposition to rustle as she moved and it had softened her voice  now when presently she stood in the study she showed a new circumspection in her treatment of her husband she surveyed the tray before him  you ought not to drink that burgundy she said i can see you are dogtired it was uncorked yesterday and anyhow it is not very digestible this cold meat is bad enough you ought to have one of those quarter bottles of champagne you got for my last convalescence theres more than a dozen left over  the bishop felt that this was a pretty return of his own kindly thoughts after many days and soon dunk his valetbutler was pouring out the precious and refreshing glassful  and now dear said the bishop feeling already much better  lady ella had come round to the marble fireplace the mantelpiece was a handsome work by a princhester artist in the gill stylewith contemplative ascetics as supporters  i am worried about eleanor said lady ella  she is in the diningroom now she said having some dinner she came in about a quarter past eight half way through dinner  where had she been asked the bishop  her dress was tornin two places her wrist had been twisted and a little sprained  my dear  her facegrubby and she had been crying  but my dear what had happened to her you dont mean  husband and wife stared at one another aghast neither of them said the horrid word that flamed between them  merciful heaven said the bishop and assumed an attitude of despair  i didnt know she knew any of them but it seems it is the second walshingham girlphoebe its impossible to trace a girls thoughts and friends she persuaded her to go  but did she understand  thats the serious thing said lady ella  she seemed to consider whether he could bear the blow  she understands all sorts of things she argues i am quite unable to argue with her  about this vote business  about all sorts of things things i didnt imagine she had heard of i knew she had been reading books but i never imagined that she could have understood  the bishop laid down his knife and fork  one may read in books one may even talk of things without fully understanding he said  lady ella tried to entertain this comforting thought it isnt like that she said at last she talks like a grownup person thisthis escapade is just an accident but things have gone further than that she seems to thinkthat she is not being educated properly here that she ought to go to a college as if we were keeping things from her  the bishop reconsidered his plate  but what things he said  she says we get all round her said lady ella and left the implications of that phrase to unfold  9   for a time the bishop said very little  lady ella had found it necessary to make her first announcement standing behind him upon the hearthrug but now she sat upon the arm of the great armchair as close to him as possible and spoke in a more familiar tone  the thing she said had come to her as a complete surprise everything had seemed so safe eleanor had been thoughtful it was true but it had never occurred to her mother that she had really been thinkingabout such things as she had been thinking about she had ranged in the library and displayed a disposition to read the weekly papers and the monthly reviews but never a sign of discontent  but i dont understand said the bishop why is she discontented what is there that she wants different  exactly said lady ella  she has got this idea that life here is secluded in some way she expanded she used words like secluded and artificial andwhat was itcloistered and she said  lady ella paused with an effect of exact retrospection  out there she said things are alive real things are happening it is almost as if she did not fully believe  lady ella paused again  the bishop sat with his arm over the back of his chair and his face downcast  the ferment of youth he said at last the ferment of youth who has given her these ideas  lady ella did not know she could have thought a school like st aubyns would have been safe but nowadays nothing was safe it was clear the girls who went there talked as girls a generation ago did not talk their people at home encouraged them to talk and profess opinions about everything it seemed that phoebe walshingham and lady kitty kingdom were the leaders in these premature mental excursions phoebe aired religious doubts  but little phoebe said the bishop  kitty said lady ella has written a novel  already  with elopements in itand all sorts of things shes had it typed youd think mary crosshampton would know better than to let her daughter go flourishing the family imagination about in that way  eleanor told you  by way of showing that they think ofthings in general  the bishop reflected she wants to go to college  they want to go in a set  i wonder if college can be much worse than school shes eighteen but i will talk to her  10   all our children are changelings they are perpetually fresh strangers every day they vanish and a new person masquerades as yesterdays child until some unexpected development betrays the cheat  the bishop had still to learn this perennial newness of the young he learnt it in half an hour at the end of a fatiguing day  he went into the diningroom he went in as carelessly as possible and smoking a cigarette he had an honourable dread of being portentous in his family almost ostentatiously he laid the bishop aside eleanor had finished her meal and was sitting in the armchair by the fire with one hand holding her sprained wrist  well he said and strolled to the hearthrug he had had an odd idea that he would find her still dirty torn and tearful as her mother had described her a little girl in a scrape but she had changed into her best white evening frock and put up her hair and became in the firelight more of a lady a very young lady but still a lady than she had ever been to him before she was dark like her mother but not of the same willowy type she had more of her fathers sturdy build and she had developed her shoulders at hockey and tennis the firelight brought out the gracious reposeful lines of a body that ripened in adolescence and though there was a vibration of resolution in her voice she spoke like one who is under her own control  mother has told you that i have disgraced myself she began  no said the bishop weighing it no but you seem to have been indiscreet little norah  i got excited she said they began turning out the other womenroughly i was indignant  you didnt go to interrupt he asked  she considered no she said but i went  he liked her disposition to get it right on that side he assisted  it isnt the same thing as really meaning daddy she said  and then things happened  yes she said to the fire  a pause followed if they had been in a lawcourt her barrister would have said that is my case my lord the bishop prepared to open the next stage in the proceedings  i think norah you shouldnt have been there at all he said  mother says that  a man in my position is apt to be judged by his family you commit more than yourself when you commit an indiscretion apart from that it wasnt the place for a girl to be at you are not a child now we give you freedommore freedom than most girls getbecause we think you will use it wisely you knewenough to know that there was likely to be trouble  the girl looked into the fire and spoke very carefully i dont think that i oughtnt to know the things that are going on  the bishop studied her face for an instant it struck him that they had reached something very fundamental as between parent and child his modernity showed itself in the temperance of his reply  dont you think my dear that on the whole your mother and i who have lived longer and know more are more likely to know when it is best that you should begin to knowthis or that  the girl knitted her brows and seemed to be reading her answer out of the depths of the coals she was on the verge of speaking altered her mind and tried a different beginning  i think that every one must do their thinkinghis thinkingforoneself she said awkwardly  you mean you cant trust  it isnt trusting but one knows best for oneself when one is hungry  and you find yourself hungry  i want to find out for myself what all this trouble about votes and things means  and we starve youintellectually  you know i dont think that but you are busy  arent you being perhaps a little impatient eleanor after allyou are barely eighteen we have given you all sorts of liberties  her silence admitted it but still she said after a long pause there are other girls younger than i am in these things they talk aboutoh all sorts of things freely  youve been awfully good to me she said irrelevantly and of course this meeting was all pure accident  father and daughter remained silent for awhile seeking a better grip  what exactly do you want eleanor he asked  she looked up at him generally she asked  your mother has the impression that you are discontented  discontented is a horrid word  wellunsatisfied  she remained still for a time she felt the moment had come to make her demand  i would like to go to newnham or somervilleand work i feelso horribly ignorant of all sorts of things if i were a son i should go  yees said the bishop and reflected  he had gone rather far in the direction of the woman suffrage people he had advocated equality of standard in all sorts of matters and the memory of these utterances hampered him  you could read here he tried  if i were a son you wouldnt say that  his reply was vague but in this home he said we have a certain atmosphere  he left her to imply her differences in sensibility and response from the hardier male  her hesitation marked the full gravity of her reply its just that she said one feels she considered it further as if we were living in a kind of magic worldnot really real out there she glanced over her shoulder at the drawn blind that hid the night one meets with different sorts of minds and differentatmospheres all this is very beautiful ive had the most wonderful home but theres a sort of feeling as though it couldnt really go on as though all these strikes and doubts and questionings  she stopped short at questionings for the thing was said  the bishop took her meaning gallantly and honestly  the church of christ little norah is built upon a rock  she made no answer she moved her head very slightly so that he could not see her face and remained sitting rather stiffly and awkwardly with her eyes upon the fire  her silence was the third and greatest blow the bishop received that day  it seemed very long indeed before either of them spoke at last he said we must talk about these things again norah when we are less tired and have more time you have been reading books when caxton set up his printingpress he thrust a new power between church and disciple and father and child and i am tired we must talk it over a little later  the girl stood up she took her fathers hands dear dear daddy she said i am so sorry to be a bother i am so sorry i went to that meeting you look tired out  we must talkproperly said the bishop patting one hand then discovering from her wincing face that it was the sprained one your poor wrist he said  its so hard to talk but i want to talk to you daddy it isnt that i have hidden things  she kissed him and the bishop had the odd fancy that she kissed him as though she was sorry for him  it occurred to him that really there could be no time like the present for discussing these questionings of hers and then his fatigue and shyness had the better of him again  11   the papers got hold of eleanors share in the suffragette disturbance the white blackbird said things about her  it did not attack her it did worse it admired her impudently  it spoke of her once as norah and once as the scrope flapper  its headline proclaimed plucky flappers hold up l g     chapter the third  insomnia  1   the night after his conversation with eleanor was the first night of the bishops insomnia it was the definite beginning of a new phase in his life  doctors explain to us that the immediate cause of insomnia is always some poisoned or depleted state of the body and no doubt the fatigues and hasty meals of the day had left the bishop in a state of unprecedented chemical disorder with his nerves irritated by strange compounds and unsoothed by familiar lubricants but chemical disorders follow mental disturbances and the core and essence of his trouble was an intellectual distress for the first time in his life he was really in doubt about himself about his way of living about all his persuasions it was a general doubt it was not a specific suspicion upon this point or that it was a feeling of detachment and unreality at once extraordinarily vague and extraordinarily oppressive it was as if he discovered himself flimsy and transparent in a world of minatory solidity and opacity it was as if he found himself made not of flesh and blood but of tissue paper  but this intellectual insecurity extended into his physical sensations it affected his feeling in his skin as if it were not absolutely his own skin  and as he lay there a weak phantom mentally and bodily an endless succession and recurrence of anxieties for which he could find no reassurance besieged him  chief of this was his distress for eleanor  she was the central figure in this new sense of illusion in familiar and trusted things it was not only that the world of his existence which had seemed to be the whole universe had become diaphanous and betrayed vast and uncontrollable realities beyond it but his daughter had as it were suddenly opened a door in this glassy sphere of insecurity that had been his abiding refuge a door upon the stormy rebel outer world and she stood there young ignorant confident adventurous ready to step out  could it be possible that she did not believe  he saw her very vividly as he had seen her in the diningroom slender and upright half child half woman so fragile and so fearless and the door she opened thus carelessly gave upon a stormy background like one of the stormy backgrounds that were popular behind portrait dianas in eighteenth century paintings did she believe that all he had taught her all the life he led waswhat was her phrasea kind of magic world not really real  he groaned and turned over and repeated the words a kind of magic worldnot really real  the wind blew through the door she opened and scattered everything in the room and still she held the door open  he was astonished at himself he started up in swift indignation had he not taught the child had he not brought her up in an atmosphere of faith what right had she to turn upon him in this matter it wasindeed it wasa sort of insolence a lack of reverence  it was strange he had not perceived this at the time  but indeed at the first mention of questionings he ought to have thundered he saw that quite clearly now he ought to have cried out and said on your knees my norah and ask pardon of god  because after all faith is an emotional thing  he began to think very rapidly and copiously of things he ought to have said to eleanor and now the eloquence of reverie was upon him in a little time he was also addressing the teaparty at morrice deans upon them too he ought to have thundered and he knew now also all that he should have said to the recalcitrant employer thunder also thunder is surely the privilege of the higher clergyunder jove  but why hadnt he thundered  he gesticulated in the darkness thrust out a clutching hand  there are situations that must be grippedgripped firmly and without delay in the middle ages there had been grip enough in a purple glove  2   from these belated seizures of the days lost opportunities the bishop passed to such a pessimistic estimate of the church as had never entered his mind before  it was as if he had fallen suddenly out of a spiritual balloon into a world of bleak realism he found himself asking unprecedented and devastating questions questions that implied the most fundamental shiftings of opinion why was the church such a failure why had it no grip upon either masters or men amidst this vigorous life of modern industrialism and why had it no grip upon the questioning young it was a tolerated thing he felt just as sometimes he had felt that the crown was a tolerated thing he too was a tolerated thing a curious survival  this was not as things should be he struggled to recover a proper attitude but he remained enormously dissatisfied  the church was no levite to pass by on the other side away from the struggles and wrongs of the social conflict it had no right when the children asked for the bread of life to offer them gothic stone  he began to make interminable weak plans for fulfilling his duty to his diocese and his daughter  what could he do to revivify his clergy he wished he had more personal magnetism he wished he had a darker and a larger presence he wished he had not been saddled with whipphams rather futile son as his chaplain he wished he had a dean instead of being his own dean with an unsympathetic rector he wished he had it in him to make some resounding appeal he might of course preach a series of thumping addresses and sermons rather on the lines of fors clavigera to masters and men in the cathedral only it was so difficult to get either masters or men into the cathedral  well if the people will not come to the bishop the bishop must go out to the people should he go outside the cathedralto the place where the trains met  interweaving with such thoughts the problem of eleanor rose again into his consciousness  werent there books she ought to read werent there books she ought to be made to read and booksand friendsthat ought to be imperatively forbidden imperatively  but how to define the forbidden  he began to compose an address on modern literature socalled  it became acrimonious  before dawn the birds began to sing  his mind had seemed to be a little tranquillized there had been a distinct feeling of subsidence sleepwards when first one and then another little creature roused itself and the bishop to greet the gathering daylight  it became a little clamour a misty sea of sound in which individuality appeared and disappeared for a time a distant cuckoo was very perceptible like a landmark looming up over a fog like the cuckoo in the pastoral symphony  the bishop tried not to heed these sounds but they were by their very nature insistent sounds he lay disregarding them acutely  presently he pulled the coverlet over his ears  a little later he sat up in bed  again in a slight detail he marked his strange and novel detachment from the world of his upbringing his hallucination of disillusionment had spread from himself and his church and his faith to the whole animate creation he knew that these were the voices of our feathered songsters that this was a joyous chorus greeting the day he knew that a wakeful bishop ought to bless these happy creatures and join with them by reciting kens morning hymn he made an effort that was more than half habit to repeat and he repeated with a scowling face and the voice of a schoolmaster   awake my soul and with the sun thy daily stage of duty run   he got no further he stopped short sat still thinking what utterly detestable things singing birds were a blackbird had gripped his attention never had he heard such vain repetitions he struggled against the dark mood of criticism he prayeth best who loveth best  no he did not love the birds it was useless to pretend whatever one may say about other birds a cuckoo is a low detestable cad of a bird  then the bishop began to be particularly tormented by a bird that made a short insistent wheezing sound at regular intervals of perhaps twenty seconds if a bird could have whoopingcough that he thought was the sort of whoop it would have but even if it had whoopingcough he could not pity it he hung in its intervals waiting for the return of the wheeze  and then that blackbird reasserted itself it had a rich boastful note it seemed proud of its noisy reiteration of simple selfassertion for some obscure reason the phrase oleographic sounds drifted into the bishops thoughts this bird produced the peculiar and irrational impression that it had recently made a considerable sum of money by shrewd industrialism it was he thought grimly a genuine princhester blackbird  this wickedly uncharitable reference to his diocese ran all unchallenged through the bishops mind and others no less wicked followed it  once during his summer holidays in florence he and lady ella had subscribed to an association for the protection of songbirds he recalled this now with a mild wonder it seemed to him that perhaps after all it was as well to let fruitgrowers and italians deal with singingbirds in their own way perhaps after all they had a wisdom  he passed his hands over his face the world after all is not made entirely for singingbirds there is such a thing as proportion singingbirds may become a luxury an indulgence an excess  did the birds eat the fruit in paradise  perhaps there they worked for some collective musical effect had some sort of conductor in the place of thishullabaloo  he decided to walk about the room for a time and then remake his bed  the sunrise found the bishop with his head and shoulders out of the window trying to see that blackbird he just wanted to look at it he was persuaded it was a quite exceptional blackbird  again came that oppressive sense of the futility of the contemporary church but this time it came in the most grotesque form for hanging half out of the casement he was suddenly reminded of st francis of assisi and how at his rebuke the wheeling swallow stilled their cries  but it was all so different then  3   it was only after he had passed four similar nights with intervening days of lassitude and afternoon siestas that the bishop realized that he was in the grip of insomnia  he did not go at once to a doctor but he told his trouble to every one he met and received much tentative advice he had meant to have his talk with eleanor on the morning next after their conversation in the diningroom but his bodily and spiritual anaemia prevented him  the fifth night was the beginning of the whitsuntide ember week and he wore a red cassock and had a distracting and rather interesting day welcoming his ordination candidates they had a good effect upon him we spiritualize ourselves when we seek to spiritualize others and he went to bed in a happier frame of mind than he had done since the day of the shock he woke in the night but he woke much more himself than he had been since the trouble began he repeated that verse of kens  when in the night i sleepless lie my soul with heavenly thoughts supply let no ill dreams disturb my rest no powers of darkness me molest   almost immediately after these there floated into his mind as if it were a message the dear familiar words  he giveth his beloved sleep   these words irradiated and soothed him quite miraculously the clouds of doubt seemed to dissolve and vanish and leave him safe and calm under a clear sky he knew those words were a promise and very speedily he fell asleep and slept until he was called  but the next day was a troubled one whippham had muddled his timetable and crowded his afternoon the strike of the transport workers had begun and the ugly noises they made at the tramway depot where they were booing some one penetrated into the palace he had to snatch a meal between services and the sense of hurry invaded his afternoon lectures to the candidates he hated hurry in ember week his ideal was one of quiet serenity of grave things said slowly of still kneeling figures of a sort of dark cool spiritual germination but what sort of dark cool spiritual germination is possible with an ass like whippham about  in the fresh courage of the morning the bishop had arranged for that talk with eleanor he had already deferred too long and this had proved less satisfactory than he had intended it to be  the bishops experience with the ordination candidates was following the usual course before they came there was something bordering upon distaste for the coming invasion then always there was an effect of surprise at the youth and faith of the neophytes and a real response of the spirit to the occasion throughout the first twentyfour hours they were all simply neophytes without individuality to break up their uniformity of selfdevotion then afterwards they began to develop little personal traits and scarcely ever were these pleasing traits always one or two of them would begin haunting the bishop giving way to an appetite for special words special recognitions he knew the expression of that craving on their faces he knew the waylaying movements in room and passage that presently began  this time in particular there was a freckled underbred young man who handed in what was evidently a carefully prepared memorandum upon what he called my positions apparently he had a muddle of doubts about the early fathers and the dates of the earlier authentic copies of the gospels things of no conceivable significance  the bishop glanced through this bale of papersit had of course no index and no synopsis and some of the pages were not numberedhanded it over to whippham and when he proved as usual a broken reed the bishop had the brilliant idea of referring the young man to canon bliss of pringle who has a special knowledge quite beyond my own in this field  but he knew from the young mans eye even as he said this that it was not going to put him off for more than a day or so  the immediate result of glancing over these papers was however to enhance in the bishops mind a growing disposition to minimize the importance of all dated and explicit evidences and arguments for orthodox beliefs and to resort to vague symbolic and liberal interpretations and it was in this state that he came to his talk with eleanor  he did not give her much time to develop her objections he met her half way and stated them for her and overwhelmed her with sympathy and understanding she had been too literal too literal was his keynote he was a little astonished at the liberality of his own views he had been getting along now for some years without looking into his own opinions too closely and he was by no means prepared to discover how far he had come to meet his daughters scepticisms but he did meet them he met them so thoroughly that he almost conveyed that hers was a needlessly conservative and oldfashioned attitude  occasionally he felt he was being a little evasive but she did not seem to notice it as she took his drift her relief and happiness were manifest and he had never noticed before how clear and pretty her eyes were they were the most honest eyes he had ever seen she looked at him very steadily as he explained and lit up at his points she brightened wonderfully as she realized that after all they were not apart they had not differed simply they had misunderstood  and before he knew where he was and in a mere parenthetical declaration of liberality he surprised himself by conceding her demand for newnham even before she had repeated it it helped his case wonderfully  call in every exterior witness you can the church will welcome them no i want you to go my dear  but his mind was stirred again to its depths by this discussion and in particular he was surprised and a little puzzled by this newnham concession and the necessity of making his new attitude clear to lady ella  it was with a sense of fatality that he found himself awake again that night like some one lying drowned and still and yet perfectly conscious at the bottom of deep cold water  he repeated he giveth his beloved sleep but all the conviction had gone out of the words  4   neither the bishops insomnia nor his incertitudes about himself and his faith developed in a simple and orderly manner there were periods of sustained suffering and periods of recovery it was not for a year or so that he regarded these troubles as more than acute incidental interruptions of his general tranquillity or realized that he was passing into a new phase of life and into a new quality of thought he told every one of the insomnia and no one of his doubts these he betrayed only by an increasing tendency towards vagueness symbolism poetry and toleration eleanor seemed satisfied with his exposition she did not press for further enlightenment she continued all her outward conformities except that after a time she ceased to communicate and in september she went away to newnham her doubts had not visibly affected clementina or her other sisters and the bishop made no further attempts to explore the spiritual life of his family below the surface of its formal acquiescence  as a matter of fact his own spiritual wrestlings were almost exclusively nocturnal during his spells of insomnia he led a curiously double existence in the daytime he was largely the self he had always been able assured ecclesiastical except that he was a little jaded and irritable or sleepy instead of being quick and bright he believed in god and the church and the royal family and himself securely in the wakeful night time he experienced a different and novel self a bareminded self bleakly fearless at its best shamelessly weak at its worst critical sceptical joyless anxious the anxiety was quite the worst element of all something sat by his pillow asking grey questions what are you doing where are you going is it really well with the children is it really well with the church is it really well with the country are you indeed doing anything at all are you anything more than an actor wearing a costume in an archaic play the people turn their backs on you  he would twist over on his pillow he would whisper hymns and prayers that had the quality of charms  he giveth his beloved sleep that answered many times and many times it failed  the labour troubles of 1912 eased off as the year wore on and the bitterness of the local press over the palace abated very considerably indeed there was something like a watery gleam of popularity when he brought down his consistent friend the dear old princess christiana of hoch and unter black bonnet deafness and all to open a new wing of the childrens hospital the princhester conservative paper took the occasion to inform the diocese that he was a fluent german scholar and consequently a persona grata with the royal aunts and that the princess christiana was merely just one of a number of royalties now practically at the beck and call of princhester it was not true but it was very effective locally and seemed to justify a little the hauteur of which lady ella was so unjustly suspected yet it involved a possibility of disappointments in the future  he went to brightonpomfrey too upon the score of his general health and brightonpomfrey revised his general regimen discouraged indiscreet fasting and suggested a complete abstinence from red wine except white port if indeed that can be called a red wine and a moderate use of egyptian cigarettes  but 1913 was a strenuous year the labour troubles revived the suffragette movement increased greatly in violence and aggressiveness and there sprang up no less than three ecclesiastical scandals in the diocese first the kensitites set themselves firmly to make presentations and prosecutions against morrice deans who was reserving the sacrament wearing they said babylonish garments going beyond all reason in the matter of infant confession and generally brightening up mogham banks next a popular preacher in wombash published a book under the exasperating title the light under the altar in which he showed himself as something between an arian and a pantheist and treated the dogma of the trinity with as little respect as one would show to an intrusive cat while thirdly an obscure but overworked missioner of a tin mission church in the new workingclass district at pringle being discovered in some sort of polygamous relationship had seen fit to publish in pamphlet form a scandalous admission and defence a pamphlet entitled marriage true and false taking the public needlessly into his completest confidence and quoting the affairs of abraham and hosea reviving many points that are better forgotten about luther and appealing also to such uncanonical authorities as milton plato and john humphrey noyes this abnormal concurrence of indiscipline was extremely unlucky for the bishop it plunged him into strenuous controversy upon three fronts so to speak and involved a great number of personal encounters far too vivid for his mental serenity  the pringle polygamist was the most moving as morrice deans was the most exacting and troublesome and the wombash pantheist the most insidiously destructive figure in these three toilsome disputes the pringle mans soul had apparently missed the normal distribution of figleaves he was an illiterate openeyed hardvoiced freckled rationalminded creature with large expository hands who had come by a side way into the church because he was an indefatigable worker and he insisted upon telling the bishop with an irrepressible candour and completeness just exactly what was the matter with his intimate life the bishop very earnestly did not want these details and did his utmost to avoid the controversial questions that the honest man pressed respectfully but obstinately upon him  even st paul my lord admitted that it is better to marry than burn said the pringle misdemeanant and here was i my lord married and still burning and i think you would find my lord considering all charlottes peculiarities that the situation was really much more trying than the absolute celibacy st paul had in view  the bishop listened to these arguments as little as possible and did not answer them at all but afterwards the offender came and wept and said he was ruined and heartbroken and unfairly treated because he wasnt a gentleman and that was distressing it was so exactly trueand so inevitable he had been deprived rather on account of his voice and apologetics than of his offence and public opinion was solidly with the sentence he made a gallant effort to found what he called a labour church in pringle and after some financial misunderstandings departed with his unambiguous menage to join the advanced movement on the clyde  the morrice deans enquiry however demanded an amount of erudition that greatly fatigued the bishop he had a very fair general knowledge of vestments but he had never really cared for anything but the poetry of ornaments and he had to work strenuously to master the legal side of the question whippham his chaplain was worse than useless as a helper the bishop wanted to end the matter as quickly quietly and favourably to morrice deans as possible he thought morrice deans a thoroughly good man in his parish and he believed that the substitution of a low churchman would mean a very complete collapse of church influence in mogham banks where people were now thoroughly accustomed to a highly ornate service but morrice deans was intractable and his pursuers indefatigable and on several occasions the bishop sat far into the night devising compromises and equivocations that should make the kensitites think that morrice deans wasnt wearing vestments when he was and that should make morrice deans think he was wearing vestments when he wasnt and it was whippham who first suggested green tea as a substitute for coffee which gave the bishop indigestion as his stimulant for these nocturnal bouts  now green tea is the most lucid of poisons  and while all this extra activity about morrice deans these vigils and crammings and writings down were using all and more energy than the bishop could well spare he was also doing his quiet utmost to keep the light under the altar ease from coming to a head  this man he hated  and he dreaded him as well as hated him chasters the author of the light under the altar was a man who not only reasoned closely but indelicately there was a demonstrating jeering air about his preaching and writing and everything he said and did was saturated by the spirit of challenge he did not so much imitate as exaggerate the style of matthew arnold and whatever was done publicly against him would have to be done very publicly because his book had got him a london reputation  from the bishops point of view chasters was one of natures ignoblemen he seemed to have subscribed to the thirtynine articles and passed all the tests and taken all the pledges that stand on the way to ordination chiefly for the pleasure of attacking them more successfully from the rear he had been given the living of wombash by a cousin and filled it very largely because it was not only more piquant but more remunerative and respectable to be a rationalist lecturer in a surplice and in a hard kind of ultraprotestant way his social and parochial work was not badly done but his sermons were terrible he takes a text said one informant and he goes on firstly secondly thirdly fourthly like somebody tearing the petals from a flower finally he says and throws the bare stalk into the dustbin  the bishop avoided the light under the altar for nearly a year it was only when a second book was announced with the winning title of the core of truth in christianity that he perceived he must take action he sat up late one night with a marked copy a very indignantly marked copy of the former work that an elderly colonel a wombash parishioner an orthodox layman of the most virulent type had sent him he perceived that he had to deal with a dialectician of exceptional ability who had concentrated a quite considerable weight of scholarship upon the task of explaining away every scrap of spiritual significance in the eucharist from chasters the bishop was driven by reference to the works of legge and frazer and for the first time he began to measure the dimensions and power of the modern criticism of church doctrine and observance green tea should have lit his way to refutation instead it lit up the whole inquiry with a light of melancholy confirmation neither by night nor by day could the bishop find a proper method of opening a counter attack upon chasters who was indisputably an intellectually abler man and a very ruthless beast indeed to assail and meanwhile the demand that action should be taken increased  the literature of church history and the controversies arising out of doctrinal development became the employment of the bishops leisure and a commanding preoccupation he would have liked to discuss with some one else the network of perplexities in which he was entangling himself and more particularly with canon bliss but his own positions were becoming so insecure that he feared to betray them by argument he had grown up with a kind of intellectual modesty some things he had never yet talked about it made his mind blench to think of talking about them and his great aching gaps of wakefulness began now thanks to the green tea to be interspersed with theological dreams and visions of an extravagant vividness he would see frazers sacrificial kings butchered picturesquely and terribly amidst strange and grotesque rituals he would survey long and elaborate processions and ceremonials in which the most remarkable symbols were borne high in the sight of all men he would cower before a gigantic and threatening heaven these greentea dreams and visions were not so much phases of sleep as an intensification and vivid furnishing forth of insomnia it added greatly to his disturbance thatexceeding the instructions of brightonpomfreyhe had now experimented ignorantly and planlessly with one or two narcotics and sleeping mixtures that friends and acquaintances had mentioned in his hearing for the first time in his life he became secretive from his wife he knew he ought not to take these things he knew they were physically and morally evil but a tormenting craving drove him to them subtly and insensibly his character was being undermined by the growing nervous trouble  he astonished himself by the cunning and the hypocritical dignity he could display in procuring these drugs he arranged to have a teamaking set in his bedroom and secretly substituted green tea for which he developed a powerful craving in the place of the delicate china tea lady ella procured him  5   these doctrinal and physical anxieties and distresses were at their worst in the spring and early summer of 1914 that was a time of great mental and moral disturbance there was premonition in the air of those days it was like the uneasiness sensitive people experience before a thunderstorm the moral atmosphere was sullen and close the whole world seemed irritable and mischievous the suffragettes became extraordinarily malignant the democratic movement went rotten with sabotage and with a cant of being rebels the reactionary tories and a crew of noisy old peeresses set themselves to create incurable confusion again in the healing wounds of ireland and feuds and frantic folly broke out at every point of the social and political edifice and then a bomb burst at sarajevo that silenced all this tumult the unstable polity of europe heeled over like a ship that founders  through the swiftest tensest week in history europe capsized into war  6   the first effect of the war upon the mind of the bishop as upon most imaginative minds was to steady and exalt it trivialities and exasperations seemed swept out of existence men lifted up their eyes from disputes that had seemed incurable and wrangling that promised to be interminable and discovered a plain and tragic issue that involved every one in a common call for devotion for a great number of men and women who had been born and bred in security the august and september of 1914 were the supremely heroic period of their lives myriads of souls were born again to ideas of service and sacrifice in those tremendous days  black and evil thing as the war was it was at any rate a great thing it did this much for countless minds that for the first time they realized the epic quality of history and their own relationship to the destinies of the race the flimsy roof under which we had been living our lives of comedy fell and shattered the floor under our feet we saw the stars above and the abyss below we perceived that life was insecure and adventurous part of one vast adventure in space and time  presently the smoke and dust of battle hid the great distances again but they could not altogether destroy the memories of this revelation  for the first two months the bishops attention was so detached from his immediate surroundings and employments so absorbed by great events that his history if it were told in detail would differ scarcely at all from the histories of most comparatively unemployed minds during those first dramatic days the days when the germans made their great rush upon paris and it seemed that france was down france and the whole fabric of liberal civilization he emerged from these stunning apprehensions after the battle of the marne to find himself busy upon a score of dispersed and disconnected war jobs and trying to get all the new appearances and forces and urgencies of the war into relations with himself one thing became very vivid indeed that he wasnt being used in any real and effective way in the war there was a mighty going to and fro upon red cross work and various war committees a vast preparation for wounded men and for the succour of dislocated families a preparation that proved to be needless for catastrophic unemployment the war problem and the puzzle of german psychology ousted for a time all other intellectual interests like every one else the bishop swam deep in nietzsche bernhardi houston stewart chamberlain and the like he preached several sermons upon german materialism and the astonishing decay of the german character he also read every newspaper he could lay his hands onlike any secular man he signed an address to the russian orthodox church beginning brethren and he revised his impressions of the filioque controversy the idea of a reunion of the two great state churches of russia and england had always attracted him but hitherto it had been a thing quite out of scale visionary utopian now in this strange time of altered perspectives it seemed the most practicable of suggestions the mayor and corporation and a detachment of the special reserve in uniform came to a great intercession service and in the palace there were two conferences of local influential people people of the most various types people who had never met tolerantly before expressing now opinions of unprecedented breadth and liberality  all this sort of thing was fresh and exciting at first and then it began to fall into a routine and became habitual and as it became habitual he found that old sense of detachment and futility was creeping back again one day he realized that indeed the whole flood and tumult of the war would be going on almost exactly as it was going on now if there had been neither cathedral nor bishop in princhester it came to him that if archbishops were rolled into patriarchs and patriarchs into archbishops it would matter scarcely more in the world process that was afoot than if two men shook hands while their house was afire at times all of us have inappropriate thoughts the unfortunate thought that struck the bishop as a bullet might strike a man in an exposed trench as he was hurrying through the cloisters to a special service and address upon that doubly glorious day in our english history the day of st crispin was of diogenes rolling his tub  it was a poisonous thought  it arose perhaps out of an article in a weekly paper at which he had glanced after lunch an article written by one of those sceptical spirits who find all too abundant expression in our periodical literature the writer boldly charged the christian churches with absolute ineffectiveness this war he declared was above all other wars a war of ideas of material organization against rational freedom of violence against law it was a war more copiously discussed than any war had ever been before the air was thick with apologetics and what was the voice of the church amidst these elemental issues bishops and divines who were patriots one heard discordantly enough but where were the bishops and divines who spoke for the prince of peace where was the blessing of the church where was the veto of the church when it came to that one discovered only a broad preoccupied back busied in supplementing the army medical corps with red cross activities good work in its wayexcept that the canonicals seemed superfluous who indeed looked to the church for any voice at all and so to diogenes  the bishops mind went hunting for an answer to that indictment and came back and came back to the image of diogenes  it was with that image dangling like a barbed arrow from his mind that the bishop went into the pulpit to preach upon st crispins day and looked down upon a thin and scattered congregation in which the elderly the childless and the unoccupied predominated  that night insomnia resumed its sway  of course the church ought to be controlling this great storm the greatest storm of war that had ever stirred mankind it ought to be standing fearlessly between the combatants like a figure in a wall painting with the cross of christ uplifted and the restored memory of christendom softening the eyes of the armed nations put down those weapons and listen to me so the church should speak in irresistible tones in a voice of silver trumpets  instead it kept a long way from the fighting tucked up its vestments and was rolling its local tubs quite briskly  7   and then came the aggravation of all these distresses by an abrupt abandonment of smoking and alcohol alcoholic relaxation a necessary mitigation of the unreality of peacetime politics becomes a grave danger in war and it was with an understandable desire to forward the interests of his realm that the king decided to set his statesmen an examplewhich unhappily was not very widely followedby abstaining from alcohol during the continuance of the struggle it did however swing over the bishop of princhester to an immediate and complete abandonment of both drink and tobacco at that time he was finding comfort for his nerves in manila cheroots and a particularly big and heavy type of egyptian cigarette with a considerable amount of opium and his disorganized system seized upon this sudden change as a grievance and set all his jangling being crying aloud for one cigarettejust one cigarette  the cheroots it seemed he could better spare but a cigarette became his symbol for his lost steadiness and ease  it brought him low  the reader has already been told the lamentable incident of the stolen cigarette and the small boy and how the bishop tormented by that shameful memory cried aloud in the night  the bishop rolled his tub and is there any tubrolling in the world more busy and exacting than a bishops he rolled in it spite of illhealth and insomnia and all the while he was tormented by the enormous background of the world war by his ineffective realization of vast national needs by his passionate desire for himself and his church not to be ineffective  the distressful alternation between nights of lucid doubt and days of dull acquiescence was resumed with an intensification of its contrasts the brief phase of hope that followed the turn of the fighting upon the maine the hope that after all the war would end swiftly dramatically and justly and everything be as it had been beforebut pleasanter gave place to a phase that bordered upon despair the fall of antwerp and the doubts and uncertainties of the flanders situation weighed terribly upon the bishop he was haunted for a time by nightmares of zeppelins presently raining fire upon london these visions became apocalyptic the zeppelins came to england with the new year and with the close of the year came the struggle for ypres that was so near to being a collapse of the allied defensive the events of the early spring the bloody failure of british generalship at neuve chapelle the naval disaster in the dardanelles the sinking of the falaba the russian defeat in the masurian lakes all deepened the bishops impression of the immensity of the nations difficulties and of his own unhelpfulness he was ashamed that the church should hold back its curates from enlistment while the french priests were wearing their uniforms in the trenches the expedition of the bishop of london to hold openair services at the front seemed merely to accentuate the tubrolling it was rolling the tub just where it was most in the way  what was wrong what was wanting  the westminster gazette the spectator and several other of the most trusted organs of public opinion were intermittently discussing the same question their discussions implied at once the extreme need that was felt for religion by all sorts of representative people and the universal conviction that the church was in some way muddling and masking her revelation what is wrong with the churches was for example the general heading of the westminster gazettes correspondence  one day the bishop skimmed a brief incisive utterance by sir harry johnston that pierced to the marrow of his own shrinking convictions sir harry is one of those people who seem to write as well as speak in a quick tenor instead of propounding plainly and without the acereted mythology of asia minor greece and rome the pure gospel of christ they present it overloaded with unbelievable myths such as among a thousand others that massacre of the innocents which never took place bore their listeners by a tibetan repetition of creeds that have ceased to be credible mutually contradictory propositions prayers and litanies composed in byzantine and mediaeval times the want of actuality the curious silliness which has ever since the destruction of jerusalem hung about the exposition of christianity but if the bishops continue to fuss about the trappings of religion the maintenance of codes compiled by people who lived sixteen hundred or two thousand five hundred years ago the increasingly educated and practicalminded working classes will not come to church weekday or sunday  the bishop held the paper in his hand and with a mind that he felt to be terribly open asked himself how true that sharp indictment might be and granting its general truth what was the duty of the church that is to say of the bishops for as cyprian says ecelesia est in episcopo we say the creeds how far may we unsay them  so far he had taken no open action against chasters suppose now he were to side with chasters and let the whole diocese the church of princhester drift as far as it chose under his inaction towards an extreme modernism risking a conflict with and if necessary fighting the archbishop it was but for a moment that his mind swung to this possibility and then recoiled the laymen that band of bigots would fight he could not contemplate litigation and wrangling about the teaching of the church besides what were the trappings of religion and what the essentials what after all was the pure gospel of christ of which this writer wrote so glibly he put the paper down and took a new testament from his desk and opened it haphazard he felt a curious wish that he could read it for the first time it was overfamiliar everything latterly in his theology and beliefs had become overfamiliar it had all become mechanical and dead and unmeaning to his tired mind  whippham came with a reminder of more tubrolling and the bishops speculations were broken off     chapter the fourth  the sympathy of lady sunderbund  1   that night when he cried aloud at the memory of his furtive cigarette the bishop was staying with a rich man named garstein fellows these garstein fellows people were steel people with a financial side to them young garstein fellows had his fingers in various chemical businesses and the real life of the firm was in various minor partners called hartstein and blumenhart and so forth who had acquired a considerable amount of ungentlemanly science and energy in germany and german switzerland but the fellows element was good old princhester stuff there had been a fellows firm in princhester in 1819 they were not people the bishop liked and it was not a house the bishop liked staying at but it had become part of his policy to visit and keep in touch with as many of the local plutocracy as he could to give and take with them in order to make the presence of the church a reality to them it had been not least among the negligences and evasions of the sainted but indolent hood that he had invariably refused overnight hospitality whenever it was possible for him to get back to his home the morning was his working time his books and hymns had profited at the cost of missing many a generous afterdinner subscription and at the expense of social unity from the outset scrope had set himself to alter this a certain lack of enthusiasm on lady ellas part had merely provoked him to greater effort on his own his ideal of what was needed with the people was something rather jolly and familiar something like a very good and successful french or irish priest something that came easily and readily into their homes and laid a friendly hand on their shoulders the less he liked these rich people naturally the more familiar his resolution to be successfully intimate made him he put down the names and brief characteristics of their sons and daughters in a little notebook and consulted it before every visit so as to get his most casual enquiries right and he invited himself to the garstein fellows house on this occasion by telegram   a special mission and some business in wombash may i have a scrap of supper and a bed   now mrs garstein fellows was a thoroughly london woman she was one of the banking grunenbaums the fair tall sort and she had a very decided tendency to smartness she had a little party in the house a sort of long weekend party that made her hesitate for a minute or so before she framed a reply to the bishops request   it was the intention of mrs garstein fellows to succeed very conspicuously in the british world and the british world she felt was a complicated one it is really not one world but several and if you would surely succeed you must keep your peace with all the systems and be a source of satisfaction to all of them so at least mrs garstein fellows saw it and her method was to classify her acquaintances according to their systems to keep them in their proper bundles and to give every one the treatment he or she was accustomed to receive and since all things british are now changing and passing away it may not be uninteresting to record the classification mrs garstein fellows adopted first she set apart as most precious and desirable and requiring the most careful treatment the court dowdies for so it was that the dignity and quiet good taste that radiated from buckingham palace impressed her restless shallow mindthe sort of people who prefer pair horse carriages to automobiles have quiet friendships in the highest quarters quietly do not know any one else busy themselves with charities dress richly rather than impressively and have either little watercolour accomplishments or none at all and no other relations with art at the skirts of this crowning british world mrs garstein fellows tugged industriously and expensively she did not keep a carriage and pair and an old family coachman because that she felt would be considered pushing and presumptuous she had the sense to stick to her common unpretending 80 hp daimler but she wore a special sort of blackish hatbonnet for such occasions as brought her near the centre of honour which she got from a little good shop known only to very few outside the inner ring which hatbonnet she was always careful to sit on for a few minutes before wearing and it was to this first and highest and best section of her social scheme that she considered that bishops properly belonged but some bishops and in particular such a comparatively bright bishop as the bishop of princhester she also thought of as being just as comfortably accommodated in her second system the serious liberal lot which was more fatiguing and less boring which talked of books and things visited the bells went to all firstnights when granville barker was the producer and knew and valued people in the grey and earnest plains between the cecils and the sidney webbs and thirdly there were the smart intellectual lot again not very well marked off and on the whole practicable to bishops of whom fewer particulars are needed because theirs is a perennial species and then finally there was that fourth world which was paradoxically at once very brilliant and a little shady which had its night club side and seemed to set no limit to its eccentricities it seemed at times to be aiming to shock and yet it had its standards but here it was that the dancers and actresses and forgiven divorcees came inand the bishops as a rule a rule hitherto always respected didnt this was the ultimate world of mrs garstein fellows she had no use for merely sporting people and the merely correct smart and the duller county families sets that led nowhere and it was from her fourth system of the glittering doubtfuls that this party which made her hesitate over the bishops telegram was derived  she ran over their names as she sat considering her reply  what was there for a bishop to object to there was that admirable american widow lady sunderbund she was enormously rich she was enthusiastic she was really on probation for higher levels it was her decolletage delayed her if only she kept off theosophy and the keltic renascence and her disposition to profess wild intellectual passions there would be no harm in her provided she didnt come down to dinner in anything too fantastically scantybut a word in season was possible no there was no harm in lady sunderbund then there were ridgeway kelso and this dark excitable catholic friend of his paidraig ogorman mrs garstein fellows saw no harm in them then one had to consider lord gatling and lizzie barusetter but nothing showed nothing was likely to show even if there was anything and besides wasnt there a church and stage guild  except for those people there seemed little reason for alarm mrs garstein fellows did not know that professor hoppart who so amusingly combined a professorship of political economy with the writing of musichall lyrics was a keen amateur theologian nor that bent the sentimental novelist had a similar passion she did not know that her own eldest son a dark romanticlooking youngster from eton had also come to the theological stage of development she did however weigh the possibilities of too liberal opinions on what are called social questions on the part of miss sharsper the novelist and decided that if that lady was watched nothing so terrible could be said even in an undertone and as for the mariposa the dancer she had nothing but spanish and bad french she looked all right and it wasnt very likely she would go out of her way to startle an anglican bishop simply she neednt dance besides which even if a man does get a glimpse of a little somethingit isnt as if it was a woman  but of course if the party mustnt annoy the bishop the bishop must do his duty by the party there must be the usual purple and the silver buckles  she wired back   a little party but it wont put you out send your man with your change  2   in making that promise mrs garstein fellows reckoned without the morbid sensibility of the bishops disorganized nervous system and the unsuspected theological stirrings beneath the apparent worldliness of hoppart and bent  the trouble began in the drawingroom after dinner out of deference to the bishops abstinence the men did not remain to smoke but came in to find the mariposa and lady sunderbund smoking cigarettes which these ladies continued to do a little defiantly they had hoped to finish them before the bishop came up the night was chilly and a cheerful wood fire cracking and banging on the fireplace emphasized the ordinary heating mrs garstein fellows who had not expected so prompt an appearance of the men had arranged her chairs in a semicircle for a little womanly gossip and before she could intervene she found her party with the exception of lord gatling who had drifted just a little too noticeably with miss barnsetter into a window sitting round with a conscious air that was perhaps just a trifle too apparent of being good  and mr bent plunged boldly into general conversation  are you reading anything now mrs garstein fellows he asked im an interested party  she was standing at the side of the fireplace she bit her lip and looked at the cornice and meditated with a girlish expression yes she said i am reading again i didnt think i should but i am  for a time said hoppart i read nothing but the papers i bought from a dozen to twenty a day  that is wearing off said the bishop  the first thing i began to read again said mrs garstein fellows im not saying it for your sake bishopwas the bible  i went to the bible said bent as if he was surprised  ive heard that before said ridgeway kelso in that slightly explosive manner of his all sorts of people who dont usually read the bible  but mr kelso protested their hostess with raised eyebrows  i was thinking of bent but anyhow theres been a great wave of seriousness a sudden turning to religion and religious things i dont know if it comes your way bishop  ive had no rows of penitents yet  we may be coming said hoppart  he turned sideways to face the bishop i think we should be coming ifif it wasnt for old entangled difficulties i dont know if you will mind my saying it to you but  the bishop returned his frank glance id like to know above all things he said if mrs garstein fellow will permit us its my business to know  we all want to know said lady sunderbund speaking from the low chair on the other side of the fireplace there was a vibration in her voice and a sudden gleam of enthusiasm in her face why shouldnt people talk seiously sometimes  well take my own case said hoppart in the last few weeks ive been reading not only in the bible but in the fathers ive read most of athanasius most of eusebius andill confess itgibbon i find all my old wonder come back why are we pinned toto the amount of creed we are pinned to why for instance must you insist on the trinity  yes said the eton boy explosively and flushed darkly to find he had spoken  here is a time when men ask for god said hoppart and you give them three cried bent rather cheaply i confess i find the way encumbered by these alexandrian elaborations hoppart completed  need it be whispered lady sunderbund very softly  well said the bishop and leant back in his armchair and knitted his brow at the fire i do not think he said that men coming to god think very much of the nature of god nevertheless he spoke slowly and patted the arm of his chair nevertheless the church insists that certain vitally important truths have to be conveyed certain mortal errors are best guarded against by these symbols  you admit they are symbols  so the church has always called them  hoppart showed by a little movement and grimace that he thought the bishop quibbled  in every sense of the word the bishop hastened to explain the creeds are symbolical it is clear they seek to express ineffable things by at least an extended use of familiar words i suppose we are all agreed nowadays that when we speak of the father and of the son we mean something only in a very remote and exalted way parallel withwith biological fatherhood and sonship  lady sunderbund nodded eagerly yes she said oh yes and held up an expectant face for more  our utmost words our most elaborately phrased creeds can at the best be no better than the shadow of something unseen thrown upon the screen of experience  he raised his rather weary eyes to hoppart as if he would know what else needed explanation he was gratified by lady sunderbunds approval but he affected not to see or hear it but it was bent who spoke  he spoke in the most casual way he made the thing seem the most incidental of observations  what puzzles me he said is why the early christians identified the spermaticos logos of the stoics with the second and not with the third person of the trinity  to which the bishop rising artlessly to the bait replied ah that indeed is the unfortunate aspect of the whole affair  and then the irish catholic came down on him  3   how the bishop awakened in the night after this dispute has been told already in the opening section of this story to that night of discomfort we now return after this comprehensive digression he awoke from nightmares of eyes and triangles to bottomless remorse and perplexity for the first time he fully measured the vast distances he had travelled from the beliefs and attitudes of his early training since his coming to princhester travelledor rather slipped and fallen down the long slopes of doubt  that clear inky dimness that comes before dawn found his white face at the window looking out upon the great terrace and the park  4   after a bout of mental distress and sleeplessness the bishop would sometimes wake in the morning not so much exhausted as in a state of thin mental and bodily activity this was more particularly so if the night had produced anything in the nature of a purpose so it was on this occasion the day was clear before him at least it could be cleared by sending three telegrams his man could go back to princhester and so leave him perfectly free to go to brightonpomfrey in london and secure that friendly dispensation to smoke again which seemed the only alternative to a serious mental breakdown he would take his bag stay the night in london smoke sleep well and return the next morning dunk his valetbutler found him already bathed and ready for a cup of tea and a bradshaw at halfpast seven he went on dressing although the good train for london did not start until 1045  mrs garstein fellows was by nature and principle a late riser the breakfastroom showed small promise yet of the repast though the table was set and bright with silver and fresh flowers and a wood fire popped and spurted to greet and encourage the march sunshine but standing in the doorway that led to the promise and daffodils and crocuses of mrs garstein fellows garden stood lady sunderbund almost with an effect of waiting and she greeted the bishop very cheerfully doubted the immediate appearance of any one else and led him in the most natural manner into the new but already very pleasant shrubbery  in some indefinable special way the bishop had been aware of lady sunderbunds presence since first he had met her but it was only now that he could observe her with any particularity she was tall like his own lady ella but not calm and quiet she was electric her eyes her smiles her complexion had as it were an established brightness that exceeded the common lustre of things this morning she was dressed in grey that was nevertheless not grey but had an effect of colour and there was a thread of black along the lines of her body and a gleam of gold she carried her head back with less dignity than pride there was a little frozen movement in her dark hair as if it flamed up out of her head there were silver ornaments in her hair she spoke with a pretty little weakness of the rs that had probably been acquired abroad and she lost no time in telling him she was eager to tell him that she had been waylaying him i did so want to talk to you some maw she said i was shy last night and they we all so noisy and eaga i payed that you might come down early  its an oppotunity ive longed for she said  she did her very pretty best to convey what it was had been troubling her iligion bad been worrying her for years life wasohjust ornaments and games and so weaisome so weaisome unless it was iligious and she couldnt get it iligious  the bishop nodded his head gravely  you undestand she pressed  i understand too wellthe attempt to get holdand keep hold  i knew you would she cried  she went on with an impulsive rapidity othodoxy had always ipelled heralways she had felt herself confronted by the most insurmountable difficulties and yet whenever she had gone away from christianityshe had gone away from christianity to the theosophists and the christian scientistsshe had felt she was only staying futha and then suddenly when he was speaking last night she had felt he knew it was so wonderful to hear the keed was only a symbol  symbol is the proper name for it said the bishop it wasnt for centuries it was called the creed  yes and so what it really meant was something quite different from what it did mean  the bishop felt that this sentence also was only a symbol and nodded encouraginglybut gravely warily  and there she was and the point was there were thousands and thousands and thousands of educated people like her who were dying to get through these oldfashioned symbols to the true faith that lay behind them that they knew lay behind them she didnt know if he had read the light under the altar  hes vicar of wombashin my diocese said the bishop with restraint  its wondeful stuff said lady sunderbund its spitually cold but its intellectually wondeful but we want that with spituality we want it so badly if some one  she became daring she bit her under lip and flashed her spirit at him  if you she said and paused  could think aloud said the bishop  yes she said nodding rapidly and became breathless to hear  it would certainly be an astonishing end to the chasters difficulty if the bishop went over to the heretic the bishop reflected  my dear lady i wont disguise he began in fact i dont see how i could that for some years i have been growing more and more discontented with some of our most fundamental formulae but its been very largely a shapeless discontenthitherto i dont think ive said a word to a single soul no not a word you are the first person to whom ive ever made the admission that even my feelings are at times unorthodox  she lit up marvellously at his words go on she whispered  but she did not need to tell him to go on now that he had once broached the casket of his reserves he was only too glad of a listener he talked as if they were intimate and loving friends and so it seemed to both of them they were it was a wonderful release from a long and painful solitude  to certain types it is never quite clear what has happened to them until they tell it so that now the bishop punctuated very prettily by lady sunderbund began to measure for the first time the extent of his departure from the old innate convictions of otteringham rectory he said that it was strange to find doubt coming so late in life but perhaps it was only in recent years that his faith had been put to any really severe tests it had been sheltered and unchallenged  this fearful wa lady sunderbund interjected  but princhester had been a critical and trying change and the light under the altar case had ploughed him deeply it was curious that his doubts always seemed to have a double strand there was a moral objection based on the churchs practical futility and an intellectual strand subordinated to this which traced that futility largely to its unconvincing formulae  and yet you know said the bishop i find i cant go with chasters he beats at the church he treats her as though she were wrong i feel like a son growing up who finds his mother isnt quite so clearspoken nor quite so energetic as she seemed to be once shes right i feel sure ive never doubted her fundamental goodness  yes said lady sunderbund very eagerly yes  and yet theres this futility you know my dear lady i dont know what to do one feels on the one hand that here is a cloud of witnesses great men sainted men subtle men figures permanently historical before whom one can do nothing but bow down in the utmost humility here is a great instrument and organizationwhat would the world be without the witness of the churchand on the other hand here are our masses out of hand and hostile our industrial leaders equally hostile there is a failure to grip and that failure to grip is so clearly traceable to the fact that our ideas are not modern ideas that when we come to profess our faith we find nothing in our mouths but antiquated alexandrian subtleties and phrases and ideas that may have been quite alive quite significant quite adequate in asia minor or egypt among men essentially orientals fifteen hundred years ago but which now  he expressed just what they came to now by a gesture  she echoed his gesture  probably im not alone among my brethren he went on and then but what is one to do  with her hands she acted her sense of his difficulty  one may be precipitate he said theres a kind of loyalty and discipline that requires one to keep the ranks until ones course of action is perfectly clear one owes so much to so many one has to consider how one may affectoh people one has never seen  he was lugging things now into speech that so far had been scarcely above the threshold of his conscious thought he went on to discuss the entire position of the disbelieving cleric he discovered a fine point  if there was something else an alternative another religion another church to which one could go the whole case would be different but to go from the church to nothingness isnt to go from falsehood to truth its to go from truth rather badly expressed rather conservatively hidden by its protections truth in an antiquated costume to the blackest liein the world  she took that point very brightly  one must hold fast to iligion she said and looked earnestly at him and gripped fiercely pink thumbs out with her beautiful hands held up  that was it exactly he too was gripping but while on the outside the midianites of denial were prowling for these clinging souls within the camp they were assailed by a meticulous orthodoxy that was only too eager to cast them forth the bishop dwelt for a time upon the curious fierceness orthodoxy would sometimes display nowadays atheism can be civil can be generous it is orthodoxy that trails a scurrilous fringe  who was that young man with a strong irish accentwho contradicted me so suddenly he asked  the dark young man  the noisy young man  that was mist patick ogoman he is a kelt and all that spells patick with eva so many letters you know they say he spends ouas and ouas leaning ese he woies about it they all ty to lean ese and it woies them and makes them hate england moa and moa  he is orthodox heis what i call orthodox to the ridiculous extent  idiculous  a deeptoned gong proclaimed breakfast over a square mile or so of territory and lady sunderbund turned about mechanically towards the house but they continued their discussion  she started indeed a new topic shall we eva do ou think have a new iligiontua and betta  that was a revolutionary idea to him  he was still fending it off from him when a gap in the shrubs brought them within sight of the house and of mrs garstein fellows on the portico waving a handkerchief and crying breakfast  i wish we could talk for houas said lady sunderbund  ive been glad of this talk said the bishop very glad  she lifted her soft abundant skirts and trotted briskly across the still dewy lawn towards the house door the bishop followed gravely and slowly with his hands behind his back and an unusually peaceful expression upon his face he was thinking how rare and precious a thing it is to find intelligent friendship in women more particularly when they were dazzlingly charming and pretty it was strange but this was really his first woman friend if as he hoped she became his friend  lady sunderbund entered the breakfast room in a gusty abundance like botticellis primavera and kissed mrs garstein fellows goodmorning she exhaled a glowing happiness he is wondyful she panted he is most wondyful  mr hidgeway kelso  no the dee bishop i love him are those the little sausages i like may i take thee ive been up houas  the dee bishop appeared in the sunlit doorway  5   the bishop felt more contentment in the london train than he had felt for many weeks he had taken two decisive and relieving steps one was that he had stated his case to another human being and that a very charming and sympathetic human being he was no longer a prey to a current of secret and concealed thoughts running counter to all the appearances of his outward life and the other was that he was now within an hour or so of brightonpomfrey and a cigarette he would lunch on the train get to london about two take a taxi at once to the wise old doctor catch him over his coffee in a charitable and understanding mood and perhaps be smoking a cigarette publicly and honourably and altogether satisfyingly before three  so far as brightonpomfreys door this program was fulfilled without a hitch the day was fine and he had his taxi opened and noted with a patriotic satisfaction as he rattled through the streets the glare of the recruiting posters on every vacant piece of wall and the increasing number of men in khaki in the streets but at the door he had a disappointment dr brightonpomfrey was away at the frontof all places he had gone for some weeks would the bishop like to see dr dale  the bishop hesitated he had never set eyes on this dr dale  indeed he had never heard of dr dale  seeing his old friend brightonpomfrey and being gently and tactfully told to do exactly what he was longing to do was one thing facing some strange doctor and going slowly and elaborately through the whole story of his illness his vow and his breakdown and perhaps having his reaction time tested and all sorts of stripping and soundings done was quite another he was within an ace of turning away  if he had turned away his whole subsequent life would have been different it was the very slightest thing in the world tipped the beam it was the thought that after all whatever inconvenience and unpleasantness there might be in this interview there was at the end of it a very reasonable prospect of a restored and legitimate cigarette     chapter the fifth  the first vision  1   dr dale exceeded the bishops worst apprehensions he was a lean lank dark young man with long black hair and irregular rather prolonged features his chin was right over to the left he looked constantly at the bishops face with a distinctly sceptical grey eye he could not have looked harder if he had been a photographer or a portrait painter and his voice was harsh and the bishop was particularly sensitive to voices  he began by understanding far too much of the bishops illness and he insisted on various familiarities with the bishops heart and tongue and eye and knee that ruffled the bishops soul  brightonpomfrey talked of neurasthenia he asked that was his diagnosis said the bishop neurasthenia said the young man as though he despised the word  the bishop went on buttoning up his coat  you dont of course want to break your vows about drinking and smoking said the young man with the very faintest suggestion of derision in his voice  not if it can possibly be avoided the bishop asserted without a loss that is of practical efficiency he added for i have much to do  i think that it is possible to keep your vow said the young man and the bishop could have sworn at him i think we can manage that all right  2   the bishop sat at the table resting his arm upon it and awaiting the next development of this unsatisfactory interview he was on the verge of asking as unpleasantly as possible when brightonpomfrey would return  the young man stood upon brightonpomfreys hearthrug and was evidently contemplating dissertations  of course he said as though he discussed a problem with himself you must have some sort of comfort you must get out of this state one way or another  the bishop nodded assent he had faint hopes of this young mans ideas of comfort  dr dale reflected then he went off away from the question of comfort altogether you see the trouble in such a case as this is peculiarly difficult to trace to its sources because it comes just upon the borderline of bodily and mental things you may take a drug or alter your regimen and it disturbs your thoughts you may take an idea and it disturbs your health it is easy enough to say as some do that all ideas have a physical substratum it is almost as easy to say with the christian scientist that all bodily states are amenable to our ideas the truth doesnt i think follow the border between those opposite opinions very exactly on either side i cant for instance tell you to go home and pray against these uncertainties and despairs because it is just these uncertainties and despairs that rob you of the power of efficient prayer  he did not seem to expect anything from the bishop  i dont see that because a case brings one suddenly right up against the frontier of metaphysics why a doctor should necessarily pull up short at that why one shouldnt go on into either metaphysics or psychology if such an extension is necessary for the understanding of the case at any rate if youll permit it in this consultation  go on said the bishop holding on to that promise of comfort the best thing is to thrash out the case in your own way and then come to what is practical  what is really the matter herethe matter with you that isis a disorganization of your tests of reality its one of a group of states hitherto confused neurasthenia that comprehensive phrasewell it is one of the neurasthenias here i confess i begin to talk of work i am doing work still to be published finished first and then published but i go off from the idea that every living being lives in a state not differing essentially from a state of hallucination concerning the things about it truth essential truth is hidden always of course there must be a measure of truth in our working illusions a working measure of truth or the creature would smash itself up and end itself but beyond that discretion of the fire and the pitfall lies a wide margin of error about which we may be deceived for years so long as it doesnt matter it doesnt matter i dont know if i make myself clear  i follow you said the bishop a little wearily i follow you phenomena and noumena and so on and so on kant and so forth pragmatism yes  with a sigh  and all that completed dr dale in a voice that suggested mockery but you see we grow into a way of life we settle down among habits and conventions we say this is all right and that is always so we get more and more settled into our life as a whole and more and more confident unless something happens to shake us out of our sphere of illusion that may be some violent contradictory fact some accident or it may be some subtle change in ones health and nerves that makes us feel doubtful or a change of habits or as i believe some subtle quickening of the critical faculty then suddenly comes the feeling as though we were lost in a strange world as though we had never really seen the world before  he paused  the bishop was reluctantly interested that does describe somethingof the mental side he admitted i never believe in concealing my own thoughts from an intelligent patient said dr dale with a quiet offensiveness that sort of thing belongs to the dark ages of the pothecarys art i will tell you exactly my guesses and suppositions about you at the base of it all is a slight and subtle kidney trouble due i suggest to your going to princhester and drinking the local water  but its excellent water they boast of it  by all the established tests as a matter of fact many of our best drinking waters have all sorts of unspecified qualities burton water for example is radioactive by beethams standards up to the ninth degree but that is by the way my theory about your case is that this produced a change in your blood that quickened your sensibilities and your critical faculties just at a time when a good many bothersi dont of course know what they were but i can so to speak see the marks all over youcame into your life  the bishop nodded  you were uprooted you moved from house to house and failed to get that curled up safe feeling one has in a real home in any of them  if you saw the fireplaces and the general decoration of the new palace admitted the bishop i had practically no control  that confirms me said dr dale insomnia followed and increased the feeling of physical strangeness by increasing the bodily disturbance i suspect an intellectual disturbance  he paused  there was said the bishop  you were no longer at home anywhere you were no longer at home in your diocese in your palace in your body in your convictions and then came the war quite apart from everything else the mind of the whole world is suffering profoundly from the shock of this warmuch more than is generally admitted one thing you did that you probably did not observe yourself doing you drank rather more at your meals you smoked a lot more that was your natural and proper response to the shock  ah said the bishop and brightened up  it was remarked by tolstoy i think that few intellectual men would really tolerate the world as it is if it were not for smoking and drinking even novelists have their moments of lucidity certainly these things soothe the restlessness in mens minds deaden their sceptical sensibilities and just at the time when you were getting most dislodgedyou gave them up  and the sooner i go back to them the better said the bishop brightly i quite see that  i wouldnt say that said dr dale  3   that said dr dale is just where my treatment of this case differs from the treatment of he spoke the name reluctantly as if he disliked the mere sound of itdr brightonpomfrey  hitherto of course said the bishop ive been in his hands  he said dr dale would certainly set about trying to restore your old sphere of illusion your old familiar sensations and ideas and confidences he would in fact turn you back he would restore all your habits he would order you a rest he would send you off to some holiday resort fresh in fact but familiar in character the high lands north italy or switzerland for example he would forbid you newspapers and order you to botanize and prescribe tranquillizing reading trollopes novels the life of gladstone the works of mr a c benson memoirs and so on youd go somewhere where there was a good anglican chaplain and youd take some of the services yourself and wed wash out the effects of the princhester water with contrexeville and afterwards put you on salutaris or perrier i dont know whether i shouldnt have inclined to some such treatment before the war began only  he paused  you think  dr dales face betrayed a sudden sombre passion it wont do now he said in a voice of quiet intensity it wont do now  he remained darkly silent for so long that at last the bishop spoke then what he asked do you suggest  suppose we dont try to go back said dr dale suppose we go on and go through  where  to reality  i know its doubtful i know its dangerous he went on but i am convinced that now we can no longer keep mens minds and souls in these feathered nests these spheres of illusion behind these veils there is either god or the darkness why should we not go on  the bishop was profoundly perplexed he heard himself speaking it would be unworthy of my cloth he was saying  dr dale completed the sentence to go back  let me explain a little more he said what i mean by going on i think that this loosening of the ties of association that bind a man to his everyday life and his everyday self is in nine cases out of ten a loosening of the ties that bind him to everyday sanity one common form of this detachment is the form you have in those cases of people who are found wandering unaware of their names unaware of their places of residence lost altogether from themselves they have not only lost their sense of identity with themselves but all the circumstances of their lives have faded out of their minds like an idle story in a book that has been read and put aside i have looked into hundreds of such cases i dont think that loss of identity is a necessary thing its just another side of the general weakening of the grip upon reality a kind of anaemia of the brain so that interest fades and fails there is no reason why you should forget a story because you do not believe itif your brain is strong enough to hold it but if your brain is tired and weak then so soon as you lose faith in your records your mind is glad to let them go when you see these lost identity people that is always your first impression a tired brain that has let go  the bishop felt extremely like letting go  but how does this apply to my case  i come to that said dr dale holding up a long large hand what if we treat this case of yours in a new way what if we give you not narcotics but stimulants and tonics what if we so touch the blood that we increase your sense of physical detachment while at the same time feeding up your senses to a new and more vivid apprehension of things about you he looked at his patients hesitation and added youd lose all that craving feeling that you fancy at present is just the need of a smoke the world might grow a trifletransparent but youd keep real instead of drugging oneself back to the old contentment  youd drug me on to the new said the bishop  but just one word more said dr dale hear why i would do this it was easy and successful to rest and drug people back to their old states of mind when the world wasnt changing wasnt spinning round in the wildest tornado of change that it has ever been in but nowwhere can i send you for a rest where can i send you to get you out of sight and hearing of the catastrophe of course old brightonpomfrey would go on sending people away for rest and a nice little soothing change if the day of judgment was coming in the sky and the earth was opening and the sea was giving up its dead hed send em to the seaside such things as that wouldnt shake his faith in the channel crossing my idea is that its not only right for you to go through with this but that its the only thing to do if you go right on and right through with these doubts and intimations  he paused  you may die like a madman he said but you wont die like a tame rabbit  4   the bishop sat reflecting what fascinated and attracted him was the ending of all the cravings and uneasinesses and restlessness that had distressed his life for over four years what deterred him was the personality of this gaunt young man with his long grey face his excited manner his shock of black hair he wanted that tonicwith grave misgivings if you think this tonic is the wiser course he began id give it you if you were my father said dr dale ive got everything for it he added  you mean you can make it upwithout a prescription  i cant give you a prescription the essence of itits a distillate i have been trying it isnt in the pharmacopeia  again the bishop had a twinge of misgiving  but in the end he succumbed he didnt want to take the stuff but also he did not want to go without his promised comfort  presently dale had given him a little phialand was holding up to the window a small medicine glass into which he was pouring very carefully twenty drops of the precious fluid take it only he said when you feel you must  it is the most golden of liquids said the bishop peering at it  when you want more i will make you more later of course it will be possible to write a prescription now add the waterso  it becomes opalescent how beautifully the light plays in it  take it  the bishop dismissed his last discretion and drank  well said dr dale  i am still here said the bishop smiling and feeling a joyous tingling throughout his body it stirs me  5   the bishop stood on the pavement outside dr brightonpomfreys house the massive door had closed behind him  it had been an act of courage of rashness if you will to take this draught he was acutely introspective ready for anything for the most disagreeable or the most bizarre sensations he was asking himself were his feet steady was his head swimming  his doubts glowed into assurance  suddenly he perceived that he was sure of god  not perhaps of the god of nicaea but what did these poor little quibblings and definitions of the theologians matter he had been worrying about these definitions and quibblings for four long restless years now they were just failures to expresswhat surely every one knewand no one would ever express exactly because here was god and the kingdom of god was manifestly at hand the visible world hung before him as a mist might hang before the rising sun he stood proudly and masterfully facing a universe that had heretofore bullied him into doubt and apologetics a universe that had hitherto been opaque and was now betrayed translucent  that was the first effect of the new tonic complete reassurance complete courage he turned to walk towards mount street and berkeley square as a sultan might turn to walk among his slaves  but the tonic was only beginning  before he had gone a dozen steps he was aware that he seemed more solid and larger than the people about him they had all a curious miniature effect as though he was looking at them through the wrong end of an opera glass the houses on either side of the street and the traffic shared this quality in an equal measure it was as if he was looking at the world through apertures in a miniature cinematograph peepshow this surprised him and a little dashed his first glow of satisfaction  he passed a man in khaki who he fancied looked at him with an odd expression he observed the next passersby narrowly and suspiciously a couple of smartish young men a lady with a poodle a grocers boy with a basket but none seemed to observe anything remarkable about him then he caught the eye of a taxidriver and became doubtful again  he had a feeling that this tonic was still coming in like a tide it seemed to be filling him and distending him in spite of the fact that he was already full after four years of flaccidity it was pleasant to be distended again but already he felt more filled than he had ever been before at present nothing was showing but all his body seemed braced and uplifted he must be careful not to become inflated in his bearing  and yet it was difficult not to betray a little inflation he was so filled with assurance that things were right with him and that god was there with him after all it was not mere fancy he was looking through the peepholes of his eyes at the world of illusion and appearance the world that was so intent upon its immediate business so regardless of eternal things that had so dominated him but a little while ago was after all a thing more mortal than himself  another man in khaki passed him  for the first time he saw the war as something measurable as something with a beginning and an end as something less than the immortal spirit in man he had been too much oppressed by it he perceived all these people in the street were too much oppressed by it he wanted to tell them as much tell them that all was well with them bid them be of good cheer he wanted to bless them he found his arm floating up towards gestures of benediction selfcontrol became increasingly difficult  all the way down berkeley square the bishop was in fullbodied struggle with himself he was trying to control himself trying to keep within bounds he felt that he was stepping too high that his feet were not properly reaching the ground that he was walking upon cushions of air  the feeling of largeness increased and the feeling of transparency in things about him he avoided collision with passersbyexcessively and he felt his attention was being drawn more and more to something that was going on beyond the veil of visible things he was in piccadilly now but at the same time piccadilly was very small and he was walking in the presence of god  he had a feeling that god was there though he could not see him and at the same time he was in this transitory world with people going to and fro men with umbrellas tucked dangerously under their arms men in a hurry policemen young women rattling red cross collecting boxes smart people loafers they distracted one from god  he set out to cross the road just opposite princes and jumping needlessly to give way to an omnibus had the narrowest escape from a taxicab  he paused on the pavement edge to recover himself the shock of his near escape had as people say pulled him together  what was he to do manifestly this opalescent draught was overpowering him he ought never to have taken it he ought to have listened to the voice of his misgivings it was clear that he was not in a fit state to walk about the streets he waswhat had been dr dales termlosing his sense of reality what was he to do he was alarmed but not dismayed his thoughts were as fullbodied as the rest of his being they came throbbing and bumping into his mind what was he to do  brightonpomfrey ought never to have left his practice in the hands of this wildeyed experimenter  strange that after a lifetime of discretion and mens respect one should be standing on the piccadilly pavementintoxicated  it came into his head that he was not so very far from the athenaeum and surely there if anywhere a bishop may recover his sense of beingordinary  and behind everything behind the tall buildings and the swarming people there was still the sense of a wide illuminated space of a light of wonder and a presence but he must not give way to that again he had already given way altogether too much he repeated to himself in a whisper i am in piccadilly  if he kept tight hold upon himself he felt he might get to the athenaeum beforebefore anything more happened  he murmured directions to himself keep along the pavement turn to the right at the circus now down the hill easily down the hill dont float junior army and navy stores and the bookseller  and presently he had a doubt of his name and began to repeat it  edward princhester edward scrope lord bishop of princhester  and all the while voices within him were asserting you are in the kingdom of heaven you are in the presence of god place and time are a texture of illusion and dreamland even now you are with god  6   the porter of the athenaeum saw him come in looking wellflushed indeedbut queer in expression his blue eyes were wide open and unusually vague and blue  he wandered across towards the diningroom hesitated went to look at the news seemed in doubt whether he would not go into the smokingroom and then went very slowly upstairs past the golden angel up to the great drawingroom  in the drawingroom he found only sir james mounce the man who knew the novels of sir walter scott by heart and had the minutest and most unsparing knowledge of every detail in the life of that supreme giant of english literature he had even it was said acquired a scotch burr in the enthusiasm of his heroworship it was usually sufficient only to turn an ear towards him for him to talk for an hour or so he was now studying bradshaw  the bishop snatched at him desperately he felt that if he went away there would be no hold left upon the ordinary things of life  sir james he said i was wondering the other day when was the exact date of the earliest public ascription of waverley to scott  eh said sir james but id like to talk that over with ye indeed i would it would be depending very largely on what ye called public but  he explained something about an engagement in birmingham that night a train to catch reluctantly but relentlessly he abandoned the proffered ear but he promised that the next time they met in the club he would go into the matter exhausteevely  the door closed upon him the bishop was alone he was flooded with the light of the world that is beyond this world the things about him became very small and indistinct  he would take himself into a quiet corner in the library of this dolls house and sit his little body down in one of the miniature armchairs then if he was going to faint or if the trancelike feeling was to become altogether a trancewell a bishop asleep in an armchair in the library of the athenaeum is nothing to startle any one  he thought of that convenient hidden room the north library in which is the bust of croker there often one can be quite alone it was empty and he went across to the window that looks out upon pall mall and sat down in the little uncomfortable easy chair by the desk with its back to the benvenuto cellini  and as he sat down something snappedlike the snapping of a lute stringin his brain  7   with a sigh of deep relief the bishop realized that this world had vanished  he was in a golden light  he perceived it as a place but it was a place without buildings or trees or any very definite features there was a cloudy suggestion of distant hills and beneath his feet were little gemlike flowers and a feeling of divinity and infinite friendliness pervaded his being his impressions grew more definite his feet seemed to be bare he was no longer a bishop nor clad as a bishop that had gone with the rest of the world he was seated on a slab of starry rock  this he knew quite clearly was the place of god  he was unable to disentangle thoughts from words he seemed to be speaking in his mind  i have been very foolish and confused and perplexed i have been like a creature caught among thorns  you served the purpose of god among those thorns it seemed to him at first that the answer also was among his thoughts  i seemed so silly and so little my wits were clay  clay full of desires  such desires  blind desires that will presently come to the light  shall we come to the light  but here it is and you see it  8   it became clearer in the mind of the bishop that a figure sat beside him a figure of great strength and beauty with a smiling face and kindly eyes a strange thought and a strange courage came to the bishop  tell me he whispered are you god  i am the angel of god  the bishop thought over that for some moments  i want he said to know about god  i want he said with a deepening passion of the soul to know about god slowly through four long years i have been awakening to the need of god body and soul i am sick for the want of god and the knowledge of god i did not know what was the matter with me why my life had become so disordered and confused that my very appetites and habits are all astray but i am perishing for god as a waterless man upon a raft perishes for drink and there is nothing but madness if i touch the seas about me not only in my thoughts but in my under thoughts and in my nerves and bones and arteries i have need of god you see i grew up in the delusion that i knew god i did not know that i was unprovisioned and unprovided against the tests and strains and hardships of life i thought that i was secure and safe i was told that we menwho were apes not a quarter of a million years ago who still have hair upon our arms and apes teeth in our jawshad come to the full and perfect knowledge of god it was all put into a creed not a word of it was to be altered not a sentence was to be doubted any more they made me a teacher of this creed they seemed to explain it to me and when i came to look into it when my need came and i turned to my creed it was old and shrivelled up it was the patchedup speculations of vanished greeks and egyptians it was a mummy of ancient disputes old and dry that fell to dust as i unwrapped it and i was dressed up in the dress of old dead times and put before an altar of forgotten sacrifices and i went through ceremonies as old as the first seedtime and suddenly i knew clearly that god was not there god was not in my creed not in my cathedral not in my ceremonies nowhere in my life and at the same time i knew i knew as i had never known before that certainly there was god  he paused tell me said the friend at his side tell me  it was as if a child running beside its mother looked up and saw that he had never seen her face before that she was not his mother and that the words he had seemed to understand werenow that he listenedwords in an unknown tongue  you see i am but a common sort of man dear god i have neither lived nor thought in any way greatly i have gone from one day to the next day without looking very much farther than the end of the day i have gone on as life has befallen if no great trouble had come into my life so i should have lived to the end of my days but life which began for me easily and safely has become constantly more difficult and strange i could have held my services and given my benedictions i could have believed i believed in what i thought i believed but now i am lost and astraycrying out for god  9   let us talk a little about your troubles said the angel let us talk about god and this creed that worries you and this church of yours  i feel as though i had been struggling to this talk through all the yearssince my doubts began  the story your creed is trying to tell is much the same story that all religions try to tell in your heart there is god beyond the stars there is god is it the same god  i dont know said the bishop  does any one know  i thought i knew  your creed is full of levantine phrases and images full of the patched contradictions of the human intelligence utterly puzzled it is about those two gods the god beyond the stars and the god in your heart it says that they are the same god but different it says that they have existed together for all time and that one is the son of the other it has added a third personbut we wont go into that  the bishop was reminded suddenly of the dispute at mrs garstein fellows we wont go into that he agreed no  other religions have told the story in a different way the cathars and gnostics did they said that the god in your heart is a rebel against the god beyond the stars that the christ in your heart is like prometheusor hiawathaor any other of the sacrificial gods a rebel he arises out of man he rebels against that high god of the stars and crystals and poisons and monsters and of the dead emptiness of space the manicheans and the persians made out our god to be fighting eternally against that being of silence and darkness beyond the stars the buddhists made the lord buddha the leader of men out of the futility and confusion of material existence to the great peace beyond but it is all one story really the story of the two essential beings always the same story and the same perplexity cropping up under different names the story of one being who stirs us calls to us and leads us and of another who is above and outside and in and beneath all things inaccessible and incomprehensible all these religions are trying to tell something they do not clearly knowof a relationship between these two that eludes them that eludes the human mind as water escapes from the hand it is unity and opposition they have to declare at the same time it is agreement and propitiation it is infinity and effort  and the truth said the bishop in an eager whisper you can tell me the truth  the angels answer was a gross familiarity he thrust his hand through the bishops hair and ruffled it affectionately and rested for a moment holding the bishops cranium in his great palm  but can this hold it he said  not with this little box of brains said the angel you could as soon make a meal of the stars and pack them into your belly you havent the things to do it with inside this  he gave the bishops head a little shake and relinquished it  he began to argue as an elder brother might  isnt it enough for you to know something of the god that comes down to the human scale who has been born on your planet and arisen out of man who is man and god your leader hes more than enough to fill your mind and use up every faculty of your being he is courage he is adventure he is the king he fights for you and with you against death  and he is not infinite he is not the creator asked the bishop  so far as you are concerned no said the angel  so far as i am concerned  what have you to do with creation  and at that question it seemed that a great hand swept carelessly across the blackness of the farther sky and smeared it with stars and suns and shining nebulas as a brush might smear dry paint across a canvas  the bishop stared in front of him then slowly he bowed his head and covered his face with his hands  and i have been in orders he murmured i have been teaching people the only orthodox and perfect truth about these things for seven and twenty years  and suddenly he was back in his gaiters and his apron and his shovel hat a little black figure exceedingly small in a very great space  10   it was a very great space indeed because it was all space and the roof was the ebony of limitless space from which the stars swung flaming held by invisible ties and the soil beneath his feet was a dust of atoms and the little beginnings of life and long before the bishop bared his face again he knew that he was to see his god  he looked up slowly fearing to be dazzled  but he was not dazzled he knew that he saw only the likeness and bodying forth of a being inconceivable of one who is greater than the earth and stars and yet no greater than a man he saw a being for ever young for ever beginning for ever triumphant the quality and texture of this being was a warm and living light like the effulgence at sunrise he was hope and courage like a sunlit morning in spring he was adventure for ever and his courage and adventure flowed into and submerged and possessed the being of the man who beheld him and this presence of god stood over the bishop and seemed to speak to him in a wordless speech  he bade him surrender himself he bade him come out upon the adventure of life the great adventure of the earth that will make the atoms our bondslaves and subdue the stars that will build up the white fires of ecstasy to submerge pain for ever that will overcome death in him the spirit of creation had become incarnate had joined itself to men summoning men to him having need of them having need of them having need of their service even as great kings and generals and leaders need and use men for a moment for an endless age the bishop bowed himself in the being and glory of god felt the glow of the divine courage and confidence in his marrow felt himself one with god  for a timeless interval  never had the bishop had so intense a sense of reality it seemed that never before had he known anything real he knew certainly that god was his king and master and that his unworthy service could be acceptable to god his mind embraced that idea with an absolute conviction that was also absolute happiness  11   the thoughts and sensations of the bishop seemed to have lifted for a time clean away from the condition of time and then through a vast orbit to be returning to that limitation  he was aware presently that things were changing that the light was losing its diviner rays that in some indescribable manner the glory and the assurance diminished  the onset of the new phase was by imperceptible degrees from a glowing serene and static realization of god everything relapsed towards change and activity he was in time again and things were happening it was as if the quicksands of time poured by him and it was as if god was passing away from him he fell swiftly down from the heaven of selfforgetfulness to a grotesque pathetic and earthly selfconsciousness  he became acutely aware of his episcopal livery and that god was passing away from him  it was as if god was passing and as if the bishop was unable to rise up and follow him  then it was as if god had passed and as if the bishop was in headlong pursuit of him and in a great terror lest he should be left behind and he was surely being left behind  he discovered that in some unaccountable way his gaiters were loose most of their buttons seemed to have flown off and his episcopal sash had slipped down about his feet he was sorely impeded he kept snatching at these things as he ran in clumsy attempts to get them off  at last he had to stop altogether and kneel down and fumble with the last obstinate button  oh god he cried god my captain wait for me be patient with me  and as he did so god turned back and reached out his hand it was indeed as if he stood and smiled he stood and smiled as a kind man might do he dazzled and blinded his worshipper and yet it was manifest that he had a hand a man might clasp  unspeakable love and joy irradiated the whole being of the bishop as he seized gods hand and clasped it desperately with both his own it was as if his nerves and arteries and all his substance were inundated with golden light  it was again as if he merged with god and became god     chapter the sixth  exegetical  1   without any sense of transition the bishop found himself seated in the little north library of the athenaeum club and staring at the bust of john wilson croker he was sitting motionless and musing deeply he was questioning with a cool and steady mind whether he had seen a vision or whether he had had a dream if it had been a dream it had been an extraordinarily vivid and convincing dream he still seemed to be in the presence of god and it perplexed him not at all that he should also be in the presence of croker the feeling of mental rottenness and insecurity that had weakened his thought through the period of his illness had gone he was secure again within himself  it did not seem to matter fundamentally whether it was an experience of things without or of things within him that had happened to him it was clear to him that much that he had seen was at most expressive that some was altogether symbolical for example there was that sudden absurd realization of his sash and gaiters and his perception of them as encumbrances in his pursuit of god but the setting and essential of the whole thing remained in his mind neither expressive nor symbolical but as real and immediately perceived and that was the presence and kingship of god god was still with him and about him and over him and sustaining him he was back again in his world and his ordinary life in his clothing and his body and his club but god had been made and remained altogether plain and manifest  whether an actual vision had made his conviction or whether the conviction of his own subconscious mind had made the dream seemed but a small matter beside the conviction that this was indeed the god he had desired and the god who must rule his life  the stuff the stuff had little to do with it it just cleared my head i have seen i have seen really i know  2   for a long time as it seemed the bishop remained wrapped in clouds of luminous meditation dream or vision it did not matter the essential thing was that he had made up his mind about god he had found god moreover he perceived that his theological perplexities had gone god was higher and simpler and nearer than any theological god than the god of the three creeds those creeds lay about in his mind now like garments flung aside no trace nor suspicion of divinity sustained them any longer and nownow he would go out into the world  the little library of the athenaeum has no visible door he went to the bookmasked entrance in the corner and felt among the bookshelves for the hidden latch then he paused held by a curious thought what exactly was the intention of that symbolical struggle with his sash and gaiters and why had they impeded his pursuit of god  to what particularly significant action was he going out  the three creeds were like garments flung aside but he was still wearing the uniform of a priest in the service of those three creeds  after a long interval he walked into the big readingroom he ordered some tea and dry toast and butter and sat down very thoughtfully in a corner he was still sitting and thinking at halfpast eight  it may seem strange to the reader that this bishop who had been doubting and criticizing the church and his system of beliefs for four long years had never before faced the possibility of a severance from his ecclesiastical dignity but he had grown up in the church his life had been so entirely clerical and anglican that the widest separation he had hitherto been able to imagine from this past had left him still a bishop heretical perhaps innovating in the broadening of beliefs and the liberalizing of practice defensive even as chasters was defensive but still with the palace and his dignities differing in opinion rather than in any tangible reality from his previous self for a bishop disbelief in the church is a far profounder scepticism than mere disbelief in god god is unseen and in daily things unfelt but the church is with the predestined bishop always his concept of the extremest possible departure from orthodoxy had been something that chasters had phrased as a restatement of christ it was a new idea an idea that had come with an immense effect of severance and novelty that god could be other than the god of the creed could present himself to the imagination as a figure totally unlike the white gentle and compromising redeemer of an anglicans thought that the bishop should treat the whole teaching of the church and the church itself as wrong was an idea so new that it fell upon him now like a thunderbolt out of a cloudless sky but here clear in his mind now was a feeling amounting to conviction that it was the purpose and gesture of the true god that he should come right out of the church and all his professions  and in the first glow of his vision he felt this gesture imperative he must step right out whither how and when  to begin with it seemed to him that an immediate renunciation was demanded but it was a momentous step he wanted to think and to go on thinking rather than to act precipitately although the imperative seemed absolute some delaying and arresting instinct insisted that he must think if he went back to princhester the everyday duties of his position would confront him at once with an effect of a definite challenge he decided to take one of the reform club bedrooms for two or three days and wire to princhester that he was unavoidably delayed in town without further explanations then perhaps this inhibitory force would give way  it did not however give way his mind sat down for two days in a blank amazement at the course before him and at the end of that time this reasonless and formless institution was as strong as ever during that time except for some incidental exchanges at his clubs he talked to no one at first he did not want to talk to any one he remained mentally and practically active with a still intensely vivid sense that god the true god stood watching him and waiting for him to follow and to follow meant slipping right out of all the world he had ever known to thrust his foot right over the edge of a cliff would scarcely have demanded more from the bishops store of resolution he stood on the very verge the chief secretion of his mind was a shadowy experiment or so in explanation of why he did not follow  3   insensibly the extreme vividness of his sense of gods nearness decreased but he still retained a persuasion of the reality of an immediate listener waiting and of the need of satisfying him  on the third day he found his mind still further changed he no longer felt that god was in pall mall or st jamess park whither he resorted to walk and muse he felt now that god was somewhere about the horizon  he felt too no longer that he thought straight into the mind of god he thought now of what he would presently say to god he turned over and rehearsed phrases with that came a desire to try them first on some other hearer and from that to the attentive head of lady sunderbund prettily bent towards him was no great leap she would understand if any one could understand the great change that had happened in his mind  he found her address in the telephone book she could be quite alone to him if he wouldnt mind just me it was he said exactly what he desired  but when he got to her great airy flat overlooking hyde park with its omega workshop furniture and its arresting decoration he was not so sure whether this encounter was so exactly the thing he had desired as he had supposed  the world had become opaque and real again as he walked up st jamess street and past the ritz he had a feeling that he was taking an afternoon off from god the adventurous modernity of the room in which he waited intensified that one whole white wall was devoted to a small picture by wyndham lewis it was like a picture of an earthquake in a city of aniline pink and grey and keen green cardboard and he wished it had never existed  he turned his back upon it and stared out of the window over the trees and greenery the balcony was decorated with white and pink geraniums in pots painted black and gold and the railings of the balcony were black and gold with crimson shape like squares wildly out of drawing  lady sunderbund kept him waiting perhaps five minutes then she came sailing in to him  she was dressed in a way and moved across the room in a way that was more reminiscent of botticellis spring than everonly with a kind of superadded stiffish polonaise of laceand he did not want to be reminded of botticellis spring or wonder why she had taken to stiff lace polonaises he did not enquire whether he had met lady sunderbund to better advantage at mrs garstein fellows or whether his memory had overrated her or whether anything had happened to his standard of taste but his feeling now was decidedly one of disappointment and all the talk and selfexamination he had promised himself seemed to wither and hide away within him for a time he talked of her view and then admired her room and its arrangement which he thought really were quite unbecomingly flippant and undignified for a room then came the black teathings on their orange tray and he searched in his mind for small talk to sustain their interview  but he had already betrayed his disposition to go on with our talk in his telephone enquiry and lady sunderbund perceiving his shyness began to make openings for him at first just little hinting openings and then larger and larger ones until at last one got him  im so glad she said to see you again im so glad to go on with our talk ive thought about it and thought about it  she beamed at him happily  ive thought ova evy wod you said she went on when she had finished conveying her pretty bliss to him ive been so helped by thinking the keeds are symbols and all you said and ive felt time after time you couldnt stay whe you we that what you we saying to me would have to be said ight out  that brought him in he could not very well evade that opening without incivility after all he had asked to see her and it was a foolish thing to let little decorative accidentals put him off his friendly purpose a woman may have flowerpots painted gold with black checkers and still be deeply understanding he determined to tell her what was in his mind but he found something barred him from telling that he had had an actual vision of god it was as if that had been a private and confidential meeting it wasnt he felt for him either to boast a privilege or tell others of things that god had not chosen to show them  since i saw you he said i have thought a great dealof the subject of our conversation  i have been tying to think she said in a confirmatory tone as if she had cooperated  my faith in god grows he said  she glowed her lips fell apart she flamed attention  but it grows less like the faith of the church less and less i was born and trained in anglicanism and it is with a sort of astonishment i find myself passing now out of every sort of catholicismseeing it from the outside  just as one might see buddhism she supplied  and yet feeling nearer infinitely nearer to god he said  yes she panted yes  i thought if one went out one went out just to doubt and darkness  and you dont  no  you have gone at one step to a new iligion  he stared for a moment at the phrase  to religion he said  it is so wondyful she said with her hands straight down upon the couch upon which she was sitting and leaning forward at him so as to seem almost as much out of drawing as a modern picture  it seems he reflected as if it were a natural thing  she came back to earth very slowly she turned to the teathings with hushed and solemn movements as though she administered a ceremony of peculiar significance the bishop too rose slowly out of the profundity of his confession no sugar please he said arresting the lump in mid air  it was only when they were embarked upon cups of tea and had a little refreshed themselves that she carried the talk further  does it mean that you must leave the church she asked  it seemed so at first he said but now i do not know i do not know what i ought to do  she awaited his next thought  it is as if one had lived in a room all ones life and thought it the worldand then suddenly walked out through a door and discovered the sea and the mountains and stars so it was with me and the anglican church it seems so extraordinary nowand it would have seemed the most natural thing a year agoto think that i ever believed that the anglican compromise was the final truth of religion that nothing more until the end of the world could ever be known that cosmo gordon lang did not know that there could be no conception of god and his quality that randall davidson did not possess  he paused  i did he said  i did she responded with round blue eyes of wonder  at the utmost the church of england is a tabernacle on a road  a oad that goes whe she rhetorized  exactly said the bishop and put down his cup  you see my dear lady sunderbund he resumed i am exactly in the same position of that man at the door  she quoted aptly and softly the wold was all befo them whe to choose  he was struck by the aptness of the words  i feel i have to come right out into the bare truth what exactly then do i become do i lose my priestly function because i discover how great god is but what am i to do  he opened a new layer of his thoughts to her  there is a saying he remarked once a priest always a priest i cannot imagine myself as other than what i am  but othodox no maw she said  orthodoxselfsatisfied no longer a priest who seeks an exploring priest  in a chuch of pogess and bothehood she carried him on  at any rate in a progressive and learning church  she flashed and glowed assent  i have been haunted he said by those words spoken at athens whom therefore ye ignorantly worship him declare i unto you that comes to me with an effect ofguidance is an oldfashioned wordshall i say suggestion to stand by the altar bearing strange names and ancient symbols speaking plainly to all mankind of the one true god  4   he did not get much beyond this point at the time though he remained talking with lady sunderbund for nearly an hour longer the rest was merely a beating out of what had already been said but insensibly she renewed her original charm and as he became accustomed to her he forgot a certain artificiality in her manner and the extreme modernity of her costume and furniture she was a wonderful listener nobody else could have helped him to expression in quite the same way and when he left her he felt that now he was capable of stating his case in a coherent and acceptable form to almost any intelligent hearer he had a point of view now that was no longer embarrassed by the immediate golden presence of god he was no longer dazzled nor ecstatic his problem had diminished to the scale of any other great human problem to the scale of political problems and problems of integrity and moral principle problems about which there is no such urgency as there is about a house on fire for example  and now the desire for expression was running strong he wanted to state his situation if he did not state he would have to act and as he walked back to the club dinner he turned over possible interlocutors in his thoughts lord rampound sat with him at dinner and he came near broaching the subject with him but lord rampound that evening had that morbid running of bluish legal anecdotes which is so common an affliction with lawyers and theology sinks and dies in that turbid stream  but as he lay in bed that night he thought of his old friend and helper bishop likeman and it was borne in upon him that he should consult him and this he did next day  since the days when the bishop had been only plain mr scrope the youngest and most helpful of likemans historical band of curates their friendship had continued likeman had been a second father to him in particular his tact and helpfulness had shone during those days of doubt and anxiety when dear old queen victoria gods representative on earth had obstinately refused at the eleventh hour to make him a bishop she had those pigheaded fits and she was touchy about the bishops she had liked scrope on account of the excellence of his german pronunciation but she had been irritated by newspaper paragraphsnobody could ever find out who wrote them and nobody could ever find out who showed them to the old ladyanticipating his elevation she had gone very red in the face and stiffened in the guelphic manner whenever scrope was mentioned and so a rich harvest of spiritual life had remained untilled for some months likeman had brought her round  it seemed arguable that scrope owed some explanation to likeman before he came to any open breach with the establishment  he found likeman perceptibly older and more shrivelled on account of the war but still as sweet and lucid and subtle as ever his voice sounded more than ever like a kind old womans  he sat buried in his cushionsfor nowadays i must save every scrap of vitalityand for a time contented himself with drawing out his visitors story  of course one does not talk to likeman of visions or intuitions i am disturbed i find myself getting out of touch that was the bishops tone  occasionally likeman nodded slowly as a physician might do at the recital of familiar symptoms yes he said i have been through most of this a little different in the inessentials how clear you are  you leave our stupid old trinitiesas i left them long ago said old likeman with his lean hand feeling and clawing at the arm of his chair  but  the old man raised his hand and dropped it you go away from it allstraight as a line i did you take the wings of the morning and fly to the uttermost parts of the earth and there you find  he held up a lean finger and inclined it to tick off each point  fatewhich is god the father the power of the heart which is god the son and that light which comes in upon us from the inaccessible godhead which is god the holy spirit  but i know of no god the holy spirit and fate is not god at all i saw in my vision one sole god uncrucified militantconquering and to conquer  old likeman stared you saw  the bishop of princhester had not meant to go so far but he stuck to his words as if i saw with my eyes a god of light and courage  you have had visions scrope  i seemed to see  no you have just been dreaming dreams  but why should one not see  see the things of the spirit these symbols as realities these metaphors as men walking  you talk like an agnostic  we are all agnostics our creeds are expressions of ourselves and our attitude and relationship to the unknown the triune god is just the form of our need and disposition i have always assumed that you took that for granted who has ever really seen or heard or felt god god is neither of the senses nor of the mind he is of the soul you are realistic you are materialistic  his voice expostulated  the bishop of princhester reflected the vision of god was far off among his memories now and difficult to recall but he said at last i believe there is a god and that he is as real a person as you or i and he is not the theological god we set out before the world  personification said likeman in the eighteenth century they used to draw beautiful female figures as science and mathematics young men have loved scienceand freedomas pygmalion loved galatea have it so if you will have a visible person for your deity but let me keep up myspirituality  your spirituality seems as thin as a mist do you really believeanything  everything said likeman emphatically sitting up with a transitory vigour everything we two have ever professed together i believe that the creeds of my church do express all that can possibly be expressed in the relationship ofthathe made a comprehensive gesture with a twist of his hand upon its wristto the human soul i believe that they express it as well as the human mind can express it where they seem to be contradictory or absurd it is merely that the mystery is paradoxical i believe that the story of the fall and of the redemption is a complete symbol that to add to it or to subtract from it or to alter it is to diminish its truth if it seems incredible at this point or that then simply i admit my own mental defect and i believe in our church scrope as the embodied truth of religion the divine instrument in human affairs i believe in the security of its tradition in the complete and entire soundness of its teaching in its essential authority and divinity  he paused and put his head a little on one side and smiled sweetly and now can you say i do not believe  but the historical christ the man jesus  a life may be a metaphor why not yes i believe it all all  the bishop of princhester was staggered by this complete acceptance i see you believe all you profess he said and remained for a moment or so rallying his forces  your visionif it was a visioni put it to you was just some single aspect of divinity said likeman we make a mistake in supposing that heresy has no truth in it most heresies are only a disproportionate apprehension of some essential truth most heretics are men who have suddenly caught a glimpse through the veil of some particular verity they are dazzled by that aspect all the rest has vanished they are obsessed you are obsessed clearly by this discovery of the militancy of god god the sonas hero and you want to go out to the simple worship of that one aspect you want to go out to a dissenters tent in the wilderness instead of staying in the great temple of the ages  was that true  for some moments it sounded true  the bishop of princhester sat frowning and looking at that very far away was the vision now of that golden captain who bade him come then at a thought the bishop smiled  the great temple of the ages he repeated but do you remember the trouble we had when the little old queen was so pigheaded  oh i remember i remember said likeman smiling with unshaken confidence why not  for sixty years all we bishops in what you call the great temple of the ages were appointed and bullied and kept in our places by that pink irascible bit of dignity i remember how at the time i didnt dare betray my boiling indignation even to youi scarcely dared admit it to myself  he paused  it doesnt matter at all and old likeman waved it aside  not at all he confirmed waving again  i spoke of the whole church of christ on earth he went on these things these victorias and edwards and so on are temporary accidentsjust as the severance of an anglican from a roman communion and a greek orthodox communion are temporary accidents you will remark that wise men in all ages have been able to surmount the difficulty of these things why because they knew that in spite of all these splits and irregularities and defacementslike the cracks and crannies and lichens on a cathedral wallthe building held good that it was shelter and security there is no other shelter and security and so i come to your problem suppose it is true that you have this incidental vision of the militant aspect of god and he isnt as you see him now that ishe isnt like the trinity he isnt like the creed he doesnt seem to be related to the church then comes the question are you going out for that and whither do you go if you do go out the church remains we alter doctrines not by changing the words but by shifting the accent we can underaccentuate below the threshold of consciousness  but can we  we do wheres hell now eighty years ago it warmed the whole church it wasas some atheist or other put it the other daythe central heating of the soul but never mind that point now consider the essential question the question of breaking with the church ask yourself whither would you go to become an oddity a dissenter a negative self emasculated the spirit that denies you would just go out you would just cease to serve religion that would be all you wouldnt do anything the church would go on everything else would go on only you would be lost in the outer wilderness  but then  old likeman leant forward and pointed a bony finger stay in the church and modify it bring this new light of yours to the altar  there was a little pause  no man the bishop thought aloud putteth new wine into old bottles  old likeman began to speak and had a fit of coughing some of these textswhuff whufflike a conjurors hatwhuffmake emfit anything  a manservant appeared and handed a silver box of lozenges into which the old bishop dipped with a trembling hand  tricks of that sort he said wont do scropeamong professionals  and besides he was inspired true religion is old wineas old as the soul  you are a bishop in the church of christ on earth he summed it up and you want to become a detached and wandering ancient mariner from your shipwreck of faith with something to explainthat nobody wants to hear you are going out i suppose you have means  the old man awaited the answer to his abrupt enquiry with a handful of lozenges  no said the bishop of princhester practicallyi havent  my dear boy it was as if they were once more rector and curate my dear brother do you know what the value of an exbishop is in the ordinary labour market  i have never thought of that  evidently you have a wife and children  five daughters  and your wife married youi remember she married you soon after you got that living in st johns wood i suppose she took it for granted that you were fixed in an ecclesiastical career that was implicit in the transaction  i havent looked very much at that side of the matter yet said the bishop of princhester  it shouldnt be a decisive factor said bishop likeman not decisive but it will weigh it should weigh  the old man opened out fresh aspects of the case his argument was for delay for deliberation he went on to a wider set of considerations a man who has held the position of a bishop for some years is he held no longer a free man in matters of opinion he has become an official part of a great edifice which supports the faith of multitudes of simple and dependant believers he has no right to indulge recklessly in intellectual and moral integrities he may understand but how is the flock to understand he may get his own soul clear but what will happen to them he will just break away their supports astonish them puzzle them distress them deprive them of confidence convince them of nothing  intellectual egotism may be as grave a sin said bishop likeman as physical selfishness  assuming even that you are absolutely right said bishop likeman arent you still rather in the position of a man who insists upon swedish exercises and a strengthening dietary on a raft  i think you have made out a case for delay said his hearer  three months  the bishop of princhester conceded three months  including every sort of service because after all even supposing it is damnable to repeat prayers and creeds you do not believe in and administer sacraments you think superstition nobody can be damned but yourself on the other hand if you express doubts that are not yet perfectly digestedyou experiment with the souls of others  5   the bishop found much to ponder in his old friends counsels they were discursive and manyfronted and whenever he seemed to be penetrating or defeating the particular considerations under examination the others in the background had a way of appearing invincible he had a strong persuasion that likeman was wrongand unanswerable and the true god now was no more than the memory of a very vividly realized idea it was clear to the bishop that he was no longer a churchman or in the generally accepted sense of the word a christian and that he was bound to come out of the church but all sense of urgency had gone it was a matter demanding deliberation and very great consideration for others  he took no more of dales stuff because he felt bodily sound and slept well and he was now a little shy of this potent fluid he went down to princhester the next day for his compromise of an interval of three months made it seem possible to face his episcopal routine again it was only when he was back in his own palace that the full weight of his domestic responsibilities in the discussion of the course he had to take became apparent  lady ella met him with affection and solicitude  i was tired and mentally fagged he said a day or so in london had an effect of change  she agreed that he looked much better and remained for a moment or so scrutinizing him with the faint anxiety of one resolved to be completely helpful  he regarded her with a renewed sense of her grace and dignity and kindliness she was wearing a grey dress of soft silky material touched with blue and covered with what seemed to him very rich and beautiful lace her hair flowed back very graciously from her broad brow and about her wrist and neck were delicate lines of gold she seemed tremendously at home and right just where she was in that big hospitable room cultured but anglican without pretensions or novelties with a glow of bound books with the grand piano that miriam his third daughter was beginning to play so well with the tea equipage of shining silver and fine porcelain  he sat down contentedly in the low armchair beside her  it wasnt a setting that one would rashly destroy  and that evening at dinner this sense of his home as a complex of finely adjusted things not to be rashly disturbed was still more in the mind of the bishop at dinner he had all his domesticities about him it was the family time from eight until ten at which latter hour he would usually go back from the drawingroom to his study he surveyed the table eleanor was at home for a few days looking a little thin and bright but very keen and happy she had taken a first in the first part of the moral science tripos and she was working hard now for part two clementina was to go back to newnham with her next september she aspired to history miriams bent was musical she and phoebe and daphne and clementina were under the care of skilful mademoiselle lafarge most tactful of protestant frenchwomen protestant and yet not too protestant one of those rare french protestants in whom a touch of bergson and the pasteur monod       scarce suspected animates the whole  and also they had lessons so high are our modern standards of education from mr blent a brilliant young mathematician in orders who sat now next to lady ella mr whippham the chaplain was at the bishops right hand ready for any chance of making arrangements to clear off the small arrears of duty the little holiday in london had accumulated the bishop surveyed all these bright young people between himself and the calm beauty of his wife he spoke first to one and then another upon the things that interested them it rejoiced his heart to be able to give them education and opportunity it pleased him to see them in clothes that he knew were none the less expensive because of their complete simplicity miriam and mr blent wrangled pleasantly about debussy and old dunk waited as though in orders of some rare and special sort that qualified him for this service  all these people the bishop reflected counted upon him that this would go on  eleanor was answering some question of her mothers they were so oddly alike and so curiously different and both in their several ways so fine eleanor was dark like his own mother perhaps she did a little lack lady ellas fine reserves she could express more she could feel more acutely she might easily be very unhappy or very happy  all these people counted on him it was indeed acutely true as likeman had said that any sudden breach with his position would be a breach of faithso far as they were concerned  and just then his eye fell upon the epergne a very old and beautiful piece of silver that graced the dinnertable it had been given him together with an episcopal ring by his curates and choristers at the church of the holy innocents when he became bishop of pinner when they gave it him had any one of them dreamt that some day he might be moved to strike an ungracious blow at the mother church that had reared them all  it was his custom to join the family in the drawingroom after dinner tonight he was a little delayed by whippham with some trivialities about next months confirmations in pringle and princhester when he came in he found miriam playing and playing very beautifully one of those later sonatas of beethoven he could never remember whether it was of 109 or of 111 but he knew that he liked it very much it was solemn and sombre with phases of indescribable sweetnesswhile clementina daphne and mademoiselle lafarge went on with their war knitting and phoebe and mr blent bent their brows over chess eleanor was reading the evening paper lady ella sat on a high chair by the coffee things and he stood in the doorway surveying the peaceful scene for a moment or so before he went across the room and sat down on the couch close to her  you look tired she whispered softly  worries  that chasters case  things developing out of that i must tell you later it would be he felt a good way of breaking the matter to her  is the chasters case coming on again daddy asked eleanor  he nodded  its a pity she said  what  that he cant be left alone  its sir reginald phipps the church would be much more tolerant if it wasnt for the house of laymen but theythey feel they must do something  he seized the opportunity of the music ceasing to get away from the subject miriam dear he asked raising his voice is that 109 or 111 i can never tell  that is always 111 daddy said miriam its the other one is 109 and then evidently feeling that she had been pert would you like me to play you 109 daddy  i should love it my dear and he leant back and prepared to listen in such a thorough way that eleanor would have no chance of discussing the chasters heresies but this was interrupted by the consummation of the coffee and mr blent breaking a long silence with mate in three if im not mistaken leapt to his feet to be of service eleanor with the rough seriousness of youth would not leave the chasters case alone  but need you take action against mr chasters she asked at once  its a very complicated subject my dear he said  his arguments  the practical considerations  but what are practical considerations in such a case  thats a postgraduate subject norah her father said with a smile and a sigh  but began eleanor gathering fresh forces  daddy is tired lady ella intervened patting him on the head  oh terriblyof that he said and so escaped eleanor for the evening  but he knew that before very long he would have to tell his wife of the changes that hung over their lives it would be shabby to let the avalanche fall without giving the longest possible warning and before they parted that night he took her hands in his and said there is much i have to tell you dear things change the whole world changes the church must not live in a dream  no she whispered i hope you will sleep tonight and held up her grave sweet face to be kissed  6   but he did not sleep perfectly that night  he did not sleep indeed very badly but he lay for some time thinking thinking not onward but as if he pressed his mind against very strong barriers that had closed again his vision of god which had filled the heavens had become now gemlike a minute hard clearcut conviction in his mind that he had to disentangle himself from the enormous complications of symbolism and statement and organization and misunderstanding in the church and achieve again a simple and living worship of a simple and living god likeman had puzzled and silenced him only upon reflection to convince him that amidst such intricacies of explanation the spirit cannot live creeds may be symbolical but symbols must not prevaricate a church that can symbolize everything and anything means nothing  it followed from this that he ought to leave the church but there came the other side of this perplexing situation his feelings as he lay in his bed were exactly like those one has in a dream when one wishes to run or leap or shout and one can achieve no movement no sound he could not conceive how he could possibly leave the church  his wife became as it were the representative of all that held him helpless she and he had never kept secret from one another any plan of action any motive that affected the other it was clear to him that any movement towards the disavowal of doctrinal christianity and the renunciation of his see must be first discussed with her he must tell her before he told the world  and he could not imagine his telling her except as an incredibly shattering act  so he left things from day to day and went about his episcopal routines he preached and delivered addresses in such phrases as he knew people expected and wondered profoundly why it was that it should be impossible for him to discuss theological points with lady ella and one afternoon he went for a walk with eleanor along the banks of the prin and found himself in response to certain openings of hers talking to her in almost exactly the same terms as likeman had used to him  then suddenly the problem of this theological eclaircissement was complicated in an unexpected fashion  he had just been taking his every second thursday talk with diocesan men helpers he had been trying to be plain and simple upon the needless narrowness of enthusiastic laymen he was still in the bishop andrews cap and purple cassock he affected on these occasions the men helpers loved purple and he was disentangling himself from two or three resolute boresfor our loyal laymen can be at times quite superlative boreswhen miriam came to him  mummy says come to the drawingroom if you can there is a lady sunderbund who seems particularly to want to see you  he hesitated for a moment and then decided that this was a conversation he ought to control  he found lady sunderbund looking very tall and radiantly beautiful in a sheathlike dress of bright crimson trimmed with snowwhite fur and a white fur toque she held out a long whitegloved hand to him and cried in a tone of comradeship and profound understanding ive come bishop  youve come to see me he said without any sincerity in his polite pleasure  ive come to pinchesta to stay she cried with a bright triumphant rising note  she evidently considered lady ella a mere conversational stopgap to be dropped now that the real business could be commenced she turned her pretty profile to that lady and obliged the bishop with a compact summary of all that had preceded his arrival i have been telling lady ella she said ive taken a house funitua and all hea in pinchesta ive made up my mind to sit unda youas they say in clapham ive come ight down he fo good ive taken a little houseoh a sweet little house that will be all over oses next month im living fom oom to oom and having the othas done up its in that little quiet steet behind you gaden wall and he i am  is it the old doctors house asked lady ella  was it an old docta cried lady sunderbund how delightful and now i shall be a patient  she concentrated upon the bishop  oh ive been thinking all the time of all the things you told me ova and ova its all so wondyful and soso like a gate daw opening new light as if it was all just beginning  she clasped her hands  the bishop felt that there were a great number of points to this situation and that it was extremely difficult to grasp them all at once but one that seemed of supreme importance to his whirling intelligence was that lady ella should not know that he had gone to relieve his soul by talking to lady sunderbund in london it had never occurred to him at the time that there was any shadow of disloyalty to lady ella in his going to lady sunderbund but now he realized that this was a thing that would annoy lady ella extremely the conversation had in the first place to be kept away from that and in the second place it had to be kept away from the abrupt exploitation of the new theological developments  he felt that something of the general tension would be relieved if they could all three be got to sit down  ive been talking for just upon two hours he said to lady ella its good to see the water boiling for tea  he put a chair for lady sunderbund to the right of lady ella got her into it by infusing an ecclesiastical insistence into his manner and then went and sat upon the musicstool on his wifes left so as to establish a screen of teathings and cakes and so forth against her more intimate enthusiasm meanwhile he began to see his way clearer and to develop his line  well lady sunderbund he said i can assure you that i think you will be no small addition to the church life of princhester but i warn you this is a hardworking and exacting diocese we shall take your money all we can get of it we shall take your time we shall work you hard  wok me hard cried lady sunderbund with passion  we will we will said the bishop in a tone that ignored her passionate note  i am sure lady sunderbund will be a great help to us said lady ella we want brightening theres a dinginess  lady sunderbund beamed an acknowledgment i shall exact a eturn she said i dont mind woking but i shall wok like the poo students in the middle ages did to get my teaching ive got my own soul to save as well as help saving othas since oua last talk  she found the bishop handing her bread and butter for a time the bishop fought a delaying action with the teathings while he sought eagerly and vainly in his mind for some good practical topic in which he could entangle and suppress lady sunderbunds enthusiasms from this she broke away by turning suddenly to lady ella  youa husbands views she said wee a eal evelation to me it was like not being blindall at once  lady ella was always pleased to hear her husband praised her colour brightened a little they seem very ordinary views she said modestly  you share them cried lady sunderbund  but of course said lady ella  wondyful cried lady sunderbund  tell me lady sunderbund said the bishop are you going to alter the outer appearance of the old doctors house and found that at last he had discovered the saving topic  hadly at all she said i shall just have it pointed white and do the doaim not su how i shall do the doa whetha i shall do the doa gold or a vehy vehy itch blue  for a time she and lady ella to whom these ideas were novel discussed the animation of grey and sombre towns by house painting in such matter lady sunderbund had a russian mind i cant bea gey she said not in my suoundings not in my keed nowhee she turned to the bishop if i had my way i would paint you cathedal inside and out  they used to be painted said the bishop i dont know if you have seen ely there the old painting has been largely restored  from that to the end there was no real danger and at last the bishop found himself alone with his wife again  remarkable person he said tentatively i never met any one whose faults were more visible i met her at wimbush house  he glanced at his watch  what did she mean asked lady ella abruptly by talking of your new views and about revelations  she probably misunderstood something i said at the garstein fellows he said she has rather a leaping mind  he turned to the window looked at his nails and appeared to be suddenly reminded of duties elsewhere  it was chiefly manifest to him that the difficulties in explaining the changes of his outlook to lady ella had now increased enormously  7   a day or so after lady sunderbunds arrival in princhester the bishop had a letter from likeman the old man was manifestly in doubt about the effect of their recent conversation  my dear scrope it began i find myself thinking continually about our interview and the difficulties you laid bare so frankly to me we touched upon many things in that talk and i find myself full of afterthoughts and not perfectly sure either quite of what i said or of what i failed to say i feel that in many ways i was not perhaps so clear and convincing as the justice of my case should have made me and you are one of my own particular little company you were one of the best workers in that band of good workers your life and your career are very much my concern i know you will forgive me if i still mingle something of the paternal with my fraternal admonitions i watched you closely i have still my old diaries of the st matthews days and i have been looking at them to remind me of what you once were it was my custom to note my early impressions of all the men who worked with me because i have a firm belief in the soundness of first impressions and the considerable risk one runs of having them obscured by the accidents and habituations of constant intercourse i found that quite early in your days at st matthews i wrote against your name enthusiastic but a saving delicacy after all our lifelong friendship i would not write anything truer i would say of you today this man might have been a revivalist if he were not a gentleman there is the enthusiast there is the revivalist in you it seems to me that the stresses and questions of this great crisis in the worlds history have brought it nearer to the surface than i had ever expected it to come  i quite understand and i sympathize with your impatience with the church at the present time we present a spectacle of pompous insignificance hard to bear with we are doing very little and we are giving ourselves preposterous airs there seems to be an opinion abroad that in some quasiautomatic way the country is going to collapse after the war into the arms of the church and the high tories a possibility i dont accept for a moment why should it these forciblefeeble reactionaries are much more likely to explode a revolution that will disestablish us and i quite understand your theological difficultiesquite the creeds if their entire symbolism is for a moment forgotten if they are taken as opaque statements of fact are inconsistent incredible so incredible that no one believes them not even the most devout the utmost they do is to avert their mindsreverentially credo quia impossibile that is offensive to a western mind i can quite understand the disposition to cry out at such things this is not the church of godto run out from it  you have some dream i suspect of a dramatic dissidence  now my dear brother and erstwhile pupil i ask you not to do this thing wait i implore you give meand some others a little time i have your promise for three months but even after that i ask you to wait let the reform come from within the church the church is something more than either its creeds its clergy or its laymen look at your cathedral rising out of and dominating princhester it stands not simply for athanasius it stands but incidentally for athanasius it stands for all religion within that fabriclet me be as frank here as in our private conversationdoctrine has altered again and again today two distinct religions worship there side by side one that fades and one that grows brighter there is the old quasimaterialistic belief of the barbarians the belief in such things for example as that christ the physical son of god descended into hell and stayed there seeing the sights i suppose like any tourist and being treated with diplomatic civilities for three terrestrial days and on the other hand there is the truly spiritual belief that you and i share which is absolutely intolerant of such grotesque ideas my argument to you is that the new faith the clearer vision gains ground that the only thing that can prevent or delay the church from being altogether possessed by what you call and i admit is the true god is that such men as yourself as the light breaks upon you should be hasty and leave the church you see my point of view do you not it is not one that has been assumed for our discussion it is one i came to long years ago that i was already feeling my way to in my st matthews lenton sermons  a word for your private ear i am working i cannot tell you fully because i am not working alone but there are movements afoot in which i hope very shortly to be able to ask you to share that much at least i may say at this stage obscure but very powerful influences are at work for the liberalizing of the church for release from many narrow limitations for the establishment of a modus vivendi with the nonconformist and dissentient bodies in britain and america and with the churches of the east but of that no more now  and in conclusion my dear scrope let me insist again upon the eternal persistence of the essential religious fact  greek letters here  rev i 18 fear not i am the first and last thing the living thing  and these promises which even if we are not to take them as promises in the exact sense in which let us say the payment of five sovereigns is promised by a fivepound note are yet assertions of practically inevitable veracity  greek letters here  phil i 6 he who began will perfect eph v 14 he will illuminate   the old man had written his greek tags in shakily resolute capitals it was his custom always to quote the greek testament in his letters never the english version it is a practice not uncommon with the more scholarly of our bishops it is as if some eminent scientific man were to insist upon writing h2o instead of water and sodium chloride instead of table salt in his private correspondence or upon hanging up a stuffed crocodile in his hall to give the place tone the bishop of princhester construed these brief dicta without serious exertion he found them very congenial texts but there were insuperable difficulties in the problem why likeman should suppose they had the slightest weight upon his side of their discussion the more he thought the less they seemed to be on likemans side until at last they began to take on a complexion entirely opposed to the old mans insidious arguments until indeed they began to bear the extraordinary interpretation of a special message unwittingly delivered  8   the bishop was still thinking over this communication when he was interrupted by lady ella she came with a letter in her hand to ask him whether she might send fiveandtwenty pounds to a poor cousin of his a teacher in a girls school who had been incapacitated from work by a dislocation of the cartilage of her knee if she could go to that unorthodox but successful practitioner mr barker the bonesetter she was convinced she could be restored to efficiency but she had no ready money the bishop agreed without hesitation his only doubt was the certainty of the cure but upon that point lady ella was convinced there had been a great experience in the walshingham family  it is pleasant to be able to do things like this said lady ella standing over him when this matter was settled  yes the bishop agreed it is pleasant to be in a position to do things like this     chapter the seventh  the second vision  1   a month later found the bishops original state of perplexity and insomnia returned and intensified he had done none of all the things that had seemed so manifestly needing to be done after his vision in the athenaeum all the relief and benefit of his experience in london had vanished out of his life he was afraid of dr dales drug he knew certainly that it would precipitate matters and all his instincts in the state of moral enfeeblement to which he had relapsed were to temporize  although he had said nothing further about his changed beliefs to lady ella yet he perceived clearly that a shadow had fallen between them she had a wifes extreme sensitiveness to fine shades of expression and bearing and manifestly she knew that something was different meanwhile lady sunderbund had become a frequent worshipper in the cathedral she was a figure as conspicuous in sombre princhester as a bird of paradise would have been common people stood outside her very very rich blue door on the chance of seeing her she never missed an opportunity of hearing the bishop preach or speak she wrote him several long and thoughtful letters with which he did not bother lady ella she communicated persistently and manifestly intended to become a very active worker in diocesan affairs  it was inevitable that she and the bishop should meet and talk occasionally in the cathedral precincts and it was inevitable that he should contrast the flexibility of her rapid and very responsive mind with a certain defensiveness a stoniness in the intellectual bearing of lady ella  if it had been lady sunderbund he had had to explain to instead of lady ella he could have explained a dozen times a day  and since his mind was rehearsing explanations it was not unnatural they should overflow into this eagerly receptive channel and that the less he told lady ella the fuller became his spiritual confidences to lady sunderbund  she was clever in realizing that they were confidences and treating them as such more particularly when it chanced that she and lady ella and the bishop found themselves in the same conversation  she made great friends with miriam and initiated her by a whole collection of pretty costume plates into the mysteries of the ussian ballet and the works of moussogski and imsky kozakof  the bishop liked a certain religiosity in the texture of moussorgskis music but failed to see the significance of many of the costumes  2   it was on a sunday nightthe fourth sunday after easterthat the supreme crisis of the bishops life began he had had a feeling all day of extreme dulness and stupidity he felt his ministrations unreal his ceremonies absurd and undignified in the night he became bleakly and painfully awake his mind occupied itself at first chiefly with the tortuousness and weakness of his own character every day he perceived that the difficulty of telling lady ella of the change in his faith became more mountainous and every day he procrastinated if he had told her naturally and simply on the evening of his return from londonbefore anything material intervenedeverything would have been different everything would have been simpler  he groaned and rolled over in his bed  there came upon him the acutest remorse and misery for he saw that amidst these petty immediacies he had lost touch with god the last month became incredible he had seen god he had touched gods hand god had been given to him and he had neglected the gift he was still lost amidst the darkness and loneliness the chaotic ends and mean shifts of an erastian world for a month now and more after a vision of god so vivid and real and reassuring that surely no saint nor prophet had ever had a better he had made no more than vague responsive movements he had allowed himself to be persuaded into an unreasonable and cowardly delay and the fetters of association and usage and minor interests were as unbroken as they had been before ever the vision shone was it credible that there had ever been such a vision in a life so entirely dictated by immediacy and instinct as his we are all creatures of the dark stream we swim in needs and bodily impulses and small vanities if ever and again a bubble of spiritual imaginativeness glows out of us it breaks and leaves us where we were  louse that i am he cried  he still believed in god without a shadow of doubt he believed in the god that he had seen the high courage the golden intention the light that had for a moment touched him but what had he to do with god he the loiterer the little thing  he was little he was funny his prevarications with his wife for example were comic there was no other word for him but funny  he rolled back again and lay staring  who will deliver me from the body of this death what right has a little bishop in a purple stock and doeskin breeches who hangs back in his palace from the very call of god to a phrase so fine and tragic as the body of this death  he was the most unreal thing in the universe he was a base insect giving himself airs what advantage has a bishop over the praying mantis that cricket which apes the attitude of piety does he matter moreto god  to the god of the universe who can tell to the god of manyes  he sat up in bed struck by his own answer and full of an indescribable hunger for god and an indescribable sense of his complete want of courage to make the one simple appeal that would satisfy that hunger he tried to pray o god he cried forgive me take me it seemed to him that he was not really praying but only making believe to pray it seemed to him that he was not really existing but only seeming to exist he seemed to himself to be one with figures on a china plate with figures painted on walls with the flimsy imagined lives of men in stories of forgotten times o god he said o god acting a gesture mimicking appeal  anaemic he said and was given an idea  he got out of bed he took his keys from the nighttable at the bed head and went to his bureau  he stood with dales tonic in his hand he remained for some time holding it and feeling a curious indisposition to go on with the thing in his mind  he turned at last with an effort he carried the little phial to his bedside and into the tumbler of his waterbottle he let the drops fall drop by drop until he had counted twenty then holding it to the bulb of his reading lamp he added the water and stood watching the slow pearly eddies in the mixture mingle into an opalescent uniformity he replaced the waterbottle and stood with the glass in his hand but he did not drink  he was afraid  he knew that he had only to drink and this world of confusion would grow transparent would roll back and reveal the great simplicities behind and he was afraid  he was afraid of that greatness he was afraid of the great imperatives that he knew would at once take hold of his life he wanted to muddle on for just a little longer he wanted to stay just where he was in his familiar prisonhouse with the key of escape in his hand before he took the last step into the very presence of truth he wouldthink  he put down the glass and lay down upon his bed  3   he awoke in a mood of great depression out of a dream of wandering interminably in an endless building of innumerable pillars pillars so vast and high that the ceiling was lost in darkness by the scale of these pillars he felt himself scarcely larger than an ant he was always alone in these wanderings and always missing something that passed along distant passages something desirable something in the nature of a procession or of a ceremony something of which he was in futile pursuit of which he heard faint echoes something luminous of which he seemed at times to see the last fading reflection across vast halls and wildernesses of shining pavement and through cyclopaean archways at last there was neither sound nor gleam but the utmost solitude and a darkness and silence and the uttermost profundity of sorrow  it was bright day dunk had just come into the room with his tea and the tumbler of dr dales tonic stood untouched upon the nighttable the bishop sat up in bed he had missed his opportunity today was a busy day he knew  no he said as dunk hesitated whether to remove or leave the tumbler leave that  dunk found room for it upon the teatray and vanished softly with the bishops evening clothes  the bishop remained motionless facing the day there stood the draught of decision that he had lacked the decision even to touch  from his bed he could just read the larger items that figured upon the engagement tablet which it was whipphams business to fill overnight and place upon his table he had two confirmation services first the big one in the cathedral and then a second one in the evening at pringle various committees and an interview with chasters he had not yet finished his addresses for these confirmation services  the task seemed mountainousoverwhelming  with a gesture of desperation he seized the tumblerful of tonic and drank it off at a gulp  4   for some moments nothing seemed to happen  then he began to feel stronger and less wretched and then came a throbbing and tingling of artery and nerve  he had a sense of adventure a pleasant fear in the thing that he had done he got out of bed leaving his cup of tea untasted and began to dress he had the sensation of relief a prisoner may feel who suddenly tries his cell door and finds it open upon sunshine the outside world and freedom  he went on dressing although he was certain that in a few minutes the world of delusion about him would dissolve and that he would find himself again in the great freedom of the place of god  this time the transition came much sooner and much more rapidly this time the phases and quality of the experience were different he felt once again that luminous confusion between the world in which a human life is imprisoned and a circumambient and interpenetrating world but this phase passed very rapidly it did not spread out over nearly half an hour as it had done before and almost immediately he seemed to plunge away from everything in this life altogether into that outer freedom he sought and this time there was not even the elemental scenery of the former vision he stood on nothing there was nothing below and nothing above him there was no sense of falling no terror but a feeling as though he floated released there was no light but as it were a clear darkness about him then it was manifest to him that he was not alone but that with him was that same being that in his former vision had called himself the angel of god he knew this without knowing why he knew this and either he spoke and was answered or he thought and his thought answered him back his state of mind on this occasion was altogether different from the first vision of god before it had been spectacular but now his perception was altogether supersensuous  and nevertheless and all the time it seemed that very faintly he was still in his room  it was he who was the first to speak the great angel whom he felt rather than saw seemed to be waiting for him to speak  i have come he said because once more i desire to see god  but you have seen god  i saw god god was light god was truth and i went back to my life and god was hidden god seemed to call me he called i heard him i sought him and i touched his hand when i went back to my life i was presently lost in perplexity i could not tell why god had called me nor what i had to do  and why did you not come here before  doubt and fear brother will you not lay your hand on mine  the figure in the darkness became distincter but nothing touched the bishops seeking hands  i want to see god and to understand him i want reassurance i want conviction i want to understand all that god asks me to do the world is full of conflict and confusion and the spirit of war it is dark and dreadful now with suffering and bloodshed i want to serve god who could save it and i do not know how  it seemed to the bishop that now he could distinguish dimly but surely the form and features of the great angel to whom he talked for a little while there was silence and then the angel spoke  it was necessary first said the angel that you should apprehend god and desire him that was the purport of your first vision now since you require it i will tell you and show you certain things about him things that it seems you need to know things that all men need to know know then first that the time is at hand when god will come into the world and rule it and when men will know what is required of them this time is close at hand in a little while god will be made manifest throughout the earth men will know him and know that he is king to you this truth is to be shownthat you may tell it to others  this is no vision said the bishop no dream that will pass away  am i not here beside you  5   the bishop was anxious to be very clear things that had been shapelessly present in his mind now took form and found words for themselves  the god i saw in my visionhe is not yet manifest in the world  he comes he is in the world but he is not yet manifested he whom you saw in your vision will speedily be manifest in the world to you this vision is given of the things that come the world is already glowing with god mankind is like a smouldering fire that will presently in quite a little time burst out into flame  in your former vision i showed you god said the angel this time i will show you certain signs of the coming of god and then you will understand the place you hold in the world and the task that is required of you  6   and as the angel spoke he lifted up his hands with the palms upward and there appeared above them a little round cloud that grew denser until it had the likeness of a silver sphere it was a mirror in the form of a ball but a mirror not shining uniformly it was discoloured with greyish patches that had a familiar shape it circled slowly upon the angels hands it seemed no greater than the compass of a human skull and yet it was as great as the earth indeed it showed the whole earth it was the earth the hands of the angel vanished out of sight dissolved and vanished and the spinning world hung free all about the bishop the velvet darkness broke into glittering points that shaped out the constellations and nearest to them so near as to seem only a few million miles away in the great emptiness into which everything had resolved itself shone the sun a ball of redtongued fires the angel was but a voice now the bishop and the angel were somewhere aloof from and yet accessible to the circling silver sphere  at the time all that happened seemed to happen quite naturally as things happen in a dream it was only later when all this was a matter of memory that the bishop realized how strange and incomprehensible his vision had been the sphere was the earth with all its continents and seas its ships and cities its countrysides and mountain ranges it was so small that he could see it all at once and so great and full that he could see everything in it he could see great countries like little patches upon it and at the same time he could see the faces of the men upon the highways he could see the feelings in mens hearts and the thoughts in their minds but it did not seem in any way wonderful to the bishop that so he should see those things or that it was to him that these things were shown  this is the whole world he said  this is the vision of the world the angel answered  it is very wonderful said the bishop and stood for a moment marvelling at the compass of his vision for here was india here was samarkand in the light of the late afternoon and china and the swarming cities upon her silvery rivers sinking through twilight to the night and throwing a spray and tracery of lantern spots upon the dark here was russia under the noontide and so great a battle of artillery raging on the dunajec as no man had ever seen before whole lines of trenches dissolved into clouds of dust and heaps of bloodstreaked earth here close to the waiting streets of constantinople were the hills of gallipoli the grave of british imperialism streaming to heaven with the dust and smoke of bursting shells and rifle fire and the smoke and flame of burning brushwood in the sea of marmora a big ship crowded with turkish troops was sinking and purple under the clear water he could see the shape of the british submarine which had torpedoed her and had submerged and was going away berlin prepared its frugal meals still far from famine he saw the war in europe as if he saw it on a map yet every human detail showed over hundreds of miles of trenches east and west of germany he could see shells bursting and the men below dropping and the stretcherbearers going back with the wounded the roads to every front were crowded with reserves and munitions for a moment a little group of men indifferent to all this struggle who were landing amidst the antarctic wilderness held his attention and then his eyes went westward to the dark rolling atlantic across which as the edge of the night was drawn like a curtain more and still more ships became visible beating upon their courses eastward or westward under the overtaking day  the wonder increased the wonder of the single and infinitely multitudinous adventure of mankind  so god perhaps sees it he whispered  7   look at this man said the angel and the black shadow of a hand seemed to point  it was a chinaman sitting with two others in a little low room separated by translucent paper windows from a noisy street of shrillvoiced people the three had been talking of the ultimatum that japan had sent that day to china claiming a priority in many matters over european influences they were by no means sure whether it was a wrong or a benefit that had been done to their country from that topic they had passed to the discussion of the war and then of wars and national aggressions and the perpetual thrusting and quarrelling of mankind the older man had said that so life would always be it was the will of heaven the little very yellowfaced emaciated man had agreed with him but now this younger man to whose thoughts the angel had so particularly directed the bishops attention was speaking he did not agree with his companion  war is not the will of heaven he said it is the blindness of men  man changes he said from day to day and from age to age the science of the west has taught us that man changes and war changes and all things change china has been the land of flowery peace and she may yet give peace to all the world she has put aside that puppet emperor at peking she turns her face to the new learning of the west as a man lays aside his heavy robes in order that her task may be achieved  the older man spoke his manner was more than a little incredulous and yet not altogether contemptuous you believe that someday there will be no more war in the world that a time will come when men will no longer plot and plan against the welfare of men  even that last said the younger man did any of us dream twentyfive years ago that here in china we should live to see a republic the age of the republics draws near when men in every country of the world will look straight up to the rule of right and the empire of heaven  and god will be king of the world said the angel is not that faith exactly the faith that is coming to you  the two other chinamen questioned their companion but without hostility  this war said the chinaman will end in a great harvesting of kings  but japan the older man began  the bishop would have liked to hear more of that conversation but the dark hand of the angel motioned him to another part of the world listen to this said the angel  he pointed the bishop to where the armies of britain and turkey lay in the heat of mesopotamia along the sandy bank of a wide slowflowing river rode two horsemen an englishman and a turk they were returning from the turkish lines whither the englishman had been with a flag of truce when englishmen and turks are thrown together they soon become friends and in this case matters had been facilitated by the englishmans command of the turkish language he was quite an exceptional englishman the turk had just been remarking cheerfully that it wouldnt please the germans if they were to discover how amiably he and his charge had got on its a pity we ever ceased to be friends he said  you englishmen arent like our christians he went on  the englishmen wanted to know why  you havent priests in robes you dont chant and worship crosses and pictures and quarrel among yourselves  we worship the same god as you do said the englishman  then why do we fight  thats what we want to know  why do you call yourselves christians and take part against us all who worship the one god are brothers  they ought to be said the englishman and thought he was struck by what seemed to him an amazingly novel idea  if it werent for religions all men would serve god together he said and then there would be no warsonly now and then perhaps just a little honest fighting  and see here said the angel here close behind this frightful battle where the german phalanx of guns pounds its way through the russian hosts here is a young german talking to two wounded russian prisoners who have stopped to rest by the roadside he is a german of east prussia he knows and thinks a little russian and they too are saying all three of them that the war is not gods will but the confusion of mankind  here he said and the shadow of his hand hovered over the burningghats of benares where a brahmin of the new persuasion watched the straight spires of funereal smoke ascend into the glow of the late afternoon while he talked to an english painter his friend of the blind intolerance of race and caste and custom in india  or here  the angel pointed to a group of people who had gathered upon a little beach at the head of a norwegian fiord there were three lads an old man and two women and they stood about the body of a drowned german sailor which had been washed up that day for a time they had talked in whispers but now suddenly the old man spoke aloud  this is the fourth that has come ashore he said poor drowned souls because men will not serve god  but folks go to church and pray enough said one of the women  they do not serve god said the old man they just pray to him as one nods to a beggar they do not serve god who is their king they set up their false kings and emperors and so all europe is covered with dead and the seas wash up these dead to us why does the world suffer these things why did we norwegians who are a freespirited people permit the germans and the swedes and the english to set up a king over us because we lack faith kings mean secret counsels and secret counsels bring war sooner or later war will come to us also if we give the soul of our nation in trust to a king but things will not always be thus with men god will not suffer them for ever a day comes and it is no distant day when god himself will rule the earth and when men will do not what the king wishes nor what is expedient nor what is customary but what is manifestly right  but men are saying that now in a thousand places said the angel here is something that goes a little beyond that  his pointing hand went southward until they saw the africanders riding down to windhuk two men boer farmers both rode side by side and talked of the german officer they brought prisoner with them he had put sheepdip in the wells of drinkingwater his life was fairly forfeit and he was not to be killed we want no more hate in south africa they agreed dutch and english and german must live here now side by side men cannot always be killing  and see his thoughts said the angel  the germans mind was one amazement he had been sure of being shot he had meant to make a good end fierce and scornful a relentless fighter to the last and these men who might have shot him like a man were going to spare him like a dog his mind was a tumbled muddle of old and new ideas he had been brought up in an atmosphere of the foulest and fiercest militarism he had been trained to relentlessness ruthlessness and so forth war was war and the bitterer the better frightfulness was your way to victory over every enemy but these people had found a better way here were dutch and english side by side sixteen years ago they had been at war together and now they wore the same uniform and rode together and laughed at him for a queer fellow because he was for spitting at them and defying them and folding his arms and looking level at the executioners rifles there were to be no executioners rifles if it was so with dutch and english why shouldnt it be so presently with french and germans why someday shouldnt french german dutch and english russian and pole ride together under this new star of mankind the southern cross to catch whatever last mischiefmaker was left to poison the wells of goodwill  his mind resisted and struggled against these ideas austere he whispered the ennobling tests of war a trooner rode up alongside and offered him a drink of water  just a mouthful he said apologetically weve had to go rather short  theres another brain busy here with the same idea the angel interrupted and the bishop found himself looking into the bedroom of a young german attache in washington sleepless in the small hours  ach cried the young man and sat up in bed and ran his hands through his fair hair  he had been working late upon this detestable business of the lusitania the news of her sinking had come to hand two days before and all america was aflame with it it might mean war his task had been to pour out explanations and justifications to the press to show that it was an act of necessity to pretend a conviction that the great ship was loaded with munitions to fight down the hostility and anger that blazed across a continent he had worked to his limit he had taken cup after cup of coffee and had come to bed worked out not two hours ago now here he was awake after a nightmare of drowning women and children trying to comfort his soul by recalling his own arguments never once since the war began had he doubted the rightness of the german cause it seemed only a proof of his nervous exhaustion that he could doubt it now germany was the best organized most cultivated scientific and liberal nation the earth had ever seen it was for the good of mankind that she should be the dominant power in the world his patriotism had had the passion of a mission the english were indolent the french decadent the russians barbaric the americans basely democratic the rest of the world was the white mans burthen the clear destiny of mankind was subservience to the good prussian eagle neverthelessthose wet draggled bodies that swirled down in the eddies of the sinking titanach he wished it could have been otherwise he nursed his knees and prayed that there need not be much more of these things before the spirit of the enemy was broken and the great peace of germany came upon the world  and suddenly he stopped short in his prayer  suddenly out of the nothingness and darkness about him came the conviction that god did not listen to his prayers  was there any other way  it was the most awful doubt he had ever had for it smote at the training of all his life could it be possible that after all our old german god is not the proper style and title of the true god is our old german god perhaps only the last of a long succession of bloodstained tribal effigiesand not god at all  for a long time it seemed that the bishop watched the thoughts that gathered in the young attaches mind until suddenly he broke into a quotation into that last cry of the dying goethe for light more light  leave him at that said the angel i want you to hear these two young women  the hand came back to england and pointed to where southend at the mouth of the thames was all agog with the excitement of an overnight zeppelin raid people had got up hours before their usual time in order to look at the wrecked houses before they went up to their work in town everybody seemed abroad two nurses not very well trained as nurses go nor very welleducated women were snatching a little sea air upon the front after an eventful night they were too excited still to sleep they were talking of the horror of the moment when they saw the nasty thing up there and felt helpless as it dropped its bombs they had both hated it  there didnt ought to be such things said one  they dont seem needed said her companion  men wont always go on like thismaking wars and all such wickedness  its ow to stop them  science is going to stop them  science  yes science my young brotheroh hes a clever onehe says such things he says that its science that they wont always go on like this theres more sense coming into the world and moremy young brother says so says it stands to reason its evolution its science that men are all brothers you can prove it its science that there oughtnt to be war science is ending war now by making it horrible like this and making it so that no one is safe showing it up only when nobody is safe will everybody want to set up peace he says he says its proved there could easily be peace all over the world now if it wasnt for flags and kings and capitalists and priests they still manage to keep safe and out of it he says the world ought to be just one state the world state he says it ought to be  under god said the bishop under god  he says science ought to be king of the whole world  call it science if you will said the bishop god is wisdom  out of the mouths of babes and elementary science students said the angel the very children in the board schools are turning against this narrowness and nonsense and mischief of nations and creeds and kings you see it at a thousand points at ten thousand points look the world is all flashing and flickering it is like a spinthariscope it is aquiver with the light that is coming to mankind it is on the verge of blazing even now  into a light  into the one kingdom of god see here see here and here this brave little french priest in a helmet of steel who is daring to think for the first time in his life this gentlemannered emir from morocco looking at the gravediggers on the battlefield this mother who has lost her son  you see they all turn in one direction although none of them seem to dream yet that they are all turning in the same direction they turn every one to the rule of righteousness which is the rule of god they turn to that communism of effort in the world which alone permits men to serve god in state and city and their economic lives they are all coming to the verge of the same salvation the salvation of one human brotherhood under the rule of one righteousness one divine will is that the salvation your church offers  8   and now that we have seen how religion grows and spreads in mens hearts now that the fields are white with harvest i want you to look also and see what the teachers of religion are doing said the angel  he smiled his presence became more definite and the earthly globe about them and the sun and the stars grew less distinct and less immediately there the silence invited the bishop to speak  in the light of this vision i see my church plainly for the little thing it is he said  he wanted to be perfectly clear with the angel and himself  this church of which i am a bishop is just a part of our poor human struggle small and pitiful as one thinks of it here in the light of the advent of gods kingdom but very great very great indeed ancient and high and venerable in comparison with me but mostly it is human it is most human for my story is the churchs story and the churchs story is mine here i could almost believe myself the church itself the world saw a light the nations that were sitting in darkness saw a great light even as i saw god and then the church began to forget and lose itself among secondary things as i have done it tried to express the truth and lost itself in a maze of theology it tried to bring order into the world and sold its faith to constantine these men who had professed the invisible king of the world shirked his service it is a most terrible disaster that christianity has sold itself to emperors and kings they forged a saying of the masters that we should render unto ceasar the things that are ceasars and unto god the things that are gods  who is this ceasar to set himself up to share mankind with god nothing that is ceasars can be any the less gods but constantine caesar sat in the midst of the council his guards were all about it and the poor fanatics and trimmers and schemers disputed nervously with their eyes on him disputed about homoousian and homoiousian and grimaced and pretended to be very very fierce and exact to hide how much they were frightened and how little they knew and because they did not dare to lay violent hands upon that usurper of the empire of the world  and from that day forth the christian churches have been damned and lost kept churches lackey churches roman russian anglican it matters not my church indeed was twice sold for it doubled the sin of nicaea and gave itself over to henry and elizabeth while it shammed a dispute about the sacraments no one cared really about transubstantiation any more than the earlier betrayers cared about consubstantiality that dispute did but serve to mask the betrayal  he turned to the listening angel what can you show me of my church that i do not know why we anglican bishops get our sees as footmen get a job for months victoria that old german frau delayed mebecause of some tittletattle the things we are snape who afterwards became bishop of burnham used to waylay the prince consort when he was riding in hyde park and give him he boasts a good loud cheer and then he would run very fast across the park so as to catch him as he came round and do it again it is to that sort of thing we bearers of the light have sunken  i have always despised that poor toady the bishop went on and yet here am i and god has called me and shown me the light of his countenance and for a month i have faltered that is the mystery of the human heart that it can and does sin against the light what right have i who have seen the lightand failed what right have ito despise any other human being i seem to have been held back by a sort of paralysis  men are so small so small still that they cannot keep hold of the vision of god that is why i want to see god again but if it were not for this strange drug that seems for a little while to lift my mind above the confusion and personal entanglements of every day i doubt if even now i could be here i am here passionate to hold this moment and keep the light as this inspiration passes i shall go back i know to my home and my place and my limitations the littleness of men the forgetfulness of men i want to know what my chief duty is to have it plain in terms so plain that i can never forget  see in this world he said turning to the globe while chinese merchants and turkish troopers schoolboard boys and norwegian fishermen halftrained nurses and boer farmers are full of the spirit of god see how the priests of the churches of nicaea spend their time  and now it was the bishop whose dark hands ran over the great silver globe and it was the angel who stood over him and listened as a teacher might stand over a child who is learning a lesson the bishops hand rested for a second on a cardinal who was planning a political intrigue to produce a reaction in france then for a moment on a pomeranian pastor who was going out to his welltilled fields with his sunday sermon full of fierce hatred of england still echoing in his head then he paused at a mollah preaching the jehad in doubt whether he too wasnt a german pastor and then at an anglican clergyman still lying abed and thinking out a great mission of repentance and hope that should restore the authority of the established churchby incoherent missioningwithout any definite sin indicated for repentance nor any clear hope for anything in particular arising out of such activities the bishops hand went seeking to and fro but nowhere could he find any religious teacher any religious body rousing itself to meet the new dawn of faith in the world some few men indeed seemed thoughtful but within the limitation of their vows everywhere it was church and creed and nation and king and property and partisanship and nowhere was it the true god that the priests and teachers were upholding it was always the common unhampered man through whom the light of god was breaking it was always the creed and the organization of the religious professionals that stood in the way to god  god is putting the priests aside he cried and reaching out to common men the churches do not serve god they stand between man and god they are like great barricades on the way to god  the bishops hand brushed over archbishop pontifex who was just coming down to breakfast in his palace this pompous old man was dressed in a purple garment that set off his tall figure very finely and he was holding out his episcopal ring for his guests to kiss that being the customary morning greeting of archbishop pontifex the thought of that ringkissing had made much hard work at lower levels worth while to archbishop pontifex and seventy miles away from him old likeman breakfasted in bed on bengers food and searched his greek testament for tags to put to his letters and here was the familiar palace at princhester and in an armchair in his bedroom sat bishop scrope insensible and motionless in a trance in which he was dreaming of the coming of god  i see my futility i see my vanity but what am i to do he said turning to the darkness that now wrapped about the angel again fold upon fold the implications of yesterday bind me for the morrow this is my world this is what i am and what i am in how can i save myself how can i turn from these habits and customs and obligations to the service of the one true god when i see myself then i understand how it is with the others all we priests and teachers are men caught in nets i would serve god easily said but how am i to serve god how am i to help and forward his coming to make myself part of his coming  he perceived that he was returning into himself and that the vision of the sphere and of the starry spaces was fading into nonexistence  he struggled against this return he felt that his demand was still unanswered his wifes face had suddenly come very close to him and he realized she intervened between him and that solution  what was she doing here  9   the great angel seemed still to be near at hand limitless space was all about him and yet the bishop perceived that he was now sitting in the armchair in his bedroom in the palace of princhester he was both there and not there it seemed now as if he had two distinct yet kindred selves and that the former watched the latter the latter was now awakening to the things about him the former marked his gestures and listened with an entire detachment to the words he was saying these words he was saying to lady ella god is coming to rule the world i tell you we must leave the church  close to him sat lady ella watching him with an expression in which dismay and resolution mingled upon the other side of him upon a little occasional table was a tray with breakfast things he was no longer the watcher now but the watched  lady ella bent towards him as he spoke she seemed to struggle with and dismiss his astonishing statement  edward she said you have been taking a drug he looked round at his night table to see the little phial it had gone then he saw that lady ella held it very firmly in her hand  dunk came to me in great distress he said you were insensible and breathing heavily i came i realized i told him to say nothing to any one but to fetch me a tray with your breakfast i have kept all the other servants away and i have waited here by you dunk i think is safe you have been muttering and moving your head from side to side  the bishops mind was confused he felt as though god must be standing just outside the room i have failed in my duty he said but i am very near to god he laid his hand on her arm you know ella he is very close to us  she looked perplexed  he sat up in his chair  for some months now he said there have been new forces at work in my mind i have been invaded by strange doubts and still stranger realizations this old church of ours is an empty mask god is not specially concerned in it  edward she cried what are you saying  i have been hesitating to tell you but i see now i must tell you plainly our church is a cast hull it is like the empty skin of a snake god has gone out of it  she rose to her feet she was so horrified that she staggered backward pushing her chair behind her but you are mad she said  he was astonished at her distress he stood up also  my dear he said i can assure you i am not mad i should have prepared you i know  she looked at him wildeyed then she glanced at the phial gripped in her hand  oh she exclaimed and going swiftly to the window emptied out the contents of the little bottle he realized what she was doing too late to prevent her  dont waste that he cried and stepping forward caught hold of her wrist the phial fell from her white fingers and crashed upon the rough paved garden path below  my dear he cried my dear you do not understand  they stood face to face it was a tonic he said i have been ill i need it  it is a drug she answered you have been uttering blasphemies  he dropped her arm and walked halfway across the room then he turned and faced her  they are not blasphemies he said but i ought not to have surprised you and shocked you as i have done i want to tell you of changes that have happened to my mind  now she exclaimed and then i will not hear them now until you are better until these fumes  her manner changed oh edward she cried why have you done this why have you taken things secretly i know you have been sleepless but i have been so ready to help you i have been willingyou know i have been willingfor any help my life is all to be of use to you  is there any reason she pleaded why you should have hidden things from me  he stood remorseful and distressed i should have talked to you he said lamely  edward she said laying her hands on his shoulders will you do one thing for me will you try to eat a little breakfast and stay here i will go down to mr whippham and arrange whatever is urgent with him perhaps if you restthere is nothing really imperative until the confirmation in the afternoon i do not understand all this for some timei have felt it was going on but of that we can talk the thing now is that people should not know that nothing should be seen suppose for instance that horrible white blackbird were to hear of it i implore you if you rest hereand if i were to send for that young doctor who attended miriam  i dont want a doctor said the bishop  but you ought to have a doctor  i wont have a doctor said the bishop  it was with a perplexed but powerless dissent that the externalized perceptions of the bishop witnessed his agreement with the rest of lady ellas proposals so soon as this point about the doctor was conceded  10   for the rest of that day until his breakdown in the cathedral the sense of being in two places at the same time haunted the bishops mind he stood beside the angel in the great space amidst the stars and at the same time he was back in his ordinary life he was in his palace at princhester first resting in his bedroom and talking to his wife and presently taking up the routines of his duties again in his study downstairs  his chief task was to finish his two addresses for the confirmation services of the day he read over his notes and threw them aside and remained for a time thinking deeply the greek tags at the end of likemans letter came into his thoughts they assumed a quality of peculiar relevance to this present occasion he repeated the words epitelesei epiphausei  he took his little testament to verify them after some slight trouble he located the two texts the first from philippians ran in the old version he that hath begun a good work in you will perform it the second was expressed thus christ shall give thee light he was dissatisfied with these renderings and resorted to the revised version which gave perfect instead of perform and shall shine upon you for give thee light he reflected profoundly for a time  then suddenly his addresses began to take shape in his mind and these little points lost any significance he began to write rapidly and as he wrote he felt the angel stood by his right hand and read and approved what he was writing there were moments when his mind seemed to be working entirely beyond his control he had a transitory questioning whether this curious intellectual automatism was not perhaps what people meant by inspiration  11   the bishop had always been sensitive to the secret fount of pathos that is hidden in the spectacle of youth long years ago when he and lady ella had been in florence he had been moved to tears by the beauty of the freshfaced eager tobit who runs beside the great angel in the picture of botticelli and suddenly and almost as uncontrollably that feeling returned at the sight of the young congregation below him of all these scores of neophytes who were gathered to make a public acknowledgment of god the war has invested all youth now with the shadow of tragedy before it came many of us were a little envious of youth and a little too assured of its certainty of happiness all that has changed fear and a certain tender solicitude mingle in our regard for every child not a lad we pass in the street but may presently be called to face such pain and stress and danger as no ancient hero ever knew the patronage the insolent condescension of age has vanished out of the world it is dreadful to look upon the young  he stood surveying the faces of the young people as the rector read the preface to the confirmation service how simple they were how innocent some were a little flushed by the excitement of the occasion some a little pallid but they were all such tender faces so soft in outline so fresh and delicate in texture and colour they had soft credulous mouths some glanced sideways at one another some listened with a forced intentness the expression of one goodlooking boy sitting in a corner scat struck the bishop as being curiously defiant he stood very erect he blinked his eyes as though they smarted his lips were compressed bitterly and then it seemed to the bishop that the angel stood beside him and gave him understanding  he is here the bishop knew because he could not avoid coming he tried to excuse himself his mother wept what could he do but the churchs teaching nowadays fails even to grip the minds of boys  the rector came to the end of his preface they will evermore endeavour themselves faithfully to observe such things as they by their own confession have assented unto  like a smart solicitor pinning them down said the bishop to himself and then roused himself unrolled the little paper in his hand leant forward and straightway began his first address  nowadays it is possible to say very unorthodox things indeed in an anglican pulpit unchallenged there remains no alert doctrinal criticism in the church congregations it was possible therefore for the bishop to say all that follows without either hindrance or disturbance the only opposition indeed came from within from a sense of dreamlike incongruity between the place and the occasion and the things that he found himself delivering  all ceremonies he began grow old all ceremonies are tainted even from the first by things less worthy than their first intention and you my dear sons and daughters who have gathered today in this worn and ancient building beneath these monuments to ancient vanities and these symbols of forgotten or abandoned theories about the mystery of god will do well to distinguish in your minds between what is essential and what is superfluous and confusing in this dedication you make of yourselves to god our master and king for that is the real thing you seek to do today to give yourselves to god this is your spiritual coming of age in which you set aside your childish dependence upon teachers and upon taught phrases upon rote and direction and stand up to look your master in the face you profess a great brotherhood when you do that a brotherhood that goes round the earth that numbers men of every race and nation and country that aims to bring god into all the affairs of this world and make him not only the king of your individual lives but the kingin place of all the upstarts usurpers accidents and absurdities who bear crowns and sceptres todayof an united mankind  he paused and in the pause he heard a little rustle as though the congregation before him was sitting up in its places a sound that always nerves and reassures an experienced preacher  this my dear children is the reality of this grave business today as indeed it is the real and practical end of all true religion this is your sacrament urn your soldiers oath you salute and give your fealty to the coming kingdom of god and upon that i would have you fix your minds to the exclusion of much that i know only too well has been narrow and evil and sectarian in your preparation for this solemn rite god is like a precious jewel found among much rubble you must cast the rubble from you the crowning triumph of the human mind is simplicity the supreme significance of god lies in his unity and universality the god you salute today is the god of the jews and gentiles alike the god of islam the god of the brahmo somaj the unknown god of many a righteous unbeliever he is not the god of those felted theologies and inexplicable doctrines with which your teachers may have confused your minds i would have it very clear in your minds that having drunken the draught you should not reverence unduly the cracked old vessel that has brought it to your lips i should be falling short of my duty if i did not make that and everything i mean by that altogether plain to you  he saw the lad whose face of dull defiance he had marked before sitting now with a startled interest in his eyes the bishop leant over the desk before him and continued in the persuasive tone of a man who speaks of things too manifest for laboured argument  in all ages religion has come from god through broadminded creative men and in all ages it has fallen very quickly into the hands of intense and conservative men these lastnarrow fearful and suspicioushave sought in every age to save the precious gift of religion by putting it into a prison of formulae and asseverations bear that in mind when you are pressed to definition it is as if you made a box hermetically sealed to save the treasure of a fresh breeze from the sea but they have sought out exact statements and tortuous explanations of the plain truth of god they have tried to take down god in writing to commit him to documents to embalm his living faith as though it would otherwise corrupt so they have lost god and fallen into endless differences disputes violence and darkness about insignificant things they have divided religion between this creed and teacher and that the corruption of the best is the worst said aristotle and the great religions of the world and especially this christianity of ours are the ones most darkened and divided and wasted by the fussings and false exactitudes of the creedmonger and the sectary there is no lie so bad as a stale disfigured truth there is no heresy so damnable as a narrow orthodoxy all religious associations carry this danger of the overstatement that misstates and the overemphasis that divides and betrays beware of that danger do not imagine because you are gathered in this queerly beautiful old building today because i preside here in this odd raiment of an odder compromise because you see about you in coloured glass and carven stone the emblems of much vain disputation that thereby you cut yourselves off and come apart from the great world of faith catholic islamic brahministic buddhistic that grows now to a common consciousness of the near advent of god our king you enter that waiting world fraternity now you do not leave it this place this church of ours should be to you not a seclusion and a fastness but a door  i could quote you a score of instances to establish that this simple universalism was also the teaching of christ but now i will only remind you that it was mary who went to her lord simply who was commended and not martha who troubled about many things learn from the mary of faith and not from these marthas of the creeds let us abandon the presumptions of an ignorant past the perfection of doctrine is not for finite men give yourselves to god give yourselves to god not to churches and uses but to god to god simply he is the first word of religion and the last he is alpha he is omega epitelesei it is he who will finish the good work begun  the bishop ended his address in a vivid silence then he began his interrogation  do you here in the presence of god and of this congregation renew the solemn promise and vow that was made in your name at your baptism ratifying and confirming the same in your own persons and acknowledging yourselves  he stopped short the next words were bound to believe and do all those things which your godfathers and godmothers then undertook for you  he could not stand those words he hesitated and then substituted acknowledge yourselves to be the true servants of the one god who is the lord of mankind  for a moment silence hung in the cathedral then one voice a boys voice led a ragged response i do  then the bishop our help is in the name of the lord  the congregation answered doubtfully with a glance at its prayer books who hath made heaven and earth  the bishop blessed be the name of the lord  the congregation said with returning confidence henceforth world without end  12   before his second address the bishop had to listen to veni creator spiritus in its english form and it seemed to him the worst of all possible hymns its defects became monstrously exaggerated to his hypersensitive mind it impressed him in its englished travesty as a grotesque as a veritable charlie chaplin among hymns and in truth it does stick out most awkward feet it misses its accusatives it catches absurdly upon points of abstruse doctrine the great angel stood motionless and ironical at the bishops elbow while it was being sung your church he seemed to say  we must end this sort of thing whispered the bishop we must end this sort of thingabsolutely he glanced at the faces of the singers and it became beyond all other things urgent that he should lift them once for all above the sectarian dogmatism of that hymn to a simple vision of gods light  he roused himself to the touching business of the laying on of hands while he did so the prepared substance of his second address was running through his mind the following prayer and collects he read without difficulty and so came to his second address his disposition at first was explanatory  when i spoke to you just now he began i fell unintentionally into the use of a greek word epitelesei it was written to me in a letter from a friend with another word that also i am now going to quote to you this letter touched very closely upon the things i want to say to you now and so these two words are very much in my mind the former one was taken from the epistle to the philippians it signifies he will complete the work begun the one i have now in mind comes from the epistle to the ephesians it is epiphauseior to be fuller epiphausei soi ho christos which signifies that he will shine upon us and this is very much in my thoughts now because i do believe that this world which seemed so very far from god a little while ago draws near now to an unexampled dawn god is at hand  it is your privilege it is your grave and terrible position that you have been born at the very end and collapse of a negligent age of an age of sham kingship sham freedom relaxation evasion greed waste falsehood and sinister preparation your lives open out in the midst of the breakdown for which that age prepared to you negligence is no longer possible there is cold and darkness there is the heat of the furnace before you you will live amidst extremes such as our youth never knew whatever betide you of your generation will have small chance of living untempered lives our country is at war and half mankind is at war death and destruction trample through the world men rot and die by the million food diminishes and fails there is a wasting away of all the hoarded resources of all the accumulated wellbeing of mankind and there is no clear prospect yet of any end to this enormous and frightful conflict why did it ever arise what made it possible it arose because men had forgotten god it was possible because they worshipped simulacra were loyal to phantoms of race and empire permitted themselves to be ruled and misled by idiot princes and usurper kings their minds were turned from god who alone can rule and unite mankind and so they have passed from the glare and follies of those former years into the darkness and anguish of the present day and in darkness and anguish they will remain until they turn to that king who comes to rule them until the sword and indignation of god have overthrown their misleaders and oppressors and the justice of god the kingdom of god set high over the republics of mankind has brought peace for ever to the world it is to this militant and imminent god to this immortal captain this undying lawgiver that you devote yourselves today  for he is imminent now he comes i have seen in the east and in the west the hearts and the minds and the wills of men turning to him as surely as when a needle is magnetized it turns towards the north even now as i preach to you here god stands over us all ready to receive us  and as he said these words the long nave of the cathedral the shadows of its fretted roof the brown choir with its golden screen the rows of seated figures became like some picture cast upon a flimsy and translucent curtain once more it seemed to the bishop that he saw god plain once more the glorious effulgence poured about him and the beautiful and wonderful conquest of mens hearts and lives was manifest to him  he lifted up his hands and cried to god and with an emotion so profound an earnestness so commanding that very many of those who were present turned their faces to see the figure to which he looked and spoke and some of the children had a strange persuasion of a presence there as of a divine figure militant armed and serene  oh god our leader and our master and our friend the bishop prayed forgive our imperfection and our little motives take us and make us one with thy great purpose use us and do not reject us make us all here servants of thy kingdom weave our lives into thy struggle to conquer and to bring peace and union to the world we are small and feeble creatures we are feeble in speech feebler still in action nevertheless let but thy light shine upon us and there is not one of us who cannot be lit by thy fire and who cannot lose himself in thy salvation take us into thy purpose o god let thy kingdom come into our hearts and into this world  his voice ceased and he stood for a measurable time with his arms extended and his face upturned  the golden clouds that whirled and eddied so splendidly in his brain thinned out his sense of gods immediacy faded and passed and he was left aware of the cathedral pulpit in which he stood so strangely posed and of the astonished congregation below him his arms sank to his side his eyes fell upon the book in front of him and he felt for and gripped the two upper corners of it and regardless of the common order and practice read out the benediction changing the words involuntarily as he read  the blessing of god who is the father the son the spirit and the king of all mankind be upon you and remain with you for ever amen  then he looked again as if to look once more upon that radiant vision of god but now he saw only the clear cool space of the cathedral vault and the coloured glass and tracery of the great rose window and then as the first notes of the organ came pealing above the departing stir of the congregation he turned about and descended slowly like one who is still half dreaming from the pulpit  13   in the vestry he found canon bliss help me to take off these garments the bishop said i shall never wear them again  you are ill said the canon scrutinizing his face  not ill but the word was taken out of my mouth i perceive now that i have been in a trance a trance in which the truth is real it is a fearful thing to find oneself among realities it is a dreadful thing when god begins to haunt a priest i can never minister in the church again  whippham thrust forward a chair for the bishop to sit down the bishop felt now extraordinarily fatigued he sat down heavily and rested his wrists on the arms of the chair already he resumed presently i begin to forget what it was i said  you became excited said bliss and spoke very loudly and clearly  what did i say  i dont know what you said i have forgotten i never want to remember things about the second advent dreadful things you said god was close at hand happily you spoke partly in greek i doubt if any of those children understood and you had a kind of lapsean aphasia you mutilated the interrogation and you did not pronounce the benediction properly you changed words and you put in words one sat frozenwaiting for what would happen next  we must postpone the pringle confirmation said whippham i wonder to whom i could telephone  lady ella appeared and came and knelt down by the bishops chair i never ought to have let this happen she said taking his wrists in her hands you are in a fever dear  it seemed entirely natural to say what i did the bishop declared  lady ella looked up at bliss  a doctor has been sent for said the canon to lady ella  i must speak to the doctor said lady ella as if her husband could not hear her there is something that will make things clearer to the doctor i must speak to the doctor for a moment before he sees him  came a gust of pretty sounds and a flash of bright colour that shamed the rich vestments at hand over the shoulder of the rector and quite at the back appeared lady sunderbund resolutely invading the vestry the rector intercepted her stood broad with extended arms  i must come in and speak to him if it is only fo a moment  the bishop looked up and saw lady ellas expression lady ella was sitting up very stiffly listening but not looking round  a vague horror and a passionate desire to prevent the entry of lady sunderbund at any cost seized upon the bishop she would he felt be the last overwhelming complication he descended to a base subterfuge he lay back in his chair slowly as though he unfolded himself he covered his eyes with his hand and then groaned aloud  leave me alone he cried in a voice of agony leave me alone i can see no one i canno more  there was a momentous silence and then the tumult of lady sunderbund receded     chapter the eighth  the new world  1   that night the bishop had a temperature of a hundred and a half the doctor pronounced him to be in a state of intense mental excitement aggravated by some drug he was a doctor modern and clearminded enough to admit that he could not identify the drug he overruled every one overruled the bishops declaration that he had done with the church that he could never mock god with his episcopal ministrations again that he must proceed at once with his resignation dont think of these things said the doctor banish them from your mind until your temperature is down to ninetyeight then after a rest you may go into them  lady ella insisted upon his keeping his room it was with difficulty that he got her to admit whippham and whippham was exasperatingly in order you need not trouble about anything now my lord he said everything will keep until you are ready to attend to it its well were through with easter bishop buncombe of eastern blowdesia was coming here anyhow and there is canon bliss theres only two ordination candidates because of the war well get on swimmingly  the bishop thought he would like to talk to those two ordination candidates but they prevailed upon him not to do so he lay for the best part of one night confiding remarkable things to two imaginary ordination candidates  he developed a marked liking for eleanors company she was home again now after a visit to some friends it was decided that the best thing to do with him would be to send him away in her charge a journey abroad was impossible france would remind him too dreadfully of the war his own mind turned suddenly to the sweet air of hunstanton he had gone there at times to read in the old cambridge days it is a terribly ugly place he said but it is wine in the veins  lady ella was doubtful about zeppelins thrice they had been right over hunstanton already they came in by the easy landmark of the wash  it will interest him said eleanor who knew her father better  2   one warm and still and sunny afternoon the bishop found himself looking out upon the waters of the wash he sat where the highest pebble layers of the beach reached up to a little cliff of sandy earth perhaps a foot high and he looked upon sands and sea and sky and saw that they were beautiful  he was a little blackgaitered object in a scene of the most exquisite and delicate colour right and left of him stretched the low grey salted shore pale banks of marly earth surmounted by greengrey wiry grass that held and was half buried in fine blown sand above the heavens made a complete hemisphere of blue in which a series of remote cumulus clouds floated and dissolved before him spread the long levels of the sands and far away at its utmost ebb was the sea eleanor had gone to explore the black ribs of a wrecked fishingboat that lay at the edge of a shallow lagoon she was a little pinkfooted figure very bright and apparently transparent she had reverted for a time to shameless childishness she had hidden her stockings among the reeds of the bank and she was running to and fro from starfish to razor shell and from cockle to weed the shingle was pale drab and purple close at hand but to the westward towards hunstanton the sands became brown and purple and were presently broken up into endless skerries of low flat weedcovered boulders and little intensely blue pools the sea was a band of sapphire that became silver to the west it met the silver shining sands in one delicate breathing edge of intensely white foam remote to the west very small and black and clear against the afternoon sky was a cart and about it was a score or so of musselgatherers a little nearer on an apparently empty stretch of shining wet sand a multitude of gulls was mysteriously busy these two groups of activities and eleanors flitting translucent movements did but set off and emphasize the immense and soothing tranquillity  for a long time the bishop sat passively receptive to this healing beauty then a little flow of thought began and gathered in his mind he had come out to think over two letters that he had brought with him he drew these now rather reluctantly from his pocket and after a long pause over the envelopes began to read them  he reread likemans letter first  likeman could not forgive him  my dear scrope he wrote your explanation explains nothing this sensational declaration of infidelity to our mother church made under the most damning and distressing circumstances in the presence of young and tender minds entrusted to your ministrations and in defiance of the honourable engagements implied in the confirmation service confirms my worst apprehensions of the weaknesses of your character i have always felt the touch of theatricality in your temperament the peculiar craving to be pseudodeeper pseudosimpler than us all the need of personal excitement i know that you were never quite contented to believe in god at secondhand you wanted to be taken notice ofpersonally except for some few hints to you i have never breathed a word of these doubts to any human being i have always hoped that the ripening that comes with years and experience would give you an increasing strength against the dangers of emotionalism and against your strong deep quiet sense of your exceptional personal importance  the bishop read thus far and then sat reflecting  was it just  he had many weaknesses but had he this egotism no that wasnt the justice of the case the old man bitterly disappointed was endeavouring to wound scrope asked himself whether he was to blame for that disappointment that was a more difficult question  he dismissed the charge at last crumpled up the letter in his hand and after a moments hesitation flung it away but he remained acutely sorry not so much for himself as for the revelation of likeman this letter made he had had a great affection for likeman and suddenly it was turned into a wound  3   the second letter was from lady sunderbund and it was an altogether more remarkable document lady sunderbund wrote on a notepaper that was evidently the result of a perverse research but she wrote a letter far more coherent than her speech and without that curious falling away of the rs that flavoured even her gravest observations with an unjust faint aroma of absurdity she wrote with a thin pen in a rounded boyish handwriting she italicized with slashes of the pen  he held this letter in both hands between his knees and considered it now with an expression that brought his eyebrows forward until they almost met and that tucked in the corners of his mouth  my dear bishop it began  i keep thinking and thinking and thinking of that wonderful service of the wonderful wonderful things you said and the wonderful choice you made of the moment to say themwhen all those young lives were coming to the great serious thing in life it was most beautifully done at any rate dear bishop and teacher it was most beautifully begun and now we all stand to you like creditors because you have given us so much that you owe us ever so much more you have started us and you have to go on with us you have broken the shell of the old church and here we are running about with nowhere to go you have to make the shelter of a new church now for us purged of errors looking straight to god the king of mankindwhat a wonderful wonderful phrase that is it says everything tell us more of him and more count me firstnot foremost but just the little one that runs in firstamong your disciples they say you are resigning your position in the church of course that must be true you are coming out of itwhat did you call itcoming out of the cracked old vessel from which you have poured the living waters i called on lady ella yesterday she did not tell me very much i think she is a very reserved as well as a very dignified woman but she said that you intended to go to london in london then i suppose you will set up the first altar to the divine king i want to help  dear bishop and teacher i want to help tremendouslywith all my heart and all my soul i want to be let do things for you the you was erased by three or four rapid slashes and our king substituted  i want to be privileged to help build that first church of the world unified under god it is a dreadful thing to says but you see i am very rich this dreadful war has made me ever so much richersteel and shipping and thingsit is my trustees have done it i am ashamed to be so rich i want to give i want to give and help this great beginning of yours i want you to let me help on the temporal side to make it easy for you to stand forth and deliver your message amidst suitable surroundings and without any horrid worries on account of the sacrifices you have made please do not turn my offering aside i have never wanted anything so much in all my life as i want to make this gift unless i can make it i feel that for me there is no salvation i shall stick with my loads and loads of stocks and shares and horrid possessions outside the needles eye but if i could build a temple for god and just live somewhere near it so as to be the poor woman who sweeps out the chapels and die perhaps and be buried under its floor dont smile at me i mean every word of it years ago i thought of such a thing after i had visited the certosa di paviado you know it so beautiful and those two still alabaster figuresrecumbent but until now i could never see my way to any such service now i do i am all afire to do it help me tell me let me stand behind you and make your mission possible i feel i have come to the most wonderful phase in my life i feel my call has come  i have written this letter over three times and torn each of them up i do so want to say all this and it is so desperately hard to say i am full of fears that you despise me i know there is a sort of high colour about me my passion for brightness i am absurd but inside of me is a soul a real living breathing soul crying out to you oh let me help let me help i will do anything i will endure anything if only i can keep hold of the vision splendid you gave me in the cathedral i see it now day and night the dream of the place i can make for youand you preaching my fingers itch to begin the day before yesterday i said to myself i am quite unworthy i am a worldly woman a rich smart decorated woman he will never accept me as i am i took off all my jewels every one i looked through all my clothes and at last i decided i would have made for me a very simple straight grey dress just simple and straight and grey perhaps you will think that too is absurd of me too selfconscious i would not tell of it to you if i did not want you to understand how alive i am to my utter impossibilities how resolved i am to do anything so that i may be able to serve but never mind about silly me let me tell you how i see the new church  i think you ought to have some place near the centre of london not too west for you might easily become fashionable not too east because you might easily be swallowed up in merely philanthropic work but somewhere between the two there must be vacant sites still to be got round about kingsway and there we must set up your tabernacle a very plain very simple very beautifully proportioned building in which you can give your message i know a young man just the very young man to do something of the sort something quite new quite modern and yet solemn and serious lady ella seemed to think you wanted to live somewhere in the northwest of londonbut she would tell me very little i seem to see you not there at all not in anything between westend and suburb but yourself as central as your mind in a kind of clergy house that will be part of the building that is how it is in my dream anyhow all that though can be settled afterwards my imagination and my desire is running away with me it is no time yet for premature plans not that i am not planning day and night this letter is simply to offer i just want to offer here i am and all my worldly goods take me i pray you and not only pray you take me i demand of you in the name of god our king i have a right to be used and you have no right to refuse me you have to go on with your message and it is your duty to take mejust as you are obliged to step on any steppingstone that lies on your way to do god service and so i am waiting i shall be waitingon thorns i know you will take your time and think but do not take too much time think of me waiting  your servant your most humble helper in god your god  agatha sunderbund   and then scrawled along the margin of the last sheet   if when you knowa telegram even if you cannot say so much as agreed still such a word as favourable i just hang over the void until i hear  agatha s   a letter demanding enormous deliberation she argued closely in spite of her italics it had never dawned upon the bishop before how light is the servitude of the disciple in comparison with the servitude of the master in many ways this proposal repelled and troubled him in many ways it attracted him and the argument of his clear obligation to accept her cooperation gripped him it was a good argument  and besides it worked in very conveniently with certain other difficulties that perplexed him  4   the bishop became aware that eleanor was returning to him across the sands she had made an end to her paddling she had put on her shoes and stockings and become once more the grave and responsible young woman who had been taking care of him since his flight from princhester he replaced the two letters in his pocket and sat ready to smile as she drew near he admired her open brow the toss of her hair and the poise of her head upon her neck it was good to note that her hard reading at cambridge hadnt bent her shoulders in the least  well old dad she said as she drew near youve got back a colour  ive got back everything its time i returned to princhester  not in this weather not for a day or so she flung herself at his feet consider your overworked little daughter ohhow good this is  no said the bishop in a grave tone that made her look up into his face i must go hack  he met her clear gaze what do you think of all this business eleanor he asked abruptly do you think i had a sort of fit in the cathedral  he winced as he asked the question  daddy she said after a little pause the things you said and did that afternoon were the noblest you ever did in your life i wish i had been there it must have been splendid to be there ive not told you beforeive been dying to id promised not to say a wordnot to remind you i promised the doctor but now you ask me now you are well again i can tell you kitty kingdom has told me all about it how it felt it was like light and order coming into a hopeless dark muddle what you said was like what we have all been trying to thinki mean all of us young people suddenly it was all clear  she stopped short she was breathless with the excitement of her confession  her father too remained silent for a little while he was reminded of his weakness he was he perceived still a little hysterical he felt that he might weep at her youthful enthusiasm if he did not restrain himself  im glad he said and patted her shoulder im glad norah  she looked away from him out across the lank brown sands and water pools to the sea it was what we have all been feeling our way towards the absolute simplification of religion the absolute simplification of politics and social duty just god just god the king  but should i have said thatin the cathedral  she felt no scruples you had to she said  but now think what it means he said i must leave the church  as a man strips off his coat for a fight  that doesnt dismay you  she shook her head and smiled confidently to sea and sky  im glad if youre with me he said sometimesi thinkim not a very selfreliant man  youll have all the world with you she was convinced in a little time  perhaps rather a longer time than you think norah in the meantime  she turned to him once more  in the meantime there are a great many things to consider young people they say never think of the transport that is needed to win a battle i have it in my mind that i should leave the church but i cant just walk out into the marketplace and begin preaching there i see the family furniture being carried out of the palace and put into vans it has to go somewhere  i suppose you will go to london  possibly in fact certainly i have a plan or at least an opportunity but that isnt what i have most in mind these things are not done without emotion and a considerable strain upon ones personal relationships i do not think thisi do not think your mother sees things as we do  she will said young enthusiasm when she understands  i wish she did but i have been unlucky in the circumstances of my explanations to her and of course you understand all this means riskspoverty perhapsgoing without thingstravel opportunity nice possessionsfor all of us a loss of position too all this sort of thing he stuck out a gaitered calf and smiled will have to go people some of them may be disasagreeable to us  after all daddy she said smiling it isnt so bad as the cross and the lions and burning pitch and you have the truth  you do believe he left his sentence unfinished  she nodded her face aglow we know you have the truth  of course in my own mind now it is very clear i had a kind of illumination he would have tried to tell her of his vision and he was too shy it came to me suddenly that the whole world was in confusion because men followed after a thousand different immediate aims when really it was quite easy if only one could be simple it was quite easy to show that nearly all men could only be fully satisfied and made happy in themselves by one single aim which was also the aim that would make the whole world one great order and that aim was to make god king of ones heart and the whole world i saw that all this world except for a few base monstrous spirits was suffering hideous things because of this war and before the war it was full of folly waste social injustice and suspicion for the same reason because it had not realized the kingship of god and that is so simple the essence of god is simplicity the sin of this war lies with men like myself men who set up to tell people about god more than it lies with any other class  kings she interjected diplomatists finance  yes those men could only work mischief in the world because the priests and teachers let them all things human lie at last at the door of the priest and teacher who differentiate who qualify and complicate who make mean unnecessary elaborations and so divide mankind if it were not for the weakness and wickedness of the priests every one would know and understand god every one who was modest enough not to set up for particular knowledge men disputed whether god is finite or infinite whether he has a triple or a single aspect how should they know all we need to know is the face he turns to us they impose their horrible creeds and distinctions none of those things matter call him christ the god or call him simply god allah heaven it does not matter he comes to us we know like a helper and friend that is all we want to know you may speculate further if you like but it is not religion they dispute whether he can set aside nature but that is superstition he is either master of nature and he knows that it is good or he is part of nature and must obey that is an argument for hairsplitting metaphysicians either answer means the same for us it does not matter which way we come to believe that he does not idly set the course of things aside obviously he does not set the course of things aside what he does do for certain is to give us courage and save us from our selfishness and the bitter hell it makes for us and every one knows too what sort of things we want and for what end we want to escape from ourselves we want to do right and right if you think clearly is just truth within and service without the service of gods kingdom which is mankind the service of human needs and the increase of human power and experience it is all perfectly plain it is all quite easy for any one to understand who isnt misled and chattered at and threatened and poisoned by evil priests and teachers  and you are going to preach that daddy  if i can when i am freeyou know i have still to resign and give upi shall make that my message  and so god comes  god comes as men perceive him in his simplicity let men but see god simply and forthwith god and his kingdom possess the world  she looked out to sea in silence for awhile  then she turned to her father and you think that his kingdom will comeperhaps in quite a little timeperhaps in our lifetimes and that all these ridiculous or wicked little kings and emperors and these political parties and these policies and conspiracies and this nationalist nonsense and all the patriotism and rowdyism all the private profitseeking and every baseness in life all the things that it is so horrible and disgusting to be young among and powerless among you think they will fade before him  the bishop pulled his faith together  they will fade before himbut whether it will take a lifetime or a hundred lifetimes or a thousand lifetimes my norah  he smiled and left his sentence unfinished and she smiled back at him to show she understood  and then he confessed further because he did not want to seem merely sentimentally hopeful  when i was in the cathedral norahand just before that service it seemed to meit was very real it seemed that perhaps the kingdom of god is nearer than we suppose that it needs but the faith and courage of a few and it may be that we may even live to see the dawning of his kingdom evenwho knowsthe sunrise i am so full of faith and hope that i fear to be hopeful with you but whether it is near or far  we work for it said eleanor  eleanor thought eyes downcast for a little while and then looked up  it is so wonderful to talk to you like this daddy in the old days i didnt dreambefore i went to newnham i misjudged you i thought never mind what i thought it was silly but now i am so proud of you and so happy to be back with you daddy and find that your religion is after all just the same religion that i have been wanting     chapter the ninth  the third vision  1   one afternoon in october four months and more after that previous conversation the card of mr edward scrope was brought up to dr brightonpomfrey the name awakened no memories the doctor descended to discover a man so obviously in unaccustomed plain clothes that he had a momentary disagreeable idea that he was facing a detective then he saw that this secular disguise draped the familiar form of his old friend the former bishop of princhester scrope was pale and a little untidy he had already acquired something of the peculiar slightly faded quality one finds in a don who has gone to hampstead and fallen amongst advanced thinkers and got mixed up with the fabian society his anxious eyes and faintly propitiatory manner suggested an impending appeal  dr brightonpomfrey had the savoirfaire of a successful consultant he prided himself on being all things to all men but just for an instant he was at a loss what sort of thing he had to be here then he adopted the genial kindly but by no means lavishly generous tone advisable in the case of a man who has suffered considerable social deterioration without being very seriously to blame  dr brightonpomfrey was a little roundfaced man with defective eyesight and an unsuitable nose for the glasses he wore and he flauntedgod knows whyenormous sidewhiskers  well he said balancing the glasses skilfully by throwing back his head and how are you and what can i do for you theres no external evidence of trouble youre looking lean and a little pale but thoroughly fit  yes said the late bishop im fairly fit  only said the doctor smiling his teeth with something of the manner of an old bathing woman who tells a child to jump  well im run down andworried  wed better sit down said the great doctor professionally and looked hard at him then he pulled at the arm of a chair  the exbishop sat down and the doctor placed himself between his patient and the light  this business of resigning my bishopric and so forth has involved very considerable strains scrope began that i think is the essence of the trouble one cuts so many associations i did not realize how much feeling there would be difficulties too of readjusting ones position  zactly zactly zactly said the doctor snapping his face and making his glasses vibrate run down want a tonic or a change  yes in facti want a particular tonic  dr brightonpomfrey made his eyes and mouth round and interrogative  while you were away last spring  had to go said the doctor unavoidable gas gangrene certain enquiries these young investigators all very well in their way but we older reputationsexperience maturity of judgment cant do without us yes  well i came here last spring and saw an assistant i suppose he was or a supplydo you call them supplies in your professionnamed i thinklet me seed  dale  the doctor as he uttered this word set his face to the unaccustomed exercise of expressing malignity his round blue eyes sought to blaze small cherubic muscles exerted themselves to pucker his brows his colour became a violent pink lunatic he said dangerous lunatic he didnt do anythinganything bad in your case did he  he was evidently highly charged with grievance in this matter that man was sent to me from cambridge with the highest testimonials the very highest i had to go at twentyfour hours notice enquirygas gangrene there was nothing for it but to leave things in his hands  dr brightonpomfrey disavowed responsibility with an open stumpyfingered hand  he did me no particular harm said scrope  you are the first he spared said dr brightonpomfrey  did he was he unskilful  unskilful is hardly the word  were his methods peculiar  the little doctor sprang to his feet and began to pace about the room peculiar he said it was abominable that they should send him to me abominable  he turned with all the round knobs that constituted his face aglow his sidewhiskers waved apart like wings about to flap he protruded his face towards his seated patient i am glad that he has been killed he said glad there  his glasses fell offshocked beyond measure he did not heed them they swung about in front of him as if they sought to escape while he poured out his feelings  fool he spluttered with demonstrative gestures dangerous fool his one ideato upset everybody drugs sir the most terrible drugs i come back find ladies high social position morphinemaniacs others reckless use of the most dangerous expedients cocaine not in it stimulantsviolent stimulants in the highest quarters terrible exalted persons royalty anxious to be given war work and become anonymous horrible hes been a terrible influence one ideato disturb soul and body minds unhinged personal relations deranged shattered the practice of years the harm he has done the harm  he looked as though he was trying to burstas a final expression of wrath he failed his hands felt trembling to recover his pincenez then from his tail pocket he produced a large silk handkerchief and wiped the glasses replaced them wriggled his head in his collar running his fingers round his neck patted his tie  excuse this outbreak he said but dr dale has inflicted injuries  scrope got up walked slowly to the window clasping his hands behind his back and turned his manner still retained much of his episcopal dignity i am sorry but still you can no doubt tell from your books what it was he gave me it was a tonic that had a very great effect on me and i need it badly now  dr brightonpomfrey was quietly malignant he kept no diary at all he said no diary at all  but  if he did said dr brightonpomfrey holding up a flat hand and wagging it from side to side i wouldnt follow his treatment he intensified with the hand going faster i wouldnt follow his treatment not under any circumstances  naturally said scrope if the results are what you say but in my case it wasnt a treatment i was sleepless confused in my mind wretched and demoralized i came here and he just produced the stuffit clears the head it clears the mind one seems to get away from the cloud of things to get through to essentials and fundamentals it straightened me out you must know such a stuff just now confronted with all sorts of problems arising out of my resignation i want that tonic effect again i must have it i have matters to decideand i cant decide i find myself uncertain changeable from hour to hour i dont ask you to take up anything of this man dales this is a new occasion but i want that drug  at the beginning of this speech dr brightonpomfreys hands had fallen to his hips as scrope went on the doctors pose had stiffened his head had gone a little on one side he had begun to play with his glasses at the end he gave vent to one or two short coughs and then pointed his words with his glasses held out  tell me he said tell me cough had this drug that cleared your headanything to do with your resignation  and he put on his glasses disconcertingly and threw his head back to watch the reply  it did help to clear up the situation  exactly said dr brightonpomfrey in a tone that defined his own position with remorseless clearness exactly and he held up a flat arresting hand   my dear sir he said how can you expect me to help you to a drug so disastrouseven if i could tell you what it is  but it was not disastrous to me said scrope  your extraordinary resignationyour still more extraordinary way of proclaiming it  i dont think those were disasters  but my dear sir  you dont want to discuss theology with me i know so let me tell you simply that from my point of view the illumination that came to methis drug of dr dales helpinghas been the great release of my life it crystallized my mind it swept aside the confusing commonplace things about me just for a time i saw truth clearly i want to do so again  why  there is a crisis in my affairsnever mind what but i cannot see my way clear  dr brightonpomfrey was meditating now with his eyes on his carpet and the corners of his mouth tucked in he was swinging his glasses pendulumwise tell me he said looking sideways at scrope what were the effects of this drug it may have been anything how did it give you thisthis vision of the truththat led to your resignation  scrope felt a sudden shyness but he wanted dales drug again so badly that he obliged himself to describe his previous experiences to the best of his ability  it was he said in a matteroffact tone a golden transparent liquid very golden like a warmtinted chablis when water was added it became streaked and opalescent with a kind of living quiver in it i held it up to the light  yes and when you took it  i felt suddenly clearer my mindi had a kind of exaltation and assurance  your mind dr brightonpomfrey assisted began to go twentynine to the dozen  it felt stronger and clearer said scrope sticking to his quest  and did things look as usual asked the doctor protruding his knobby little face like a clenched fist  no said scrope and regarded him how much was it possible to tell a man of this type  they differed said the doctor relaxing  yes well to be plain i had an immediate sense of god i saw the worldas if it were a transparent curtain and then god becameevident is it possible for that to determine the drug  god becameevident the doctor said with some distaste and shook his head slowly then in a sudden sharp crossexamining tone you mean you had a vision actually saw um  it was in the form of a vision scrope was now mentally very uncomfortable indeed  the doctors lips repeated these words noiselessly with an effect of contempt he must have given you somethingits a little like morphia but goldenopalescent and it was this vision made you astonish us all with your resignation  that was part of a larger process said scrope patiently i had been drifting into a complete repudiation of the anglican positions long before that all that this drug did was to make clear what was already in my mind and give it value act as a developer  the doctor suddenly gave way to a botryoidal hilarity to think that one should be consulted about visions of godin mount street he said and you know you know you half want to believe that vision was real you know you do  so far scrope had been resisting his realization of failure now he gave way to an exasperation that made him reckless of brightonpomfreys opinion i do think he said that that drug did in some way make god real to me i think i saw god  dr brightonpomfrey shook his head in a way that made scrope want to hit him  i think i saw god he repeated more firmly i had a sudden realization of how great he was and how great life was and how timid and mean and sordid were all our genteel professional lives i was seized upon for a time i was altogether possessed by a passion to serve him fitly and recklessly to make an end to compromises with comfort and selflove and secondary things and i want to hold to that i want to get back to that i am given to lassitudes i relax i am by temperament an easygoing man i want to buck myself up i want to get on with my larger purposes and i find myself tired muddled entangled the drug was a good thing for me it was a good thing i want its help again  i know no more than you do what it was  are there no other drugs that you do know that have a kindred effect if for example i tried morphia in some form  youd get visions they wouldnt be divine visions if you took small quantities very discreetly you might get a temporary quickening but the swift result of all repeated drugtaking is i can assure you moral decayrapid moral decay to touch drugs habitually is to become hopelessly unpunctual untruthful callously selfish and insincere i am talking mere textbook mere everyday commonplaces to you when i tell you that  i had an idea i had a hope  youve a stiff enough fight before you said the doctor without such a handicap as that  you wont help me  the doctor walked up and down his hearthrug and then delivered himself with an extended hand and waggling fingers  i wouldnt if i could for your good i wouldnt and even if i would i couldnt for i dont know the drug one of his infernal brews no doubt somethingaccidental its lostfor goodfor your good anyhow  2   scrope halted outside the stucco portals of the doctors house he hesitated whether he should turn to the east or the west  that door closes he said theres no getting back that way  he stood for a time on the kerb he turned at last towards park lane and hyde park he walked along thoughtfully inattentively steering a course for his new home in pembury road notting hill  3   at the outset of this new phase in scropes life that had followed the crisis of the confirmation service everything had seemed very clear before him he believed firmly that he had been shown god that he had himself stood in the presence of god and that there had been a plain call to him to proclaim god to the world he had realized god and it was the task of every one who had realized god to help all mankind to the same realization the proposal of lady sunderbund had fallen in with that idea he had been steeling himself to a prospect of struggle and dire poverty but her prompt loyalty had come as an immense relief to his anxiety for his wife and family when he had talked to eleanor upon the beach at hunstanton it had seemed to him that his course was manifest perhaps a little severe but by no means impossible they had sat together in the sunshine exalted by a sense of fine adventure and confident of success they had looked out upon the future upon the great near future in which the idea of god was to inspire and reconstruct the world  it was only very slowly that this pristine clearness became clouded and confused it had not been so easy as eleanor had supposed to win over the sympathy of lady ella with his resignation indeed it had not been won over she had become a stern and chilling companion mute now upon the issue of his resignation but manifestly resentful he was secretly disappointed and disconcerted by her tone and the same hesitation of the mind instinctive rather than reasoned that had prevented a frank explanation of his earlier doubts to her now restrained him from telling her naturally and at once of the part that lady sunderbund was to play in his future ministry in his own mind he felt assured about that part but in order to excuse his delay in being frank with his wife he told himself that he was not as yet definitely committed to lady sunderbunds project and in accordance with that idea he set up housekeeping in london upon a scale that implied a very complete cessation of income as yet he told lady ella we do not know where we stand for a time we must not so much house ourselves as camp we must take some quite small and modest house in some less expensive district if possible i would like to take it for a year until we know better how things are with us  he reviewed a choice of london districts  lady ella said her bitterest thing does it matter where we hide our heads  that wrung him to we are not hiding our heads  she repented at once i am sorry ted she said it slipped from me  he called it camping but the house they had found in pembury road notting hill was more darkened and less airy than any camp neither he nor his wife had ever had any experience of middleclass househunting or middleclass housekeeping before and they spent three of the most desolating days of their lives in looking for this cheap and modest shelter for their household possessions hitherto life had moved them from one established and comfortable home to another their worst affliction had been the modern decorations of the palace at princhester and it was altogether a revelation to them to visit house after house illlit illplanned with dingy paint and peeling wallpaper kitchens for the most part underground and either without bathrooms or with builtout bathrooms that were manifestly grudging afterthoughts such as harbour the respectable middle classes of london the house agents perceived intimations of helplessness in their manner adopted a rushing method with them strange to people who had hitherto lived in a glowing halo of episcopal dignity take it or leave it was the note of those gentlemen there are always people ready for houses the line that property in land and houses takes in england the exbishop realized is always to hold up and look scornful the position of the landowning houseowning class in a crowded country like england is ultraregal it is under no obligation to be of use and people are obliged to get down to the land somewhere they cannot conduct business and rear families in the air englands necessity is the landlords opportunity  scrope began to generalize about this and develop a new and sincerer streak of socialism in his ideas the church has been very remiss he said as he and lady ella stared at the basement breakfast room of their twentyseventh dismal possibility it should have insisted far more than it has done upon the landlords responsibility no one should tolerate the offer of such a house as thisat such a rentto decent people it is unrighteous  at the house agents he asked in a cold intelligent rulingclass voice the name of the offending landlord  its all the property of the ecclesiastical commissioners that side of the railway said the agent picking his teeth with a pin lazy lot dreadfully hard to get em to do anything own some of the worst properties in london  lady ella saw things differently again if you had stayed in the church she said afterwards you might have helped to alter such things as that  at the time he had no answer  but he said presently as they went back in the tube to their modest bloomsbury hotel if i had stayed in the church i should never have realized things like that  4   but it does no justice to lady ella to record these two unavoidable expressions of regret without telling also of the rallying courage with which she presently took over the task of resettling herself and her stricken family her husbands change of opinion had fallen upon her out of a clear sky without any premonition in one tremendous day in one day there had come clamouring upon her with an effect of revelation after revelation the ideas of drugs of heresy and blasphemy of an alien feminine influence of the entire moral and material breakdown of the man who had been the centre of her life never was the whole world of a woman so swiftly and comprehensively smashed all the previous troubles of her life seemed infinitesimal in comparison with any single item in this dismaying debacle she tried to consolidate it in the idea that he was ill disordered she assured herself that he would return from hunstanton restored to health and orthodoxy with all his threatenings of a resignation recalled the man she had loved and trusted to succeed in the world and to do right always according to her ideas it was only with extreme reluctance that she faced the fact that with the fumes of the drug dispelled and all signs of nervous exhaustion gone he still pressed quietly but resolutely toward a severance from the church she tried to argue with him and she found she could not argue the church was a crystal sphere in which her life was wholly contained her mind could not go outside it even to consider a dissentient proposition  while he was at hunstanton every day she had prayed for an hour some days she had prayed for several hours in the cathedral kneeling upon a harsh hassock that hurt her knees even in her prayers she could not argue nor vary she prayed over and over again many hundreds of times bring him back dear lord bring him back again  in the past he had always been a very kind and friendly mate to her but sometimes he had been irritable about small things especially during his seasons of insomnia now he came back changed a much graver man rather older in his manner carefully attentive to her kinder and more watchful at times astonishingly apologetic but rigidly set upon his purpose of leaving the church i know you do not think with me in this he said i have to pray you to be patient with me i have struggled with my conscience for a time it means hardship i know poverty but if you will trust me i think i shall be able to pull through there are ways of doing my work perhaps we shall not have to undergo this cramping in this house for very long  it is not the poverty i fear said lady ella  and she did face the worldly situation if a little sadly at any rate with the courage of practical energy it was she who stood in one ungainly house after another and schemed how to make discomforts tolerable while scrope raged unhelpfully at landlordism and the responsibility of the church for economic disorder it was she who at last took decisions into her hands when he was too jaded to do anything but generalize weakly and settled upon the house in pembury road which became their london home she got him to visit hunstanton again for half a week while she and miriam who was the practical genius of the family moved in and made the new home presentable at the best it was barely presentable there were many plain hardships the girls had to share one of the chief bedrooms in common instead of their jolly little individual dens at princhester one little room was all that could be squeezed out as a study for father it was not really a separate room it was merely cut off by closed folding doors from the diningroom folding doors that slowly transmitted the dinner flavours to a sensitive worker and its window looked out upon a blackened and uneventful yard and the skylights of a populous conversational and highspirited millinery establishment that had been built over the corresponding garden of the house in restharrow street lady ella had this room lined with open shelves and clementina in the absence of eleanor at newuham arranged the pick of her fathers books it is to be noted as a fact of psychological interest that this cramped illlit little room distressed lady ella more than any other of the discomforts of their new quarters the bishops writingdesk filled a whole side of it parsimony ruled her mind but she could not resist the impulse to get him at least a seemly readinglamp  he came back from hunstanton full of ideas for work in london he was he thought going to write something about his views he was very grateful and much surprised at what she had done to that forbidding house and full of hints and intimations that it would not be long before they moved to something roomier she was disposed to seek some sort of salaried employment for clementina and miriam at least but he would not hear of that they must go on and get educated he said if i have to give up smoking to do it perhaps i may manage even without that eleanor it seemed had a good prospect of a scholarship at the london school of economics that would practically keep her there would be no cambridge for clementina but london university might still be possible with a little pinching and the move to london had really improved the prospects of a good musical training for miriam phoebe and daphne lady ella believed might get in on special terms at the notting hill high school  scrope found it difficult to guess at what was going on in the heads of his younger daughters none displayed such sympathy as eleanor had confessed he had a feeling that his wife had schooled them to say nothing about the change in their fortunes to him but they quarrelled a good deal he could hear about the use of the one bathroomthere was never enough hot water after the second bath and miriam did not seem to enjoy playing the new upright piano in the drawingroom as much as she had done the princhester grand it replaced though she was always willing to play that thing he liked he knew now that it was the adagio of of 111 whenever he asked for it  london servants lady ella found were now much more difficult to get than they had been in the holy innocents days in st johns wood and more difficult to manage when they were got the households of the more prosperous clergy are much sought after by domestics of a serious and excellent type an unfrocked clergymans household is by no means so attractive the first comers were young women of unfortunate dispositions the first cook was reluctant and insolent she went before her month was up the second careless she made burnt potatoes and cindered chops underboiled and overboiled eggs a dropped look about everything harsh coffee and bitter tea seemed to be a natural aspect of the state of being no longer a bishop he would often after a struggle with his nerves in the bedroom come humming cheerfully to breakfast to find that phoebe who was a delicate eater had pushed her plate away scarcely touched while lady ella sat at the end of the table in a state of dangerous calm framing comments for delivering downstairs that would be sure to sting and yet leave no opening for repartee and trying at the same time to believe that a third cook if the chances were risked again would certainly be all right  the drawingroom was papered with a morose wallpaper that the landlord in view of the fact that scrope in his optimism would only take the house on a yearly agreement had refused to replace it was a design of very dark green leaves and grey gothic arches and the apartment was lit by a chandelier which spilt a pool of light in the centre of the room and splashed useless weak patches elsewhere lady ella had to interfere to prevent the monopolization of this centre by phoebe and daphne for their home work this light trouble was difficult to arrange the plain truth was that there was not enough illumination to go round in the princhester drawingroom there had been a number of obliging little electric pushes the size of the diningroom now that the study was cut off from it forbade hospitality as it was with only the family at home the housemaid made it a grievance that she could scarcely squeeze by on the sideboard side to wait  the house vibrated to the trains in the adjacent underground railway there was a lady next door but one who was very pluckily training a contralto voice that most people would have gladly thrown away at the end of restharrow street was a garage and a yard where chauffeurs were accustomed to tune up their engines all these facts were persistently audible to any one sitting down in the little back study to think out this project of writing something about a change in the government of the whole world petty inconveniences no doubt all these inconveniences were but they distressed a rather oversensitive mind which was also acutely aware that even upon this scale living would cost certainly two hundred and fifty pounds if not more in excess of the little private income available   5   these domestic details irrelevant as they may seem in a spiritual history need to be given because they added an intimate keenness to scropes readiness for this private chapel enterprise that he was discussing with lady sunderbund along that line and along that line alone he saw the way of escape from the great sea of london dinginess that threatened to submerge his family and it was also he felt the line of his duty it was his call  at least that was how he felt at first and then matters began to grow complicated again  things had gone far between himself and lady sunderbund since that letter he had read upon the beach at old hunstanton the blinds of the house with the very very blue door in princhester had been drawn from the day when the first vanload of the renegade bishops private possessions had departed from the palace the lady had returned to the brightly decorated flat overlooking hyde park he had seen her repeatedly since then and always with a fairly clear understanding that she was to provide the chapel and pulpit in which he was to proclaim to london the gospel of the simplicity and universality of god he was to be the prophet of a reconsidered faith calling the whole world from creeds and sects from egotisms and vain loyalties from prejudices of race and custom to the worship and service of the divine king of all mankind that in fact had been the ruling resolve in his mind the resolve determining his relations not only with lady sunderbund but with lady ella and his family his friends enemies and associates he had set out upon this course unchecked by any doubt and overriding the manifest disapproval of his wife and his younger daughters lady sunderbunds enthusiasm had been enormous and sustaining  almost imperceptibly that resolve had weakened imperceptibly at first then the decline had been perceived as one sometimes perceives a thing in the background out of the corner of ones eye  in all his early anticipations of the chapel enterprise he had imagined himself in the likeness of a small but eloquent figure standing in a large exposed place and calling this lost misled world back to god lady sunderbund he assumed was to provide the large exposed place which was dimly paved with pews and guarantee that little matter which was to relieve him of sordid anxieties for his family the stipend he had agreed in an inattentive way that this was to be eight hundred a year with a certain proportion of the subscriptions at first i shall be the chief subscriber she said before the rush comes he had been so content to take all this for granted and think no more about itmore particularly to think no more about itthat for a time he entirely disregarded the intense decorative activities into which lady sunderbund incontinently plunged had he been inclined to remark them he certainly might have done so even though a considerable proportion was being thoughtfully veiled for a time from his eyes  for example there was the young architect with the wonderful tie whom he met once or twice at lunch in the hyde park flat this young man pulled the conversation again and again lady sunderbund aiding and abetting in the direction of the ideal church it was his ambition he said someday to build an ideal church divorced from tradition  scrope had been drawn at last into a dissertation he said that hitherto all temples and places of worship had been conditioned by orientation due to the seasonal aspects of religion they pointed to the west oras in the case of the egyptian templesto some particular star and by sacramentalism which centred everything on a highly lit sacrificial altar it was almost impossible to think of a church built upon other lines than that the architect would be so free that  absolutely free interrupted the young architect he might for example build a temple like a star  or like some wondyful casket said lady sunderbund  and also there was a musician with fuzzy hair and an impulsive way of taking the salted almonds who wanted to know about religious music  scrope hazarded the idea that a chanting people was a religious people he said moreover that there was a fine religiosity about moussorgski but that the most beautiful single piece of music in the world was beethovens sonata opus 111he was thinking he said more particularly of the adagio at the end molto semplice e cantabile it had a real quality of divinity  the musician betrayed impatience at the name of beethoven and thought with his mouth appreciatively full of salted almonds that nowadays we had got a little beyond that anyhow  we shall be superhuman before we get beyond either purcell or beethoven said scrope  nor did he attach sufficient importance to lady sunderbunds disposition to invite positivists members of the brotherhood church leaders among the christian scientists old followers of the rev charles voysey swedenborgians moslem converts indian theosophists psychic phenomena and so forth to meet him nevertheless it began to drift into his mind that he was by no means so completely in control of the new departure as he had supposed at first both he and lady sunderbund professed universalism but while his was the universalism of one who would simplify to the bare fundamentals of a common faith hers was the universalism of the collector religion to him was something that illuminated the soul to her it was something that illuminated prayerbooks for a considerable time they followed their divergent inclinations without any realization of their divergence none the less a vague doubt and dissatisfaction with the prospect before him arose to cloud his confidence  at first there was little or no doubt of his own faith he was still altogether convinced that he had to confess and proclaim god in his life he was as sure that god was the necessary king and saviour of mankind and of a mans life as he was of the truth of the binomial theorem but what began first to fade was the idea that he had been specially called to proclaim the true god to all the world he would have the most amiable conference with lady sunderbund and then as he walked back to notting hill he would suddenly find stuck into his mind like a challenge heaven knows how another prophet even if he succeeded in this mission enterprise he found himself asking what would he be but just a little westend mahomet he would have founded another sect and we have to make an end to all sects how is there to be an end to sects if there are still to be chapelsrichly decorated chapelsand congregations and salaried specialists in god  that was a very disconcerting idea it was particularly active at night he did his best to consider it with a cool detachment regardless of the facts that his private income was just under three hundred pounds a year and that his experiments in cultured journalism made it extremely improbable that the most sedulous literary work would do more than double this scanty sum yet for all that these nasty ugly sordid facts were entirely disregarded they did somehow persist in coming in and squatting down shapeless in a black corner of his mindfrom which their eyes shone out so to speakwhenever his doubt whether he ought to set up as a prophet at all was under consideration  6   then very suddenly on this october afternoon the situation had come to a crisis  he had gone to lady sunderbunds flat to see the plans and drawings for the new church in which he was to give his message to the world they had brought home to him the complete realization of lady sunderbunds impossibility he had attempted upon the spur of the moment an explanation of just how much they differed and he had precipitated a storm of extravagantly perplexing emotions  she kept him waiting for perhaps ten minutes before she brought the plans to him he waited in the little room with the wyndham lewis picture that opened upon the balcony painted with crazy squares of livid pink on a golden table by the window a number of recently bought books were lying and he went and stood over these taking them up one after another the first was the countess of huntingdon and her circle that bearder of lightminded archbishops that formidable harbourer of wesleyan chaplains for some minutes he studied the grim portrait of this inspired lady standing with one foot ostentatiously on her coronet and then turned to the next volume this was a life of saint teresa that energetic organizer of spanish nunneries the third dealt with madame guyon it was difficult not to feel that lady sunderbund was reading for a part  she entered  she was wearing a long simple dress of spangled white with a very high waist she had a bracelet of green jade a waistband of green silk and her hair was held by a wreath of artificial laurel very stiff and green her arms were full of big rolls of cartridge paper and tracing paper im so pleased she said its eady at last and i can show you  she banged the whole armful down upon a vivid little table of inlaid black and white wood he rescued one or two rolls and a sheet of tracing paper from the floor  its the temple she panted in a significant whisper its the temple of the one tue god  she scrabbled among the papers and held up the elevation of a strange square building to his startled eyes iszit it just pefect she demanded  he took the drawing from her it represented a building manifestly an enormous building consisting largely of two great deeply fluted towers flanking a vast archway approached by a long flight of steps between the towers appeared a dome it was as if the mosque of saint sophia had produced this offspring in a mesalliance with the cathedral of wells its enormity was made manifest by the minuteness of the large automobiles that were driving away in the foreground after setting down here is the plan she said thrusting another sheet upon him before he could fully take in the quality of the design the geat hall is to be pefectly ound no aisle no altar and in lettas of sapphiah god is evywhe  she added with a note of solemnity it will hold thee thousand people sitting down  but said scrope  thees a sort of gandeur she said its young venables wok its his flst gate oppotunity  butis this to go on that little site in aldwych  he says the isnt oom the she explained he wants to put it out at goldas geen  butif it is to be this little simple chapel we proposed then wasnt our idea to be central  but if the isnt oem she saidconclusively and isnt thisisnt it rather a costly undertaking rather more costly  that doesnt matta im making heaps and heaps of money half my popety is in shipping and a lot of the eat in munitions im icher than eva isnt the a sort of gandeur she pressed  he put the elevation down he took the plan from her hands and seemed to study it but he was really staring blankly at the whole situation  lady sunderbund he said at last with an effort i am afraid all this wont do  wont do  no it isnt in the spirit of my intention it isnt in a great building of this sortsoso ornate and imposing that the simple gospel of gods universal kingdom can be preached  but oughtnt so gate a message to have as gate a pulpit  and then as if she would seize him before he could go on to further repudiations she sought hastily among the drawings again  but look she said it has evything its not only a peaching place its a headquarters for evything  with the rapid movements of an excited child she began to thrust the remarkable features and merits of the great project upon him the preaching dome was only the heart of it there were to be a library efectoies consultation rooms classrooms a publication department a big underground printing establishment nowadays she said evy gate movement must pint there was to be music she said a gate invisible ogan hidden amidst the architectural details and pouring out its sounds into the dome and then she glanced in passing at possible pocessions round the preaching dome this preaching dome was not a mere shutin drum for spiritual reverberations around it ran great open corridors and in these corridors there were to be chapels  but what for he asked stemming the torrent what need is there for chapels there are to be no altars no masses no sacraments  no she said but they are to be chapels for special intests a chapel for science a chapel for healing a chapel for govment places for peoples to sit and think about those thingswith paintings and symbols  i see your intention he admitted i see your intention  the is to be a gate dak blue ound chapel for stas and atoms and the mystry of matta her voice grew solemn all still and deep and high like a kystal in a dak place you will go down steps to it though a dak ounded ach maked with mathematical symbols and balances and scientific appatus and the vey next to it the vey next is to be a little bight chapel for bids and flowas  yes he said it is all very fine and expressive it is i see a symbolical building a great artistic possibility but is it the place for me what i have to say is something very simple that god is the king of the whole world king of the hapenny newspaper and the omnibus and the vulgar everyday things and that they have to worship him and serve him as their leader in every moment of their lives this isnt that this is the old religions over again this is taking god apart this is putting him into a fresh casket instead of the old one and i dont like it  dont like it she cried and stood apart from him with her chin in the air a tall astonishment and dismay  i cant do the work i want to do with this  butisnt it you idea  no it is not in the least my idea i want to tell the whole world of the one god that can alone unite it and save itand you make this extravagant toy  he felt as if he had struck her directly he uttered that last word  toy she echoed taking it in you call it a toy  a note in her voice reminded him that there were two people who might feel strongly in this affair  my dear lady sunderbund he said with a sudden change of manner i must needs follow the light of my own mind i have had a vision of god i have seen him as a great leader towering over the little lives of men demanding the little lives of men prepared to take them and guide them to the salvation of mankind and the conquest of pain and death i have seen him as the god of the human affair a god of politics a god of such muddy and bloody wars as this war a god of economics a god of railway junctions and clinics and factories and evening schools a god in fact of men this godthis god here that you want to worship is a god of artists and poetsof elegant poets a god of bricabrac a god of choice allusions oh it has its grandeur i dont want you to think that what you are doing may not be altogether fine and right for you to do but it is not what i have to do i cannotindeed i cannotgo on with this projectupon these lines  he paused flushed and breathless lady sunderbund had heard him to the end her bright face was brightly flushed and there were tears in her eyes it was like her that they should seem tears of the largest most expensive sort tears of the first water  but she cried and her red delicate mouth went awry with dismay and disappointment and her expression was the half incredulous expression of a child suddenly and cruelly disappointed you wont go on with all this  no he said my dear lady sunderbund  oh dont lady sunderbund me she cried with a novel rudeness dont you see ive done it all for you  he winced and felt boorish he had never liked and disapproved of lady sunderbund so much as he did at that moment and he had no words for her  how can i stop it all at once like this  and still he had no answer  she pursued her advantage what am i to do she cried  she turned upon him passionately look what youve done she marked her points with finger upheld and gave odd suggestions in her face of an angry coster girl eva since i met you ive woshipped you ive been eady to follow you anywheto do anything eva since that night when you sat so calm and dignified and they baited you and woid you when they we all vain and cleva and youyou thought only of god and iligion and didnt mind fo youself up to thenid been livingoh the emptiest life  the tears ran pehaps i shall live it again she dashed her grief away with a hand beringed with stones as big as beetles  i said to myself this man knows something i dont know hes got the seeds of etenal life suely i made up my mind then and the id follow you and back you and do all i could fo you ive lived fo you eve since lived fo you and now when all my little plans are ipe you oh  she made a quaint little gesture with pink fists upraised and then stood with her hand held up staring at the plans and drawings that were littered over the inlaid table ive planned and planned i said i will build him a temple i will be his temple sevant just a me sevant  she could not go on  but it is just these temples that have confused mankind he said  not my temple she said presently now openly weeping over the gay rejected drawings you could have explained  oh she said petulantly and thrust them away from her so that they went sliding one after the other on to the floor for some longdrawn moments there was no sound in the room but the slowly accelerated slide and flop of one sheet of cartridge paper after another  we could have been so happy she wailed seving oua god  and then this disconcerting lady did a still more disconcerting thing she staggered a step towards scrape seized the lapels of his coat bowed her head upon his shoulder put her black hair against his cheek and began sobbing and weeping  my dear lady he expostulated trying weakly to disengage her  let me ky she insisted gripping more resolutely and following his backward pace you must let me ky you must let me ky  his resistance ceased one hand supported her the other patted her shining hair my dear child he said my dear child i had no idea that you would take it like this  7   that was but the opening of an enormous interview presently he had contrived in a helpful and sympathetic manner to seat the unhappy lady on a sofa and when after some cramped discourse she stood up before him wiping her eyes with a wet wonder of lace to deliver herself the better a newborn appreciation of the tactics of the situation made him walk to the other side of the table under colour of picking up a drawing  in the retrospect he tried to disentangle the threads of a discussion that went to and fro and contradicted itself and began again far back among things that had seemed forgotten and disposed of lady sunderbunds mind was extravagantly untrained a wildgrown mental thicket at times she reproached him as if he were a heartless god at times she talked as if he were a recalcitrant servant her mingling of utter devotion and the completest disregard for his thoughts and wishes dazzled and distressed his mind it was clear that for half a year her clear bold absurd will had been crystallized upon the idea of giving him exactly what she wanted him to want the crystal sphere of those ambitions lay now shattered between them  she was trying to reconstruct it before his eyes  she was she declared prepared to alter her plans in any way that would meet his wishes she had not understood if it is a toy she cried show me how to make it not a toy make it eal  he said it was the bare idea of a temple that made it impossible and there was this drawing here what did it mean he held it out to her it represented a figure distressingly like himself robed as a priest in vestments  she snatched the offending drawing from him and tore it to shreds  if you dont want a temple have a meetinghouse you wanted a meetinghouse anyhow  just any old meetinghouse he said not that special one a place without choirs and clergy  if you wont have music she responded dont have music if god doesnt want music it can go i cant think god does not appove of music butthat is for you to settle if you dont like the being onaments well make it all plain some gate gey domeall

way to tears of real tenderness  a cassock she cried with passion just a pefectly plain cassock fo deecency oh if you wontnot even that  8   as he walked now after his unsuccessful quest of dr brightonpomfrey towards the serpentine he acted that stormy interview with lady sunderbund over again at the end as a condition indeed of his departure he had left things open he had assented to certain promises he was to make her understand better what it was he needed he was not to let anything that had happened affect that spitual fenship she was to abandon all her plans she was to begin again at the vey beginning but he knew that indeed there should be no more beginning again with her he knew that quite beyond these questions of the organization of a purified religion it was time their association ended she had wept upon him she had clasped both his hands at parting and prayed to be forgiven she was drawing him closer to her by their very dissension she had infected him with the softness of remorse from being a bright and spirited person she had converted herself into a warm and touching person her fine bright black hair against his cheek and the clasp of her hand on his shoulder was now inextricably in the business the perplexing the astonishing thing in his situation was that there was still a reluctance to make a conclusive breach  he was not the first of men who have tried to find in vain how and when a relationship becomes an entanglement he ought to break off now and the riddle was just why he should feel this compunction in breaking off now he had disappointed her and he ought not to have disappointed her that was the essential feeling he had never realized before as he realized now this peculiar quality of his own mind and the gulf into which it was leading him it came as an illuminating discovery  he was a social animal he had an instinctive disposition to act according to the expectations of the people about him whether they were reasonable or congenial expectations or whether they were not that he saw for the first time had been the ruling motive of his life it was the clue to him man is not a reasonable creature he is a socially responsive creature trying to be reasonable in spite of that fact from the days in the rectory nursery when scrope had tried to be a good boy on the whole and just a little naughty sometimes until they stopped smiling through all his life of school university curacy vicarage and episcopacy up to this present moment he perceived now that he had acted upon no authentic and independent impulse his impulse had always been to fall in with people and satisfy them and all the painful conflicts of those last few years had been due to a growing realization of jarring criticisms of antagonized forces that required from him incompatible things from which he had now taken refugeor at any rate sought refugein god it was paradoxical but manifestly in god he not only sank his individuality but discovered it  it was wonderful how much he had thought and still thought of the feelings and desires of lady sunderbund and how little he thought of god her he had been assiduously propitiating managing accepting for three months now why partly because she demanded it and there was a quality in her demand that had touched some hidden springof vanity perhaps it wasin him that made him respond but partly also it was because after the evacuation of the palace at princhester he had felt more and more felt but never dared to look squarely in the face the catastrophic change in the worldly circumstances of his family only this chapel adventure seemed likely to restore those fallen and bedraggled fortunes he had not anticipated a tithe of the dire quality of that change they were not simply uncomfortable in the notting hill home they were miserable he fancied they looked to him with something between reproach and urgency why had he brought them here what next did he propose to do he wished at times they would say it out instead of merely looking it phoebes failing appetite chilled his heart  that concern for his family he believed had been his chief motive in clinging to lady sunderbunds projects long after he had realized how little they would forward the true service of god no doubt there had been moments of flattery moments of something something rather in the nature of an excited affection some touch of the magnificent in her some touch of the infantileboth appealed magnetically to his imagination but the real effective cause was his habitual solicitude for his wife and children and his consequent desire to prosper materially as his first dream of being something between mohammed and peter the hermit in a new proclamation of god to the world lost colour and life in his mind he realized more and more clearly that there was no way of living in a state of material prosperity and at the same time in a state of active service to god the church of the one true god by favour of lady sunderbund was a gailycoloured lure  and yet he wanted to go on with it all his imagination and intelligence was busy now with the possibility of in some way subjugating lady sunderbund and modifying her and qualifying her to an endurable proposition why  why  there could be but one answer he thought brought to the test of action he did not really believe in god he did not believe in god as he believed in his family he did not believe in the reality of either his first or his second vision they had been dreams autogenous revelations exaltations of his own imaginations these beliefs were upon different grades of reality put to the test his faith in god gave way a sword of plaster against a reality of steel  and yet he did believe in god he was as persuaded that there was a god as he was that there was another side to the moon his intellectual conviction was complete only beside the living breathingoccasionally coughingreality of phoebe god was something as unsubstantial as the binomial theorem  very like the binomial theorem as one thought over that comparison  by this time he had reached the banks of the serpentine and was approaching the grey stone bridge that crosses just where hyde park ends and kensington gardens begins following upon his doubts of his religious faith had come another still more extraordinary question although there is a god does he indeed matter more in our ordinary lives than that same demonstrable binomial theorem isnt ones duty to phoebe plain and clear old likemans argument came back to him with novel and enhanced powers wasnt he after all selfishly putting his own salvation in front of his plain duty to those about him what did it matter if he told lies taught a false faith perjured and damned himself if after all those others were thereby saved and comforted  but that is just where the whole of this state of mind is false and wrong he told himself god is something more than a priggish devotion an intellectual formula he has a hold and a claimhe should have a hold and a claimexceeding all the claims of phoebe miriam daphne clementinaall of them but he hasnt  it was to that he had got after he had left lady sunderbund and to that he now returned it was the thinness and unreality of his thought of god that had driven him posthaste to brightonpomfrey in search for that drug that had touched his soul to belief  was god so insignificant in comparison with his family that after all with a good conscience he might preach him every sunday in lady sunderbunds church wearing lady sunderbunds vestments  before him he saw an empty seat the question was so immense and conclusive it was so clearly a choice for all the rest of his life between god and the dear things of this world that he felt he could not decide it upon his legs he sat down threw an arm along the back of the seat and drummed with his fingers  if the answer was yes then it was decidedly a pity that he had not stayed in the church it was ridiculous to strain at the cathedral gnat and then swallow lady sunderbunds decorative pantechnicon  for the first time scrope definitely regretted his apostasy  a trivial matter as it may seem to the reader intensified that regret three weeks ago borrowdale the bishop of howeaster had died and scrope would have been the next in rotation to succeed him on the bench of bishops he had always looked forward to the house of lords intending to take rather a new line to speak more and to speak more plainly and fully upon social questions than had hitherto been the practice of his brethren well that had gone  9   regrets were plain now the question before his mind was growing clear whether he was to persist in this selfimposed martyrdom of himself and his family or whether he was to go back upon his outbreak of visionary fanaticism and close with this last opportunity that lady sunderbund offered of saving at least the substance of the comfort and social status of his wife and daughters in which case it was clear to him he would have to go to great lengths and exercise very considerable subtletyand magnetismin the management of lady sunderbund  he found himself composing a peculiar speech to her very frank and revealing and one that he felt would dominate her thoughts she attracted him oddly at least this afternoon she had attracted him  and repelled him  a wholesome gust of moral impatience stirred him he smacked the back of the seat hard as though he smacked himself  no he did not like it  a torn sunset of purple and crimson streamed raggedly up above and through the half stripped trecs of kensington gardens and he found himself wishing that heaven would give us fewer sublimities in sky and mountain and more in our hearts against the background of darkling trees and stormily flaming sky a girl was approaching him there was little to be seen of her but her outline something in her movement caught his eye and carried his memory back to a sundown at hunstanton then as she came nearer he saw that it was eleanor  it was odd to see her here he had thought she was at newnham  but anyhow it was very pleasant to see her and there was something in eleanor that promised an answer to his necessity the girl had a kind of instinctive wisdom she would understand the quality of his situation better perhaps than any one he would put the essentials of that situation as fully and plainly as he could to her perhaps she with that clear young idealism of hers would give him just the lift and the light of which he stood in need she would comprehend both sides of it the points about phoebe as well as the points about god  when first he saw her she seemed to be hurrying but now she had fallen to a loitering pace she looked once or twice behind her and then ahead almost as though she expected some one and was not sure whether this person would approach from east or west she did not observe her father until she was close upon him  then she was so astonished that for a moment she stood motionless regarding him she made an odd movement almost as if she would have walked on that she checked in its inception then she came up to him and stood before him its dad she said  i didnt know you were in london norah he began  i came up suddenly  have you been home  no i wasnt going home at leastnot until afterwards  then she looked away from him east and then west and then met his eye again  wont you sit down norah  i dont know whether i can  she consulted the view again and seemed to come to a decision at least i will for a minute  she sat down for a moment neither of them spoke  what are you doing here little norah  she gathered her wits then she spoke rather volubly i know it looks bad daddy i came up to meet a boy i know who is going to france tomorrow i had to make excusesup there i hardly remember what excuses i made  a boy you know  yes  do we know him  not yet  for a time scrope forgot the church of the one true god altogether who is this boy he asked  with a perceptible effort eleanor assumed a tone of commonsense conventionality hes a boy i met first when we were skating last year his sister has the study next to mine  father looked at daughter and she met his eyes well  its all happened so quickly daddy she said answering all that was implicit in that well she went on i would have told you about him if he had seemed to matter but it was just a friendship it didnt seem to matter in any serious way of course wed been good friendsand talked about all sorts of things and then suddenly you seeher tone was offhand and matteroffacthe has to go to france  she stared at her father with the expression of a hostess who talks about the weather and then the tears gathered and ran down her cheek  she turned her face to the serpentine and clenched her fist  but she was now fairly weeping i didnt know he cared i didnt know i cared  his next question took a little time in coming  and its love little norah he asked  she was comfortably crying now the defensive altogether abandoned its love daddy oh love hes going tomorrow for a minute or so neither spoke scropes mind was entirely made up in the matter he approved altogether of his daughter but the traditions of parentage his habit of restrained decision made him act a judicial part id like just to see this boy he said and added if it isnt rather interfering  dear daddy she said dear daddy and touched his hand hell be coming here  if you could tell me a few things about him said scrope is he an undergraduate  you see began eleanor and paused to marshal her facts he graduated this year then hes been in training at cambridge properly hed have a fellowship he took the natural science tripos zoology chiefly hes good at philosophy but of course our cambridge philosophy is so sillymctaggart blowing bubbles his fathers a doctor sir hedley riverton  as she spoke her eyes had been roving up the path and down hes coming she interrupted she hesitated would you mind if i went and spoke to him first daddy  of course go to him go and warn him im here said scrope  eleanor got up and was immediately greeted with joyful gestures by an approaching figure in khaki the two young people quickened their paces as they drew nearer one another there was a rapid greeting they stood close together and spoke eagerly scrope could tell by their movements when he became the subject of their talk he saw the young man start and look over eleanors shoulder and he assumed an attitude of philosophical contemplation of the water so as to give the young man the liberty of his profile  he did not look up until they were quite close to him and when he did he saw a pleasant slightly freckled fair face a little agitated and very honest blue eyes i hope you dont think sir that its bad form of me to ask eleanor to come up and see me as ive done i telegraphed to her on an impulse and its been very kind of her to come up to me  sit down said scrope sit down youre mr riverton  yes sir said the young man he had the frequent sir of the subaltern scrope was in the centre of the seat and the young officer sat down on one side of him while eleanor took up a watching position on her fathers other hand you see sir weve hardly known each otheri mean weve been associated over a philosophical society and all that sort of thing but in a more familiar way i mean  he hung for a moment just a little short of breath scrope helped him with a grave but sympathetic movement of the head its a little difficult to explain the young man apologized  we hadnt understood i think either of us very much wed just been friendlyand liked each other and so it went on even when i was training and then when i found i had to go outim going out a little earlier than i expectedi thought suddenly i wouldnt ever go to cambridge again at all perhapsand there was something in one of her letters i thought of it a lot sir i thought it all over and i thought it wasnt right for me to do anything and i didnt do anything until this morning and then i sort of had to telegraph i know it was frightful cheek and bad form and all that sir it is it would be worse if she wasnt differenti mean sir if she was just an ordinary girl but i had a sort of feelingjust wanting to see her i dont suppose youve ever felt anything sir as i felt i wanted to see herand just hear her speak to me  he glanced across scrope at eleanor it was as if he justified himself to them both  scrope glanced furtively at his daughter who was leaning forward with tender eyes on her lover and his heart went out to her but his manner remained judicial  all this is very sudden he said  or you would have heard all about it sir said young riverton its just the hurry that has made this seem furtive all that there is between us sir is just the two telegrams weve sent hers and mine i hope you wont mind our having a little time together we wont do anything very committal its as much friendship as anything i go by the evening train tomorrow  mm said serope with his eye on eleanor  in these uncertain times he began  why shouldnt i take a risk too daddy said eleanor sharply  i know theres that side of it said the young man i oughtnt to have telegraphed he said  cant i take a risk exclaimed eleanor im not a doll i dont want to live in wadding until all the world is safe for me  scrope looked at the glowing face of the young man  is this taking care of her he asked  if you hadnt telegraphed she cried with a threat in her voice and left it at that  perhaps i feel about herrather as if she was as strong as i amin those ways perhaps i shouldnt i could hardly endure myself sircut off from her and a sort of blank nothing said  you want to work out your own salvation said scrope to his daughter  no one else can she answered imim grown up  even if it hurts  to live is to be hurt somehow she said thisthis she flashed her love she intimated by a gesture that it is better to be stabbed with a clean knife than to be suffocated or poisoned or to decay  scrope turned his eyes to the young man again he liked him he liked the modelling of his mouth and chin and the line of his brows he liked him altogether he pronounced his verdict slowly i suppose after all he said that this is better than the tender solicitude of a safe and prosperous middleaged man eleanor my dear ive been thinking today that a father who stands between his children and hardship by doing wrong may really be doing them a wrong you are a dear girl to me i wont stand between you two find your own salvation he got up i go west he said presently you i think go east  i can assure you sir the young man began  scrope held his hand out take your life in your own way he said  he turned to eleanor talk as you will he said  she clasped his hand with emotion then she turned to the waiting young man who saluted  youll come back to supper scrope said without thinking out the implications of that invitation  she assented as carelessly the fact that she and her lover were to go with their meeting legalized and blessed excluded all other considerations the two young people turned to each other  scrope stood for a moment or so and then sat down again  for a time he could think only of eleanor he watched the two young people as they went eastward as they walked their shoulders and elbows bumped amicably together  10   presently he sought to resume the interrupted thread of his thoughts he knew that he had been dealing with some very tremendous and urgent problem when eleanor had appeared then he remembered that eleanor at the time of her approach had seemed to be a solution rather than an interruption well she had her own life she was making her own life instead of solving his problems she was solving her own god bless those dear grave children they were nearer the elemental things than he was that eastward path led to victoriaand thence to a very probable death the lad was in the infantry and going straight into the trenches  love death god this war was bringing the whole world back to elemental things to heroic things the years of comedy and comfort were at an end in europe the age of steel and want was here and he had been thinkingwhat had he been thinking  he mused and the scheme of his perplexities reshaped itself in his mind but at that time he did not realize that a powerful new light was falling upon it now cast by the tragic illumination of these young lovers whose love began with a parting he did not see how reality had come to all things through that one intense reality he reverted to the question as he had put it to himself before first he recognized eleanor did he believe in god should he go on with this sunderbund adventure in which he no longer believed should he play for safety and comfort trusting to gods toleration or go back to his family and warn them of the years of struggle and poverty his renunciation cast upon them  somehow lady sunderbunds chapel was very remote and flimsy now and the hardships of poverty seemed less black than the hardship of a youthful death  did he believe in god again he put that fundamental question to himself  he sat very still in the sunset peace with his eyes upon the steel mirror of the waters the question seemed to fill the whole scene to wait even as the water and sky and the windless trees were waiting  and then by imperceptible degrees there grew in scropes mind the persuasion that he was in the presence of the living god this time there was no vision of angels nor stars no snapping of bowstrings no throbbing of the heart nor change of scene no magic and melodramatic drawing back of the curtain from the mysteries the water and the bridge the ragged black trees and a distant boat that broke the silvery calm with an arrow of black ripples all these things were still before him but god was there too god was everywhere about him this persuasion was over him and about him a dome of protection a power in his nerves a peace in his heart it was an exalting beauty it was a perfected conviction this indeed was the coming of god the real coming of god for the first time scrope was absolutely sure that for the rest of his life he would possess god everything that had so perplexed him seemed to be clear now and his troubles lay at the foot of this last complete realization like a litter of dust and leaves in the foreground of a sunlit snowy mountain range  it was a little incredible that he could ever have doubted  11   it was a phase of extreme intellectual clairvoyance a multitude of things that hitherto had been higgledypiggledy contradictory and incongruous in his mind became lucid serene full and assured he seemed to see all things plainly as one sees things plainly through perfectly clear still water in the shadows of a summer noon his doubts about god his periods of complete forgetfulness and disregard of god this conflict of his instincts and the habits and affections of his daily life with the service of god ceased to be perplexing incompatibilities and were manifest as necessary understandable aspects of the business of living  it was no longer a riddle that little immediate things should seem of more importance than great and final things for man is a creature thrusting his way up from the beast to divinity from the blindness of individuality to the knowledge of a common end we stand deep in the engagements of our individual lives looking up to god and only realizing in our moments of exaltation that through god we can escape from and rule and alter the whole worldwide scheme of individual lives only in phases of illumination do we realize the creative powers that lie ready to mans hand personal affections immediate obligations ambitions selfseeking these are among the natural and essential things of our individual lives as intimate almost as our primordial lusts and needs god the true god is a later revelation a newer less natural thing in us a knowledge still remote uncertain and confused with superstition an apprehension as yet entangled with barbaric traditions of fear and with ceremonial surgeries blood sacrifices and the maddest barbarities of thought we are only beginning to realize that god is here so far as our minds go he is still not here continually we perceive him and then again we are blind to him god is the last thing added to the completeness of human life to most his presence is imperceptible throughout their lives they know as little of him as a savage knows of the electric waves that beat through us for ever from the sun all this appeared now so clear and necessary to scrope that he was astonished he had ever found the quality of contradiction in these manifest facts  in this unprecedented lucidity that had now come to him scrope saw as a clear and simple necessity that there can be no such thing as a continuous living presence of god in our lives that is an unreasonable desire there is no permanent exaltation of belief it is contrary to the nature of life one cannot keep actively believing in and realizing god round all the twentyfour hours any more than one can keep awake through the whole cycle of night and day day after day if it were possible so to apprehend god without cessation life would dissolve in religious ecstasy but nothing human has ever had the power to hold the curtain of sense continually aside and retain the light of god always we must get along by remembering our moments of assurance even jesus himself leader of all those who have hailed the coming kingdom of god had cried upon the cross my god my god why hast thou forsaken me the business of life on earth life itself is a thing curtained off as it were from such immediate convictions that is in the constitution of life our ordinary state of belief even when we are free from doubt is necessarily far removed from the intuitive certainty of sight and hearing it is a persuasion it falls far short of perception  we dont know directly scrope said to himself with a checking gesture of the hand we dont see we cant we hold on to the remembered glimpse we go over our reasons  and it was clear too just because god is thus manifest like the momentary drawing of a curtain sometimes to this man for a time and sometimes to that but never continuously to any and because the perception of him depends upon the ability and quality of the perceiver because to the intellectual man god is necessarily a formula to the active man a will and a commandment and to the emotional man love there can be no creed defining him for all men and no ritual and special forms of service to justify a priesthood god is god he whispered to himself and the phrase seemed to him the discovery of a sufficient creed god is his own definition there is no other definition of god scrope had troubled himself with endless arguments whether god was a person whether he was concerned with personal troubles whether he loved whether he was finite it were as reasonable to argue whether god was a frog or a rock or a tree he had imagined god as a figure of youth and courage had perceived him as an effulgence of leadership a captain like the sun the vision of his drugquickened mind had but symbolized what was otherwise inexpressible of that he was now sure he had not seen the invisible but only its sign and visible likeness he knew now that all such presentations were true and that all such presentations were false just as much and just as little was god the darkness and the brightness of the ripples under the bows of the distant boat the black beauty of the leaves and twigs of those trees now acidclear against the flushed and deepening sky these riddles of the profundities were beyond the compass of common living they were beyond the needs of common living he was but a little earth parasite sitting idle in the darkling day trying to understand his infinitesimal functions on a minor planet within the compass of terrestrial living god showed himself in its own terms the life of man on earth was a struggle for unity of spirit and for unity with his kind and the aspect of god that alone mattered to man was a unifying kingship without and within so long as men were men so would they see god only when they reached the crest could they begin to look beyond so we knew god so god was to us since we struggled he led our struggle since we were finite and mortal he defined an aim his personality was the answer to our personality but god except in so far as he was to us remained inaccessible inexplicable wonderful shining through beauty shining beyond research greater than time or space above good and evil and pain and pleasure  12   seropes mind was saturated as it had never been before by his sense of the immediate presence of god he floated in that realization he was not so much thinking now as conversing starkly with the divine interlocutor who penetrated all things and saw into and illuminated every recess of his mind he spread out his ideas to the test of this presence he brought out his hazards and interpretations that this light might judge them  there came back to his mind the substance of his two former visions they assumed now a reciprocal quality they explained one another and the riddle before him the first had shown him the personal human aspect of god he had seen god as the unifying captain calling for his personal service the second had set the stage for that service in the spectacle of mankinds adventure he had been shown a great multitude of human spirits reaching up at countless points towards the conception of the racial unity under a divine leadership he had seen mankind on the verge of awakening to the kingdom of god that solves no mystery he whispered gripping the seat and frowning at the water mysteries remain mysteries but that is the reality of religion and now now what is my place what have i to do that is the question i have been asking always the question that this moment now will answer what have i to do  god was coming into the life of all mankind in the likeness of a captain and a king all the governments of men all the leagues of men their debts and claims and possessions must give way to the world republic under god the king for five troubled years he had been staring religion in the face and now he saw that it must mean thisor be no more than fetishism obi orphic mysteries or ceremonies of demeter a legacy of mental dirtiness a residue of selfmutilation and superstitious sacrifices from the cunning fearhaunted apedog phase of human development but it did mean this and every one who apprehended as much was called by that very apprehension to the service of gods kingdom to live and serve gods kingdom on earth to help to bring it about to propagate the idea of it to establish the method of it to incorporate all that one made and all that one did into its growing reality was the only possible life that could be lived once that god was known  he sat with his hands gripping his knees as if he were holding on to his idea and now for my part he whispered brows knit now for my part  ever since he had given his confirmation addresses he had been clear that his task or at least a considerable portion of his task was to tell of this faith in god and of this conception of service in his kingdom as the form and rule of human life and human society but up to now he had been floundering hopelessly in his search for a method and means of telling that he saw still needed to be thought out for example one cannot run through the world crying the kingdom of god is at hand mens minds were still so filled with old theological ideas that for the most part they would understand by that only a fantasy of some great coming of angels and fiery chariots and judgments and hardly a soul but would doubt ones sanity and turn scornfully away but one must proclaim god not to confuse but to convince mens minds it was that and the habit of his priestly calling that had disposed him towards a pulpit there he could reason and explain the decorative genius of lady sunderbund had turned that intention into a vast iridescent absurdity  this sense he had of thinking openly in the sight of god enabled him to see the adventure of lady sunderbund without illusion and without shame he saw himself at once honest and disingenuous divided between two aims he had no doubt now of the path he had to pursue a stronger man of permanently clear aims might possibly turn lady sunderbund into a useful opportunity oblige her to provide the rostrum he needed but for himself he knew he had neither the needed strength nor clearness she would smother him in decoration overcome him by her picturesque persistence it might be ridiculous to run away from her but it was necessary and he was equally clear now that for him there must be no idea of any pulpit of any sustained mission he was a man of intellectual moods only at times he realized had he the inspiration of truth upon such uncertain snatches and glimpses he must live to make his life a ministry would be to face phases when he would simply be carrying on with his mind blank and his faith asleep  his thought spread out from this perennial decision to more general things again had god any need of organized priests at all wasnt that just what had been the matter with religion for the last three thousand years  his vision and his sense of access to god had given a new courage to his mind in these moods of enlightenment he could see the world as a comprehensible ball he could see history as an understandable drama he had always been on the verge of realizing before he realized now the two entirely different and antagonistic strands that interweave in the twisted rope of contemporary religion the old strand of the priest the fetishistic element of the blood sacrifice and the obscene rite the element of ritual and tradition of the cult the caste the consecrated tribe and interwoven with this so closely as to be scarcely separable in any existing religion was the new strand the religion of the prophets the unidolatrous universal worship of the one true god priest religion is the antithesis to prophet religion he saw that the founders of all the great existing religions of the world had been like himselfonly that he was a weak and commonplace man with no creative force and they had been great men of enormous initiativemen reaching out and never with a complete definition from the old kind of religion to the new the hebrew prophets jesus whom the priests killed when pilate would have spared him mohammed buddha had this much in common that they had sought to lead men from temple worship idol worship from rites and ceremonies and the rule of priests from anniversaryism and sacramentalism into a direct and simple relation to the simplicity of god religious progress had always been liberation and simplification but none of these efforts had got altogether clear the organizing temper in men the disposition to dogmatic theorizing the distrust of the discretion of the young by the wisdom of age the fear of indiscipline which is so just in warfare and so foolish in education the tremendous power of the propitiatory tradition had always caught and crippled every new gospel before it had run a score of years jesus for example gave man neither a theology nor a church organization his sacrament was an innocent feast of memorial but the fearful limited imitative men he left to carry on his work speedily restored all these three abominations of the antiquated religion theology priest and sacrifice jesus indeed caught into identification with the ancient victim of the harvest sacrifice and turned from a plain teacher into a horrible blood bath and a mock cannibal meal was surely the supreme feat of the ironies of chance  it is curious how i drift back to jesus said scrope i have never seen how much truth and good there was in his teaching until i broke away from christianity and began to see him plain if i go on as i am going i shall end a nazarene  he thought on he had a feeling of temerity but then it seemed as if god within him bade him be of good courage  already in a glow of inspiration he had said practically as much as he was now thinking in his confirmation address but now he realized completely what it was he had then said there could be no priests no specialized ministers of the one true god because every man to the utmost measure of his capacity was bound to be gods priest and minister many things one may leave to specialists surgery detailed administration chemistry for example but it is for every man to think his own philosophy and think out his own religion one man may tell another but no man may take charge of another a man may avail himself of electrician or gardener or what not but he must stand directly before god he may suffer neither priest nor king these other things are incidental but god the kingdom of god is what he is for  good he said checking his reasoning so i must bear witness to godbut neither as priest nor pastor i must write and talk about him as i can no reason why i should not live by such writing and talking if it does not hamper my message to do so but there must be no high place no ordered congregation i begin to see my way  the evening was growing dark and chill about him now the sky was barred with deep bluish purple bands drawn across a chilly brightness that had already forgotten the sun the trees were black and dim but his understanding of his place and duty was growing very definite  and this duty to bear witness to gods kingdom and serve it is so plain that i must not deflect my witness even by a little though to do so means comfort and security for my wife and children god comes first  they must not come between god and me  but there is more in it than that  he had come round at last through the long clearingup of his mind to his fundamental problem again he sat darkly reluctant  i must not play priest or providence to them he admitted at last i must not even stand between god and them  he saw now what he had been doing it had been the flaw in his faith that he would not trust his family to god and he saw too that this distrust has been the flaw in the faith of all religious systems hitherto  13   in this strange voyage of the spirit which was now drawing to its end in which scrope had travelled from the confused unanalyzed formulas and assumptions and implications of his rectory upbringing to his present stark and simple realization of god he had at times made some remarkable selfidentifications he was naturally much given to analogy every train of thought in his mind set up induced parallel currents he had likened himself to the anglican church to the whole christian body as for example in his imagined second conversation with the angel of god but now he found himself associating himself with a still more farreaching section of mankind this excess of solicitude was traceable perhaps in nearly every one in all the past of mankind who had ever had the vision of god an excessive solicitude to shield those others from ones own trials and hardships to preserve the exact quality of the revelation for example had been the fruitful cause of crippling errors spiritual tyrannies dogmatisms dissensions and futilities suffer little children to come unto me the text came into his head with an effect of contribution the parent in us all flares out at the thought of the younger and weaker minds we hide difficulties seek to spare them from the fires that temper the spirit the sharp edge of the truth that shapes the soul christian is always trying to have a carriage sent back from the celestial city for his family why we ask should they flounder dangerously in the morasses that we escaped or wander in the forest in which we lost ourselves catch these souls young therefore save them before they know they exist kidnap them to heaven vaccinate them with a catechism they may never understand lull them into comfort and routine instinct plays us false here as it plays the savage mother false when she snatches her fevered child from the doctors hands the last act of faith is to trust those we love to god  hitherto he had seen the great nets of theological overstatement and dogma that kept mankind from god as if they were the work of purely evil things in man of pride of selfassertion of a desire to possess and dominate the minds and souls of others it was only now that he saw how large a share in the obstruction of gods kingdom had been played by the love of the elder and the parent by the carefulness the fussy care of good men and women he had wandered in wildernesses of unbelief in dangerous places of doubt and questioning but he had left his wife and children safe and secure in the selfsatisfaction of orthodoxy to none of them except to eleanor had he ever talked with any freedom of his new apprehensions of religious reality and that had been at eleanors initiative there was he saw now something of insolence and something of treachery in this concealment his ruling disposition throughout the crisis had been to force comfort and worldly wellbeing upon all those dependants even at the price of his own spiritual integrity in no way had he consulted them upon the bargain while we have pottered each for the little good of his own family each for the lessons and clothes and leisure of his own children assenting to this injustice conforming to that dishonest custom being myopically benevolent and fundamentally treacherous our accumulated folly has achieved this catastrophe it is not so much human wickedness as human weakness that has permitted the youth of the world to go through this hell of blood and mud and fire the way to the kingdom of god is the only way to the true safety the true wellbeing of the children of men  it wasnt fair to them but now he saw how unfair it was to them in a light that has only shone plainly upon european life since the great interlude of the armed peace came to an end in august 1914 until that time it had been the fashion to ignore death and evade poverty and necessity for the young we can shield our young no longer death has broken through our precautions and tender evasionsand his eyes went eastward into the twilight that had swallowed up his daughter and her lover  the tumbled darkling sky monstrous masses of frowning blue with icy gaps of cold light was like the great confusions of the war all our youth has had to go into that terrible and destructive chaosbecause of the kings and churches and nationalities sturdiersouled men would have set aside  everything was sharp and clear in his mind now eleanor after all had brought him his solution  he sat quite still for a little while and then stood up and turned northward towards notting hill  the keepers were closing kensington gardens and he would have to skirt the park to victoria gate and go home by the bayswater road  14   as he walked he rearranged in his mind this longoverdue apology for his faith that he was presently to make to his family there was no one to interrupt him and nothing to embarrass him and so he was able to set out everything very clearly and convincingly there was perhaps a disposition to digress into rather voluminous subordinate explanations on such themes for instance as sacramentalism whereon he found himself summarizing frazers golden bough which the chasters controversy had first obliged him to read and upon the irrelevance of the question of immortality to the process of salvation but the reality of his eclaircissement was very different from anything he prepared in these anticipations  tea had been finished and put away and the family was disposed about the diningroom engaged in various evening occupations phoebe sat at the table working at some mathematical problem clementina was reading with her chin on her fist and a frown on her brow lady ella miriam and daphne were busy making soft washing cloths for the wounded lady ella had brought home the demand for them from the red cross centre in burlington house the family was all downstairs in the diningroom because the evening was chilly and there were no fires upstairs yet in the drawingroom he came into the room and exchanged greetings with lady ella then he stood for a time surveying his children phoebe he noted was a little flushed she put passion into her work on the whole she was more like eleanor than any other of them miriam knitted with a steady skill clementinas face too expressed a tussle he took up one of the roughknit washingcloths upon the sidetable and asked how many could be made in an hour then he asked some idle obvious question about the fire upstairs clementina made an involuntary movement he was disturbing her he hovered for a moment longer he wanted to catch his wifes eye and speak to her first she looked up but before he could convey his wish for a private conference with her she smiled at him and then bent over her work again  he went into the back study and lit his gas fire hitherto he had always made a considerable explosion when he did so but this time by taking thought and lighting his match before he turned on the gas he did it with only a gentle thud then he lit his readinglamp and pulled down the blindpausing for a time to look at the lit dressmakers opposite then he sat down thoughtfully before the fire presently ella would come in and he would talk to her he waited a long time thinking only weakly and inconsecutively and then he became restless should he call her  but he wanted their talk to begin in a naturalseeming way he did not want the portentousness of wanting to speak to her and calling her out to him he got up at last and went back into the other room clementina had gone upstairs and the book she had been reading was lying closed on the sideboard he saw it was one of chasters books he took it up it was the core of truth in christianity and he felt an irrational shock at the idea of clementina reading it in spite of his own immense changes of opinion he had still to revise his conception of the polemical chasters as an evil influence in religion he fidgeted past his wife to the mantel in search of an imaginary mislaid pencil clementina came down with some bandage linen she was cutting out he hung over his wife in a way that he felt must convey his desire for a conversation then he picked up chasters book again does any one want this he asked  not if i may have it again consented clementina  he took it back with him and began to read again those familiar controversial pages he read for the best part of an hour with his knees drying until they smoked over the gas what curious stuff it was how it wrangled was chasters a religious man why did he write these books had he really a passion for truth or only a swiftlike hatred of weaklythinking people none of this stuff in his books was really wrong provided it was religiousspirited much of it had been indeed destructively illuminating to its reader it let daylight through all sorts of walls indeed the more one read the more vividly true its acidbit lines became and yet and yet there was something hateful in the mans tone scrope held the book and thought he had seen chasters once or twice chasters had the sort of face the sort of voice the sort of bearing that made one think of his possibly saying upon occasion rudely and rejoicing more fool you nevertheless scrope perceived now with an effort of discovery that it was from chasters that he had taken all the leading ideas of the new faith that was in him here was the stuff of it he had forgotten how much of it was here during those months of worried study while the threat of a chasters prosecution hung over him his mind had assimilated almost unknowingly every assimilable element of the chasters doctrine he had either assimilated and transmuted it by the alchemy of his own temperament or he had reacted obviously and filled in chasters gaps and pauses chasters could beat a road to the holy of holies and shy at entering it but in spite of all the mans roughness in spite of a curious flavour of baseness and malice about him the spirit of truth had spoken through him god has a use for harsh ministers in one man god lights the heart in another the reason becomes a consuming fire god takes his own where he finds it he does not limit himself to nice people in these matters of evidence and argument in his contempt for amiable demoralizing compromise chasters served god as scrope could never hope to serve him scropes new faith had perhaps been altogether impossible if the chasters controversy had not ploughed his mind  for a time scrope dwelt upon this remarkable realization then as he turned over the pages his eyes rested on a passage of uncivil and ungenerous sarcasm against old likeman of all people  what did a girl like clementina make of all this how had she got the book from eleanor the stuff had not hurt eleanor eleanor had been able to take the good that chasters taught and reject the evil of his spirit  he thought of eleanor gallantly working out her own salvation the world was moving fast to a phase of great freedomfor the young and the bold he liked that boy  his thoughts came back with a start to his wife the evening was slipping by and he had momentous things to say to her he went and just opened the door  ella he said  did you want me  presently  she put a liberal interpretation upon that presently so that after what seemed to him a long interval he had to call again ella  just a minute she answered  15   lady ella was still so to speak a little in the other room when she came to him  shut that door please he said and felt the request had just that flavour of portentousness he wished to avoid  what is it she asked  i wanted to talk to youabout some things ive done something rather serious today ive made an important decision  her face became anxious what do you mean she asked  you see he said leaning upon the mantelshelf and looking down at the gas flames ive never thought that we should all have to live in this crowded house for long  all she interrupted in a voice that made him look up sharply youre not going away ted  oh no but i hoped we should all be going away in a little time it isnt so  i never quite understood why you hoped that  it was plain enough  how  i thought i should have found something to do that would have enabled us to live in better style id had a plan  what plan  its fallen through  but what plan was it  i thought i should be able to set up a sort of broad church chapel i had a promise  her voice was rich with indignation and she has betrayed you  no he said i have betrayed her  lady ellas face showed them still at cross purposes he looked down again and frowned i cant do that chapel business he said ive had to let her down ive got to let you all down theres no help for it it isnt the way i cant have anything to do with lady sunderbund and her chapel  but lady ella was still perplexed  its too great a sacrifice  of us  no of myself i cant get into her pulpit and do as she wants and keep my conscience its been a horrible riddle for me it means plunging into all this poverty for good but i cant work with her ella shes impossible  you meanyoure going to break with lady sunderbund  i must  then teddyshe was a woman groping for flight amidst intolerable perplexitieswhy did you ever leave the church  because i have ceased to believe  but had it nothing to do with lady sunderbund  he stared at her in astonishment  if it means breaking with that woman she said  you mean he said beginning for the first time to comprehend her that you dont mind the poverty  poverty she cried i cared for nothing but the disgrace  disgrace  oh never mind ted if it isnt true if ive been dreaming  instead of a woman stunned by a life sentence of poverty he saw his wife rejoicing as if she had heard good news  their minds were held for a minute by the sound of some one knocking at the house door one of the girls opened the door there was a brief hubbub in the passage and then they heard a cry of eleanor through the folding doors  theres eleanor he said realizing he had told his wife nothing of the encounter in hyde park  they heard eleanors clear voice wheres mummy or daddy and then cant stay now dears wheres mummy or daddy  i ought to have told you said scrope quickly i met eleanor in the park by accident shes come up unexpectedly to meet a boy going to the front quite a nice boy son of riverton the doctor the parting had made them understand one another its all right ella its a little irregular but id stake my life on the boy shes very lucky  eleanor appeared through the folding doors she came to business at once  i promised you id come back to supper here daddy she said but i dont want to have supper here i want to stay out late  she saw her mother look perplexed hasnt daddy told you  but where is young riverton  hes outside  eleanor became aware of a broad chink in the folding doors that was making the diningroom an auditorium for their dialogue she shut them deftly  i have told mummy scrope explained bring him in to supper we ought to see him  eleanor hesitated she indicated her sisters beyond the folding doors theyll all be watching us mummy she said wed be uncomfortable and besides  but you cant go out and dine with him alone  oh mummy its our only chance  customs are changing said scrope  but can they asked lady ella  i dont see why not  the mother was still doubtful but she was in no mood to cross her husband that night its an exceptional occasion said scrope and eleanor knew her point was won she became radiant i can be late  scrope handed her his latchkey without a word  you dear kind things she said and went to the door then turned and came back and kissed her father then she kissed her mother it is so kind of you she said and was gone they listened to her passage through a storm of questions in the diningroom  three months ago that would have shocked me said lady ella  you havent seen the boy said scrope  but the appearances  arent we rather breaking with appearances he said  and he goes tomorrowperhaps to get killed he added a lad like a schoolboy a young thing because of the political foolery that we priests and teachers have suffered in the place of the kingdom of god because we have allowed the religion of europe to become a lie because no man spoke the word of god you seewhen i see thatsee those two those children of oneandtwenty wrenched by tragedy beginning with a parting its like a knife slashing at all our appearances and discretions think of our lovemaking  the front door banged  he had some idea of resuming their talk but his was a scattered mind now  its a quarter to eight he said as if in explanation  i must see to the supper said lady ella  16   there was an air of tension at supper as though the whole family felt that momentous words impended but phoebe had emerged victorious from her mathematical struggle and she seemed to eat with better appetite than she had shown for some time it was a cold meat supper lady ella had found it impossible to keep up the regular practice of a cooked dinner in the evening and now it was only on thursdays that the scropes to preserve their social tradition dressed and dined the rest of the week they supped lady ella never talked very much at supper this evening was no exception clementina talked of london university and bedford college she had been making enquiries daphne described some of the mistresses at her new school the feeling that something was expected had got upon scropes nerves he talked a little in a flat and obvious way and lapsed into thoughtful silences while supper was being cleared away he went back into his study  thence he returned to the diningroom hearthrug as his family resumed their various occupations  he tried to speak in a casual conversational tone  i want to tell you all he said of something that has happened today  he waited phoebe had begun to figure at a fresh sheet of computations miriam bent her head closer over her work as though she winced at what was coming daphne and clementina looked at one another their eyes said eleanor but he was too full of his own intention to read that glance only his wife regarded him attentively  it concerns you all he said  he looked at phoebe he saw lady ellas hand go out and touch the girls hand gently to make her desist phoebe obeyed with a little sigh  i want to tell you that today i refused an income that would certainly have exceeded fifteen hundred pounds a year  clementina looked up now this was not what she expected her expression conveyed protesting enquiry  i want you all to understand why i did that and why we are in the position we are in and what lies before us i want you to know what has been going on in my mind  he looked down at the hearthrug and tried to throw off a memory of his princhester classes for young women that oppressed him his manner he forced to a more familiar note he stuck his hands into his trouser pockets  you know my dears i had to give up the church i just simply didnt believe any more in orthodox church teaching and i feel ive never explained that properly to you not at all clearly i want to explain that now its a queer thing i know for me to say to you but i want you to understand that i am a religious man i believe that god matters more than wealth or comfort or position or the respect of men that he also matters more than your comfort and prosperity god knows i have cared for your comfort and prosperity i dont want you to think that in all these changes we have been through lately i havent been aware of all the discomfort into which you have comethe relative discomfort compared with princhester this is dark and crowded and povertystricken i have never felt crowded before but in this house i know you are horribly crowded it is a house that seems almost contrived for small discomforts this narrow passage outside the incessant going up and down stairs and there are other things there is the blankness of our london sundays what is the good of pretending they are desolating theres the impossibility too of getting good servants to come into our dugout kitchen im not blind to all these sordid consequences but all the same god has to be served first i had to come to this i felt i could not serve god any longer as a bishop in the established church because i did not believe that the established church was serving god i struggled against that convictionand i struggled against it largely for your sakes but i had to obey my conviction i havent talked to you about these things as much as i should have done but partly at least that is due to the fact that my own mind has been changing and reconsidering going forward and going back and in that fluid state it didnt seem fair to tell you things that i might presently find mistaken but now i begin to feel that i have really thought out things and that they are definite enough to tell you  he paused and resumed a number of things have helped to change the opinions in which i grew up and in which you have grown up there were worries at princhester i didnt let you know much about them but there were there was something harsh and cruel in that atmosphere i saw for the first timeits a lesson im still only learninghow harsh and greedy rich people and employing people are to poor people and working people and how ineffective our church was to make things better that struck me there were religious disputes in the diocese too and they shook me i thought my faith was built on a rock and i found it was built on sand it was slipping and sliding long before the war but the war brought it down before the war such a lot of things in england and europe seemed like a comedy or a farce a bad joke that one tolerated one tried half consciously half avoiding the knowledge of what one was doing to keep ones own little circle and life civilized the war shook all those ideas of isolation all that sort of evasion down the world is the rightful kingdom of god we had left its affairs to kings and emperors and suchlike impostors to priests and profitseekers and greedy men we were genteel condoners the war has ended that it thrusts into all our lives it brings death so closea fortnight ago twentyseven people were killed and injured within a mile of this by zeppelin bombs every one loses some one because through all that time men like myself were going through our priestly mummeries abasing ourselves to kings and politicians when we ought to have been crying out no no there is no righteousness in the world there is no right government except it be the kingdom of god  he paused and looked at them they were all listening to him now but he was still haunted by a dread of preaching in his own family he dropped to the conversational note again  you see what i had in mind i saw i must come out of this and preach the kingdom of god that was my idea i dont want to force it upon you but i want you to understand why i acted as i did but let me come to the particular thing that has happened today i did not think when i made my final decision to leave the church that it meant such poverty as this we are living inpermanently that is what i want to make clear to you i thought there would be a temporary dip into dinginess but that was all there was a plan at the time it seemed a right and reasonable plan for setting up a chapel in london a very plain and simple undenominational chapel for the simple preaching of the world kingdom of god there was some one who seemed prepared to meet all the immediate demands for such a chapel  was it lady sunderbund asked clementina  scrope was pulled up abruptly yes he said it seemed at first a quite hopeful project  wed have hated that said clementina with a glance as if for assent at her mother we should all have hated that  anyhow it has fallen through  we dont mind that said clementina and daphne echoed her words  i dont see that there is any necessity to import this note ofhostility to lady sunderbund into this matter he addressed himself rather more definitely to lady ella shes a woman of a very extraordinary character highly emotional energetic generous to an extraordinary extent  daphne made a little noise like a comment  a faint acerbity in her fathers voice responded  anyhow you make a mistake if you think that the personality of lady sunderbund has very much to do with this thing now her quality may have brought out certain aspects of the situation rather more sharply than they might have been brought out under other circumstances but if this chapel enterprise had been suggested by quite a different sort of person by a man or by a committee in the end i think i should have come to the same conclusion leave lady sunderbund out any chapel was impossible it is just this specialization that has been the trouble with religion it is just this tendency to make it the business of a special sort of man in a special sort of building on a special dayevery man every building every day belongs equally to god that is my conviction i think that the only possible existing sort of religions meeting is something after the fashion of the quaker meeting in that there is no professional religious man at all not a trace of the sacrifices to the ancient gods and no room for a professional religions man he felt his argument did a little escape him he snatched that is what i want to make clear to you god is not a speciality he is a universal interest  he stopped both daphne and clementina seemed disposed to say something and did not say anything  miriam was the first to speak daddy she said i know im stupid but are we still christians  i want you to think for yourselves  but i mean said miriam are wesomething like quakersa sort of very broad christians  you are what you choose to be if you want to keep in the church then you must keep in the church if you feel that the christian doctrine is alive then it is alive so far as you are concerned  but the creeds asked clementina  he shook his head so far as christianity is defined by its creeds i am not a christian if we are going to call any sort of religious feeling that has a respect for jesus christianity then no doubt i am a christian but so was mohammed at that rate let me tell you what i believe i believe in god i believe in the immediate presence of god in every human life i believe that our lives have to serve the kingdom of god  that practically is what mr chasters calls the core of truth in christianity  you have been reading him  eleanor lent me the book but mr chasters keeps his living  i am not chasters said scrope stiffly and then relenting what he does may be right for him but i could not do as he does  lady ella had said no word for some time  i would be ashamed she said quietly if you had not done as you have done i dont mindthe girls dont mindall this not when we understandas we do now  that was the limit of her eloquence  not now that we understand daddy said clementina and a faint flavour of lady sunderbund seemed to pass and vanish  there was a queer little pause he stood rather distressed and perplexed because the talk had not gone quite as he had intended it to go it had deteriorated towards personal issues phoebe broke the awkwardness by jumping up and coming to her father dear daddy she said and kissed him  we didnt understand properly said clementina in the tone of one who explains away muchthat had never been spoken  daddy said miriam with an inspiration may i play something to you presently  but the fire interjected lady ella disposing of that idea  i want you to know all of you the faith i have he said  daphne had remained seated at the table  are we never to go to church again she asked as if at a loss  17   scrope went back into his little study he felt shy and awkward with his daughters now he felt it would be difficult to get back to usualness with them tonight it would be impossible tomorrow he must come down to breakfast as though their talk had never occurred in his rehearsal of this deliverance during his walk home he had spoken much more plainly of his sense of the coming of god to rule the world and end the long age of the warring nations and competing traders and he had intended to speak with equal plainness of the passionate subordination of the individual life to this great common purpose of god and man an aspect he had scarcely mentioned at all but in that little room in the presence of those dear familiar people those great horizons of life had vanished the room with its folding doors had fixed the scale the wallpaper had smothered the kingdom of god he had been he felt domestic it had been an aftersupper talk he had been put out too by the mention of lady sunderbund and the case of chasters  in his study he consoled himself for this diminution of his intention it had taken him five years he reflected to get to his present real sense of gods presence and to his personal subordination to gods purpose it had been a little absurd he perceived to expect these girls to leap at once to a complete understanding of the halting hints the allusive indications of the thoughts that now possessed his soul he tried like some maiden speaker to recall exactly what it was he had said and what it was he had forgotten to say this was merely a beginning merely a beginning  after the girls had gone to bed lady ella came to him and she was glowing and tender she was in love again as she had not been since the shadow had first fallen between them i was so glad you spoke to them she said they had been puzzled but they are dear loyal girls  he tried to tell her rather more plainly what he felt about the whole question of religion in their lives but eloquence had departed from him  you see ella life cannot get out of tragedyand sordid tragedyuntil we bring about the kingdom of god its no unreality that has made me come out of the church  no dear no she said soothingly and reassuringly with all these mere boys going to the most dreadful deaths in the trenches with death hardship and separation running amok in the world  one has to do something she agreed  i know dear he said that all this year of doubt and change has been a dreadful year for you  it was stupid of me she said but i have been so unhappy its over nowbut i was wretched and there was nothing i could say i prayed it isnt the poverty i feared ever but the disgrace nowim happy im happy again  but how far do you come with me  im with you  but he said you are still a churchwoman  i dont know she said i dont mind  he stared at her  but i thought always that was what hurt you most my breach with the church  things are so different now she said  her heart dissolved within her into tender possessiveness there came flooding into her mind the old phrases of an ancient story whither thou goest i will go thy people shall be my people and thy god my god the lord do so to me and more also if aught but death part thee and me  just those words would lady ella have said to her husband now but she was capable of no such rhetoric  whither thou goest she whispered almost inaudibly and she could get no further my dear she said  18   at two oclock the next morning scrope was still up he was sitting over the snoring gas fire in his study he did not want to go to bed his mind was too excited he knew for any hope of sleep in the last twelve hours since he had gone out across the park to his momentous talk with lady sunderbund it seemed to him that his life had passed through its cardinal crisis and come to its crown and decision the spiritual voyage that had begun five years ago amidst a stormy succession of theological nightmares had reached harbour at last he was established now in the sure conviction of gods reality and of his advent to unify the lives of men and to save mankind some unobserved process in his mind had perfected that conviction behind the cloudy veil of his vacillations and moods surely that work was finished now and the days experience had drawn the veil and discovered god established for ever  he contrasted this simple and overruling knowledge of god as the supreme fact in a practical world with that vague and ineffective subject for sentiment who had been the god of his anglican days some theologian once spoke of god as the friend behind phenomena that anglican deity had been rather a vague flummery behind court and society wealth respectability and the comfortable life and even while he had lived in lipservice to that complaisant compromise this true god had been here this god he now certainly professed waiting for his allegiance waiting to take up the kingship of this distraught and bloodstained earth the finding of god is but the stripping of bandages from the eyes seek and ye shall find  he whispered four words very softly the kingdom of god  he was quite sure he had that now quite sure  the kingdom of god  that now was the form into which all his life must fall he recalled his vision of the silver sphere and of ten thousand diverse minds about the world all making their ways to the same one conclusion here at last was a king and emperor for mankind for whom one need have neither contempt nor resentment here was an aim for which man might forge the steel and wield the scalpel write and paint and till and teach upon this conception he must model all his life upon this basis he must found friendships and cooperations all the great religions christianity islam in the days of their power and honesty had proclaimed the advent of this kingdom of god it had been their common inspiration a religion surrenders when it abandons the promise of its millennium he had recovered that ancient and immortal hope all men must achieve it and with their achievement the rule of god begins he muttered his faith it made it more definite to put it into words and utter it it comes it surely comes tomorrow i begin i will do no work that goes not godward always now it shall be the truth as near as i can put it always now it shall be the service of the commonweal as well as i can do it i will live for the ending of all false kingship and priestcraft for the eternal growth of the spirit of man  he was he knew clearly only one common soldier in a great army that was finding its way to enlistment round and about the earth he was not alone while the kings of this world fought for dominion these others gathered and found themselves and one another these others of the faith that grows plain these men who have resolved to end the bloodstained chronicles of the dynasts and the miseries of a world that trades in life for ever they were many men speaking divers tongues he was but one who obeyed the worldwide impulse he could smile at the artless vanity that had blinded him to the import of his earlier visions that had made him imagine himself a sole discoverer a new prophet that had brought him so near to founding a new sect every soldier in the new host was a recruiting sergeant according to his opportunity and none was leader only god was leader  the achievement of the kingdom of god this was his calling henceforth this was his business in life  for a time he indulged in vague dreams of that kingdom of god on earth of which he would be one of the makers it was a dream of a shadowy splendour of cities of great scientific achievements of a universal beauty of beautiful people living in the light of god of a splendid adventure thrusting out at last among the stars but neither his natural bent nor his mental training inclined him to mechanical or administrative explicitness much more was his dream a vision of men inwardly ennobled and united in spirit he saw history growing reasonable and life visibly noble as mankind realized the divine aim all the outward peace and order the joy of physical existence finely conceived the mounting power and widening aim were but the expression and verification of the growth of god within then we would bear children for finer ends than the blood and mud of battlefields life would tower up like a great flame by faith we reached forward to that the vision grew more splendid as it grew more metaphorical and the price one paid for that one gave sham dignities false honour a levitical righteousness immediate peace one bartered kings and churches for god he looked at the mean povertystruck room he marked the dinginess and tawdriness of its detail and all the sordid evidences of ungracious bargaining and grudging service in its appointments for all his life now he would have to live in such rooms he who had been one of the lucky ones well men were living in dugouts and dying gaily in muddy trenches they had given limbs and lives eyes and the joy of movement prosperity and pride for a smaller cause and a feebler assurance than this that he had found  19   presently his thoughts were brought back to his family by the sounds of eleanors return he heard her key in the outer door he heard her move about in the hall and then slip lightly up to bed he did not go out to speak to her and she did not note the light under his door  he would talk to her later when this discovery of her own emotions no longer dominated her mind he recalled her departing figure and how she had walked touching and looking up to her young mate and he a little leaning to her  god bless them and save them he said  he thought of her sisters they had said but little to his clumsy explanations he thought of the years and experience that they must needs pass through before they could think the fulness of his present thoughts and so he tempered his disappointment they were a gallant group he felt he had to thank ella and good fortune that so they were there was clementina with her odd quick combatant sharpness a harder being than eleanor but nevertheless a finespirited and even more independent there was miriam indefatigably kind phoebe too had a real passion of the intellect and daphne an innate disposition to service but it was strange how they had taken his proclamation of a conclusive breach with the church as though it was a command they must at least outwardly obey he had expected them to be more deeply shocked he had thought he would have to argue against objections and convert them to his views their acquiescence was strange they were content he should think all this great issue out and give his results to them and his wife well as he knew her had surprised him he thought of her words whither thou goest  he was dissatisfied with this unconditional agreement why could not his wife meet god as he had met god why must miriam put the fantastic questionas though it was not for her to decide are we still christians and pursuing this thought why couldnt lady sunderbund set up in religion for herself without going about the world seeking for a priest and prophet were women undines who must get their souls from mortal men and who was it tempted men to set themselves up as priests it was the wife the disciple the lover who was the last the most fatal pitfall on the way to god  he began to pray still sitting as he prayed  oh god he prayed thou who has shown thyself to me let me never forget thee again save me from forgetfulness and show thyself to those i love show thyself to all mankind use me o god use me but keep my soul alive save me from the presumption of the trusted servant save me from the vanity of authority  and let thy light shine upon all those who are so dear to me save them from me take their dear loyalty  he paused a flushed childishly miserable face that stared indignantly through glittering tears rose before his eyes he forgot that he had been addressing god  how can i help you you silly thing he said i would give my own soul to know that god had given his peace to you i could not do as you wished and i have hurt you you hurt yourself but all the time you would have hampered me and tempted meand wasted yourself it was impossible and yet you are so fine  he was struck by another aspect  ella was happypartly because lady sunderbund was hurt and left desolated  both of them are still living upon nothings living for nothings a phantom way of living  he stared blankly at the humming blue gas jets amidst the incandescent asbestos for a space  make them understand he pleaded as though he spoke confidentially of some desirable and reasonable thing to a friend who sat beside him you see it is so hard for them until they understand it is easy enough when one understands easy he reflected for some momentsit is as if they could not existexcept in relationship to other definite people i want them to existas now i existin relationship to god knowing god  but now he was talking to himself again  so far as one can know god he said presently  for a while he remained frowning at the fire then he bent forward turned out the gas arose with the air of a man who relinquishes a difficult task one is limited he said all ones ideas must fall within ones limitations faith is a sort of tour de force a feat of the imagination for such things as we are naturallynaturally one
