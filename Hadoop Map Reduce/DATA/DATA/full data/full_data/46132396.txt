46132396	april hopes  1887  by william dean howells     i  from his place on the floor of the hemenway gymnasium mr elbridge g mavering looked on at the class day gaiety with the advantage which his stature gave him over most people there hundreds of these were pretty girls in a great variety of charming costumes such as the eclecticism of modern fashion permits and all sorts of ingenious compromises between walking dress and ball dress it struck him that the young men on whose arms they hung in promenading around the long oval within the crowd of stationary spectators were very much younger than students used to be whether they wore the dresscoats of the seniors or the cutaway of the juniors and sophomores and the young girls themselves did not look so old as he remembered them in his day there was a band playing somewhere and the galleries were well filled with spectators seated at their ease and intent on the partycoloured turmoil of the floor where from time to time the younger promenaders broke away from the ranks into a waltz and after some turns drifted back smiling and controlling their quick breath and resumed their promenade the place was intensely light in the candour of a summer day which had no reserves and the brilliancy was not broken by the simple decorations ropes of wild laurel twisted up the pine posts of the aisles and swung in festoons overhead masses of tropical plants in pots were set along between the posts on one side of the room and on the other were the lunch tables where a great many people were standing about eating chicken and salmon salads or strawberries and icecream and drinking claretcup from the whole rose that blended odour of viands of flowers of stuffs of toilet perfumes which is the characteristic expression of all social festivities and which exhilarates or depressesaccording as one is new or old to it  elbridge mavering kept looking at the faces of the young men as if he expected to see a certain one then he turned his eyes patiently upon the faces around him he had been introduced to a good many persons but he had come to that time of life when an introduction unless charged with some special interest only adds the pain of doubt to the wearisome encounter of unfamiliar people and he had unconsciously put on the severity of a man who finds himself without acquaintance where others are meeting friends when a small man with a neatly trimmed reddishgrey beard and prominent eyes stepped in front of him and saluted him with the hello mavering of a contemporary  his face after a moment of question relaxed into joyful recognition why john munt is that you he said and he took into his large moist palm the dry little hand of his friend while they both broke out into the incoherencies of people meeting after a long time mr mavering spoke in it voice soft yet firm and with a certain thickness of tongue which gave a boyish charm to his slow utterance and mr munt used the sort of bronchial snuffle sometimes cultivated among us as a chest tone but they were cut short in their intersecting questions and exclamations by the presence of the lady who detached herself from mr munts arm as if to leave him the freer for his handshaking  oh he said suddenly recurring to her let me introduce you to mrs pasmer mr mavering and the latter made a bow that creased his waistcoat at about the height of mrs pasmers pretty little nose  his waistcoat had the curve which waistcoats often describe at his age and his heavy shoulders were thrown well back to balance this curve his coat hung carelessly open the panama hat in his hand suggested a certain habitual informality of dress but his smoothly shaven large handsome face with its jaws slowly ruminant upon nothing intimated the consequence of a man accustomed to supremacy in a subordinate place  mrs pasmer looked up to acknowledge the introduction with a sort of pseudorespectfulness which it would be hard otherwise to describe whether she divined or not that she was in the presence of a magnate of some sort she was rather superfluously demure in the first two or three things she said and was all sympathy and interest in the meeting of these old friends they declared that they had not seen each other for twenty years or at any rate not since 59 she listened while they disputed about the exact date and looked from time to time at mr munt as if for some explanation of mr mavering but munt himself when she saw him last had only just begun to commend himself to society which had since so fully accepted him and she had so suddenly the moment before found her self hand in glove with him that she might well have appealed to a third person for some explanation of munt but she was not a woman to be troubled much by this momentary mystification and she was not embarrassed at all when munt said as if it had all been prearranged well now mrs pasmer if youll let me leave you with mr mavering a moment ill go off and bring that unnatural child to you no use dragging you round through this crowd longer  he made a gesture intended in the american manner to be at once polite and jocose and was gone leaving mrs pasmer a little surprised and mr mavering in some misgiving which he tried to overcome pressing his jaws together two or three times without speaking she had no trouble in getting in the first remark isnt all this charming mr mavering she spoke in a deep low voice with a caressing manner and stood looking up at mr mavering with one shoulder shrugged and the other drooped and a tasteful composition of her fan and hands and handkerchief at her waist  yes maam it is said mr mavering he seemed to say maam to her with a public or official accent which sent mrs primers mind fluttering forth to poise briefly at such conjectures as congressman from a country district judge of the common pleas bank president railroad superintendent leading physician in a large townno mr munt said mister and then to return to her pretty blue eyes and to centre there in that pseudorespectful attention under the arch of her neat brows and her soberly crinkled greythreaded brown hair and her very appropriate bonnet a bonnet she said was much more than half the battle after forty and it was now quite after forty with mrs pasmer but she was very well dressed otherwise mr mavering went on to say with a deliberation that seemed an element of his unknown dignity whatever it might be a number of the young fellows together can give a much finer spread and make more of the day in a place like this than we used to do in our rooms  ah then youre a harvard man too said mrs primer to herself with surprise which she kept to herself and she said to mavering oh yes indeed its altogether better arent they nice looking fellows she said putting up her glass to look at the promenaders  yes mr mavering assented i suppose he added out of the consciousness of his own relation to the affairi suppose youve a son somewhere here  oh dear no cried mrs primer with a mingling superhuman but for her of ironical deprecation and derision only a daughter mr mavering  at this feat of mrs pasmers mr mavering looked at her with question as to her precise intention and ended by repeating hopelessly only a daughter  yes said mrs pasmer with a sigh of the same irony only a poor despised young girl mr mavering  you speak said mr mavering beginning to catch on a little as if it were a misfortune and his dignity broke up into a smile that had its queer fascination  why isnt it asked mrs pasmer  well i shouldnt have thought so  then you dont believe that all that oldfashioned chivalry and devotion have gone out you dont think the young men are all spoiled nowadays and expect the young ladies to offer them attentions  no said mr mavering slowly as if recovering from the shock of the novel ideas do you  oh im such a stranger in bostonive lived abroad so longthat i dont know one hears all kinds of things but im so glad youre not one of thosepessimists  well said mr mavering still thoughtfully i dont know that i can speak by the card exactly i cant say how it is now i havent been at a class day spread since my own class day i havent even been at commencement more than once or twice but in my time here we didnt expect the young ladies to show us attentions at any rate we didnt wait for them to do it we were very glad to be asked to meet them and we thought it an honour if the young ladies would let us talk or dance with them or take them to picnics i dont think that any of them could complain of want of attention  yes said mrs pasmer thats what i preached thats what i prophesied when i brought my daughter home from europe i told her that a girls life in america was one long triumph but they say now that girls have more attention in london even than in cambridge one hears such dreadful things  like what asked mr mavering with the unserious interest which mrs primer made most people feel in her talk  oh its too vast a subject but they tell you about charming girls moping the whole evening through at boston parties with no young men to talk with and sitting from the beginning to the end of an assembly and not going on the floor once they say that unless a girl fairly throws herself at the young mens heads she isnt noticed its this terrible disproportion of the sexes thats at the root of it i suppose it reverses everything there arent enough young men to go half round and they know it and take advantage of it i suppose it began in the war  he laughed and i should think he said laying hold of a single idea out of several which she had presented that there would always be enough young men in cambridge to go round  mrs pasmer gave a little cry in cambridge  yes when i was in college our superiority was entirely numerical  but thats all passed long ago from what i hear retorted mrs pasmer i know very well that it used to be thought a great advantage for a girl to be brought up in cambridge because it gave her independence and ease of manner to have so many young men attentive to her but they say the students all go into boston now and if the cambridge girls want to meet them they have to go there too oh i assure you that from what i hear theyve changed all that since our time mr mavering  mrs pasmer was certainly letting herself go a little more than she would have approved of in another the result was apparent in the jocosity of this heavy mr maverings reply  well then im glad that i was of our time and not of this wicked generation but i presume that unnatural supremacy of the young men is brought low so to speak after marriage  mrs primer let herself go a little further oh give us an equal chance she laughed and we can always take care of ourselves and something more they say she added that the young married women now have all the attention that girls could wish  hm said mr mavering frowning i think i should be tempted to box my boys ears if i saw him paying another mans wife attention  what a roman father cried mrs pasmer greatly amused and letting herself go a little further yet she said to herself that she really must find out who this remarkable mr mavering was and she cast her eye over the hall for some glimpse of the absent munt whose arm she meant to take and whose ear she meant to fill with questions but she did not see him and something else suggested itself he probably wouldnt let you see him or if he did you wouldnt know it  how not know it  mrs primer did not answer one hears such dreadful things what do you sayor youll think im a terrible gossip  oh no said mr mavering impatient for the dreadful thing whatever it was  mrs primer resumed to the young married women meeting last winter just after a lot of pretty girls had came out and magnanimously resolving to give the buds a chance in society  the buds  yes the rosebudsthe debutantes its an odious little word but everybody uses it dont you think thats a strange state of things for america but i cant believe all those things said mrs pasmer flinging off the shadow of this lurid social condition isnt this a pretty scene  yes it is mr mavering admitted withdrawing his mind gradually from a consideration of mrs pasmers awful instances yes he added in final selfpossession the young fellows certainly do things in a great deal better style nowadays than we used to  oh yes indeed and all those pretty girls do seem to be having such a good time  yes they dont have the despised and rejected appearance that youd like to have one believe  not in the least mrs pasmer readily consented they look radiantly happy it shows that you cant trust anything that people say to you she abandoned the ground she had just been taking without apparent shame for her inconsistency i fancy its pretty much as its always been if a girl is attractive the young men find it out  perhaps said mr mavering unbending with dignity the young married women have held another meeting and resolved to give the buds one more chance  oh there are some pretty mature roses here said mrs pasmer laughing evasively but i suppose class day can never be taken from the young girls  i hope not said mr mavering his wandering eye fell upon some young men bringing refreshments across the nave toward them and he was reminded to ask mrs pasmer will you have something to eat he had himself had a good deal to eat before he took up his position at the advantageous point where john munt had found him  why yes thank you said mrs pasmer i ought to say an ice please but im really hungry and  ill get you some of the salad said mr mavering with the increased liking a man feels for a woman when she owns to an appetite sit down here he added and he caught a vacant chair toward her when he turned about from doing so he confronted a young gentleman coming up to mrs pasmer with a young lady on his arm and making a very low bow of relinquishment     ii  the men looked smilingly at each other without saying anything and the younger took in due form the introduction which the young lady gave him  my mother mr mavering  mr mavering cried mrs pasmer in a pure astonishment before she had time to colour it with a polite variety of more conventional emotions she glanced at the two men and gave a little oh of inquiry and resignation and then said demurely let me introduce you to mr mavering alice while the young fellow laughed nervously and pulled out his handkerchief partly to hide the play of his laughter and partly to wipe away the perspiration which a great deal more laughing had already gathered on his forehead he had a vein that showed prominently down its centre and large mobile girlish blue eyes under good brows an arched nose and rather a long face and narrow chin he had beautiful white teeth as he laughed these were seen set in a jaw that contracted very much toward the front he was tall and slim and he wore with elegance the evening dress which class day custom prescribes for the seniors in his buttonhole he had a club button  i shall not have to ask an introduction to mr mavering and youve robbed me of the pleasure of giving him one to you mrs pasmer he said  she heard the young man in the course of a swift review of what she had said to his father and with a formless resentment of the fathers not having told her he had a son there but she answered with the flattering sympathy she had the use of oh but you wont miss one pleasure out of so many today mr mavering and think of the little dramatic surprise  oh perfect he said with another laugh i told miss pasmer as we came up  oh then you were in the surprise alice said mrs pasmer searching her daughters eyes for confession or denial of this little community of interest the girl smiled slightly upon the young man but not disapprovingly and made no other answer to her mother who went on where in the world have you been did mr munt find you who told you where i was did you see me how did you know i was here was there ever anything so droll she did not mean her questions to be answered or at least not then for while her daughter continued to smile rather more absently and young mavering broke out continuously in his nervous laugh and his father stood regarding him with visible satisfaction she hummed on turning to the young man but im quite appalled at alices having monopolised even for a few minutes a whole seniorand probably an official senior at that she said with a glance at the pink and white club button in his coat lapel and i cant let you stay another instant mr mavering i know very well how many demands you have upon you and you must go back directly to your sisters and your cousins and your aunts and all the rest of them you must indeed  oh no dont drive me away mrs pasmer pleaded the young man laughing violently and then wiping his face i assure you that ive no encumbrances of any kind here except my father and he seems to have been taking very good care of himself they all laughed at this and the young fellow hurried on dont be alarmed at my button it only means a love of personal decoration if thats where you got the notion of my being an official senior this isnt my spread i shall hope to welcome you at beck hall after the tree and i wish youd let me be of use to you wouldnt you like to go round to some of the smaller spreads i think it would amuse you and have you got tickets to the tree to see us make fools of ourselves its worth seeing mrs pasmer i assure you  he rattled on very rapidly but with such a frankness in his urgency such amiable kindliness that mrs pasmer could not feel that it was pushing she looked at her daughter but she stood as passive in the transaction as the elder mavering she was taller than her mother and as she waited her supple figure described that fine lateral curve which one sees in some louis quinze portraits this effect was enhanced by the fashion of her dress of pale sage green with a wide stripe or sash of white dropping down the front from her delicate waist the same simple combination of colours was carried up into her hat which surmounted darker hair than mrs pasmers and a complexion of wholesome pallor her eyes were grey and grave with black brows and her face which was rather narrow had a pleasing irregularity in the sharp jut of the nose in profile the parting of the red lips showed well back into the cheek  i dont know said mrs pasmer in her own behalf and she added in his about letting you take so much trouble so smoothly that it would have been quite impossible to detect the point of union in the two utterances  well dont call it names anyway mrs pasmer pleaded the young man i thought it was nothing but a pleasure and a privilege  the fact is she explained neither consenting nor refusing that we were expecting to meet some friends who had tickets for usyoung maverings face felland i cant imagine whats happened  oh lets hope something dreadful he cried  perhaps you know them she delayed further professor saintsbury  well rather why they were here about an hour agoboth of them they must have been looking for you  yes we were to meet them here we waited to come out with other friends and i was afraid we were late mrs pasmers face expressed a tempered disappointment and she looked at her daughter for indications of her wishes in the circumstances seeing in her eye a willingness to accept young maverings invitation she hesitated more decidedly than she had yet done for she was other things being equal quite willing to accept it herself but other things were not equal and the whole situation was very odd all that she knew of mr mavering the elder was that he was the old friend of john munt and she knew far too little of john munt except that he seemed to go everywhere and to be welcome not to feel that his introduction was hardly a warrant for what looked like an impending intimacy she did not dislike mr mavering he was evidently a country person of great selfrespect and no doubt of entire respectability he seemed very intelligent too he was a harvard man he had rather a cultivated manner or else naturally a clever way of saying things but all that was really nothing if she knew no more about him and she certainly did not if she could only have asked her daughter who it was that presented young mavering to her that might have formed some clew but there was no earthly chance of asking this and besides it was probably one of those haphazard introductions that people give on such occasions young maverings behaviour gave her still greater question his selfpossession his entire absence of anxiety or any expectation of rebuff or snub might be the ease of unimpeachable social acceptance or it might be merely adventurous effrontery only something ingenuous and good in the young fellows handsome face forbade this conclusion that his face was so handsome was another of the complications she recalled in the dreamlike swiftness with which all these things passed through her mind what her friends had said to alice about her being sure to meet her fate on class day and she looked at her again to see if she had met it  well mamma said the girl smiling at her mothers look  mrs pasmer thought she must have been keeping young mavering waiting a long time for his answer why of course alice but i really dont know what to do about the saintsburys this was not in the least true but it instantly seemed so to mrs pasmer as a plausible excuse will when we make it  why ill tell you what mrs pasmer said young mavering with a cordial unsuspicion that both won and reassured her well be sure to find them at some of the spreads let me be of that much use anyway you must  we really oughtnt to let you said mrs pasmer making a last effort to cling to her reluctance but feeling it fail with a sensation that was not disagreeable she could not help being pleased with the pleasure that she saw in her daughters face  young maverings was radiant ill be back in just half a minute he said and he took a gay leave of them in running to speak to another student at the opposite end of the hall     iii  you must allow me to get you something to eat first mrs pasmer said the elder mavering  oh no thank you mrs pasmer began but she changed her mind and said or yes i will mr mavering a very little salad please she had really forgotten her hunger as a woman will in the presence of any social interest but she suddenly thought his going would give her a chance for two words with her daughter and so she sent him as he creaked heavily across the smooth floor of the nave alice she whispered i dont know exactly what ive done who introduced this young mr mavering to you  mr munt  mr munt  yes he came for me he said you sent him he introduced mr mavering and he was very polite mr mavering said we ought to go up into the gallery and see how it looked and mr munt said hed been up and mr mavering promised to bring me back to him but he was not there when we got back mr mavering got me some ice cream first and then he found you for me  really said mrs pasmer to herself the combat thickens to her daughter she said hes very handsome  he laughs too much said the daughter her mother recognised her uncandour with a glance but he waltzes well added the girl  waltzes echoed the mother did you waltz with him alice  everybody else was dancing he asked me for a turn or two and of course i did it what difference  oh nonenone onlyi didnt see you  perhaps you werent looking  yes i was looking all the time  what do you mean mamma  well said mrs pasmer in a final despair we dont know anything about them  were the only people here who dont then said her daughter the ladies were bowing right left to him all the time and he kept asking if i knew this one and that one and all i could say was that some of them were distant cousins but i wasnt acquainted with them i would think hed wonder who we were  yes said the mother thoughtfully  there hes laughing with that other student but dont look  mrs pasmer saw well enough out of the corner of her eye the joking that went on between mavering and his friend and it did not displease her to think that it probably referred to alice while the young man came hurrying back to them she glanced at the girl standing near her with a keenly critical inspection from which she was able to exclude all maternal partiality and justly decided that she was one of the most effective girls in the place that costume of hers was perfect mrs pasmer wished now that she could have compared it more carefully with other costumes she had noticed some very pretty ones and a feeling of vexation that alice should have prevented this by being away so long just when the crowd was densest qualified her satisfaction the people were going very fast now the line of the oval in the nave was broken into groups of lingering talkers who were conspicuous to each other and mrs pasmer felt that she and her daughter were conspicuous to all the rest where they stood apart with the two maverings converging upon them from different points the son nodding and laughing to friends of both sexes as he came the father wholly absorbed in not spilling the glass of claret punch which he carried in one hand and not falling down on the slippery floor with the plate of salad which he bore in the other she had thoughts of feigning unconsciousness she would have had no scruple in practising this or any other social stratagem for though she kept a conscience in regard to certain matterswhat she considered essentialsshe lived a thousand little lies every day and taught her daughter by precept and example to do the same you must seem to be looking one way when you were really looking another you must say this when you meant that you must act as if you were thinking one thing when you were thinking something quite different and all to no end for as she constantly said people always know perfectly well what you were about whichever way you looked or whatever you said or no matter how well you acted the part of thinking what you did not think now although she seemed not to look she saw all that has been described at a glance and at another she saw young mavering slide easily up to his father and relieve him of the plate and glass with a laugh as pleasant and a show of teeth as dazzling as he bestowed upon any of the ladies he had passed she owned to her recondite heart that she liked this in young mavering though at the same time she asked herself what motive he really had in being so polite to his father before people but she had no time to decide she had only time to pack the question hurriedly away for future consideration when young mavering arrived at her elbow and she turned with a little oh of surprise so perfectly acted that it gave her the greatest pleasure     iv  i dont think my father would have got here alive with these things said young mavering did you see how i came to his rescue  mrs pasmer instantly threw away all pretext of not having seen oh yes my heart was in my mouth when you bore down upon him mr mavering it was a beautiful instance of filial devotion  well do sit down now mrs pasmer and take it comfortably said the young fellow and he got her one of the many empty chairs and would not give her the things which he put in another till she sat down and let him spread a napkin over her lap  really she said i feel as if i were stopping all the wheels of class day am i keeping them from closing the gymnasium mr mavering  not quite said the young man with one of his laughs i dont believe they will turn us out and ill see that they dont lock us in dont hurry mrs pasmer im only sorry you hadnt something sooner  oh your father proposed getting me something a good while ago  did he then i wonder you havent had it hes usually on time  youre both very energetic i think said mrs pasmer  hes the father of his son said the young fellow assuming the merit with a bow of burlesque modesty  it went to mrs pasmers heart lets hope hell never forget that she said in an enjoyment of the excitement and the salad that was beginning to leave her question of these maverings a light diaphanous cloud on the verge of the horizon  the elder mavering had been trying without success to think of something to say to miss pasmer he had twice cleared his throat for that purpose but this comedy between his son and the young ladys mother seemed so much lighter and brighter than anything he could have said that he said nothing and looked on with his mouth set in its queer smile while the girl listened with the gravity of a daughter who sees that her mother is losing her head mrs pasmer buzzed on in her badinage with the young man and allowed him to go for a cup of coffee before she rose from her chair and shook out her skirts with an air of pleasant expectation of whatever should come next  he came back without it the coffee urn has dried up here mrs pasmer but you can get some at the other spreads theyd be inconsolable if you didnt take something everywhere  they all started toward the door but the elder mavering said holding back a little dan i think ill go and see  oh no you mustnt father cried the young man laying his hand with caressing entreaty on his fathers coat sleeve i dont want you to go anywhere till youve seen professor saintsbury we shall be sure to meet him at some of the spreads i want you to have that talk with him he corrected himself for the instants deflection from the interests of his guest and added i want you to help me hunt him up for mrs pasmer now mrs pasmer youre not to think its the least trouble or anything but a boon much less say it he cried turning to the deprecation in mrs pasmers face he turned away from it to acknowledge the smiles and bows of people going out of the place and he returned their salutations with charming heartiness  in the vestibule they met the friends they were going in search of     v  with mr mavering of course exclaimed mrs saintsbury i might have known it mrs pasmer would have given anything she could think of to be able to ask why her friend might have known it but for the present they could only fall upon each other with flashes of selfaccusal and explanation and rejoicing for their deferred and now accomplished meeting the professor stood by with the satirical smile with which men witness the effusion of women young mavering after sharing the ladies excitement fully with them rewarded himself by an exclusive moment with miss pasmer  you must get mrs pasmer to let me show you all of class day that a senior can i didnt know what a perfect serpents tooth it was to be one before mrs saintsbury he broke off have you got tickets for the tree ah she doesnt hear me  mrs saintsbury was just then saying to the elder mavering im so glad you decided to come today it would have been a shame if none of you were here she made a feint of dropping her voice with a glance at dan mavering hes such a nice boy which made him laugh and cry out  oh now dont poison my fathers mind mrs saintsbury  oh some one would be sure to tell him retorted the professors wife and hed better hear it from a friend  the young fellow laughed again and then he shook hands with some ladies going out and asked were they going so soon from an abstract hospitality apparently for he was not one of the hosts and so turned once more to miss pasmer we must get away from here or the afternoon will get away from us and leave us nothing to show for it suppose we make a start miss pasmer  he led the way with her out of the vestibule banked round with pots of palm and fern and down the steps into the glare of the cambridge sunshine blown full as is the case on class day of fine cambridge dust which had drawn a delicate grey veil over the grass of the gymnasium lawn and mounted in light clouds from the wheels powdering it finer and finer in the street along the sidewalks dusty hacks and carriages were ranged and others were driving up to let people dismount at the entrances to the college yard within the temporary picketfences secluding a part of the grounds for the students and their friends were seen stretching from dormitory to dormitory long lines of chinese lanterns to be lit after nightfall swung between the elms groups of ladies came and went nearly always under the escort of some student the caterers carts disburdened of their icecreams and salads were withdrawn under the shade in the street and their drivers lounged or drowsed upon the seats now and then a black waiter brilliant as a bobolink in his white jacket and apron appeared on some errand the large mild cambridge policemen kept the entrances to the yard with a benevolent vigilance which was not harsh with the little irish children coming up from the marsh in their best to enjoy the sight of other peoples pleasure  isnt it a perfect class day cried young mavering as he crossed kirkland street with miss pasmer and glanced down its vaulted perspective of elms through which the sunlight broke and lay in the road in pools and washes as far as the eye reached did you ever see anything bluer than the sky today i feel as if wed ordered the weather with the rest of the things and i had some credit for it as host do make it a little compliment miss pasmer i assure you ill be very modest about it  ah i think its fully up to the occasion said the girl catching the spirit of his amiable satisfaction is it the usual class day weather  you spoil everything by asking that cried the young man it obliges me to make a confessionits always good weather on class day there havent been more than a dozen bad class days in the century but youll admit that there cant have been a better class day than this  oh yes its certainly the pleasantest class day ive seen said the girl and now when mavering laughed she laughed too  thank you so much for saying that i hope it will pass off in unclouded brilliancy it will if i can make it why hallo theyre on the other side of the street yet and looking about as if they were lost  he pulled his handkerchief from his pocket and waved it at the others of their party  they caught sight of it and came hurrying over through the dust  mrs saintsbury said apparently as the sum of her consultations with mrs pasmer the tree is to be at halfpast five and after weve seen a few spreads im going to take the ladies hone for a little rest  oh no dont do that pleaded the young man after making this protest he seemed not to have anything to say immediately in support of it he merely added this is miss pasmers first class day and i want her to see it all  but youll have to leave us very soon to get yourself ready for the tree suggested the professors lady with a motherly prevision  i shall want just fifteen minutes for that  i know better mr mavering said mrs saintsbury with finality you will want a good threequarters of an hour to make yourself as disreputable as youll look at the tree and youll have to take time for counsel and meditation you may stay with us just half an hour and then we shall part inexorably ive seen a great many more class days than you have and i know what they are in their demands upon the seniors  oh well then we wont think about the time said the young man starting on with miss pasmer  well dont undertake too much said the lady she came last in the little procession with the elder mavering and her husband and mrs pasmer preceded her  what young mavering called back with his smiling face over his shoulder  she says not to bite off more than you can chew the professor answered for her  mavering broke into a conscious laugh but full of delight and with his handkerchief to his face had almost missed the greeting of some ladies who bowed to him he had to turn round to acknowledge it and he was saluting and returning salutations pretty well all along the line of their progress  im afraid youll think im everybodys friend but my own miss pasmer but i assure you all this is purely accidental i dont know so many people after all only all that i do know seem to be here this morning  i dont think its a thing to be sorry for said the girl i wish we knew more people its rather forlorn  oh will you let me introduce some of the fellows to you theyll be so glad  if youll tell them how forlorn i said i was said the girl with a smile  oh no no no i understand that and i assure you that i didnt supposebut of course he arrested himself in the superfluous reassurance he was offering all that goes without saying only there are some of the fellows coming back to the law school and if youll allow me  we shall be very happy indeed mr mavering said mrs pasmer behind him  oh thank you ever so much mrs pasmer this was occasion for another burst of laughter with him he seemed filled with the intoxication of youth whose spirit was in the bright air of the day and radiant in the young faces everywhere the paths intersecting one another between the different dormitories under the drooping elms were thronged with people coming and going in pairs and groups and the academic fete the prettiest flower of our tough old puritan stem had that charm at once sylvan and elegant which enraptures in the pictured fables of the renaissance it falls at that moment of the year when the old university town often so commonplace and sometimes so ugly becomes briefly and almost pathetically beautiful under the leafage of her hovering elms and in the perfume of her syringas and bathed in this joyful tide of youth that overflows her heart she seems fit then to be the home of the poets who have loved her and sung her and the regret of any friend of the humanities who has left her  alice said mrs pasmer leaning forward a little to speak to her daughter and ignoring a remark of the professors did you ever see so many pretty costumes  never said the girl with equal intensity  well it makes you feel that you have got a country after all sighed mrs pasmer in a sort of apostrophe to her european self you see splendid dressing abroad but its mostly upon old people who ought to be sick and ashamed of their pomps and vanities but here its the young girls who dress and how lovely they are i thought they were charming in the gymnasium but i see you must get them outofdoors to have the full effect mr mavering are they always so prettily dressed on class day  well im beginning to feel as if it wouldnt be exactly modest for me to say so whatever i think youd better ask mrs saintsbury she pretends to know all about it  no im bound to say theyre not said the professors wife candidly your daughter she added in a low tone for all to hear decides that question  im so glad you said that mrs saintsbury said the young man he looked at the girl who blushed with a pleasure that seemed to thrill to the last fibre of her pretty costume  she could not say anything but her mother asked with an effort at selfdenial do you think so really its one of those london things they have so much taste there now she added yielding to her own pride in the dress  yes i supposed it must be said mrs saintsbury we used to come in muslins and tremendous hoopsdont you remember  did you look like your photographs asked young mavering over his shoulder  yes but we didnt know it then said the professors wife  neither did we said the professor we supposed that there had never been anything equal to those hoops and white muslins  thank you my dear said his wife tapping him between the shoulders with her fan now dont go any further  do you mean about our first meeting here on class day asked her husband  theyll think so now said mrs saintsbury patiently with a playful threat of consequences in her tone  when i first saw the present mrs saintsbury pursued the professorit was his joking way of describing her as if there had been several other mrs saintsburysshe was dancing on the green here  ah they dont dance on the green any more i hear sighed mrs pasmer  no they dont said the other lady and i think its just as well it was always a ridiculous affectation of simplicity  it must have been rather public said young mavering in a low voice to miss pasmer  it doesnt seem as if it could ever have been in character quite she answered  were a thoroughly indoors people said the professor and it seems as if we hadnt really begun to get well as a race till we had come in out of the weather  how can you say that on a day like this cried mrs pasmer i didnt suppose any one could be so unromantic  dont flatter him cried his wife  does he consider that a compliment  not personally he answered but its the first duty of a professor of comparative literature to be unromantic  i dont understand faltered mrs pasmer  he will be happy to explain at the greatest possible length said mrs saintsbury but you shant spoil our pleasure now john  they all laughed and the professor looked proud of the wit at his expense the american husband is so and the public attitude of the american husband and wife toward each other is apt to be amiably satirical their relation seems never to have lost its novelty or to lack droll and surprising contrasts for them  besides these passages with her husband mrs saintsbury kept up a full flow of talk with the elder mavering which mrs pasmer did her best to overhear for it related largely to his son whom it seemed from the fathers expressions the saintsburys had been especially kind to  no i assure you mrs pasmer heard her protest mr saintsbury has been very much interested in him i hope he has not put any troublesome ideas into his head of course hes very much interested in literature from his point of view and hes glad to find any of the young men interested in it and thats apt to make him overdo matters a little  dan wished me to talk with him and i shall certainly be glad to do so said the father but in a tone which conveyed to mrs pasmer the impression that though he was always open to conviction his mind was made up on this point whatever it was     vi  the party went to half a dozen spreads some of which were on a scale of public grandeur approaching that of the gymnasium and others of a subdued elegance befitting the more private hospitalities in the students rooms mrs pasmer was very much interested in these rooms whose luxurious appointments testified to the advance of riches and of the taste to apply them since she used to visit students rooms in faroff class days the deep window nooks and easychairs upholstered in the leather that seems sacred alike to the seats and the shelves of libraries the aesthetic bookcases low and topped with bricabrac the etchings and prints on the walls which the elder mavering went up to look at with a mystifying air of understanding such things the foils crossed over the chimney and the mantel with its pipes and its photographs of theatrical celebrities tilted about over itspoke of conditions mostly foreign to mrs pasmers memories of harvard the photographed celebrities seemed to be chosen chiefly for their beauty and for as much of their beauty as possible mrs pasmer perceived with an obscure misgiving of the sort which an older generation always likes to feel concerning the younger but with a tolerance too which was personal to herself it was to be considered that the massive thought and honest amiability of salvinis face and the deep and spiritualized power of booths varied the effect of these companies of posturing nymphs  at many places she either met old friends with whom she clamoured over the wonder of their encounter there or was made acquainted with new people by the saintsburys she kept a mothers eye on her daughter to whom young mavering presented everybody within hail or reach and whom she could see whenever she looked at her a radiant centre of admiration she could hear her talk sometimes and she said to herself that really alice was coming out she had never heard her say so many good things before she did not know it was in her she was very glad then that she had let her wear that dress it was certainly distinguished and the girl carried it off to her mothers amusement with the air of a superb lady of the period from which it dated she thought what a simple child alice really was all the time those other children the seniors were stealing their glances of bold or timid worship at her and doubtless thinking her a brilliant woman of the world but there could be no mistake that she was a success  part of her triumph was of course due to mrs saintsbury whose chaperonage mrs pasmer could see was everywhere of effect but it was also largely due to the vigilant politeness of young mavering who seemed bent on making her have good time and who let no chance slip him mrs pasmer felt his kindness truly and she did not feel it the less because she knew that there was but one thing that could at his frankly selfish age make a young fellow wish to make a girl have a good time except for that reason he must be bending the whole soul of egotistic youth to making some other girl have a good time but all the same it gave her pause when some one to whom she was introduced spoke to her of her friends the maverings as if they were friends of the oldest standing instead of acquaintances of very recent accident she did not think of disclaiming the intimacy but really i shall die of these maverings she said to herself unless i find out something about them pretty soon  im not going to take you to the omicron spread mrs pasmer said young mavering coming up to her with such an effect of sympathetic devotion that she had to ask herself are they my friends the maverings the saintsburys have been there already and it is a little too common the tone of superiority gave mrs pasmer courage theyre good fellows and all that but i want you to see the best i suppose it will get back to giving the spreads all in the fellows rooms again its a good deal pleasanter dont you think  oh yes indeed assented mrs pasmer though she had really been thinking the private spreads were not nearly so amusing as the large spread she had seen at the gymnasium she had also wondered where all mr maverings relations and friends were and the people who had social claims on him that he could be giving up his class day in this reckless fashion to strangers alice would account for a good deal but she would not account for everything mrs pasmer would have been willing to take him from others but if he were so anomalous as to have no one to be taken from of course it lessened his value as a trophy these things went in and out of her mind with a final resolution to get a full explanation from mrs saintsbury while she stood and smiled her winning assent up into the young mans handsome face  mrs saintsbury caught sight of them and as if suddenly reminded of a forgotten duty rushed vividly upon him  mr mavering i shall not let you stay with us another minute you must go to your room now and get ready you ought to have a little rest  he broke out in his laugh do you think i want to go and lie down awhile like a lady before a party  im sure youd be the stronger for it said mrs saintsbury but go upon any theory dont you see there isnt a senior left  he would not look round theyve gone to other spreads he said but now ill tell you it is pretty near time and if youll take me to my room ill go  youre a spoiled boy said mrs saintsbury  but i want mrs pasmer to see the room of a real studenta reading man and all thatand well come to humour you  well come upon any theory said young mavering  his father and professor saintsbury who had been instructed by his wife not to lose sight of her were at hand and they crossed to that old hall which keeps its favour with the students in spite of the rivalry of the newer dormitoriesit would be hard to say why  mrs pasmer willingly assented to its being much better out of pure complaisance though the ceilings were low and the windows small and it did not seem to her that the franklin stove and the aesthetic papering and painting of young maverings room brought it up to the level of those others that she had seen but with her habit of saying some friendly lying thing no matter what her impressions were she exclaimed oh how cosy and glad of the word she went about from one to another asking isnt this cosy  mrs saintsbury said its supposed to be the cell of a recluse but it is cosyyes  it looks as if some hermit had been using it as a storeroom said her husband for there were odds and ends of furniture and clothes and boxes and handbags scattered about the floor  i forgot all about them when i asked you cried mavering laughing out his delight they belong to some fellows that are giving spreads in their rooms and i let them put them in here  do you commonly let people put things in your room that they want to get rid off asked mrs pasmer  well not when im expecting company  he couldnt refuse even then if they pressed the matter said mrs saintsbury lecturing upon him to her friend  im afraid youre too amiable altogether mr mavering im sure you let people impose upon you said the other lady you have been letting us impose upon you  ah now that proves youre all wrong mrs pasmer  it proves that you know how to say things very prettily  oh thank you i know when im having a good time and i do my best to enjoy it he ended with the nervous laugh which seemed habitual with him  he does laugh a good deal thought mrs pasmer surveying him with smiling steadiness i suppose it tires alice some of his teeth are filled at the sides that vein in his foreheadthey say that means genius she said to him i hope you know when others are having a good time too mr mavering you ought to have that reward  they both looked at alice oh i should be so happy to think you hadnt been bored with it all mrs pasmer he returnedwithdeep feeling  alice was looking at one of the sketches which were pretty plentifully pinned about the wall and apparently seeing it and apparently listening to what professor saintsbury was saying but her mother believed from a tremor of the ribbons on her hat that she was conscious of nothing but young maverings gaze and the sound of his voice  weve been delighted simply enchanted said mrs pasmer and she thought now if alice were to turn round just as she stands he could see all the best points of her face i wonder what she really thinks of him what is it you have there alice she asked aloud  the girl turned her face over her shoulder so exactly in the way her mother wished that mrs pasmer could scarcely repress a cry of joy a sketch of mr maverings  oh how very interesting said mrs pasmer do you sketch mr mavering but of course she pressed forward and studied the sketch inattentively how very very good she buzzed deep in her throat while with a glance at her daughter she thought how impassive alice is but she behaves with great dignity yes perhaps thats best and are you going to be an artist she asked of mavering  not if it can be prevented he answered laughing again  but his laugh is very pleasant reflected mrs pasmer does alice dislike it so much she repeated aloud if it can be prevented  they think i might spoil a great lawyer in the attempt  oh i see and are you going to be a lawyer but to be a great painter and america has so few of them she knew quite well that she was talking nonsense but she was aware through her own indifference to the topic that he was not minding what she said but was trying to bring himself into talk with alice again the girl persistently listened to professor saintsbury  is she punishing him for something her mother asked herself what can it be for does she think hes a little too pushing perhaps he is a little pushing she reflected with an inward sigh that she would know whether he was if she only knew more about him  he did the honours of his room very simply and nicely and he said it was pretty rough to think this was the last of it after which he faltered and something occurred to mrs saintsbury  why were keeping you its time for you to dress for the tree johnshe reproached her husbandhow could you let us do it  far be it from me to hurry ladies out of other peoples housesespecially ladies who have put themselves in charge of other people  no dont hurry pleaded mavering theres plenty of time  how much time asked mrs saintsbury  he looked at his watch well a good quarter of an hour  and i was to have taken mrs pasmer and alice home for a little rest before the tree cried mrs saintsbury and now we must go at once or we shall get no sort of places  in the civil and satirical parley which followed no one answered another but young mavering bore as full a part as the elder ladies and only his father and alice were silent his guests got themselves out of his room they met at the threshold a young fellow short and dark and stout in an old tennis suit he fell back at sight of them and took off his hat to mrs saintsbury  why mr boardman  dont be bashful boardman young mavering called out come in and show them how i shall look in five minutes  mr boardman took his introductions with a sort of mainforce selfpossession and then said youll have to look it in less than five minutes now mavering youre come for  what are they ready  we must fly panted mrs saintsbury without waiting for the answer which was lost in the incoherencies of all sorts of au revoirs called after and called back     vii  that is one thing said mrs saintsbury looking swiftly round to see that the elder mavering was not within hearing as she hurried ahead with mrs pasmer that i cant stand in dan mavering why couldnt he have warned us that it was getting near the time why should he have gone on pretending that there was no hurry it isnt insincerity exactly but it isnt candour no its uncandid oh i suppose its the artistic temperamentnever coming straight to the point  what do you mean asked mrs pasmer eagerly  ill tell you sometime she looked round and halted a little for alice who was walking detached and neglected by the preoccupation of the two elderly men im afraid youre tired she said to the girl  oh no  of course not on class day but i hope we shall get seats what weather  the sun had not been oppressive at any time during the day though the crowded building had been close and warm and now it lay like a painted light on the grass and paths over which they passed to the entrance of the grounds around the tree holden chapel which enclosed the space on the right as they went in shed back the sun from its brickred flank rising unrelieved in its venerable ugliness by any touch of the festive preparations but to their left and diagonally across from them high stagings supported tiers of seats along the equally unlovely red bulks of hollis and of harvard these seats and the windows in the stories above them were densely packed with people mostly young girls dressed in a thousand enchanting shades and colours and bonneted and hatted to the last effect of fashion they were like vast terraces of flowers to the swift glance and here and there some brilliant parasol spread to catch the sun on the higher ranks was like a flaunting poppy rising to the light and lolling out above the blooms of lower stature but the parasols were few for the two halls flung wide curtains of shade over the greater part of the spectators and across to the foot of the chapel while a piece of the carpentry whose simplicity seems part of the class day tradition shut out the glare and the uninvited public striving to penetrate the enclosure next the street in front of this yellow pine wall with its ranks of benches stood the class day tree girded at ten or fifteen feet from the ground with a wide band of flowers  mrs pasmer and her friends found themselves so late that if some gentlemen who knew professor saintsbury had not given up their places they could have got no seats but this happened and the three ladies had harmoniously blended their hues with those of the others in that bank of bloom and the gentlemen had somehow made away with their obstructiveness in different crouching and stooping postures at their feet when the junior class filed into the green enclosure amidst the rahs of their friends and sank in long ranks on the grass beside the chapel then the sophomores appeared and were received with cheers by the juniors with whom they joined as soon as they were placed in heaping ignominy upon the freshmen the seniors came last grotesque in the variety of their old clothes and a fierce uproar of rahs and yells met them from the students squatted upon the grass as they loosely grouped themselves in front of the tree the men of the younger classes formed in three rings and began circling in different directions around them  mrs pasmer bent across mrs saintsbury to her daughter can you make out mr mavering among them alice  no hush mamma pleaded the girl  with the subsidence of the tumult in the other classes the seniors had broken from the stoical silence they kept through it and were now with an equally serious clamour applauding the first of a long list of personages beginning with the president and ranging through their favourites in the faculty down to billy the postman the leader who invited them to this expression of good feeling exacted the full tale of nine cheers for each person he named and before he reached the last the rahs came in gasps from their dry throats  in the midst of the tumult the marshal flung his hat at the elm then the rush upon the tree took place and the scramble for the flowers the first who swarmed up the trunk were promptly plucked down by the legs and flung upon the ground as if to form a base there for the operations of the rest who surged and built themselves up around the elm in an irregular mass from time to time some one appeared clambering over heads and shoulders to make a desperate lunge and snatch at the flowers and then fall back into the fluctuant heap again yells cries and clappings of hands came from the other students and the spectators in the seats involuntarily dying away almost to silence as some stronger or wilfuler aspirant held his own on the heads and shoulders of the others or was stayed there by his friends among them till he could make sure of a handful of the flowers a rush was made upon him when he reached the ground if he could keep his flowers from the hands that snatched at them he staggered away with the fragments the wreath began to show wide patches of the bark under it the surging and struggling crowd below grew less dense here and there one struggled out of it and walked slowly about panting pitiably  oh i wonder they dont kill each other cried mrs pasmer isnt it terrible she would not have missed it on any account but she liked to get all she could out of her emotions  they never get hurt said mrs saintsbury oh look theres dan mavering  the crowd at the foot of the tree had closed densely and a wilder roar went up from all the students a tall slim young fellow lifted on the shoulders of the mass below and staying himself with one hand against the tree rapidly stripped away the remnants of the wreath and flung them into the crowd under him a single tuft remained the crowd was melting away under him in a scramble for the fallen flowers he made a crooked leap caught the tuft and tumbled with it headlong  oh breathed the ladies on the benches with a general suspiration lost in the rahs and clappings as mavering reappeared with the bunch of flowers in his hand he looked dizzily about as if not sure of his course then his face flushed and heated with the hair pulled over the eyes brightened with recognition and he advanced upon mrs saintsburys party with rapid paces each of which mrs pasmer commentated with inward conjecture  is he bringing the flowers to alice isnt it altogether too conspicuous has he really the right to do it what will people think will he give them to me for her or will he hand them directly to her which should i prefer him to do i wonder if i know  when she looked up with the air of surprise mixed with deprecation and ironical disclaimer which she had prepared while these things were passing through her mind young mavering had reached them and had paused in a moments hesitation before his father with a bow of affectionate burlesque from which he lifted his face to break into laughter at the look in all their eyes he handed the tattered nosegay to his father  oh how delightful how delicate how perfect mrs pasmer confided to herself  i think this must be for you mrs pasmer said the elder mavering offering her the bouquet with a grave smile at his sons whim  oh no indeed said mrs pasmer for mrs saintsbury of course  she gave it to her and mrs saintsbury at once transferred it to miss pasmer  they wished me to pass this to you alice and at this consummation dan mavering broke into another happy laugh  mrs saintsbury you always do the right thing at once he cried  thats more than i can say of you mr mavering she retorted  oh thank you mr mavering said the girl receiving the flowers it was as if she had been too intent upon them and him to have noticed the little comedy that had conveyed them to her     viii  as soon after class day as mrs pasmers complaisant sense of the decencies would let her she went out from boston to call on mrs saintsbury in cambridge and thank her for her kindness to alice and herself she will know well enough what i come for she said to herself and she felt it the more important to ignore mrs saintsburys penetration by every polite futility this was due to them both and she did not go till the second day after  mrs saintsbury came down into the darkened syringascented library to find her and give her a fan  you still live jenny she said kissing her gaily  they called each other by their girl names as is rather the custom in boston with ladies who are in the same set whether they are great friends or not in the more changeful society of cambridge where so many new people are constantly coming and going in connection with the college it is not so much the custom but mrs saintsbury was boston born as well as mrs pasmer and was cantabrigian by marriagethough this is not saying that she was not also thoroughly so by convincement and usage she now rarely went into boston society  yes ettajust but i wasnt sure of it said mrs pasmer when i woke yesterday i was a mere aching jelly  and alice  oh i dont think she had any physical consciousness she was a mere rapturous memory  she did have a good time didnt she said mrs saintsbury in a generous retrospect i think she was on her feet every moment in the evening it kept me from getting tired to watch her  i was afraid youd be quite worn out id no idea it was so late it must have been nearly half past seven before we got away from the beck hall spread and then by the time we had walked round the college groundshow extremely pretty the lanterns were and how charming the whole effect wasit must have been nine before the dancing began well we owe it all to you etta  i dont know what you mean by owing im always glad of an excuse for class day and it was dan mavering who really managed the affair  he was very kind said mrs pasmer with a feeling which was chiefly gratitude to her friend for bringing in his name so soon now that it had been spoken she felt it decorous to throw aside the outer integument of pretense which if it could have been entirely exfoliated would have caused mrs pasmer morally to disappear like an onion stripped of its successive laminae  what did you mean she asked leaning forward with her face averted about his having the artistic temperament is he going to be an artist i should hope not she remembered without shame that she had strongly urged him to consider how much better it would be to be a painter than a lawyer in the dearth of great american painters  he could be a painter if he likedup to a certain point said mrs saintsbury or he could be any one of halfadozen other thingshis last craze was journalism but you know what i mean by the artistic temperament its that inability to be explicit that habit of leaving things vague and undefined and hoping theyll somehow come out as you want them of themselves that way of taking the line of beauty to get at what you wish to do or say and of being very finicking about little things and lag about essentials thats what i mean by the artistic temperament  yes thats terrible sighed mrs pasmer with the abstractly severe yet personally pitying perception of one whose every word and act was sincere and direct i know just what you mean but how does it apply to mr mavering  it doesnt exactly returned her friend and im always ashamed when i say or even think anything against dan mavering hes sweetness itself weve known him ever since he came to harvard and i must say that a more constant and lovely follow i never saw it wasnt merely when he was a freshman and he had that home feeling hanging about him still that makes all the freshmen so appreciative of anything you do for them but all through the sophomore and junior years when theyre so taken up with their athletics and their societies and their college life generally that they havent a moment for people that have been kind to them he was just as faithful as ever  how nice cried mrs pasmer  yes indeed and all the allurements of boston society havent taken him from us altogether you cant imagine how much this means till youve been at home a while and seen how the students are petted and spoiled nowadays in the young society  oh ive heard of it said mrs pasmer and is it his versatility and brilliancy or his amiability that makes him such a universal favourite  universal favourite i dont know that hes that  well popular then  oh hes certainly very much liked but jenny there are no universal favourites in harvard now if there ever were the classes are altogether too big and it wouldnt be ability and it wouldnt be amiability alone that would give a man any sort of leadership  what in the world would it be  that question more than anything else shows how long youve been away jenny it would be familyfamily with a judicious mixture of the others and with money  is it possible but of coursei remember only at their age one thinks of students as being all hailfellowwellmet with each other  yes its hard to realise how conventional they arehow very much worldlier than the worldtill one sees it as one does in cambridge they pique themselves on it and mr saintsburyshe was one of those women whom everything reminds of their husbands says that it isnt a bad thing altogether he says that harvard is just like the world and even if its a little more so these boys have got to live in the world and they had better know what it is you may not approve of the harvard spirit and mr saintsbury doesnt sympathise with it he only says its the worlds spirit harvard menthe swellsare far more exclusive than oxford men a student comme il faut wouldnt at all like to be supposed to know another student whom we valued for his brilliancy unless he was popular and well known in college  dear me cried mrs pasmer but of course its perfectly natural with young people and its well enough that they should begin to understand how things really are in the world early it will save them from a great many disappointments  i assure you we have very little to teach harvard men in those matters they could give any of us points those who are of good family and station know how to protect themselves by reserves that the others wouldnt dare to transgress but a merely rich man couldnt rise in their set any more than a merely gifted man he could get on to a certain point by toadying and some do but he would never get to be popular like dan mavering  and what makes him popularto go back to the point we started from said mrs pasmer  ah thats hard to say itsquality i suppose i dont mean social quality exactly but personal charm he never had a mean thought of course were all full of mean thoughts and dan is too but his first impulse is always generous and sweet and at his age people act a great deal from impulse i dont suppose he ever met a human being without wanting to make him like him and trying to do it  yes he certainly makes you like him sighed mrs pasmer but i understand that he cant make people like him without family or money and i dont understand that hes one of those nouveaux riches who are giving harvard such a reputation for extravagance nowadays  there was an inquiring note in mrs pasmers voice and in the syringascented obscurity which protected the ladies from the expression of each others faces mrs saintsbury gave a little laugh of intelligence to which mrs pasmer responded by a murmur of humorous enjoyment at being understood  oh no he isnt one of those but the maverings have plenty of money said mrs saintsbury and dans been very free with it though not lavish and he came here with a reputation for popularity from a very good school and that always goes a very great way in college  yes said mrs pasmer feeling herself getting hopelessly adrift in these unknown waters but reposing a pious confidence in her pilot  yes if a sufficient number of his class said he was the best fellow in the world he would be pretty sure to be chosen one of the first ten in the dickey  what mysteries gasped mrs pasmer disposed to make fun of them but a little overawed all the same what in the world is the dickey  its the society that the freshmen are the most eager to get into theyre chosen ten at a time by the old members and to be one of the first tenthe only freshmen chosenis something quite ineffable  i see mrs pasmer fanned herself after taking a long breath and when he had got into the  then it would depend upon himself how he spent his money and all that and what sort of society success he was in boston that has a great deal to do with it from the first then another thing is cautiondiscreetness not saying anything censorious or critical of other men no matter what they do and dan mavering is the perfection of prudence because hes the perfection of goodnature  mrs pasmer had apparently got all of these facts that she could digest and who are the maverings  why its an old boston name  its too old isnt it like pasmer there are no maverings in boston that i ever heard of  no the names quite died out just here i believe but its old and it bids fair to be replated at ponkwasset falls  at ponk  thats where they have their mills or factories or shops or whatever institution they make wallpaper in  wallpaper cried mrs pasmer austerely after a moment she asked and is wallpaper the thing now i mean she tried to think of some way of modifying the commonness of her phrase but did not after all it expressed her meaning  it isnt the extreme of fashion of course but its manufacturing and it isnt disgraceful and the mavering papers are very pretty and you can live with them without becoming anaemic or having your face twitch  face twitch echoed mrs pasmer  yes arsenical poisoning  oh conscientious as well as aesthetic i see and does mr mavering put his artistic temperament into them  his father does hes a very interesting man he has the best taste in certain thingshe knows more about etchings i suppose than any one else in boston  is it possible and does he live at ponkwasset falls its in rhode island isnt it  new hampshire yes the whole family live there  the whole family are there many of them id fancied somehow that mr mavering was the onlydo tell me about them etta said mrs pasmer leaning back in her chair and fanning herself with an effect of impartial interest to which the dim light of the room lent itself  hes the only son but there are daughters of coursevery cultivated girls  and is heis the elder mr mavering ai dont know what made me think soa widower  well nonot exactly  not exactly hes not a grasswidower i hope  no indeed but his wifes a helpless invalid and always has been hes perfectly devoted to her and he hurried home yesterday though he wanted very much to stay for commencement hes never away from her longer than he can help shes bedridden and you can see from the moment you enter it that its a mans house daughters cant change that you know  have you been there asked mrs pasmer surprised that she was getting so much information but eager for more why how long have you known them etta  only since dan came to harvard mr saintsbury took a fancy to him from the start and the boy was so fond of him that they were always insisting upon a visit and last summer we stopped there on our way to the mountains  and the sistersdo they stay there the whole year round are they countrified  one doesnt live in the country without being countrified said mrs saintsbury theyre rather quiet girls though theyve been about a good dealto europe with friends and to new york in the winter theyre older than dan theyre more like their father are you afraid of that draught at the windows  oh no its delicious and hes like the mother  yes  then its the father who has the artistic tastehe gets that from him and the mother who has the  temperamentyes  how extremely interesting and so hes going to be a lawyer why lawyer if hes got the talent and the temperament of an artist does his father wish him to be a lawyer  his father wishes him to be a wallpaper maker  and the young man compromises on the law i see said mrs pasmer and you say hes been going into boston a great deal where does he go  the ladies entered into this social inquiry with a zest which it would be hard to make the reader share or perhaps to feel the importance of it is enough that it ended in the social vindication of dan mavering it would not have been enough for mrs pasmer that he was accepted in the best cambridge houses she knew of old how people were accepted in cambridge for their intellectual brilliancy or solidity their personal worth and all sorts of things without consideration of the mystical something which gives vogue in boston  how superb alice was mrs saintsbury broke off abruptly she has such a beautiful manner such repose  repose yes said her mother thoughtfully but shes very intense and i dont see where she gets it her father has repose enough but he has no intensity and im all intensity and no repose but im no more like my mother than alice is like me  i think she has the hibbins face said mrs saintsbury  oh shes got the hibbins face said mrs pasmer with a disdain of tone which she did not at all feel the tone was mere absentmindedness  she was about to revert to the question of maverings family when the doorbell rang and another visitor interrupted her talk with mrs saintsbury     ix  mrs pasmers husband looked a great deal older than herself and by operation of a wellknown law of compensation he was lean and silent while she was plump and voluble he had thick eyebrows which remained black after his hair and beard had become white and which gave him an aspect of fierceness expressive of nothing in his character it was from him that their daughter got her height and as mrs pasmer freely owned her distinction  soon after their marriage the pasmers had gone to live in paris where they remained faithful to the fortunes of the second empire till its fall with intervals of return to their own country of a year or two years at a time after the fall of the empire they made their sojourn in england where they lived upon the edges and surfaces of things as americans must in europe everywhere but had more permanency of feeling than they had known in france and something like a real social status at one time it seemed as if they might end their days there but that which makes americans different from all other peoples and which finally claims their allegiance for their own land made them wish to come back to america and to come back to boston after all their place in england was strictly inferior and must be they knew titles and consorted with them but they had none themselves and the english constancy which kept their friends faithful to them after they had become an old story was correlated with the english honesty which never permitted them to mistake themselves for even the lowest of the nobility they went out last and they did not come in first ever  the invitations upon these conditions might have gone on indefinitely but they did not imply a future for the young girl in whom the interests of her parents centred after being so long a little girl she had become a great girl and then all at once she had become a young lady they had to ask themselves the mother definitely and the father formlessly whether they wished their daughter to marry an englishman and their hearts answered them like true republican hearts not an untitled englishman while they saw no prospect of her getting any other mrs pasmer philosophised the case with a clearness and a courage which gave her husband a series of twinges analogous to the toothache for a man naturally shrinks from such bold realisations she said alice had the beauty of a beauty and she had the distinction of a beauty but she had not the principles of a beauty there was no use pretending that she had for this reason the prince of waless set so accessible to american loveliness with the courage of its convictions was beyond her and the question was whether there was money enough for a younger son or whether if there was a younger son was worth it  however this might be there was no question but there was now less money than there had been and a great deal less the investments had not turned out as they promised not only had dividends been passed but there had been permanent shrinkages what was once an amiable competency from the pooling of their joint resources had dwindled to a sum that needed a careful eye both to the income and the outgo alices becoming a young lady had increased their expenses by the suddenly mounting cost of her dresses and of the dresses which her mother must now buy for the different role she had to sustain in society they began to ask themselves what it was for and to question whether if she could not marry a noble englishman alice had not better marry a good american  even with mrs pasmer this question was tacit and it need not be explained to any one who knows our life that in her most worldly dreams she intended at the bottom of her heart that her daughter should marry for love it is the rule that americans marry for love and the very rare exception that they marry for anything else and if our divorce courts are so busy in spite of this fact it is perhaps because the americans also unmarry for love or perhaps because love is not so sufficient in matters of the heart as has been represented in the literature of people who have not been able to give it so fair a trial but whether it is all in all in marriage or only a very marked essential it is certain that mrs pasmer expected her daughters marriage to involve it she would have shrunk from intimating anything else to her as from a gross indecency and she could not possibly by any finest insinuation have made her a partner in her design for her happiness that so far as alice was concerned was a thing which was to fall to her as from heaven for this also is part of the american plan we are the children of the poets the devotees of the romancers so far as that goes and however material and practical we are in other things in this we are a republic of shepherds and shepherdesses and we live in a golden age which if it sometimes seems an age of inconvertible paper is certainly so through no want of faith in us  though the pasmers said that they ought to go home for alices sake they both understood that they were going home experimentally and not with the intention of laying their bones in their native soil unless they liked it or found they could afford it mrs pasmer had no illusions in regard to it she had learned from her former visits home that it was frightfully expensive and during the fifteen years which they had spent chiefly abroad she had observed the decay of that distinction which formerly attended returning sojourners from europe she had seen them cease gradually from the romantic reverence which once clothed them and decline through a gathering indifference into something like slight and compassion as people who have not been able to make their place or hold their own at home and she had taught herself so well how to pocket the superiority natural to the europeanised american before arriving at consciousness of this disesteem that she paid a ready tribute to people who had always stayed at home  in fact mrs pasmer was a flatterer and it cannot be claimed for her that she flattered adroitly always but adroitness in flattery is not necessary for its successful use there is no morsel of it too gross for the condor gullet and the ostrich stomach of human vanity there is no society in which it does not give the utterer instant honour and acceptance in greater or less degree mrs pasmer who was very goodnatured employed it because she liked it herself and knowing how absolutely worthless it was from her own tongue prized it from others she could have rested perfectly safe without it in her social position which she found unchanged by years of absence she had not been a hibbins for nothing and she was not a pasmer for nothing though why she should have been either for something it would not be easy to say  but while confessing the foibles of mrs pasmer it would not be fair to omit from the tale of her many virtues the final conscientiousness of her openly involuted character not to mention other things she instituted and practised economies as alien to her nature as to her husbands and in their narrowing affairs she kept him out of debt she was prudent she was alert and while presenting to the world all the outward effect of a butterfly she possessed some of the best qualities of the bee  with his senatorial presence his distinction of person and manner mr pasmer was inveterately selfish in that province of small personal things where his wife left him unmolested in what related to his own comfort and convenience he was undisputed lord of himself it was she who ordered their comings and goings and decided in which hemisphere they should sojourn from time to time and in what city street and house but always with the understanding that the kitchen and all the domestic appointments were to her husbands mind he was sensitive to degrees of heat and cold and luxurious in the matter of lighting and he had a fine nose for plumbing if he had not occupied himself so much with these details he was the sort of man to have thought mrs pasmer with her buzz of activities and pretences rather a tedious little woman he had some delicate tastes if not refined interests and was expensively fond of certain sorts of bricabrac he spent a great deal of time in packing and unpacking it and he had cases stored in rome and london and paris it had been one of his motives in consenting to come home that he might get them out and set up the various objects of bronze and porcelain in cabinets he had no vices unless absolute idleness ensuing uninterruptedly upon a remotely demonstrated unfitness for business can be called a vice like other people who have always been idle he did not consider his idleness a vice he rather plumed himself upon it for the man who has done nothing all his life naturally looks down upon people who have done or are doing something in europe he had not all the advantage of this superiority which such a man has here he was often thrown with other idle people who had been useless for so many generations that they had almost ceased to have any consciousness of it in their presence pasmer felt that his uselessness had not that passive elegance which only ancestral uselessness can give that it was positive and to that degree vulgar  a life like this was not one which would probably involve great passions or affections and it would be hard to describe exactly the feeling with which he regarded his daughter he liked her of course and he had naturally expected certain things of her as a ladylike intelligence behaviour and appearance but he had never shown any great tenderness for her or even pride in her she had never given him any displeasure however and he had not shared his wifes question of mind at a temporary phase of alices development when she showed a decided inclination for a religious life he had apparently not observed that the girl had a pensive temperament in spite of the effect of worldly splendour which her mother contrived for her and that this pensiveness occasionally deepened to gloom he had certainly never seen that in a way of her own she was very romantic mrs pasmer had seen it with amusement sometimes and sometimes with anxiety but always with the courage to believe that she could cope with it when it was necessary  whenever it was necessary she had all the moral courage she wanted it seemed as if she could have it or not as she liked and in coming home she had taken a flat instead of a house though she had not talked with her friends three minutes without perceiving that the moment when flats had promised to assert their social equality with houses in boston was past for ever there were of course cases in which there could be no question of them but for the most part they were plainly regarded as makeshifts the resorts of people of small means or the defiances or errors of people who had lived too much abroad they stamped their occupants as of transitory and fluctuant character good people might live in them and did as good people sometimes boarded but they could not be regarded as forming a social base except in rare instances they presented peculiar difficulties in calling and for any sort of entertainment they were toonot public perhaps butevident  in spite of these objections mrs pasmer took a flat in the cavendish and she took it furnished from people who were going abroad for a year     x  mrs pasmer stood at the drawingroom window of this apartment the morning after her call upon mrs saintsbury looking out on the passage of an expresswagon load of trunks through cavendish square and commenting the fact with the tacit reflection that it was quite time she should be getting away from boston too when her daughter who was looking out of the other window started significantly back  what is it alice  nothing mr mavering i think and that friend of his  which friend but where dont look they will think we were watching them i cant see them at all which way were they going mrs pasmer dramatised a careless unconsciousness to the square while vividly betraying this anxiety to her daughter  alice walked away to the furthest part of the room they are coming this way she said indifferently  before mrs pasmer had time to prepare a conditional mood adapted either to their coming that way or going some other she heard the janitor below in colloquy with her maid in the kitchen and then the maid came in to ask if she should say the ladies were at home oh certainly said mrs pasmer with a caressing politeness that anticipated the tone she meant to use with mavering and his friend were you going alice better stay it would be awkward sending out for you you look well enough  well  the young men came in mavering with his nervous laugh first and then boardman with his twinkling black eyes and his mainforce selfpossession  we couldnt go away as far as new london without coming to see whether you had really survived class day said the former addressing his solicitude to mrs pasmer i tried to find out from mrs saintsbury but she was very noncommittal he laughed again and shook hands with alice whom he now included in his inquiry  im glad she was said mrs pasmerinwardly wondering what he meant by going to new londonif it sent you to ask in person she made them sit down and she made as little as possible of the young ceremony they threw into the transaction to be cosy to be at ease instantly was mrs pasmers way weve not only survived weve taken a new lease of life from class day id for gotten how charming it always was or perhaps it didnt use to be so charming i dont believe they have anything like it in europe is it always so brilliant  i dont know said mavering i really believe it was rather a nice one  oh we were both enraptured cried mrs pasmer  alice added a quiet yes indeed and her mother went on  and we thought the beck hall spread was the crowning glory of the whole affair we owe ever so much to your kindness  oh not at all said mavering  but we were talking afterward alice and i about the sudden transformation of all that disheveled crew around the tree into the imposing swellsmay i say howling swells  yes do say howling mrs pasmer implored the young man  whom we met afterward at the spread she concluded how did you manage it all mr irving in the lyons mail was nothing to it we thought we had walked directly over from the tree and there you were all ready to receive us in immaculate evening dress  it was pretty quick work modestly admitted the young man could you recognise any one in that hurlyburly round the tree  we didnt till you rose like a statue of victory and began grabbing for the spoils from the heads and shoulders of your friends who was your pedestal  mavering put his hand on his friends broad shoulder and gave him a playful push  boardman turned up his little black eyes at him with a funny gleam in them  poor mr boardman said mrs pasmer  it didnt hurt him a bit said mavering pushing him he liked it  of course he did said mrs pasmer implying in flattery of mavering that boardman might be glad of the distinction and now boardman looked as if he were not she began to get away in adding but i wonder you dont kill each other  oh were not so easily killed said mavering  and what a fairy scene it was at the spread said mrs pasmer turning to boardman she had already talked its splendours over with mavering the same evening i thought we should never get out of the hall but when we did get out of the window upon that tapestried platform and down on the tennisground with turkey rugs to hide the bare spots in it she stopped as people do when it is better to leave the effect to the listeners imagination  yes i think it was rather nice said boardman  nice repeated mrs pasmer and she looked at mavering is that the famous harvard indifferentism  no no mrs pasmer its just his personal envy he wasnt in the spread and of course he doesnt like to hear any one praise it go on they all laughed  well even mr boardman will admit said mrs pasmer that nothing could have been prettier than that pavilion at the bottom of the lawn and the little tables scattered about over it and all those charming young creatures under that lovely evening sky  ah even boardman cant deny that we did have the nicest crowd didnt we  well said mrs pasmer playfully checking herself in a ready adhesion that depends a good deal upon where mr boardmans spread was  thank you said boardman  he wasnt spreading anywhere cried his friend except himselfhe was spreading himself everywhere  then i think i should prefer to remain neutral said mrs pasmer with a mock prudence which pleased the young men in the midst of the pleasure the was giving and feeling she was all the time aware that her daughter had contributed but one remark to the conversation and that she must be seeming very stiff and cold she wondered what that meant and whether she disliked this little mr boardman or whether she was again trying to punish mr mavering for something and if so what it was had he offended her in some way the other day at any rate she had no right to show it she longed for some chance to scold the girl and tell her that it would not do and make her talk mr mavering was merely a friendly acquaintance and there could be no question of anything personal she forgot that between young people the social affair is always trembling to the personal affair  in the little pause which these reflections gave her mother the girl struck in with the coolness that always astonished mrs pasmer and as if she had been merely waiting till some phase of the talk interested her  are many of the students going to the race she asked boardman  yes nearly everybody that is  the race queried mrs pasmer  yes at new london mavering broke in dont you know the university raceharvard and yale  ohoh yes cried mrs pasmer wondering how her daughter should know about the race and she not had they talked it over together on class day she asked herself she felt herself in spite of her efforts to keep even with them left behind and left out as later age must be distanced and excluded by youth are you gentlemen going to row she asked mavering  no theyve ruled the tubs out this time and we should send anything else to the bottom  mrs pasmer perceived that he was joking but also that they were not of the crew and she said that if that was the case the should not go  oh dont let that keep you away arent you going i hoped you were going continued the young man speaking with his eyes on mrs pasmer but with his mind as she could see by his eyes on her daughter  no no  oh do go mrs pasmer he urged i wish youd go along to chaperon us  mrs pasmer accepted the notion with amusement i should think you might look after each other at any rate i think i must trust you to mr boardman this time  yes but hes going on business persisted mavering as if for the pleasure he found in fencing with the air and he cant look after me  on business said mrs pasmer dropping her outspread fan on her lap incredulously  yes hes going into journalismhes gone into it laughed mavering and hes going down to report the race for the events  really asked mrs pasmer with a glance at boardman whose droll embarrassment did not contradict his friends words how splendid she cried i had heard that a great many harvard men were taking up journalism im so glad of it it will do everything to elevate its tone  boardman seemed to suffer under these expectations a little and he stole a glance of comical menace at his friend  yes said mavering youll see a very different tone about the fires and the fights and the distressing accidents in the events after this  what does he mean she asked boardman giving him unavoidably the advantage of the caressing manner which was in her mind for mavering  well you see said boardman we have to begin pretty low down  oh but all departments of our press need reforming dont they she inquired consolingly one hears such shocking things about our papers abroad im sure that the more harvard men go into them the better and how splendid it is to have them going into politics the way they are theyre going into politics too arent they she looked from one young man to the other with an idea that she was perhaps shooting rather wild and an amiable willingness to be laughed at if she were why dont you go into politics mr mavering  well the fact is  so many of the young university men do in england said mrs pasmer fortifying her position  well you see they havent got such a complete machine in england  oh yes that dreadful machine sighed mrs pasmer who had heard of it but did not know in the least what it was  do you think the harvard crew will beat this time alice asked of boardman  well to tell you the truth  oh but you must never believe him when he begins that way cried mavering to be sure they will beat and you ought to be there to see it now why wont you come mrs pasmer he pleaded turning to her mother  oh im afraid we must be getting away from boston by that time its very tiresome but there seems to be nobody left and one cant stay quite alone even if youre sick of moving about have you ever beenwe think of going thereto campobello  no but i hear that its charming there i had a friend who was there last year and he said it was charming the only trouble is its so far youre pretty well on the way to europe when you get there you know its all hotel life  yes its quite a new place isnt it  well its been opened up several years and they say it isnt like the hotel life anywhere else its charming and theres the very nicest class of people  very nice philadelphia people i hear said mrs pasmer and baltimore dont you think its well she asked deferentially and under correction if she were hazarding too much to see somebody besides boston people sometimesif theyre nice that seems to be one of the great advantages of living abroad  oh i think there are nice people everywhere said the young man with the bold expansion of youth  yes sighed mrs pasmer we saw two such delightful young people coming in and out of the hotel in rome we were sure they were english and they were from chicago but there are not many western people at campobello are there  i really dont know said mavering how is it boardman do many of your people go there  you know you do make it so frightfully expensive with your money said mrs pasmer explaining with a prompt effect of having known all along that boardman was from the west you drive us poor people all away  i dont think my money would do it said boardman quietly  oh you wait till youre a syndicate correspondent said mavering putting his hand on his friends shoulder and rising by aid of it he left mrs pasmer to fill the chasm that had so suddenly yawned between her and boardman and while she tumbled into every sort of flowery friendliness and compliment telling him she should look out for his account of the race with the greatest interest and expressing the hope that he would get as far as campobello during the summer mavering found some minutes for talk with alice he was graver with herfar graver than with her mothernot only because she was a more serious nature but because they were both young and youth is not free with youth except by slow and cautious degrees in that little space of time they talked of pictures a propos of some on the wall and of books because of those on the table  oh yes said mrs pasmer when they paused and she felt that her piece of difficult engineering had been quite successful mrs saintsbury was telling me what a wonderful connoisseur of etchings your father is  i believe he does know something about them said the young man modestly  and hes gone back already  oh yes he never stays long away from my mother i shall be going home myself as soon as i get back from the race  and shall you spend the summer there  part of it i always like to do that  perhaps when you get away youll come as far as campobellowith mr boardman she added  has boardman promised to go laughed mavering he will promise anything well ill come to campobello if youll come to new london do come mrs pasmer  the mother stood watching the two young men from the window as they made their way across the square together she had now for some reason no apparent scruple in being seen to do so  how ridiculous that stout little mr boardman is with him said mrs pasmer he hardly comes up to his shoulder why in the world should he have brought him  i thought he was very pleasant said the girl  yes yes of course and i suppose hed have felt that it was rather pointed coming alone  pointed  young men are so queer did you like that kind of collar he had on  i didnt notice it  so very very high  i suppose he has rather a long neck  well what did you think of his urging us to go to the race do you think he meant it do you think he intended it for an invitation  i dont think he meant anything or if he did i think he didnt know what  yes said mrs pasmer vaguely that must be what mrs saintsbury meant by the artistic temperament  i like people to be sincere and not to say things they dont mean or dont know whether they mean or not said alice  yes of course thats the best way admitted mrs pasmer its the only way she added as if it were her own invariable practice then she added further i wonder what he did mean  she began to yawn for after her simulation of vivid interest in them the visit of the young men had fatigued her in the midst of her yawn her daughter went out of the room with an impatient gesture and she suspended the yawn long enough to smile and then finished it     xi  after first going to the owen at campobello the pasmers took rooms at the tynycoed which is so much gayer even if it is not so characteristic of the old welsh admirals baronial possession of the island it is characteristic enough and perched on its bluff overlooking the bay or whatever the body of water is it sees a score of pretty isles and long reaches of mainland coast with a white marble effect of whitepainted wooden eastport nestled in the wide lap of the shore in apparent luxury and apparent innocence of smuggling and the manufacture of herring sardines the waters that wrap the island in morning and evening fog temper the air of the latitude to a newport softness in summer with a sort of inner coolness that is peculiarly delicious lulling the day with long calms and light breezes and after nightfall commonly sending a stiff gale to try the stops of the hotels gables and casements and to make the cheerful blaze on its public hearths acceptable once or twice a day the eastport ferryboat arrives with passengers from the southward at a floating wharf that sinks or swims half a hundred feet on the mighty tides of the northeast but all night long the island is shut up to its own memories and devices the pretty romance of the old sailor who left england to become a sort of feudal seigneur here with a holding of the entire island and its fisherfolk for his villeins forms a picturesque background for the aesthetic leisure and society in the three hotels remembering him and his language in their names and housing with a few cottages all the sojourners on the island by day the broad hotel piazzas shelter such of the guests as prefer to let others make their excursions into the heart of the island and around its rocky seabeaten borders and at night when the falling mists have brought the early dark and from lighthouse to lighthouse the foghorns moan and low to one another the piazzas cede to the corridors and the parlours and smokingrooms the life does not greatly differ from other seaside hotel life on the surface and if one were to make distinctions one would perhaps begin by saying that hotel society there has much of the tone of cottage society elsewhere with a little more accessibility as the reader doubtless knows the great mass of boston society thoughtful of its own weight and bulk transports itself down the north shore scarcely further than manchester at the furthest but there are more courageous or more detachable spirits who venture into more distant regions these contribute somewhat toward peopling bar harbour in the summer but they scarcely characterise it in any degree while at campobello they settle in little daring colonies whose selfreliance will enlist the admiration of the sympathetic observer they do not refuse the knowledge of other colonies of other stirps and origins and they even combine in temporary alliance with them but after all boston speaks one language and new york another and washington a third and though the several dialects have only slight differences of inflection their moral accents render each a little difficult for the others in fact every society is repellant of strangers in the degree that it is sufficient to itself and is incurious concerning the rest of the world if it has not the elements of selfsatisfaction in it if it is uninformed and new and restless it is more hospitable than an older society which has a sense of merit founded upon historical documents and need no longer go out of itself for comparisons of any sort knowing that if it seeks anything better it will probably be disappointed the natural man the savage is as indifferent to others as the exclusive and those who accuse the coldness of the bostonians and their reluctant or repellant behaviour toward unknown people accuse not only civilisation but nature itself  that love of independence which is notable in us even in our most acquiescent phases at home is perhaps what brings these cultivated and agreeable people so far away where they can achieve a sort of sylvan urbanity without responsibility and without that measuring of purses which attends the summer display elsewhere at campobello one might be poor with almost as little shame as in cambridge if one were cultivated mrs pasmer who seldom failed of doing just the right thing for herself had promptly divined the advantages of campobello for her family she knew by dint of a little inquiry and from the volunteer information of enthusiasts who had been there the summer before just who was likely to be there during the summer with which she now found herself confronted campobello being yet a new thing it was not open to the objection that you were sure to meet such and such people more or less common or disagreeable there whatever happened it could be lightly handled in the retrospect as the adventure of a partial and fragmentary summer when really she hardly cared where they went  they did not get away from boston before the middle of july and after the solitude they left behind them there the owen at first seemed very gay but when they had once or twice compared it with the tynycoed riding to and fro in the barge which formed the connecting link with the saturday evening hops of the latter hotel mrs pasmer decided that from alices point of view they had made a mistake and she repaired it without delay the young people were in fact all at the tynycoed and though she found the owen perfectly satisfying for herself and mr pasmer she was willing to make the sacrifice of going to a new place it was not a great sacrifice for one who had dwelt so long in tents  there were scarcely any young girls at the owen and no young men of course even at the tynycoed where young girls abounded it would not be right to pretend that there were young men enough nowhere perhaps except at bar harbour is the longlost balance of the sexes trimmed in new england and even there the observer abstractly delighting in the young girls and their dresses at that grand loveexchange of rodicks must question whether the adjustment is perfectly accurate  at campobello there were not more than half enough young men and there was not enough flirtation to affect the prevailing social mood of the place an unfevered expectationless tranquillity in which today is like yesterday and tomorrow cannot be different it is a quiet of light reading and slowly brokenly murmured contented gossip for the ladies of old newspapers and old stories and luxuriously meditated cigars for the men with occasional combinations for a steamlaunch cruise among the eddies and islands of the nearer waters or a voyage further off in the bay of fundy to the grand menan and a return for the late dinner which marks the high civilisation of campobello and then an evening of more reading and gossip and cigars while the night wind whistles outside and the brawl and crash of the balls among the tenpins comes softened from the distant alleys there are pleasant walks which people seldom take in many directions and there are drives and bridlepaths all through the dense sad northern woods which still savagely clothe the greater part of the island to its further shores where there are shelves and plateaus of rock incomparable for picnicking  one need ask nothing better in fact than to stroll down the sylvan road that leads to the owen past the little fishingvillage with its sheds for curing herring and the pale blue smoke and appetising savour escaping from them and past the little chapel with which the old admiral attested his love of the established rite on this road you may sometimes meet a little english bishop from the provinces in his apron and kneebreeches and there is a certain bridge over a narrow estuary where in the shallow landlocked pools of the deeply ebbing tide you may throw stones at sculpin and witness the admirable indifference of those fish to human cruelty and folly in the middle distance you will see a group of herring weirs which with their coronals of tufted saplings form the very most picturesque aspect of any fishing industry you may now and then find an artist at this point who crouched over his easel or hers seems to agree with you about the village and the weirs  but alice pasmer cared little more for such things than her mother did and mrs pasmer regarded nature in all her aspects simply as an adjunct of society or an occasional feature of the entourage the girl had no such worldly feeling about it but she found slight sympathy in the moods of earth and sky with her peculiar temperament this temperament whose recondite origin had almost wholly broken up mrs pasmers faith in heredity was like other temperaments not always in evidence and alice was variously regarded as cold of shy or proud or insipid by the various other temperaments brought in contact with her own she was apt to be liked because she was as careful of others as she was of herself and she never was childishly greedy about such admiration as she won as girls often are perhaps because she did not care for it up to this time it is doubtful if her heart had been touched even by the fancies that shake the surface of the soul of youth and perhaps it was for this reason that her seriousness at first fretted mrs pasmer with a vague anxiety for her future  mrs pasmer herself remained inalienably unitarian but she was aware of the prodigiousgrowth which the church had been making in society and when alice showed her inclination for it she felt that it was not at all as if she had developed a taste for orthodoxy when finally it did not seem likely to go too far it amused mrs pasmer that her daughter should have taken so intensely to the anglican rite  in the hotel it attached to her by a common interest several of the ladies who had seen her earnestly responsive at the little owen chapelladies left to that affectional solitude which awaits long widowhood through the death or marriage of children and other ladies younger but yet beginning to grow old with touching courage alice was especially a favourite with the three or four who represented their class and condition at the tyny coed and who read the best books read there and had the gentlest manners there was a tacit agreement among these ladies who could not help seeing the difference in the temperaments of the mother and daughter that mrs pasmer did not understand alice but probably there were very few people except herself whom mrs pasmer did not understand quite well she understood these ladies and their compassion for alice and she did not in the least resent it she was willing that people should like alice for any reason they chose if they did not go too far with her little flutter of futile deceits her irreverence for every form of human worth and her trust in a providence which had seldom failed her she smiled at the cult of alices friends as she did at the girls seriousness which also she felt herself able to keep from going too far  while she did not object to the sympathy of these ladies whatever inspired it she encouraged another intimacy which grew up contemporaneously with theirs and which was frankly secular and practical though the girl who attached herself to alice with one of those instant passions of girlhood was also in every exterior observance a strict and diligent churchwoman the difference was through the difference of boston and new york in everything the difference between idealising and the realising tendency the elderly and middleaged boston women who liked alice had been touched by something high yet sad in the beauty of her face at church the new york girl promptly owned that she had liked her effect the first sunday she saw her there and she knew in a minute she never got those things on this side her obeisances and genuflections throughout the service much more profound and punctilious than those of any one else there had apparently not prevented her from making a thorough study of alices costume and a correct conjecture as to its authorship  miss anderson who claimed a collateral dutch ancestry by the van hook tucked in between her noncommittal family name and the julia given her in christening was of the ordinary slender make of american girlhood with dull blond hair and a dull blond complexion which would have left her face uninteresting if it had not been for the caprice of her nose in suddenly changing from the ordinary american regularity after getting over its bridge and turning out distinctly retrousse this gave her profile animation and character you could not expect a girl with that nose to be either irresolute or commonplace and for good or for ill miss anderson was decided and original she carried her figure which was no great things of a figure as to height with vigorous erectness she walked with long strides knocking her skirts into fine eddies and tangles as she went and she spoke in a bold deep voice with tones like a man in it all the more amusing and fascinating because of the perfectly feminine eyes with which she looked at you and the nervous feminine gestures which she used while she spoke  she took mrs pasmer into her confidence with regard to alice at an early stage of their acquaintance which from the first had a patronising or rather protecting quality in it if she owned herself less fine she knew herself shrewder and more capable of coping with actualities  i think shes moybid alice is she said she isnt moybid in the usual sense of the word but she expects more of herself and of the woyld generally than anybodys going to get out of it she thinks shes going to get as much as she gives and thats a great mistake mrs pasmer she said with that peculiar liquefaction of the canine letter which the newyorkers alone have the trick of and which it would be tiresome and futile to try to represent throughout her talk  oh yes i quite agree with you said mrs pasmer deep in her throat and reserving deeper still her enjoyment of this early wisdom of miss andersons  now even at churchshe carries the same spirit into the church she doesnt make allowance for human nature and the church does  oh certainly mrs pasmer agreed  she isnt like a person thats been brought up in the church its more like the old puritan spiritexcuse me mrs pasmer  yes indeed say anything you like about the puritans said mrs pasmer delighted that as a bostonian she should be thought to care for them  i always forget that youre a bostonian miss anderson apologized  oh thank you cried mrs pasmer  im going to try to make her like other girls continued miss anderson  do said alices mother with the effect of wishing her joy of the undertaking  if there were a few young men about a little over seventeen and a little under fifty it would be easier said miss anderson thoughtfully but how are you going to make a girl like other girls when there are no young men  thats very true said mrs pasmer with an interest which she of course did her best to make impersonal do you think there will be more later on  they will have to huey up if they are comin said miss anderson its the middle of august now and the hotel closes the second week in september  yes said mrs pasmer vaguely looking at alice she had just appeared over the brow of the precipice along whose face the arrivals and departures by the ferryboat at campobello obliquely ascend and descend  she came walking swiftly toward the hotel and for her so excitedly that mrs pasmer involuntarily rose and went to meet her at the top of the broad hotel steps  what is it alice  oh nothing i thought i saw mr munt coming off the boat  mr munt  yes she would not stay for further question  her mother looked after her with the edge of her fan over her mouth till she disappeared in the depths of the hotel corridor then she sat down near the steps and chatted with some halfgrown boys lounging on the balustrade and waited for munt to come up over the brink of the precipice dan mavering came with him running forward with a polite eagerness at sight of mrs pasmer she distributed a skillful astonishment equally between the two men she had equally expected to see and was extremely cordial with them not only because she was pleased with them but because she was still more pleased with her daughters being after all like other girls when it came to essentials     xii  alice came down to lunch in a dress which reconciled the seaside and the drawingroom in an effect entirely satisfactory to her mother and gave her hand to both the gentlemen without the affectation of surprise at seeing either  i saw mr munt coning up from the boat she said in answer to maverings demand for some sort of astonishment from her i wasnt certain that it was you  mrs pasmer whose pretences had been all given away by this simple confession did not resent it she was so much pleased with her daughters evident excitement at the young mans having come without being conscious of it perhaps alice prettily assumed the part of hostess from the moment of their meeting and did the honours of the hotel with a tacit implication of knowing that he had come to see her there they had only met twice but now the third time meeting after a little separation their manner toward each other was as if their acquaintance had been making progress in the interval she took him about quite as if he had joined their family party and introduced him to miss anderson and to all her particular friends for each of whom within five minutes after his presentation he contrived to do some winning service she introduced him to her father whom he treated with deep respect and said sir to she showed him the bowling alley and began to play tennis with him  her mother sitting with john munt on the piazza followed these polite attentions to mavering with humorous satisfaction which was qualified as they went on  alice she said to her at a chance which offered itself during the evening and then she hesitated for the right word  well mamma said the girl impatiently stopping on her way to walk up and down the piazza with mavering she had run in to get a wrap and a tamoshanter cap  dontoverdothe honours  what do you mean mamma asked the girl dropping her arms before her and letting the shawl trail on the floor  dont you think he was very kind to us on class day  her mother laughed but every one maynt know its gratitude  alice went out but she came back in a little while and went up to her room without speaking to any one  the fits of elation and depression with which this first day passed for her succeeded one another during maverings stay he did not need alices chaperonage long by the next morning he seemed to know and to like everybody in the hotel where he enjoyed a general favour which at that moment had no exceptions in the afternoon he began to organise excursions and amusements with the help of miss anderson  the plans all referred to alice who accepted and approved with an authority which every one tacitly admitted just as every one recognised that mavering had come to campobello because she was there such a phase is perhaps the prettiest in the history of a love affair all is yet in solution nothing has been precipitated in word or fact the parties to it even reserve a final construction of what they themselves say or do they will not own to their hearts that they mean exactly this or that it is this phase which in its perfect freedom is the most american of all under other conditions it is an instant perceptible or imperceptible under ours it is a distinct stage unhurried by any outside influences  the nearest approach to a definition of the situation was in a walk between mavering and mrs pasmer and this talk too light and brief might have had no such intention as her fancy assigned his part of it  she recurred to something that had been said on class day about his taking up the law immediately or going abroad first for a year  oh ive abandoned europe altogether for the present he said laughing and i dont know but i may go back on the law too  indeed then you are going to be an artist  oh no not so bad as that it isnt settled yet and im off here to think it over a while before the law school opens in september my father wants me to go into his business and turn my powers to account in designing wallpapers  oh how very interesting at the same time mrs pasmer ran over the whole field of her acquaintance without finding another wallpaper maker in it but she remembered what mrs saintsbury had said it was manufacturing this reminded her to ask if he had seen the saintsburys lately and he said no he believed they were still in cambridge though  and we shall actually see a young man she said finally in the act of deciding his own destiny  he laughed for pleasure in her persiflage yes only dont give me away nobody else knows it  oh no indeed too much flattered mr mavering shall you let me know when youve decided i shall be dying to know and i shall be too highminded to ask  it was not then too late to adapt pinafore to any exigency of life and mavering said you will learn from the expression of my eyes     xiii  the witnesses of maverings successful efforts to make everybody like him were interested in his differentiation of the attentions he offered every age and sex from those he paid alice but while they all agreed that there never was a sweeter fellow they would have been puzzled to say in just what this difference consisted and much as they liked him the ladies of her cult were not quite satisfied with him till they decided that it was marked by an anxiety a timidity which was perfectly fascinating in a man so far from bashfulness as he that is he did nice things for others without asking but with her there was always an explicit pause and an implicit prayer and permission first upon this condition they consented to the glamour which he had for her and which was evident to every one probably but him  once agreeing that no one was good enough for alice pasmer whose qualities they felt that only women could really appreciate they were interested to see how near mavering could come to being good enough and as the drama played itself before their eyes they pleased themselves in analysing its hero  he is not bashful certainly said one of a little group who sat midway of the piazza while alice and mavering walked up and down together but dont you think hes modest theres that difference you know  the lady addressed waited so long before answering that the young couple came abreast of the group and then she had to wait till they were out of hearing yes she said then with a tender sighing thoughtfulness ive felt that in him and really think he is a very loveable nature the only question would be whether he wasnt too loveable  yes said the first lady with the same kind of suspiration i know what you mean and i suppose they ought to be something more alike in disposition  or sympathies suggested the other  yes or sympathies  a third lady laughed a little mr mavering has so many sympathies that he ought to be like her in some of them  do you mean that hes too sympatheticthat he isnt sincere asked the firsta single lady of fortynine a miss cotton who had a little knot of conscience between her pretty eyebrows tied there by the unremitting effort of half a century to do and say exactly the truth and to find it out  mrs brinkley whom she addressed was of that obesity which seems often to incline people to sarcasm no i dont think hes insincere i think he always means what he says and doeswell do you think a little more concentration of goodwill would hurt him for miss pasmers purposeif she has it  yes i see said miss cotton she waited with her kind eyes fixed wistfully upon alice for the young people to approach and get by i wonder what the men think of him  you might ask miss anderson said mrs brinkley  oh do you think they tell her  not that exactly said mrs brinkley shaking with goodhumoured pleasure in her joke  her voiceoh yes she and alice are great friends of course  i should think said mrs stamwell the second speaker that mr mavering would be jealous sometimestill he looked twice  yes said miss cotton obliged to admit the force of the remark but feeling that mr mavering had been carried out of the field of her vision by the turn of the talk i suppose she continued that he wouldnt be so well liked by other young men as she is by other girls do you think  i dont think as a rule said mrs brinkley that men are half so appreciative of one another as women are its most amusing to see the open scorn with which two young fellows treat each other if a pretty girl introduces them  all the ladies joined in the laugh with which mrs brinkley herself led off but miss cotton stopped laughing first  do you mean she asked that if a gentleman were generally popular with gentlemen it would be  because he wasnt generally so with women something like thatif youll leave mr mavering out of the question oh how very good of them she broke off and all the ladies glanced at mavering and alice where they had stopped at the further end of the piazza and were looking off now i can probably finish before they get back here again what i do mean miss cotton is that neither sex willingly accepts the favourites of the other  yes said miss cotton admissively  and all that saves miss pasmer is that she has not only the qualities that women like in women but some of the qualities that men like in them shes thoroughly human  a little sensation almost a murmur not wholly of assent went round that circle which had so nearly voted alice a saint  in the first place she likes to please men  oh came from the group  and that makes them like herif it doesnt go too far as her mother says  the ladies all laughed recognising a common turn of phrase in mrs pasmer  i should think said mrs stamwell that she would believe a little in heredity if she noticed that in her daughter and the ladies laughed again  then mrs brinkley resumed concerning alice she has a very pretty facean extremely pretty face she has a tender voice and shes very very gracefulin rather an odd way perhaps its only a fascinating awkwardness then she dressesor her mother dresses herexquisitely the ladies with another sensation admitted the perfect accuracy with which these points had been touched  thats what men like what they fall in love with what mr maverings in love with this instant its no use womens flattering themselves that they dont for they do the rest of the virtues and graces and charms are for women if that serious girl could only know the silly things that that amiable simpleton is taken with in her shed  never speak to him again suggested miss cotton  no i dont say that but she would think twice before marrying him  and then do it said mrs stamwell pensively with eyes that seemed looking far into the past  yes and quite right to do it said mrs brinkley i dont know that we should be very proud ourselves if we confessed just what caught our fancy in our husbands for my part i shouldnt like to say how much a light hat that mr brinkley happened to be wearing had to do with the matter  the ladies broke into another laugh and then checked themselves so that mrs pasmer coming out of the corridor upon them naturally thought they were laughing at her she reflected that if she had been in their place she would have shown greater tact by not stopping just at that instant  but she did not mind she knew that they talked her over but having a very good conscience she simply talked them over in return have you seen my daughter within a few minutes she asked  she was with mr mavering at the end of the piazza a moment ago said mrs brinkley they must leave just gone round the corner of the building  oh said mrs pasmer she had a novel with her finger between its leaves pressed against her heart after the manner of ladies coming out on hotel piazzas she sat down and rested it on her knee with her hand over the top  miss cotton bent forward and mrs pasmer lifted her fingers to let her see the name of the book  oh yes said miss cotton but hes so terribly pessimistic dont you think  what is it asked mrs brinkley  fumee said mrs pasmer laying the book title upward on her lap for every one to see  oh yes said mrs brinkley fanning herself tourguenief that man gave me the worst quarter of an hour with his lisa that i ever had  thats the same as the nichee des gentilshommes isnt it asked mrs pasmer with the involuntary superiority of a woman who reads her tourguenief in french  i dont know i had it in english i dont build my ships to cross the sea in as emerson says i take those i find built  ah i was already on the other side said mrs pasmer softly she added i must get lisa i like a good heartbreak dont you if thats what gave you the bad moment  heartbreak heartcrush where lavretsky comes back old to the scene of his love for lisa and strikes that chord on the pianowell i simply wonder that im alive to recommend the book to you  do you know said miss cotton very deferentially that your daughter always made me think of lisa  indeed cried mrs pasmer not wholly pleased but gratified that she was able to hide her displeasure you make me very curious  oh i doubt if youll see more than a mere likeness of temperament mrs brinkley interfered bluntly all the conditions are so different there couldnt be an american lisa thats the charm of these russian tragedies you feel that theyre so perfectly true there and so perfectly impossible here lavretsky would simply have got himself divorced from varvara pavlovna and no clergyman could have objected to marrying him to lisa  thats what i mean by his pessimism said miss cotton he leaves you no hope and i think that despair should never be used in a novel except for some good purpose dont you mrs brinkley  well said mrs brinkley i was trying to think what good purpose despair could be put to in a book or out of it  i dont think said mrs pasmer referring to the book in her lap that he leaves you altogether in despair here unless youd rather hed run off with irene than married tatiana  oh i certainly didnt wish that said miss cotton in selfdefence as if the shot had been aimed at her  the book ends with a marriage theres no denying that said mrs brinkley with a reserve in her tone which caused mrs pasmer to continue for her  and marriage means happinessin a book  im not sure that it does in this case the time would come after litvinof had told tatiana everything when she would have to ask herself and not once only what sort of man it really was who was willing to break his engagement and run off with another mans wife and whether he could ever repent enough for it she could make excuses for him and would but at the bottom of her heartno it seems to me that there almost for the only time tourguenief permitted himself an amiable weakness all that part of the book has the air of begging the question  but dont you see said miss cotton leaning forward in the way she had when very earnest that he means to show that her love is strong enough for all that  but he doesnt because it isnt love isnt strong enough to save people from unhappiness through each others faults do you suppose that so many married people are unhappy in each other because they dont love each other no its because they do love each other that their faults are such a mutual torment if they were indifferent they wouldnt mind each others faults perhaps thats the reason why there are so many american divorces if they didnt care like europeans who dont marry for love they could stand it  then the moral is said mrs pasmer at her lightest through the surrounding gravity that as all americans marry for love only americans who have been very good ought to get married  im not sure that the havebeen goodness is enough either said mrs brinkley willing to push it to the absurd you marry a mans future as well as his past  dear me you are terribly exigeante mrs brinkley said mrs pasmer  one can afford to be soin the abstract answered mrs brinkley  they all stopped talking and looked at john munt who was coming toward them and each felt a longing to lay the matter before him  there was probably not a woman among them but had felt more read more and thought more than john munt but he was a man and the mind of a man is the court of final appeal for the wisest women till some man has pronounced upon their wisdom they do not know whether it is wisdom or not  munt drew up his chair and addressed himself to the whole group through mrs pasmer we are thinking of getting up a little picnic tomorrow     xiv  the day of the picnic struggled till ten oclock to peer through the fog that wrapt it with that remote damp and coolness and that nearer drouth and warmth which some fogs have the low pine groves hung full of it and it gave a silvery definition to the gossamer threads running from one grass spear to another in spacious networks over the open levels of the old fields that stretch back from the bluff to the woods at last it grew thinner somewhere over the bay then you could see the smooth water through it then it drifted off in ragged fringes before a light breeze when you looked landward again it was all gone there and seaward it had gathered itself in a low dun bank along the horizon it was the kind of fog that people interested in campobello admitted as apt to be common there but claimed as a kind of local virtue when it began to break away they said that it was a very dry fog not like newport and asked you to notice that it did not wet you at all  four or five carriages driven by the gentlemen of the party held the picnic which was destined for that beautiful cove on the bay of fundy where the red granite ledges smoothwashed by ages of storm and sun lend themselves to such festivities as if they had been artificially fashioned into shelves and tables the whole place is yet so new to men that this haunt has not acquired that air of repulsive custom which the egg shells and broken bottles and sardine boxes of many seasons give or perhaps the winter tempests heap the tides of the bay over the ledge and wash it clean of these vulgar traces of human resort and enable it to offer as fresh a welcome to the picnics of each successive summer as if there had never been a picnic in that place before  this was the sense that mavering professed to have received from it when he jumped out of the beach wagon in which he had preceded the other carriages through the weird forest lying between the fringe of farm fields and fishingvillages on the western shore of the island and these lonely coasts of the bay as far as the signs of settled human habitation last the road is the good hard country road of new england climbing steep little hills and presently leading through long tracts of woodland but at a certain point beyond the furthest cottage you leave it and plunge deep into the heart of the forest vaguely traversed by the wheelpath carried through since the island was opened to summer sojourn road you can hardly call it remembering its curious pauses and hesitations when confronted with stretches of marshy ground and its staggering progress over the thick stubble of saplings through which it is cut the progress of teams over it is slow but there is such joy of wildness in the solitudes it penetrates that if the horses had any gait slower than a walk one might still wish to stay them it is a northern forest with the air of having sprang quickly up in the fierce heat and haste of the northern summers the small firs are set almost as dense as rye in a field and in their struggle to the light they have choked one another so that there is a strange blight of death and defeat on all that vigour of life few of the trees have won any lofty growth they seem to have died and fallen when they were about to outstrip the others in size and from their decay a new sylvan generation riots rankly upward the surface of the ground is thinly clothed with a deciduous undergrowth above which are the bare spare stems of the evergreens and then their limbs thrusting into one another in a sombre tangle with locks of long yellowishwhite moss like the grey pendants of the southern pines dripping from them and draining their brief life  in such a place you must surrender yourself to its influences profoundly yet vaguely melancholy or you must resist them with whatever gaiety is in you or may be conjured out of others it was conceded that mavering was the life of the party as the phrase goes his lightheartedness as kindly and sympathetic as it was inexhaustible served to carry them over the worst places in the road of itself he jumped down and ran back when he had passed a bad bit to see if the others were getting through safely the least interesting of the party had some proof of his impartial friendliness he promised an early and triumphant emergence from all difficulties he started singing and sacrificed himself in several tunes for he could not sing well his laugh seemed to be always coming back to alice where she rode late in the little procession several times with the deference which he delicately qualified for her he came himself to see if he could not do something for her  miss pasmer croaked her friend miss anderson who always began in that ceremonious way with her and got to calling her alice further along in the conversation if you dont drop something for that poor fellow to run back two or three miles and get pretty soon ill do it myself its peyfectly disheaytening to see his disappointment when you tell him theyes nothing to be done  he seems to get over it said alice evasively she smiled with pleasure in miss andersons impeachment however  oh he keeps coming if thats what you mean but do drop an umbrella or a rubber or something next time just to show a proper appreciation  but mavering did not come any more just before they got to the cove miss anderson leaned over again to whisper in alices ear i told you he was huyt now you must be very good to him the rest of the time  upon theory a girl of alice pasmers reserve ought to have resented this intervention but it is not probable she did she flushed a little but not with offence apparently and she was kinder to mavering and let him do everything for her that he could invent in transferring the things from the wagons to the rocks  the party gave a gaiety to the wild place which accented its proper charm as they scattered themselves over the ledges on the bright shawls spread upon the level spaces on either hand craggy bluffs hemmed the cove in but below the ledge it had a pebbly beach strewn with driftwood and the bay of fundy gloomed before it with small fishing craft tipping and tilting on the swell in the foreground and dim sail melting into the dun fog bank at the horizons edge  the elder ladies of the party stood up or stretched themselves on the shawls as they found this or that posture more restful after their long drive one who was skilled in making coffee had taken possession of the pot and was demanding fire and water for it the men scattered themselves over the beach and brought her drift enough to roast an ox two of them fetched water from the spring at the back of the ledge whither they then carried the bottles of ale to cool in its thrilling pool each after his or her fashion symbolised a return to nature by some act or word of selfabandon  you ought to have brought heavier shoes said mrs pasmer with a serious glance at her daughters feet well never mind she added it doesnt matter if you do spoil them  really cried mrs brinkley casting her sandals from her i will not be enslaved to rubbers in such a sylvan scene as this at any rate  look at mrs stamwell said miss cotton shes actually taken her hat off  mrs stamwell had not only gone to this extreme but had tied a lightly fluttering handkerchief round her hair she said she should certainly not put on that heavy thing again till she got in sight of civilisation  at these words miss cotton boldly drew off her gloves and put them in her pocket  the young girls slim in their blues flannel skirts and their broad white canvas belts went and came over the rocks there were some children in the party who were allowed to scream uninterruptedly in the games which they began to play as soon as they found their feet after getting out of the wagons  some of the gentlemen drove a stake into the beach and threw stones at it to see which could knock off the pebble balanced on its top several of the ladies joined them in the sport and shrieked and laughed when they made wild shots with the missiles the men politely gathered for them  alice had remained with mavering to help the hostess of the picnic lay the tables but her mother had followed those who went down to the beach at first mrs pasmer looked on at the practice of the stonethrowers with disapproval but suddenly she let herself go in this as she did in other matters that her judgment condemned and began to throw stones herself she became excited and made the wildest shots of any accepting missiles right and left and making herself dangerous to everybody within a wide circle a gentleman who had fallen a victim to her skill said just wait mrs pasmer till i get in front of the stake  the men became seriously interested and worked themselves red and hot the ladies soon gave it up and sat down on the sand and began to talk they all owned themselves hungry and from time to time they looked up anxiously at the preparations for lunch on the ledge where white napkins were spread with bottles at the four corners to keep them from blowing away this use of the bottles was considered very amusing the ladies tried to make jokes about it and the desire to be funny spread to certain of the men who had quietly left off throwing at the stake because they had wrenched their shoulders they succeeded in being merry they said they thought that coffee took a long time to boil  a lull of expectation fell upon all even mavering sat down on the rocks near the fire and was at rest a few minutes by order of miss anderson who said that the sight of his activity tired her to death  i wonder why always boiled ham at a picnic said the lady who took a final plate of it from a basket under the ordinary conditions few of us can be persuaded to touch it  it seems to be dear to nature and to natures children said mrs brinkley perhaps because their digestions are strong  dont you wish that something could be substituted for it asked miss cotton  there have been efforts to replace it with chicken and tongue in sandwiches said mrs brinkley but i think theyve only measurably succeededabout as temperance drinks have in place of the real strong waters  on the boat coming up said mavering we had a troupe of genuine darky minstrels one of them sang a song about ham that rather took me  ham good old ham ham is de best ob meat its always good and sweet you can bake it you can boil it you can fry it you can broil itham good old ham  oh how good sighed mrs brinkley how sincere how native go on mr mavering for ever  i havent the materials said mavering with his laugh the rest was da capo but there was another song about a coloured lady  six foot high and eight foot round holler ob her foot made a hole in de ground  ah thats an old friend said mrs brinkley i remember hearing of that coloured lady when i was a girl but its a fine flight of the imagination what else did they sing  i cant remember but there was something they dancedto show how a rheumatic old coloured uncle dances  he jumped nimbly up and sketched the stiff and limping figure he had seen it was over in a flash he dropped down again laughing  oh how wonderfully good cried mrs brinkley with frank joy do it again  encore oh encore came from the people on the beach  mavering jumped to his feet and burlesqued the profuse bows of an actor who refuses to repeat he was about to drop down again amidst their wails of protest  no dont sit down mr mavering said the lady who had introduced the subject of ham get some of the young ladies and go and gather some blueberries for the dessert there are all the necessaries of life here but none of the luxuries  im at the service of the young ladies as an escort said mavering gallantly with an infusion of joke will you come and pick blueberries under my watchful eyes miss pasmer  theyve gone to pick blueberries called the lady through her tubed hand to the people on the beach and the younger among them scrambled up the rocks for cups and bowls to follow them  mrs pasmer had an impulse to call her daughter back and to make some excuse to keep her from going she was in an access of decorum naturally following upon her late outbreak and it seemed a very pronounced thing for alice to be going off into the woods with the young man but it would have been a pronounced thing to prevent her and so mrs pasmer submitted  isnt it delightful asked mrs brinkley following them with her eyes to see the charm that gay young fellow has for that serious girl she looked at him while he was dancing as if she couldnt take her eyes off him and she followed him as if he drew her by an invisible spell not that spells are ever visible she added saving herself though this one seems to be she added further again saving herself  do you really think so pleaded miss cotton  well i say so whatever i think and im not going to be caught up on the tenterhooks of conscience as to all my meanings miss cotton i dont know them all but im not one of the aliceolaters you know  no of course not but shouldnt youdont you think it would be a great pityshes so superior so very uncommon in every way that it hardly seemsah i should so like to see some one really finenot a coarse fibre in him dont you know not that mr maverings coarse but beside her he does seem so light  perhaps thats the reason she likes him  no no i cant believe that she must see more in him than we can  i dare say she thinks she does at any rate its a perfectly evident case on both sides and the frank way hes followed her up here and devoted himself to her as ifwell not as if she were the only girl in the world but incomparably the bestis certainly not common  no sighed miss cotton glad to admit it thats beautiful     xv  in the edge of the woods and the open spaces among the trees the blueberries grew larger and sweeter in the late northern summer than a more southern sun seems to make them they hung dense upon the low bushes and gave them their tint through the soft grey bloom that veiled their blue sweetfern in patches broke their mass here and there and exhaled its wild perfume to the foot or skirt brushing through it  i dont think theres anything much prettier than these clusters do you miss pasmer asked mavering as he lifted a bunch pendent from the little tree before he stripped it into the bowl he carried and see it spoils the bloom to gather them he held out a handful and then tossed them away it ought to be managed more aesthetically for an occasion like this ill tell you what miss pasmer are you used to blueberrying  no she said i dont know that i ever went blueberrying before why she asked  because if you havent you wouldnt be very efficient perhaps and so you might resign yourself to sitting on that log and holding the berries in your lap while i pick them  but what about the bowls then  oh never mind them ive got an idea see here he clipped off a bunch with his knife and held it up before her tilting it this way and that could anything be more graceful my idea is to serve the blueberry on its native stem at this picnic what do you think sugar would profane it and of course theyve only got milk enough for the coffee  delightful alice arranged herself on the log and made a lap for the bunch he would not allow that the arrangement was perfect till he had cushioned the seat and carpeted the ground for her feet with sweetfern  now youre something like a woodnymph he laughed only wouldnt a real woodnymph have an apron he asked looking down at her dress  oh it wont hurt the dress you must begin now or theyll be calling us  he was standing and gazing at her with a distracted enjoyment of her pose oh yes yes he answered coming to himself and he set about his work  he might have got on faster if he had not come to her with nearly every bunch he cut at first and when he began to deny himself this pleasure he stopped to admire an idea of hers  well thats charmingmaking them into bouquets  yes isnt it she cried delightedly holding a bunch of the berries up at armslength to get the effect  ah but you must have some of this fern and this tall grass to go with it why its sweetgrassthe sweetgrass of the indian baskets  is it she looked up at him and do you think that the mixture would be better than the modest simplicity of the berries with a few leaves of the same  no youre right it wouldnt he said throwing away his ferns but youll want something to tie the stems with you must use the grass he left that with her and went back to his bushes he added from beyond a little thicket as if what he said were part of the subject i was afraid you wouldnt like my skipping about there on the rocks doing the coloured uncle  like it  i meaniyou thought it undignifiedtrivial  she said after a moment it was very funny and people do all sorts of things at picnics thats the pleasure of it isnt it  yes it is but i know you dont always like that kind of thing  do i seem so very severe she asked  oh no not severe i should be afraid of you if you were i shouldnt have dared to come to campobello  he looked at her across the blueberry bushes his gay speech meant everything or nothing she could parry it with a jest and then it would mean nothing she let her head droop over her work and made no answer  i wish you could have seen those fellows on the boat said mavering  hello mavering called the voice of john munt from another part of the woods  alicemiss pasmer came that of miss anderson  he was going to answer when he looked at alice well let them see if they can find us he said and smiled  alice said nothing at first she smiled too you know more about the woods than i do i suppose if they keep looking  oh yes he came toward her with a mass of clusters which he had clipped how fast you do them he said standing and looking down at her i wish youd let me come and make up the withes for you when you need them  no i couldnt allow that on any account she answered twisting some stems of the grass together  well will you let me hold the bunches while you tie them or tie them when you hold them  no  this once then  this once perhaps  how little you let me do for you he sighed  that gives you a chance to do more for other people she answered and then she dropped her eyes as if she had been surprised into that answer she made haste to add thats what makes you so popular witheverybody  ah but id rather be popular with somebody  he laughed and then they both laughed together consciously and still nothing or everything had been said a little silly silence followed and he said for escape from it i never saw such berries before even in september on the top of ponkwasset  why is it a mountain she asked i thought it was afalls  its both he said  i suppose its very beautiful isnt it all america seems so lovely so large  its pretty in the summer i dont know that i shall like it there in the winter if i conclude todid yourdid mrs pasmer tell you what my father wants me to do  about going there tomanufacture  mavering nodded hes given me three weeks to decide whether i would like to do that or go in for law thats what i came up here for  there was a little pause she bent her head down over the clusters she was grouping is the light of campobello particularly good on such questions she asked  i dont mean that exactly but i wish you could help me to some conclusion  yes why not  its the first time ive ever had a business question referred to me  well then you can bring a perfectly fresh mind to it  let me see she said affecting to consider its really a very important matter  it is to me  after a moment she looked up at him i should think that you wouldnt mind living there if your business was there i suppose its being idle in places that makes them dull i thought it was dull in london one ought to be gladoughtnt heto live in any place where theres something to do  well that isnt the way people usually feel said mavering thats the kind of a place most of them fight shy of  alice laughed with an undercurrent of protest perhaps because she had seen her parents whole life so far as she knew it passed in this sort of struggle i mean that i hate my own life because there seems nothing for me to do with it i like to have people do something  do you really asked mavering soberly as if struck by the novelty of the idea  yes she said with exaltation if i were a man  he burst into a ringing laugh oh no dont  why she demanded with provisional indignation  because then there wouldnt be any miss pasmer  it seemed to alice that this joking was rather an unwarranted liberty again she could not help joining in his lightheartedness but she checked herself so abruptly and put on a look so austere that he was quelled by it  i mean he beganthat is to sayi mean that i dont understand why ladies are always saying that i am sure they can do what they like as it is  do you mean that everything is open to them now she asked disentangling a cluster of the berries from those in her lap and beginning a fresh bunch  yes said mavering something like thatyes they can do anything they like lots of them do  oh yes i know said the girl but people dont like them to  why what would you like to be he asked  she did not answer but sorted over the clusters in her lap weve got enough now havent we she said  oh not half he said but if youre tired you must let me make up some of the bunches  no no i want to do them all myself she said gesturing his offered hands away with a little nether appeal in her laughing refusal  so as to feel that youve been of some use in the world he said dropping contentedly on the ground near her and watching her industry  do you think that would be very wrong she asked what made that friend of yoursmr boardmango into journalism  oh virtuous poverty youre not thinking of becoming a newspaper woman miss pasmer  why not she put the final cluster into the bunch in hand and began to wind a withe of sweetgrass around the stems he dropped forward on his knees to help her and together they managed the knot they were both flushed a little when it was tied and were serious  why shouldnt one be a newspaper woman if harvard graduates are to be journalists  well you know only a certain kind are  what kind  well not exactly what youd call the gentlemanly sort  i thought mr boardman was a great friend of yours  he is he is one of the best fellows in the world but you must have seen that he wasnt a swell  i should think hed be glad he was doing something at once if i were a she stopped and they laughed together i mean that i should hate to be so long getting ready to do something as men are  then youd rather begin making wallpaper at once than studying law  oh i dont say that im not competent to advise but i should like to feel that i was doing something i suppose its hereditary mavering stared a little one of my fathers sisters has gone into a sisterhood shes in england  is she acatholic asked mavering  she isnt a roman catholic  oh yes he dropped forward on his knees again to help her tie the bunch she had finished it was not so easy as the first  oh thank you she said with unnecessary fervour  but you shouldnt like to go into a sisterhood i suppose said mavering ready to laugh  oh i dont know why not she looked at him with a flying glance and dropped her eyes  oh no reason if you have a fancy for that kind of thing  that kind of thing repeated alice severely  oh i dont mean anything disrespectful to it said mavering throwing his anxiety off in the laugh he had been holding back and i beg your pardon but i dont suppose youre in earnest  oh no im not in earnest said the girl letting her wrists fall upon her knees and the clusters drop from her hands im not in earnest about anything thats the truththats the shame wouldnt you like she broke off to be a priest and go round among these people up here on their frozen islands in the winter  no shouted mavering i certainly shouldnt i dont see how anybody stands it ponkwasset falls is bad enough in the winter and compared to this region ponkwasset falls is a metropolis i believe in getting all the good you can out of the world you were born inof course without hurting anybody else he stretched his legs out on the bed of sweetfern where he had thrown himself and rested his head on his hand lifted on his elbow i think this is what this place is fit fora picnic and i wish every one well out of it for nine months of the year  i dont said the girl with a passionate regret in her voice it would be heavenly here withbut youno youre different you always want to share your happiness  i shouldnt call that happiness but dont you asked mavering  no im selfish  you dont expect me to be believe that i suppose  yes she went on it must be selfishness you dont believe im so because you cant imagine it but its true if i were to be happy i should be very greedy about it i couldnt endure to let any one else have a part in it so its best for me to be wretched dont you seeto give myself up entirely to doing for others and not expect any one to do anything for me then i can be of some use in the world thats why i should like to go into a sisterhood  mavering treated it as the best kind of joke and he was confirmed in this view of it by her laughing with him after a first glance of what he thought mock piteousness     xvi  the clouds sailed across the irregular space of pale blue northern sky which the break in the woods opened for them overhead it was so still that they heard and smiled to hear the broken voices of the others who had gone to get berries in another directionmiss andersons hoarse murmur and munts artificial bass some words came from the party on the rocks  isnt it perfect cried the young fellow in utter content  yes too perfect answered the girl rousing herself from the reverie in which they had both lost themselves she did not know how long shall you gather any more  no i guess theres enough lets count them he stooped over on his hands and knees and made as much of counting the bunches as he could theres about one bunch and a half a piece how shall we carry them we ought to come into camp as impressively as possible  yes said alice looking into his face with dreamy absence it was going through her mind from some romance she had read what if he were some sylvan creature with that gaiety that natural gladness and sweetness of his so far from any happiness that was possible to her ought not she to be afraid of him she was thinking she was not afraid  ill tell you he said tie the stems of all the bunches together and swing them over a pole like grapes of eshcol dont you know the picture  oh yes  hold on ill get the pole he cut a white birch sapling and swept off its twigs and leaves then he tied the bunches together and slung them over the middle of the pole  well she asked  now we must rest the ends on our shoulders  do you think so she asked with the reluctance that complies  yes but not right away ill carry them out of the woods and well form the procession just before we come in sight  every one on the ledge recognised the tableau when it appeared and saluted it with cheers and handclapping mrs pasmer bent a look on her daughter which she faced impenetrably  where have you been we thought you were lost we were just organising a search expedition different ones shouted at them  the lady with the coffeepot was kneeling over it with her hand on it have some coffee you poor things you must be almost starved  we looked about for you everywhere said munt and shouted ourselves dumb  miss anderson passed near alice i knew where you were all the time  then the whole party fell to praising the novel conception of the bouquets of blueberries and the talk began to flow away from alice and mavering in various channels  all that had happened a few minutes ago in the blueberry patch seemed a faroff dream the reality had died out of the looks and words  he ran about from one to another serving every one in a little while the whole affair was in his hospitable hands and his laugh interspersed and brightened the talk  she got a little back of the others and sat looking wistfully out over the bay with her hands in her lap  hold on just half a minute miss pasmer dont move exclaimed the amateur photographer who is now of all excursions he jumped to his feet and ran for his apparatus she sat still to please him but when he had developed his picture in a dark corner of the rocks roofed with a waterproof he accused her of having changed her position but its going to be splendid he said with another look at it  he took several pictures of the whole party for which they fell into various attitudes of consciousness then he shouted to a boatload of sailors who had beached their craft while they gathered some drift for their galley fire they had flung their armloads into the boat and had bent themselves to shove it into the water  keep still dont move he yelled at them with the imperiousness of the amateur photographer and they obeyed with the helplessness of his victims but they looked round  oh idiots groaned the artist  i always wonder what that kind of people think of us kind of people said mrs brinkley with her eye on the photographers subjects  yes i wonder what they do said miss cotton pleased with the speculative turn which the talk might take from this i suppose they envy us she suggested  well not all of them and those that do not respectfully they view us as the possessors of illgotten gains who would be in a very different place if we had our deserts  do you really think so  yes i think so but i dont know that i really think so thats another matter said mrs brinkley with the whimsical resentment which miss cottons conscientious pursuit seemed always to rouse in her  i supposed continued miss cotton that it was only among the poor in the cities who have begin misled by agitators that thewelltodo classes were regarded with suspicion  it seems to have begun a great while ago said mrs brinkley and not exactly with agitators it was considered very difficult for us to get into the kingdom of heaven you know  yes i know assented miss cotton  and there certainly are some things against us even when the chance was given us to sell all we had and give it to the poor we couldnt bring our minds to it and went away exceeding sorrowful  i wonder said miss cotton whether those things were ever intended to be taken literally  lets hope not said john munt seeing his chance to make a laugh  mrs stamwell said well i shall take another cup of coffee at any rate and her hardihood raised another laugh  that always seems to me the most pitiful thing in the whole bible said alice from her place to see the right so clearly and not to be strong enough to do it  my dear it happens every day said mrs brinkley  i always felt sorry for that poor fellow too said mavering he seemed to be a good fellow and it was pretty hard lines for him  alice looked round at him with deepening gravity  confound those fellows said the photographer glancing at his hastily developed plate they moved     xvii  the picnic party gathered itself up after the lunch and while some of the men emulous of maverings public spirit helped some of the ladies to pack the dishes and baskets away under the wagon seats others threw a corked bottle into the water and threw stones at it a few of the ladies joined them but nobody hit the bottle which was finally left bobbing about on the tide  mrs brinkley addressed the defeated group of whom her husband was one as they came up the beach toward the wagons do you think that display was calculated to inspire the lower middle classes with respectful envy  her husband made himself spokesman for the rest no but you cant tell how theyd have felt if wed hit it  they all now climbed to a higher level grassy and smooth on the bluff from which there was a particular view and mavering came carrying the wraps of mrs pasmer and alice with which he associated his overcoat a book fell out of one of the pockets when he threw it down  miss anderson picked the volume up browning he reads browning superior young man  oh dont say that pleaded mavering  oh read something aloud cried another of the young ladies  isnt browning rather serious for a picnic he asked with a glance at alice he still had a doubt of the effect of the rheumatic uncles dance upon her and would have been glad to give her some other aesthetic impression of him  oh no said mrs brinkley nothing is more appropriate to a picnic than conundrums they always have them choose a good tough one  i dont know anything tougher than the legend of pernikor lovelier he said and he began to read simply and with a passionate pleasure in the subtle study feeling its control over his hearers  the gentlemen lay smoking about at their ease at the end a deep sigh went up from the ladies cut short by the question which they immediately fell into  they could not agree but they said one after another but you read beautifully mr mavering beautifully yes indeed  well im glad there is one point clear he said putting the book away and im afraid youll think im rather sentimental he added in a low voice to alice carrying poetry around with me  oh no she replied intensely i thank you  i thank you he retorted and their eyes met in a deep look  one of the outer circle of smokers came up with his watch in his hand and addressed the company do you know what time its got to be its four oclock  they all sprang up with a clamour of surprise  mrs pasmer under cover of the noise said in a low tone to her daughter alice i think youd better keep a little more with me now  yes said the girl in a sympathy with her mother in which she did not always find herself  but when mavering whom their tacit treaty concerned turned toward them and put himself in charge of alice mrs pasmer found herself dispossessed by the charm of his confidence and relinquished her to him they were going to walk to the castle rocks by the path that now loses and now finds itself among the fastnesses of the forest stretching to the loftiest outlook on the bay the savage woodland is penetrated only by this forgetful path that passes now and then aver the bridge of a ravine and offers to the eye on either hand the mystery deepening into wilder and weirder tracts of solitude the party resolved itself into twos and threes and these straggled far apart out of conversational reach of one another mrs pasmer found herself walking and talking with john munt  mr pasmer hasnt much interest in these excursions he suggested  no he never goes she answered and by one of the agile intellectual processes natural to women she arrived at the question you and the maverings are old friends mr munt  i cant say about the son but im his fathers friend and i suppose that im his friend too everybody seems to be so suggested munt  oh yes mrs pasmer assented he appears to be a universal favourite  we used to expect great things of elbridge mavering in college we were rather more romantic than the harvard men are nowadays and we believed in one another more than they do perhaps we idealised one another but anyway our class thought mavering could do anything you know about his taste for etchings  yes said mrs pasmer with a sigh of deep appreciation what gifted people  i understand that the son inherits all his fathers talent  he sketches delightfully  and mavering wrote why he was our class poet cried munt remembering the fact with surprise and gratification to himself he was a tremendous satirist  really and he seems so amiable now  oh it was only on paper  perhaps he still keeps it upon wallpaper suggested mrs pasmer  munt laughed at the little joke with a goodwill that flattered the veteran flatterer i should like to ask him that some time will you lend it to me  yes if such a sayer of good things will deign to borrow  oh mrs pasmer cried munt otherwise speechless  and the mother do you know mrs mavering  mrs mavering ive never seen  oh said mrs pasmer with a disappointment for which munt tried to console her  ive never even been at their place he asked me once a great while ago but you know how those things are ive heard that she used to be very pretty and very gay they went about a great deal to saratoga and cape may and such placesrather out of our beat  and now  and now shes been an invalid for a great many years bedridden i believe paralysis i think  yes mrs saintsbury said something of the kind  well said munt anxious to add to the store of knowledge which this remark let him understand he had not materially increased i think mrs mavering was the origin of the wallpaperor her money mavering was poor her father had started it and mavering turned in his talent  how very interesting and is that the reasonits being ancestralthat mr mavering wishes his son to go into it  is he going into it asked munt  hes come up here to think about it  i should suppose it would be a very good thing said munt  what a very remarkable forest said mrs pasmer examining it on either side and turning quite round this gave her from her place in the van of the straggling procession a glimpse of alice and dan mavering far in the rear  dont you know he was saying to the girl at the same moment its like some of those dore illustrations to the inferno or the wandering jew  oh yes i was trying to think what it was made me think i had seen it before she answered it must be that but how strange it is she exclaimed that sensation of having been there beforein some place before where you cant possibly have been  and do you feel it here he asked as vividly interested as if they two had been the first to notice the phenomenon which has been a psychical consolation to so many young observers  yes she cried  i hope i was with you he said with a sudden turn of levity which did not displease her for there seemed to be a tender earnestness lurking in it i couldnt bear to think of your being alone in such a howling wilderness  oh i was with a large picnic she retorted gaily you might have been among the rest i didnt notice  well the next time i wish youd look closer i dont like being left out they were so far behind the rest that he devoted himself entirely to her and they had grown more and more confidential  they came to a narrow footbridge over a deep gorge the handrail had fallen away he sprang forward and gave her his hand for the passage who helped you over here he demanded dont say i didnt  perhaps it was you she murmured letting him keep the fingers to which he clung a moment after they had crossed the bridge then she took them away and said but i cant be sure there were so many others  other fellows he demanded placing himself before her on the narrow path so that she could not get by try to remember miss pasmer this is very important it would break my heart if it was really some one else she stole a glance at his face but it was smiling though his voice was so earnest i want to help you over all the bad places and i dont want any one else to have a hand in it  the voice and the face still belied each other and between them the girl chose to feel herself trifled with by the artistic temperament if youll please step out of the way mr mavering she said severely i shall not need anybodys help just here  he instantly moved aside and they were both silent till she said as she quickened her pace to overtake the others in front i dont see how you can help liking nature in such a place as this  i canthuman nature he said it was mere folly and an abstract folly at that but the face that she held down and away from him flushed with sweet consciousness as she laughed  on the cliff beetling above the bay where she sat to look out over the sad northern sea lit with the fishing sail they had seen before and the surge washed into the rocky coves far beneath them he threw himself at her feet and made her alone in the company that came and went and tried this view and that from the different points where the picnic hostess insisted they should enjoy it she left the young couple to themselves and mrs pasmer seemed to have forgotten that she had bidden alice to be a little more with her  alice had forgotten it too she sat listening to maverings talk with a certain fascination but not so much apparently because the meaning of the words pleased her as the sound of his voice the motion of his lips in speaking charmed her at first he was serious and even melancholy as if he were afraid he had offended her but apparently he soon believed that he had been forgiven and began to burlesque his own mood but still with a deference and a watchful observance of her changes of feeling which was delicately flattering in its way now and then when she answered something it was not always to the purpose he accused her of not hearing what he said but she would have it that she did and then he tried to test her by proofs and questions it did not matter for anything that was spoken or done speech and action of whatever sort were mere masks of their young joy in each other so that when he said after he had quoted some lines befitting the scene they looked out on now was that from tennyson or from tupper and she answered neither it was from shakespeare they joined in the same happy laugh and they laughed now and then without saying anything neither this nor that made them more glad or less they were in a trance vulnerable to nothing but the summons which must come to leave their dream behind and issue into the waking world  in hope or in experience such a moment has come to all and it is so pretty to those who recognise it from the outside that no one has the heart to hurry it away while it can be helped the affair between alice and mavering had evidently her mothers sanction and all the rest were eager to help it on when the party had started to return they called to them and let them come behind together at the carriages they had what miss anderson called a new deal and alice and mavering found themselves together in the rear seat of the last  the fog began to come in from the sea and followed them through the woods when they emerged upon the highway it wrapped them densely round and formed a little world cosy intimate where they two dwelt alone with these friends of theirs each of whom they praised for delightful qualities the horses beat along through the mist in which there seemed no progress and they lived in a blissful arrest of time miss anderson called back from the front seat my ear buyns youre talkin about me  which ear cried mavering  oh the left of couyse  then its merely habit julie you ought to have heard the nice things we were saying about you alice called  id like to hear all the nice things youve been saying  this seemed the last effect of subtle wit mavering broke out in his laugh and alices laugh rang above it  mrs pasmer looked involuntarily round from the carriage ahead  they seem to be having a good time said mrs brinkley at her side  yes i hope alice isnt overdoing  im afraid youre dreadfully tired said mavering to the girl in a low voice as he lifted her from her place when they reached the hotel through the provisional darkness and found that after all it was only dinnertime  oh no i feel as if the picnic were just beginning  then you will come tonight  i will see what mamma says  shall i ask her  oh perhaps not said the girl repressing his ardour but not severely     xviii  they were going to have some theatricals at one of the cottages and the lady at whose house they were to be given made haste to invite all the picnic party before it dispersed mrs pasmer accepted with a mental reservation meaning to send an excuse later if she chose and before she decided the point she kept her husband from going after dinner into the readingroom where he spent nearly all his time over a paper and a cigar or in sitting absolutely silent and unoccupied and made him go to their own room with her  there is something that i must speak to you about she said closing the door and you must decide for yourself whether you wish to let it go any further  what go any further asked mr pasmer sitting down and putting his hand to the pocket that held his cigarcase with the same series of motions  no dont smoke she said staying his hand impatiently i want you to think  how can i think if i dont smoke  very well smoke then do you want this affair with young mavering to go any farther  oh said pasmer i thought you had been looking after that he had in fact relegated that to the company of the great questions exterior to his personal comfort which she always decided  i have been looking after it but now the time has come when you must as a father take some interest in it  pasmers noble mask of a face from the point of his full white beard to his fine forehead crossed by his impressive black eyebrows expressed all the dignified concern which a father ought to feel in such an affair but what he was really feeling was a grave reluctance to have to intervene in any way what do you want me to say to him he asked  why i dont know that hes going to ask you anything i dont know whether hes said anything to alice yet said mrs pasmer with some exasperation  her husband was silent but his silence insinuated a degree of wonder that she should approach him prematurely on such a point  they have been thrown together all day and there is no use to conceal from ourselves that they are very much taken with each other  i thought pasmer said that you said that from the beginning didnt you want them to be taken with each other  that is what you are to decide  pasmer silently refused to assume the responsibility  well demanded his wife after waiting for him to speak  well what  what do you decide  what is the use of deciding a thing when it is all over  it isnt over at all it can be broken off at any moment  well break it off then if you like  mrs pasmer resumed the responsibility with a sigh she felt the burden the penalty of power after having so long enjoyed its sweets and she would willingly have abdicated the sovereignty which she had spent her whole married life in establishing but there was no one to take it up no i shall not break it off she said resentfully i shall let it go on then seeing that her husband was not shaken by her threat from his longconfirmed subjection she added it isnt an ideal affair but i think it will be a very good thing for alice he is not what i expected but he is thoroughly nice and i should think his family was nice ive been talking with mr munt about them today and he confirms all that etta saintsbury said i dont think there can be any doubt of his intentions in coming here he isnt a particularly artless young man but hes been sufficiently frank about alice since hes been here her husband smoked on his father seems to have taken up the business from the artistic side and mr mavering wont be expected to enter into the commercial part at once if it wasnt for alice i dont believe he would think of the business for a moment he would study law of course its a little embarrassing to have her engaged at once before shes seen anything of society here but perhaps its all for the best after all the main thing is that she should be satisfied and i can see that shes only too much so yes shes very much taken with him and i dont wonder he is charming  it was not the first time that mrs pasmer had reasoned in this round but the utterance of her thoughts seemed to throw a new light on them and she took a courage from them that they did not always impart she arrived at the final opinion expressed with a throb of tenderness for the young fellow whom she believed eager to take her daughter from her and now for the first time she experienced a desolation in the prospect as if it were an accomplished fact she was morally a bundle of finesses but at the bottom of her heart her daughter was all the world to her she had made the girl her idol and if like some other heathen she had not always used her idol with the greatest deference if she had often expected the impossible from it and made it pay for her disappointment still she had never swerved from her worship of it she suddenly asked herself what if this young fellow so charming and so good should so wholly monopolise her child that she should no longer have any share in her what if alice who had so long formed her first care and chief object in life should contentedly lose herself in the love and care of another and both should ignore her right to her she answered herself with a pang that this might happen with any one alice married and that it would be no worse at the worst with dan mavering than with another while her husband remained impartially silent always keeping within the lines to which his wifes supremacy had driven him he felt safe there and was not to be easily coaxed out of them  mrs pasmer rose and left him with his perfect acquiescence and went into her daughters room she found alice there with a pretty evening dress laid out on her bed mrs pasmer was very fond of that dress and at the thought of alice in it her spirits rose again  oh are you going alice  why yes answered the girl didnt you accept  why yes mrs pasmer admitted but arent you tired  oh not in the least i feel as fresh as i did this morning dont you want me to go  oh yes certainly i want you to goif you think youll enjoy it  enjoy it why why shouldnt i enjoy it mamma  what are you thinking about its going to be the greatest kind of fun  but do you think you ought to look at everything simply as fun asked the mother with unwonted didacticism  how everything what are you thinking about mamma  oh nothing im so glad youre going to wear that dress  why of course its my best but what are you driving at mamma  mrs pasmer was really seeking in her daughter that comfort of a distinct volition which she had failed to find in her husband and she wished to assure herself of it more and more that she might share with some one the responsibility which he had refused any part in  nothing but im glad you wish so much to go the girl dropped her hands and stared you must have enjoyed yourself today she added as if that were an explanation  of course i enjoyed myself but what has that to do with my wanting to go tonight  oh nothing but i hope alice that there is one thing you have looked fully in the face  what thing faltered the girl and now showed herself unable to confront it by dropping her eyes  well whatever you may have heard or seen nobody else is in doubt about it what do you suppose has brought mr mavering here  i dont know the denial not only confessed that she did know but it informed her mother that all was as yet tacit between the young people  very well then i know said mrs pasmer and there is one thing that you must know before long alice  what she asked faintly  your own mind said her mother i dont ask you what it is and i shall wait till you tell me of course i shouldnt have let him stay here if i had objected  o mamma murmured the girl dyed with shame to have the facts so boldly touched but not probably too deeply displeased  yes and i know that he would never have thought of going into that business if he had not expectedhoped  mamma  and you ought to consider  oh dont dont dont implored the girl  thats all said her mother turning from alice who had hidden her face in her hands to inspect the costume on the bed she lifted one piece of it after another turned it over looked at it and laid it down you can never get such a dress in this country  she went out of the room as the girl dropped her face in the pillow an hour later they met equipped for the evenings pleasure to the keen glance that her mother gave her the daughters eyes had the brightness of eyes that have been weeping but they were also bright with that knowledge of her own mind which mrs pasmer had desired for her she met her mothers glance fearlessly even proudly and she carried her stylish costume with a splendour to which only occasions could stimulate her they dramatised a perfect unconsciousness to each other but mrs pasmer was by no means satisfied with the decision which she had read in her daughters looks somehow it did not relieve her of the responsibility and it did not change the nature of the case it was gratifying of course to see alice the object of a passion so sincere and so ardent so far the triumph was complete and there was really nothing objectionable in the young man and his circumstances though there was nothing very distinguished but the affair was altogether different from anything that mrs pasmer had imagined she had supposed and intended that alice should meet some one in boston and go through a course of society before reaching any decisive step there was to be a whole season in which to look the ground carefully over and the ground was to be all within certain wellascertained and guarded precincts but this that had happened was outside of these precincts of at least on their mere outskirts class day of course was all right and she could not say that the summer colony at campobello was not thoroughly and essentially boston and yet she felt that certain influences certain sanctions were absent to tell the truth she would not have cared for the feelings of maverings family in regard to the matter except as they might afterward concern alice and the time had not come when she could recognise their existence in regard to the affair and yet she could have wished that even as it was his family could have seen and approved it from the start it would have been more regular  with alice it was a simpler matter and of course deeper for her it was only a question of himself and herself no one else existed to the sublime egotism of her love she did not call it by that name she did not permit it to assert itself by any name it was a mere formless joy in her soul a trustful and blissful expectance which she now no more believed he could disappoint than that she could die within that hour all the rebellion that she had sometimes felt at the anomalous attitude exacted of her sex in regard to such matters was gone she no longer thought it strange that a girl should be expected to ignore the admiration of a young man till he explicitly declared it and should then be fully possessed of all the materials of a decision on the most momentous question in life for she knew that this state of ignorance could never really exist she had known from the first moment that he had thought her beautiful tonight she was radiant for him her eyes shone with the look in which they should meet and give themselves to each other before they spokethe look in which they had met already in which they had lived that whole day     xix  the evenings entertainment was something that must fail before an audience which was not very kind they were to present a burlesque of classic fable and the parts with their general intention had been distributed to the different actors but nothing had been written down and beyond the situations and a few points of dialogue all had to be improvised the costumes and properties had been invented from such things as came to hand sheets sculpturesquely draped the deities who took part a foxpelt from the hearth did duty as the leopard skin of bacchus a feather duster served neptune for a trident the lyre of apollo was a dustpan a gulls breast furnished jove with his grey beard  the fable was adapted to modern life and the scene had been laid in campobello the peculiarities of which were to be satirised throughout the principal situation was to be a passage between jupiter represented by mavering and juno whom miss anderson personated it was to be a scene of conjugal reproaches and reprisals and to end in reconciliation in which the father of the gods sacrificed himself on the altar of domestic peace by promising to bring his family to campobello every year  this was to be followed by a sketch of the judgment of paris in which juno and pallas were to be personated by two young men and miss anderson took the part of venus  the pretty drawingroom of the trevorsyoung people from albany and cousins of miss andersonwas curtained off at one end for a stage and beyond the sliding doors which divided it in half were set chairs for the spectators people had come in whatever dress they liked the men were mostly in morning coats the ladies had generally made some attempt at evening toilet but they joined in admiring alice pasmers costume and one of them said that they would let it represent them all and express what each might have done if she would there was not much time for their tributes all the lamps were presently taken away and set along the floor in front of the curtain as footlights leaving the company in a darkness which mrs brinkley pronounced sepulchral she made her reproaches to the master of the house who had effected this transposition of the lamps i was just thinking some very pretty and valuable things about your charming cottage mr trevor a rug on a bare floor a trim of varnished pine a wall with half a dozen simple etchings on it an open fire and a mantelpiece without bricabrac how entirely satisfying it all is and how it upbraids us for heaping up upholstery as we do in town  go on said the host those are beautiful thoughts  but i cant go on in the dark retorted mrs brinkley you cant think in the dark much less talk can you mrs pasmer mrs pasmer with alice next to her sat just in front of mrs brinkley  no she assented but if i couldyou can thick anywhere mrs brinkleymrs trevors lovely house would inspire me to it  two birds with one stonethank you mrs pasmer for my part of the compliment pick yourself up mr trevor  oh thank you im all right said trevor panting after the ladies meanings as a man must i suppose thinking and talking in the dark is a good deal like smoking in the dark  no thinking and talking are not at all like smoking under any conditions why in the world should they be  oh i cant get any fun out of a cigar unless i can see the smoke the host explained  do you follow him mrs pasmer  yes perfectly  thank you mrs pasmer said trevor  ill get you to tell me how you did it some time said mrs brinkley but your house is a gem mr trevor  isnt it cried trevor i want my wife to live here the year round it was the trevors first summer in their cottage and the experienced reader will easily recognise his mood but shes such a worldly spirit she wont  oh i dont know about the year round do you mrs pasmer  i should said alice with the suddenness of youth breaking into the talk which she had not been supposed to take any interest in  is it proper to kiss a young ladys hand said trevor gratefully appealing to mrs brinkley  it isnt very customary in the nineteenth century said mrs brinkley but you might kiss her fan he might kiss her fan mightnt he mrs pasmer  certainly alice hold out your fan instantly  the girl humoured the joke laughing  trevor pressed his lips to the perfumed sticks i will tell mrs trevor he said and that will decide her  it will decide her not to come here at all next year if you tell her all  he never tells me all said mrs trevor catching so much of the talk as she came in from some hospitable cares in the diningroom theyre incapable of it what has he been doing now  nothing or i will tell you when we are alone mrs trevor said mrs brinkley with burlesque sympathy we oughtnt to have a scene on both sides of the footlights  a boyish face all excitement was thrust out between the curtains forming the proscenium of the little theatre all ready mrs trevor  yes all ready jim  he dashed the curtains apart and marred the effect of his own disappearance from the scene by tripping over the long legs of jove stretched out to the front where he sat on mrs trevors richest rug propped with sofa cushions on either hand  so perish all the impious race of titans enemies of the gods said mavering solemnly as the boy fell sprawling pick the earthborn giant up vulcan my son  the boy was very small for his age every one saw that the accident had not been premeditated and when vulcan appeared with an exaggerated limp and carried the boy off a burst of laughter went up from the company  it did not matter what the play was to have been after that it all turned upon the accident juno came on and began to reproach jupiter for his carelessness ive sent mercury upstairs for the aynica but he says its no use that boy wont be able to pass ball for a week how often have i told you not to sit with your feet out that way i knew youd hurt somebody  i didnt have my feet out retorted jupiter besides he added with dignity and a burlesque of marital special pleading which every wife and husband recognised i always sit with my feet out so and i always will so long as ive the spirit of a god  isnt he delicious buzzed mrs pasmer leaning backward to whisper to mrs brinkley it was not that she thought what dan had just said was so very fanny but people are immoderately applausive of amateur dramatics and she was feeling very fond of the young fellow  the improvisation went wildly and adventurously on and the curtains dropped together amidst the facile acclaim of the audience  its very well for jupiter that he happened to think of the curtain said mrs brinkley they couldnt have kept it up at that level much longer  oh do you think so softly murmured mrs pasmer it seemed as if they could have kept it up all night if they liked  i doubt it mr trevor said mrs brinkley to the host who had come up for her congratulations do you always have such brilliant performances  well we have so far he answered modestly and mrs brinkley laughed with him this was the first entertainment at trevor cottage  sh went up all round them and mrs trevor called across the room in a reproachful whisper loud enough for every one to hear my dearenjoying yourself while mavering stood between the parted curtains waiting for the attention of the company  on account of an accident to the callboy and the mental exhaustion of some of the deities the next piece will be omitted and the performance will begin with the one after while the audience is waiting mercury will go round and take up a collection for the victim of the recent accident who will probably be indisposed for life the collector will be accompanied by a policeman and may be safely trusted  he disappeared behind the curtain with a pas and r swirl of his draperies like the lord chancellor in iolanthe and the audience again abandoned itself to applause  how very witty he is said miss cotton who sat near john munt dont you think hes really witty  yes munt assented critically but you should have known his father  oh do you know his father  i was in college with him  oh do tell me about him and all mr maverings family were so interested you know on account ofisnt it pretty to have that little love idyl going on here i wonderive been wondering all the timewhat she thinks of all this do you suppose she quite likes it his costume is so very remarkable miss cotton in the absence of any lady of her intimate circle was appealing confidentially to john munt  why do you think theres anything serious between them he asked dropping his head forward as people do in church when they wish to whisper to some one in the same pew  why yes it seems so murmured miss cotton his admiration is quite undisguised isnt it  a man never can tell said munt we have to leave those things to you ladies  oh every ones talking of it i assure you and you know his family  i knew his father once rather better than anybody else  indeed  yes munt sketched rather a flattered portrait of the elder mavering his ability his goodness his shyness which he had always had to make such a hard fight with munt was sensible of an access of popularity in knowing dan maverings people and he did not spare his colours  then it isnt from his father that he gets everything he isnt in the least shy said miss cotton  that must be the mother  and the mother  the mother i dont know  miss cotton sighed sometimes i wish that he did show a little more trepidation it would seem as if he were more alive to the great difference that there is between alice pasmer and other girls  munt laughed a mans laugh i guess hes pretty well alive to that if hes in love with her  oh in a certain way of course but not in the highest way now for instance if he felt all her fineness asas we do i dont believe hed be willing to appear before her just like that the father of the gods wore a damask tablecloth of a pale golden hue and a classic pattern his arms were bare and rather absurdly white on his feet a pair of lawntennis shoes had a very striking effect of sandals  it seems to me miss cotton pursued that if he really appreciated her in the highest way he would wish never to do an undignified or trivial thing in her presence  oh perhaps its that that pleases her in him they say were always taken with opposites  yesdo you think so asked miss cotton  the curtains were flung apart and the judgment of paris followed rather tamely upon what had gone before though the two young fellows who did juno and minerva were very amusing and the dialogue was full of hits some of the audience an appreciative minority were of opinion that mavering and miss anderson surpassed themselves in it she promised him the most beautiful and cultured wife in greece that settles it he answered they came out arm in arm and paris having put on a striped tennis coat over his shortsleeved greek tunic moved round among the company for their congratulations venus ostentatiously showing the apple she had won  i can haydly keep from eating it she explained to alice before whom she dropped maverings arm im awfully hungry its hayd woyk  alice stood with her head drawn back looking at the excited girl with a smile in which seemed to hover somewhere a latent bitterness  mavering with a flushed face and a flying tongue was exchanging sallies with her mother who smothered him in flatteries  mrs trevor came toward the group and announced supper mr paris will you take miss aphrodite out  miss anderson swept a low bow of renunciation and tacitly relinquished mavering to alice  oh no no said alice shrinking back from him with an intensification of her uncertain smile a mere mortal  oh how very good said mrs trevor  there began to be without any ones intending it that sort of tacit misunderstanding which is all the worse because it can only follow upon a tacit understanding like that which had established itself between alice and mavering they laughed and joked together gaily about all that went on they were perfectly good friends he saw that she and her mother were promptly served he brought them salad and icecream and coffee himself only waiting officially upon miss anderson first and alice thanked him with the politest deprecation of his devotion but if their eyes met it was defensively and the security between them was gone mavering vaguely felt the loss without knowing how to retrieve it and it made him go on more desperately with miss anderson he laughed and joked recklessly and alice began to mark a more explicit displeasure with her she made her mother go rather early  on her part miss anderson seemed to find reason for resentment in alices bearing toward her as if she had said to herself that her frank loyalty had been thrown away upon a cold and unresponsive nature and that her harmless follies in the play had been met with unjust suspicions she began to make reprisals she began in dead earnest to flirt with mavering before the evening passed she had made him seem taken with her but how justly she had done this and with how much fault of his no one could have said there were some who did not notice it at all but these were not people who knew mavering or knew alice very well     xx  the next morning alice was walking slowly along the road toward the fishing village when she heard rapid plunging strides down the wooded hillside on her right she knew them for maverings and she did not affect surprise when he made a final leap into the road and shortened his pace beside her  may i join you miss pasmer  i am only going down to the herringhouses she began  and youll let me go with you said the young fellow the fact isyoure always so frank that you make everything else seem sillyive been waiting up there in the woods for you to come by mrs pasmer told me you had started this way and i cut across lots to overtake you and then when you came in sight i had to let you pass before i could screw my courage up to the point of running after you how is that for openmindedness  its a very good beginning i should think  well dont you think you ought to say now that youre sorry you were so formidable  am i so formidable she asked and then recognised that she had been trapped into a leading question  you are to me because i would like always to be sure that i had pleased you and for the last twelve hours ive only been able to make sure that i hadnt thats the consolation im going away with i thought id get you to confirm my impression explicitly thats why i wished to join you  are youwere you going away  im going by the next boat whats the use of staying i should only make bad worse yesterday i hoped but last night spoiled everything miss pasmer he broke out with a rush of feeling you must know why i came up here to campobello  his steps took him a little ahead of her and he could look back into her face as he spoke but apparently he saw nothing in it to give him courage to go on for he stopped and then continued lightly and im going away because i feel that ive made a failure of the expedition i knew that you were supremely disgusted with me last night but it will be a sort of comfort if youll tell me so  oh said alice everybody thought it was very brilliant im sure  and you thought it was a piece of buffoonery well it was i wish youd say so miss pasmer though i didnt mean the playing entirely it would be something to start from and i want to make a beginningturn over a new leaf cant you help me to inscribe a good resolution of the most ironclad description on the stainless page ive lain awake all night composing one wouldnt you like to hear it  i cant see what good that would do she said with some relenting toward a smile in which he instantly prepared himself to bask  but you will when ive done it now listen  please dont go on she cut him short with a return to her severity which he would not recognise  well perhaps id better not he consented its rather a long resolution and i dont know that ive committed it perfectly yet but i do assure you that if you were disgusted last night you were not the only one i was immensely disgusted myself and why i wanted you to tell me so was because when i have a strong pressure brought to bear i can brace up and do almost anything he said dropping into earnest then he rose lightly again and added you have no idea how unpleasant it is to lie awake all night throwing dust in the eyes of an accusing conscience  it must have been if you didnt succeed said alice drily  yes thats itthats just the point if id succeeded i should be all right dont you see but it was a difficult case she turned her face away but he saw the smile on her cheek and he laughed as if this were what he had been trying to make her do i got beaten i had to give up and own it i had to say that i had thrown my chance away and i had better take myself off he looked at her with a real anxiety in his gay eyes  the boat goes just after lunch i believe she said indifferently  oh yes i shall have time to get lunch before i go he said with bitterness but lunch isnt the only thing it isnt even the main thing miss pasmer  no she hardened her heart  he waited for her to say something more and then he went on the question is whether theres time to undo last night abolish it erase it from the calendar of recorded timesponge it out in shortand get back to yesterday afternoon she made no reply to this dont you think it was a very pleasant picnic miss pasmer he asked with pensive respectfulness  very she answered drily  he cast a glance at the woods that bordered the road on either side that weird foresti shall never forget it  no it was something to remember she said  and the blueberry patch we mustnt forget the blueberry patch  there were a great many blueberries  she walked on and he said and that bridgeyou dont have that feeling of having been here before  no  am i walking too fast for you miss pasmer  no i like to walk fast  but wouldnt you like to sit down on this wayside log for example he pointed it out with his stick it seems to invite repose and i know you must be tired  im not tired  ah that shows that you didnt lie awake grieving over your follies all night i hope you rested well miss pasmer she said nothing if i thoughtif i could hope that you hadnt it would be a bond of sympathy and i would give almost anything for a bond of sympathy just now miss pasmer alice he said with sudden seriousness i know that im not worthy even to think of you and that youre whole worlds above me in every way its that that takes all heart out of me and leaves me without a word to say when id like to say so much i would like to speaktell you  she interrupted him i wish to speak to you mr mavering and tell you thatim very tired and im going back to the hotel i must ask you to let me go back alone  alice i love you  im sorry you said itsorry sorry  why he asked with hopeless futility  because there can be no love between usnot friendship evennot acquaintance  i shouldnt have asked for your acquaintance your friendship if his words conveyed a delicate reproach and they stung her because they put her in the wrong  no matter she began wildly i didnt mean to wound you but we must part and we must never see each other again  he stood confused as if he could not make it out or believe it but yesterday  its today now  ah no its last night and i can explain  no she cried you shall not make me out so mean and vindictive i dont care for last night nor for anything that happened this was not true but it seemed so to her at the moment she thought that she really no longer resented his association with miss anderson and his separation from herself in all that had taken place  then what is it  i cant tell you but everything is over between usthats all  but yesterdayand all these days pastyou seemed  its unfair of you to insistits ungenerous ungentlemanly  that word which from a womans tongue always strikes a man like a blow in the face silenced mavering he set his lips and bowed and they parted she turned upon her way and he kept the path which she had been going  it was not the hour when the piazzas were very full and she slipped into the dim hotel corridor undetected or at least undetained she flung into her room and confronted her mother  mrs pasmer was there looking into a trunk that had overflowed from her own chamber what is the matter she said to her daughters excited face  mr mavering  well  and i refused him  mrs pasmer was one of those ladies who in any finality have a keen retrovision of all the advantages of a different conclusion she had been thinking since she told dan mavering which way alice had gone to walk that if he were to speak to her now and she were to accept him it would involve a great many embarrassing consequences but she had consoled herself with the probability that he would not speak so soon after the effects of last night but would only try at the furthest to make his peace with alice since he had spoken though and she had refused him mrs pasmer instantly saw all the pleasant things that would have followed in another event refused him she repeated provisionally while she gathered herself for a full exploration of all the facts  yes mamma and i cant talk about it i wish never to hear his name again or to see him or to speak to him  why of course not said mrs pasmer with a fine smile from the vantageground of her superior years if youve refused him she left the trunk which she had been standing over and sat down while alice swept to and fro before her excitedly but why did you refuse him my dear  why because hes detestableperfectly ignoble  her mother probably knew how to translate these exalted expressions into the more accurate language of maturer life do you mean last night  last night cried alice tragically no why should i care for last night  then i dont understand what you mean retorted mrs pasmer what did he say she demanded with authority  mamma i cant talk about iti wont  but you must alice its your duty of course i must know about it what did he say  alice walked up and down the room with her lips firmly closedlike maverings lips it occurred to her and then she opened them but without speaking  what did he say persisted her mother and her persistence had its effect  say exclaimed the girl indignantly he tried to make me say  i see said mrs pasmer well  but i forced him to speak and theni rejected him thats all  poor fellow said mrs pasmer he was afraid of you  and thats what made it the more odious do you think i wished him to be afraid of me would that be any pleasure i should hate myself if i had to quell anybody into being unlike themselves she sat down for a moment and then jumped up again and went to the window for no reason and came back  yes said her mother impartially hes light and hes roundabout he couldnt come straight at anything  and would you have me accept such abeing  mrs pasmer smiled a little at the literary word and continued but hes very sweet and hes as good as the days long and hes very fond of you andi thought you liked him  the girl threw up her arms across her eyes oh how can you say such a thing mamma  she dropped into a chair at the bedside and let her face fall into her hands and cried  her mother waited for the gust of tears to pass before she said but if you feel so about it  mamma alice sprang to her feet  it neednt come from you i could make some excuse to see himwrite him a little note  never exclaimed alice grandly what ive done ive done from my reason and my feelings have nothing to do with it  oh very well said her mother going out of the room not wholly disappointed with what she viewed as a respite and amused by her daughters tragics but if you think that the feelings have nothing to do with such a matter youre very much mistaken if she believed that her daughter did not know her real motives in rejecting dan mavering or had not been able to give them she did not say so  the little group of aliceolaters on the piazza who began to canvass the causes of maverings going before the top of his hat disappeared below the bank on the path leading to the ferryboat were of two minds one faction held that he was going because alice had refused him and that his gaiety up to the last moment was only a mask to hide his despair the other side contended that if he and alice were not actually engaged they understood each other and he was going away because he wanted to tell his family or something of that kind between the two opinions miss cotton wavered with a sentimental attraction to either what do you really think she asked mrs brinkley arriving from lunch at the corner of the piazza where the group was seated  oh what does it matter at their age she demanded  but theyre just of the age when it does happen to matter suggested mrs stamwell  yes said mrs brinkley and thats what makes the whole thing so perfectly ridiculous just think of two children one of twenty and the other of twentythree proposing to decide their lifelong destiny in such a vital matter should we trust their judgment in regard to the smallest business affair of course not theyre babes in arms morally and mentally speaking people havent the data for being wisely in love till theyve reached the age when they havent the least wish to be so oh i suppose i thought that i was a grown woman too when i was twenty i can look back and see that i did and whats more preposterous still i thought mr brinkley was a man at twentyfour but we were no more fit to accept or reject each other at that infantile period  do you really think so asked miss cotton only partially credulous of mrs brinkleys irony  yes it does seem out of all reason admitted mrs stamwell  of course it is said mrs brinkley if she has rejected him shes done a very safe thing nobody should be allowed to marry before fifty then if people married it would be because they knew that they loved each other  miss cotton reflected a moment it is strange that such an important question should have to be decided at an age when the judgment is so far from mature i never happened to look at it in that light before  yes said mrs brinkleyand she made herself comfortable in an arm chair commanding a stretch of the bay over which the ferryboat must passbut its only part and parcel of the whole affair im sure that no grown person can see the ridiculous young thingsinexperienced ignorant featherbrainedthat nature intrusts with children their immortal little souls and their extremely perishable little bodies without rebelling at the whole system when you see what most young mothers are how perfectly unfit and incapable you wonder that the whole race doesnt teeth and die yes theres one thing i feel pretty sure ofthat as matters are arranged now there oughtnt to be mothers at all there ought to be only grandmothers  the group all laughed even miss cotton but she was the first to become grave at the bottom of her heart there was a doubt whether so light a way of treating serious things was not a little wicked  perhaps she said we shall have to go back to the idea that engagements and marriages are not intended to be regulated by the judgment but by the affections  i dont know whats intended said mrs brinkley but i know what is in ninetynine cases out of a hundred the affections have it their own way and i must say i dont think the judgment could make a greater mess of it in fact she continued perhaps provoked to the excess by the deprecation she saw in miss cottons eye i consider every broken engagement nowadays a blessing in disguise  miss cotton said nothing the other ladies said why mrs brinkley  yes the thing has gone altogether too far the pendulum has swung in that direction out of all measure we are married too much and as a natural consequence we are divorced too much the whole case is in a nutshell if there were no marriages there would be no divorces and that great abuse would be corrected at any rate  all the ladies laughed miss cotton more and more sorrowfully she liked to have people talk as they do in genteel novels mrs brinkleys bold expressions were a series of violent shocks to her nature and imparted a terrible vibration to the fabric of her whole little rosecoloured ideal world if they had not been the expressions of a person whom a great many unquestionable persons accepted who had such an undoubted standing she would have thought them very coarse as it was they had a great fascination for her but in a case like that ofshe looked round and lowered her voiceour young friends im sure you couldnt rejoice if the engagement were broken off  well im not going to be a mush of concession as emerson says miss cotton and in the first place how do you know theyre engaged  ah i dont i didnt mean that they were but wouldnt it be a little pathetic if after all that weve seen going on his coming here expressly on her account and his perfect devotion to her for the past two weeks it should end in nothing  two weeks isnt a very long time to settle the business of a lifetime  no  perhaps shes proposed delay a little further acquaintance  oh of course that would be perfectly right do you think she did  not if shes as wise as the rest of us would have been at her age but i think she ought  yes said miss cotton semiinterrogatively  do you think his behaviour last night would naturally impress her with his wisdom and constancy  no i cant say that it would but  and this alice of yours is rather a severe young person she has her ideas and im afraid theyre rather heroic shed be just with him of course but theres nothing a man dreads so much as justicesome men  yes pursued miss cotton but that very disparityi know theyre very unlikedont you think  oh yes i know the theory about that but if they were exactly alike in temperament theyd be sufficiently unlike for the purposes of counterparts that was arranged once for all when male and female created he them ive no doubt their fancy was caught by all the kinds of difference they find in each other thats just as natural as its silly but the misunderstanding the trouble the quarrelling the wear and tear of spirit that theyd have to go through before they assimilatedit makes me tired as the boys say no i hope for the young mans own sake hes got his conge  but hes so kind so good  my dear the world is surfeited with kind good men there are half a dozen of them at the other end of the piazza smoking and there comes another to join them she added as a large figure semicircular in profile advanced itself from a doorway toward a vacant chair among the smokers the very soul of kindness and goodness she beckoned toward her husband who caught sight of her gesture now i can tell you all his mental processes first surprise at seeing some one beckoning then astonishment that its i though who else should beckon himthen wonder what i can want then conjecture that i may want him to come here then pride in his conjecture rebellion compliance  the ladies were in a scream of laughter as mr brinkley lumbered heavily to their group  what is it he asked  do you believe in broken engagements now quickoffhand  whos engaged  no matter  well you know punchs advice to those about to marry  i knowchestnuts said his wife scornfully they dismissed each other with tender bluntness and he went in to get a match  ah mrs brinkley said one of the ladies it would be of no use for you to preach broken engagements to any one who saw you and mr brinkley together they fell upon her one after another and mocked her with the difference between her doctrine and practice and they were all the more against her because they had been perhaps a little put down by her whimsical sayings  yes she admitted but weve been thirty years coming to the understanding that you all admire so much and do you think it was worth the time     xxi  mavering kept up until he took leave of the party of young people who had come over on the ferryboat to eastport for the frolic of seeing him off it was a tremendous tour de force to accept their company as if he were glad of it and to respond to all their gay nothings gaily to maintain a sunny surface on his turbid misery they had tried to make alice come with them but her mother pleaded a bad headache for her and he had to parry a hundred sallies about her and from his sick heart humour the popular insinuation that there was an understanding between them and that they had agreed together she should not come he had to stand about on the steamboat wharf and listen to amiable innuendoes for nearly an hour before the steamer came in from st john the fond adieux of his friends their offers to take any message back lasted during the interminable fifteen minutes that she lay at her moorings and then he showed himself at the stern of the boat and waved his handkerchief in acknowledgment of the last parting salutations on shore  when it was all over he went down into his stateroom and shut himself in and let his misery rollover him he felt as if there were a flood of it and it washed him to and fro one gall of shame of selfaccusal of bitterness from head to foot but in it all he felt no resentment toward alice no wish to wreak any smallest part of his suffering upon her even while he had hoped for her love it seemed to him that he had not seen her in all that perfection which she now had in irreparable loss his soul bowed itself fondly over the thought of her and stung as he was by that last cruel word of hers he could not upbraid her that humility which is love casting out selfishness the most egotistic of the passions triumphing over itselfmavering experienced it to the full he took all the blame he could not see that she had ever encouraged him to hope for her love which now appeared a treasure heavenfar beyond his scope he could only call himself fool and fool and fool and wonder that he could have met her in the remoteness of that morning with the belief that but for the follies of last night she might have answered him differently he believed now that whatever had gone before she must still have rejected him she had treated his presumption very leniently she had really spared him  it went on over and over sometimes it varied a little as when he thought of how when she should tell her mother mrs pasmer must laugh he pictured them both laughing at him and then mr pasmerhe had scarcely passed a dozen words with himcoming in and asking what they were laughing at and their saying and his laughing too  at other times he figured them as incensed at his temerity which must seem to them greater and greater as now it seemed to him he had never thought meanly of himself and the world so far had seemed to think well of him but because alice pasmer was impossible to him he felt that it was an unpardonable boldness in him to have dreamed of her what must they be saying of his having passed from the ground of society compliments and light flirtation to actually telling alice that he loved her  he wondered what mrs pasmer had thought of his telling her that he had come to campobello to consider the question whether he should study law or go into business and what motive she had supposed he had in telling her that he asked himself what motive he had and tried to pretend that he had none he dramatised conversations with mrs pasmer in which he laughed it off  he tried to remember all that had passed the day before at the picnic and whether alice had done or said anything to encourage him and he could not find that she had all her trust and freedom was because she felt perfectly safe with him from any such disgusting absurdity as he had been guilty of the ride home through the mist with its sweet intimacy that parting which had seemed so full of tender intelligence were parts of the same illusion there had been nothing of it on her side from the beginning but a kindliness which he had now flung away for ever  he went back to the beginning and tried to remember the point where he had started in this fatal labyrinth of error she had never misled him but he had misled himself from the first glimpse of her  whatever was best in his light nature whatever was generous and selfdenying came out in this humiliation from the vision of her derision he passed to a picture of her suffering from pity for him and wrung with a sense of the pain she had given him he promised himself to write to her and beg her not to care for him because he was not worthy of that he framed a letter in his mind in which he posed in some noble attitudes and brought tears into his eyes by his magnanimous appeal to her not to suffer for the sake of one so unworthy of her serious thought he pictured her greatly moved by some of the phrases and he composed for her a reply which led to another letter from him and so to a correspondence and a long and tender friendship in the end he died suddenly and then she discovered that she had always loved him he discovered that he was playing the fool again and he rose from the berth where he had tumbled himself the stateroom had that smell of parboiled paint which staterooms have and reminded him of the steamer in which he had gone to europe when a boy with the family just after his mothers health began to fail  he went down on the deck near the ladies saloon where the secondclass passengers were gathered listening to the same band of plantation negroes who had amused him so much on the eastward trip the passengers were mostly pock marked provincials and many of them were women they lounged on the barrels of apples neatly piled up and listened to the music without smiling one of the negroes was singing to the banjo and another began to do the rheumatic uncles breakdown mavering said to himself i cant stand that oh what a fool i am alice i love you o merciful heavens o infernal jackass ow gaw  at the bow of the boat he found a gang of italian labourers returning to the states after some job in the provinces they smoked their pipes and whined their neapolitan dialect together it made mavering think of dante of the inferno to which he passed naturally from his selfdenunciation for having been an infernal jackass the inscription on the gate of hell ran through his mind he thought he would make his lifehis desolate broken lifea perpetual exile like dantes at the same time he ground his teeth and muttered oh what a fool i am oh idiot beast oh oh the pipes reminded him to smoke and he took out his cigarette case the italians looked at him he gave all the cigarettes among them without keeping any for himself he determined to spend the miserable remnant of his life in going about doing good and bestowing alms  he groaned aloud so that the italians noticed it and doubtless spoke of it among themselves he could not understand their dialect but he feigned them saying respectfully compassionate things then he gnashed his teeth again and cursed his folly when the bell rang for supper he found himself very hungry and ate heavily after that he went out in front of the cabin and walked up and down thinking and trying not to think the turmoil in his mind tired him like a prodigious physical exertion  toward ten oclock the night grew rougher the sea was so phosphorescent that it broke in sheets and flakes of pale bluish flame from the bows and wheelhouses and out in the dark the waves revealed themselves in flashes and long gleams of fire one of the officers of the boat came and hung with mavering over the guard the weird light from the water was reflected on their faces and showed them to each other  well i never saw anything like this before looks like hell dont it said the officer  yes said mavering is it uncommon  well i should say so i guess were going to have a picnic  mavering thought of blueberries but he did not say anything  i guess its going to be a regular circus  mavering did not care he asked incuriously how do you find your course in such weather  well we guess where we are and then give her so many turns of the wheel the officer laughed and mavering laughed too he was struck by the hollow note in his laugh it seemed to him pathetic he wondered if he should now always laugh so and if people would remark it he tried another laugh it sounded mechanical  he went to bed and was so worn out that he fell asleep and began to dream a face came up out of the sea and brooded over the waters as in that picture of vedders which he calls memory but the hair was not blond it was the colour of those phosphorescent flames and the eyes were like it horrible horrible he tried to shriek but he cried alice i love you there was a burglar in the room and he was running after miss pasmer mavering caught him and tried to beat him his fists fell like bolls of cotton the burglar drew his breath in with a long washing sound like water  mavering woke deathly sick and heard the sweep of the waves the boat was pitching frightfully he struggled out into the saloon and saw that it was five oclock in five hours more it would be a day since he told alice that he loved her it now seemed very improbable there were a good many halfdressed people in the saloon and a woman came running out of her stateroom straight to mavering she was in her stocking feet and her hair hung down her back  oh are we going down she implored him have we struck oughtnt we to praysomebody shall i wake the children  mavering reassured her and told her there was no danger  well then she said ill go back for my shoes  yes better get your shoes  the saloon rose round him and sank he controlled his sickness by planting a chair in the centre and sitting in it with his eyes shut as he grew more comfortable he reflected how he had calmed that woman and he resolved again to spend his life in doing good yes thats the only ticket he said to himself with involuntary frivolity he thought of what the officer had said and he helplessly added circus ticketreserved seat then he began again and loaded himself with execration  the boat got into portland at nine oclock and mavering left her taking his handbag with him and letting his trunk go on to boston  the officer who received his ticket at the gangplank noticed the destination on it and said got enough  yes for one while mavering recognised his acquaintance of the night before  dont like picnics very much  no said mavering with abysmal gloom they dont agree with me never did he was aware of trying to make his laugh bitter the officer did not notice  mavering was surprised after the chill of the storm at sea to find it rather a warm close morning in portland the restaurant to which the hackman took him as the best in town was full of flies they bit him awake out of the dreary reveries he fell into while waiting for his breakfast in a mirror opposite he saw his face it did not look haggard it looked very much as it always did he fancied playing a part through lifehiding a broken heart under a smile o you incorrigible ass he said to himself and was afraid he had said it to the young lady who brought him his breakfast and looked haughtily at him from under her bang she was very thin and wore a black jersey  he tried to find out whether he had spoken aloud by addressing her pleasantly its pretty cold this morning  what say  pretty cool  oh yes but its pretty cloose she replied in her yankee cantillation she went away and left him to the bacon and eggs he had ordered at random there was a fly under one of the slices of bacon and mavering confined himself to the coffee  a man came up in a white cap and jacket from a basement in the front of the restaurant where confectionery was sold and threw down a mass of malleable candy on a marble slab and began to work it mavering watched him thinking fuzzily all the time of alice and holding long fatiguing dialogues with the people at the tynycoed whose several voices he heard  he said to himself that it was worse than yesterday he wondered if it would go on getting worse every day  he saw a man pass the door of the restaurant who looked exactly like boardman as he glanced in the resemblance was explained by the mans coming back and proving to be really boardman     xxii  mavering sprang at him with a demand for the reason of his being there  i thought it was you as i passed said boardman but i couldnt make sureso dark back here  and i thought it was you but i couldnt believe it said mavering with equal force cutting short an interior conversation with mr pasmer which had begun to hold itself since his first glimpse of boardman  i came down here to do a sort of onehorse yacht race today boardman explained  going to be a yacht race better have some breakfast or better nothere flies under your bacon  rough on the flies said boardman snapping the bell which summoned the spectre in the black jersey and he sat down what are you doing in portland  mavering told him and then boardman asked him how he had left the pasmers mavering needed no other hint to speak and he spoke fully while boardman listened with an agreeable silence letting the hero of the tale break into selfscornful groans and doleful laughs and ease his heart with grotesque inarticulate noises and made little or no comments  by the time his breakfast came boardman was ready to say i didnt suppose it was so much of a mash  i didnt either said mavering when i left boston of course i knew i was going down there to see her but when i got there it kept going on just like anything else up to the last moment i didnt realise till it came to the worst that i had become a mere pulp  well you wont stay so said boardman making the first vain attempt at consolation he lifted the steak he had ordered and peered beneath it all right this time any way  i dont know what you mean by staying so replied mavering with gloomy rejection of the comfort offered  youll see that its all for the best that youre well out of it if she could throw you over after leading you on  but she didnt lead me on exclaimed mavering dont you understand that it was all my mistake from the first if i hadnt been perfectly besotted i should have seen that she was only tolerating me dont you see why hang it boardman i must have had a kind of consciousness of it under my thickskinned conceit after all for when i came to the pointwhen i did come to the pointi hadnt the sand to stick to it like a man and i tried to get her to help me yes i can see that i did now i kept fooling about and fooling about and it was because i had that sort of prescienceof whatever you call itthat i was mistaken about it from the very beginning  he wished to tell boardman about the events of the night before but he could not he said to himself that he did not care about their being hardly to his credit but he did not choose to let alice seem to have resented anything in them it belittled her and claimed too much for him so boardman had to proceed upon a partial knowledge of the facts  i dont suppose that boomerang way of yours if thats what you mean was of much use he said  use it ruined me but what are you going to do how are you going to presuppose that a girl like miss pasmer is interested in an idiot like you i mean me of course mavering broke off with a dolorous laugh and if you cant presuppose it what are you going to do when it comes to the point youve got to shillyshally and then youve got to go it blind i tell you its a leap in the dark  well then if youve got yourself to blame  how am i to blame i should like to know retorted mavering rejecting the first offer from another of the censure which he had been heaping upon himself the irritation of his nerves spoke i did speak out at lastwhen it was too late well let it all go he groaned aimlessly i dont care but she isnt to blame i dont think i could admire anybody very much who admired me no sir she did just right i was a fool and she couldnt have treated me differently  oh i guess itll come out all right said boardman abandoning himself to mere optimism  how come all right demanded mavering flattered by the hope he refused its come right now ive got my deserts thats all  oh no you havent what harm have you done its all right for you to think small beer of yourself and i dont see how you could think anything else just at present but you wait awhile when did it happen  mavering took out his watch one day one hour twenty minutes and fifteen seconds ago  sure about the seconds i suppose you didnt hang round a great while afterward  well people dont generally said mavering with scorn  never tried it said boardman looking critically at his fried potatoes before venturing upon them if you had stayed perhaps she might have changed her mind he added as if encouraged to this hopeful view by the result of his scrutiny  where did you get your fraudulent reputation for commonsense boardman retorted mavering who had followed his examination of the potatoes with involuntary interest she wont change her mind she isnt one of that kind but shes the one woman in this world who could have made a man of me boardman  is that so asked boardman lightly well she is a goodlooking girl  shes divine  what a dress that was she had on class day  i never think what she has on she makes everything perfect and then makes you forget it  shes got style theres no mistake about that  style sighed mavering but he attempted no exemplification  shes awfully graceful what a walk shes got  oh dont dont boardman all thats true and all thats nothingnothing to her goodness shes so good boardman well i give it up shes religious you wouldnt think that may be you cant imagine a pretty girl religious and shes all the more intoxicating when shes serious and when shes forgotten your whole worthless existence shes ten thousand times more fascinating than and other girl when shes going right for you theres a kind of look comes into her eyeskind of absence rapture dont you knowwhen shes serious that brings your heart right into your mouth she makes you think of some of those picturesi want to tell you what she said the other day at a picnic when we were off getting blueberries and youll understand that she isnt like other girlsthat she has a soul fall ofofyou know what boardman she has high thoughts about everything i dont believe shes ever had a mean or ignoble impulseshe couldnt have in the business of imparting his ideas confidentially mavering had drawn himself across the table toward boardman without heed to what was on it  look out youll be into my steak first thing you know  oh confound your steak cried mavering pushing the dish away what difference does it make ive lost her anyway  i dont believe youve lost her said boardman  whats the reason you dont retorted mavering with contempt  because if shes the serious kind of a girl you say she is she wouldnt let you come up there and dangle round a whole fortnight without letting you know she didnt like it unless she did like it now you just go a little into detail  mavering was quite willing he went so much into detail that he left nothing to boardmans imagination he lost the sense of its calamitous close in recounting the facts of his story at campobello he smiled and blushed and laughed in telling certain things he described miss anderson and imitated her voice he drew heads of some of the ladies on the margin of a newspaper and the tears came into his eyes when he repeated the cruel words which alice had used at their last meeting  oh well you must brace up said boardman ive got to go now she didnt mean it of course  mean what  that you were ungentlemanly women dont know half the time how hard theyre hitting  i guess she meant that she didnt want me anyway said mavering gloomily  ah i dont know about that youd better ask her the next time you see her goodbye he had risen and he offered his hand to mavering who was still seated  why ive half a mind to go with you  all right come along but i thought you might be going right on to boston  no ill wait and go on with you how do you go to the race  in the press boat  any women  no we dont send them on this sort of duty  that settles it i have got all i want of that particular sex for the time being mavering wore a very bitter air as he said this it seemed to him that he would always be cynical he rose and arranged to leave his bag with the restaurateur who put it under the counter and then he went out with his friend  the sun had come out and the fog was burning away there was life and lift in the air which the rejected lover could not refuse to feel and he said looking round and up and down the animated street i guess youre going to have a good day for it  the pavement was pretty well filled with women who had begun shopping carriages were standing beside the pavement a lady crossed the pavement from a shop door toward a coupe just in front of them with her hand full of light packages she dropped one of them and mavering sprang forward instinctively and picked it up for her  oh thank you she said with the deep gratitude which society cultivates for the smallest services then she lifted her drooped eyelashes and with a flash of surprise exclaimed mr mavering and dropped all her packages that she might shake hands with him  boardman sauntered slowly on but saw with a backward glance mavering carrying the ladys packages to the coupe for her saw him lift his hat there and shake hands with somebody in the coupe and then stand talking beside it he waited at the corner of the block for mavering to come up affecting an interest in the neckwear of a furnishers window  in about five minutes mavering joined him  look here boardman those ladies have snagged onto me  are there two of them  yes one inside and they want me to go with then to see the race their fathers got a little steamyacht they want you to go too  boardman shook his head  well thats what i told themtold them that you had to go on the press boat they said they wished they were going on the press boat too but i dont see how i can refuse theyre ladies that i met class day and i ought to have shown them a little more attention then but i got so taken up with  i see said boardman showing his teeth fine and even as grains of popcorn in a slight sarcastic smile sort of poetical justice he suggested  well it issort of said mavering with a shamefaced consciousness what train are you going back on  seven oclock  ill be there  he hurried back to rejoin the ladies and boardman saw him after some parley and laughter get into the coupe from which he inferred that they had turned down the little seat in front and made him take it and he inferred that they must be very jolly sociable girls  he did not see mavering again till the train was on its way when he came in looking distraughtly about for his friend he was again very melancholy and said dejectedly that they had made him stay to dinner and had then driven him down to the station bag and all the old gentleman came too i was in hopes id find you hanging round somewhere so that i could introduce you theyre awfully nice none of that infernal boston stiffness the one you saw me talking with is married though  boardman was writing out his report from a little book with shorthand notes in it there were half a dozen other reporters in the car busy with their work a man who seemed to be in authority said to one of them try to throw in a little humour  mavering pulled his hat over his eyes and leaned his head on the back of his seat and tried to sleep     xxiii  at his fathers agency in boston he found the next morning a letter from him saying that he expected to be down that day and asking dan to meet him at the parker house for dinner the letter intimated the elder maverings expectation that his son had reached some conclusion in the matter they had talked of before he left for campobello  it gave dan a shiver of selfdisgust and a sick feeling of hopelessness he was quite willing now to do whatever his father wished but he did not see haw he could face him and own his defeat  when they met his father did not seem to notice his despondency and he asked him nothing about the pasmers of course that would not have been the american way nothing had been said between the father and son as to the special advantages of campobello for the decision of the question pending when they saw each other last but the son knew that the father guessed why he chose that island for the purpose and now the elder knew that if the younger had anything to tell him he would tell it and if he had not he would keep it it was tacitly understood that there was no objection on the fathers part to miss pasmer in fact there had been a glimmer of humorous intelligence in his eye when the son said he thought he should run down to bar harbour and perhaps to campobello but he had said nothing to betray his consciousness  they met in the readingroom at parkers and dan said hello father and his father answered well dan and they shyly touched the hands dropped at their sides as they pressed together in the crowd the father gave his boy a keen glance and then took the lead into the diningroom where he chose a corner table and they disposed of their hats on the windowseat  all well at home asked the young fellow as he took up the bill of fare to order the dinner his father hated that and always made him do it  yes yes as usual i believe minnie is off for a week at the mountains eunice is at home  oh how would you like some green goose with applesauce sweetpotatoes and succotash  it seems to me that was pretty good the last time all right if you like it  i dont know that i care for anything much im a little off my feed no soup he said looking up at the waiter bending over him and then he gave the order i think you may bring me half a dozen blue points if theyre good he called after him  didnt bar harbour agree with youor campobello asked mr mavering taking the opening offered him  no not very well said dan and he said no more about it leaving his father to make his own inferences as to the kind or degree of the disagreement  well have you made up your mind asked the father resting his elbows on either side of his plate and putting his hands together softly while he looked across them with a cheery kindness at his boy  yes i have said dan slowly  well  i dont believe i care to go into the law  sure  yes  well thats all right then i wished you to choose freely and i suppose youve done so  oh yes  i think youve chosen wisely and im very glad its a weight off my mind i think youll be happier in the business than you would in the law i think youll enjoy it you neednt look forward to a great deal of ponkwasset falls unless you like  i shouldnt mind going there said dan listlessly  it wont be necessaryat first in fact it wont be desirable i want you to look up the business at this end a little  dan gave a start in boston  yes it isnt in the shape i want to have it i propose to open a place of our own and to put you in charge something in the young mans face expressed reluctance and his father asked kindly would that be distasteful to you  oh no it isnt the thing i object to but i dont know that i care to be in boston he lifted his face and looked his father full in the eyes but with a gaze that refused to convey anything definite then the father knew that the boys love affair had gone seriously wrong  the waiter came with the dinner and made an interruption in which they could be naturally silent when he had put the dinner before them and cumbered them with superfluous service after the fashion of his kind he withdrew a little way and left them to resume their talk  well said the elder lightly as if dans not caring to be in boston had no particular significance for him i dont know that i care to have you settle down to it immediately i rather think id like to have you look about first a little go to new york go to philadelphia and see their processes there we cant afford to get oldfashioned in our ways ive always been more interested by the aesthetic side of the business but you ought to have a taste for the mechanism from your grandfather your mother has it  oh yes sir i think all thats very interesting said dan  well go to france and see how those fellows do it go to london and look up william morris  yes that would be very nice admitted the young fellow beginning to catch on but i didnt supposei didnt expect to begin life with a picnic he entered upon his sentence with a jocular buoyancy but at the last word which he fatally drifted upon his voice fell he said to himself that he was greatly changed that he should never be gay and bright again there would always be this undercurrent of sadness he had noticed the undercurrent yesterday when he was laughing and joking with those girls at portland  oh i dont want you to buckle down at once said his father smiling if youd decided upon the law i should have felt that youd better not lose time but as youre going into the business i dont mind your taking a year off it wont be lost time if you keep your eyes open i think youd better go down into italy and spain look up the old tapestries and stamped leathers you may get some ideas how would you like it  firstrate i should like it said dan rising on the waft of his fathers suggestion but gloomily lapsing again still it was pleasing to picture himself going about through europe with a broken heart and he did not deny himself the consolation of the vision  well theres nobody to dislike it said his father cheerily he was sure now that dan had been jilted otherwise he would have put forth some objection to a scheme which must interrupt his lovemaking theres no reason why with our resources we shouldnt take the lead in this business  he went on to speak more fully of his plans and dan listened with a nether reference of it all to alice but still with a surface intelligence on which nothing was lost  are you going home with me tomorrow asked his father as they rose from the table  well perhaps not tomorrow ive got some of my things to put together in cambridge yet and perhaps id better look after them but ive a notion id better spend the winter at home and get an idea of the manufacture before i go abroad i might sail in january they say its a good month  yes theres sense in that said his father  and perhaps i wont break up in cambridge till ive been to new york and philadelphia what do you think its easier striking them from here  i dont know but youre right said his father easily  they had come out of the diningroom and dan stopped to get some cigarettes in the office he looked mechanically at the theatre bills over the cigar case i see irvings at the boston  oh you dont say said his father lets go and see him  if you wish it sir said dan with pensive acquiescence all the maverings were fond of the theatre and made any mood the occasion or the pretext of going to the play if they were sad they went if they were gay they went as long as dans mother could get outofdoors she used to have herself carried to a box in the theatre whenever she was in town now that she no longer left her room she had a dominant passion for hearing about actors and acting it was almost a work of piety in her husband and children to see them and report to her  his father left him the next afternoon and dan who had spent the day with him looking into business for the first time with a running accompaniment of alice in all the details remained to uninterrupted misery he spent the evening in his room too wretched even for the theatre it is true that he tried to find boardman but boardman was again off on some newspaper duty and after trying at several houses in the hope which he knew was vain of finding any one in town yet he shut himself up with his thoughts they did not differ from the thoughts of the night before and the night before that but they were calmer and they portended more distinctly a life of selfabnegation and solitude from that time forth he tested his feelings and found that it was not hurt vanity that he was suffering from it was really wounded affection he did not resent alices cruelty he wished that she might be happy he could endure to see her happy  he wrote a letter to the married one of the two ladies he had spent the day with in portland and thanked them for making pass pleasantly a day which he would not otherwise have known how to get through he let a soft mysterious melancholy pervade his letter he hinted darkly at trouble and sorrow of which he could not definitely speak he had the good sense to tear his letter up when he had finished it and to send a short sprightly note instead saying that if mrs frobisher and her sister came to boston at the end of the month as they had spoken of doing they must be sure to let him know upon the impulse given him by this letter he went more cheerfully to bed and fell instantly asleep  during the next three weeks he bent himself faithfully to the schemes of work his father had outlined for him he visited new york and philadelphia and looked into the business and the processes there and he returned to ponkwasset falls to report and compare his facts intelligently with those which he now examined in his fathers manufactory for the first time he began to understand how his father who was a man of intellectual and artistic interests should be fond of the work  he spent a good deal of time with his mother and read to her and got upon better terms with her than they usually were they were very much alike and she objected to him that he was too light and frivolous he sat with his sisters and took an interest in their pursuits he drove them about with his fathers sorrels and resumed something of the old relations with them which the selfish years of his college life had broken off as yet he could not speak of campobello or of what had happened there and his mother and sisters whatever they thought made no more allusion to it than his father had done  they mercifully took it for granted that matters must have gone wrong there or else he would speak about them for there had been some gay banter among them concerning the objects of his expedition before he left home they had heard of the heroine of his class day and they had their doubts of her such as girls have of their brothers heroines they were not inconsolably sorry to have her prove unkind and their mother found in the probable event another proof of their fathers total want of discernment where women were concerned for the elder mavering had come home from class day about as much smitten with this mysterious miss pasmer as dan was she talked it over indignantly with her daughters they were glad of dans escape but they were incensed with the girl who could let him escape and they inculpated her in a high degree of heartless flirtation they knew how sweet dan was and they believed him most sincere and good he had been brilliantly popular in college and he was as bright as he could be what was it she chose not to like in him they vexed themselves with asking how or in what way she thought herself better they would not have had her love dan but they were hot against her for not loving him  they did not question him but they tried in every way to find out how much he was hurt and they watched him in every word and look for signs of change to better or worse with a growing belief that he was not very much hurt  it could not be said that in three weeks he forgot alice or had begun to forget her but he had begun to reconcile himself to his fate as people do in their bereavements by death his consciousness habituated itself to the facts as something irretrievable he no longer framed in his mind situations in which the past was restored he knew that he should never love again but he had moments and more and more of them in which he experienced that life had objects besides love there were times when he tingled with all the anguish of the first moment of his rejection when he stopped in whatever he was doing or stood stockstill as a man does when arrested by a physical pang breathless waiting there were other times when he went about steeped in gloom so black that all the world darkened with it and some mornings when he woke he wished that the night had lasted for ever and felt as if the daylight had uncovered his misery and his shame to every one he never knew when he should have these moods and he thought he should have them as long as he lived he thought this would be something rather fine he had still other moods in which he saw an old man with a grey moustache like colonel newcome meeting a beautiful whitehaired lady the man had never married and he had not seen this lady for fifty years he bent over and kissed her hand  you idiot said mavering to himself throughout he kept a good appetite in fact after that first morning in portland he had been hungry three times a day with perfect regularity he lost the idea of being sick he had not even a furred tongue he fell asleep pretty early and he slept through the night without a break he had to laugh a great deal with his mother and sisters since he could not very well mope without expecting them to ask why and he did not wish to say why but there were some laughs which he really enjoyed with the yankee foreman of the works who was a droll after a common american pattern and said things that were killingly funny especially about women of whom his opinions were sarcastic  dan mavering suffered but not solidly his suffering was short and crossed with many gleams of respite and even joy his disappointment made him really unhappy but not wholly so it was a genuine sorrow but a sorrow to which he began to resign himself even in the monotony of ponkwasset falls and which admitted the thought of mrs frobishers sister by the time business called him to boston     xxiv  before the end of the first week after dan came back to town that which was likely to happen whenever chance brought him and alice together had taken place  it was one of the soft days that fall in late october when the impending winter seems stayed and the warm breath of the land draws seaward and over a thousand miles of indian summer the bloom came and went in quick pulses over the girls temples as she sat with her head thrown back in the corner of the car and from moment to moment she stirred slightly as if some stress of rapture made it hard for her to get her breath a little gleam of light fell from under her fallen eyelids into the eyes of the young man beside her who leaned forward slightly and slanted his face upward to meet her glances they said some words now and then indistinguishable to the others in speaking they smiled slightly sometimes her hand wavered across her lap in both their faces there was something beyond happinessa transport a passion the brief splendour of a supreme moment  they left the car at the arlington street corner of the public garden and followed the winding paths diagonally to the further corner on charles street  how stupid we were to get into that ridiculous horsecar she said what in the world possessed us to do it  i cant imagine he answered what a waste of time it was if we had walked we might have been twice as long coming and now youre going to send me off so soon  i dont send you she murmured  but you want me to go  oh no but youd better  i cant do anything against your wish  i wish itfor your own good  ah do let me go home with you alice  dont ask it or i must say yes  part of the way then  no not a step you must take the first car for cambridge what time is it now  you can see by the clock on the providence depot  but i wish you to go by your watch now look  alice he cried in pure rapture  look  its a quarter of one  and weve been three hours together already now you must simply fly if you came home with me i should be sure to let you come in and if i dont see mamma alone first i shall die cant you understand  no but i can do the next best thing i can misunderstand you want to be rid of me  shall you be rid of me when weve parted she asked with an inner thrill of earnestness in her gay tone  alice  you know i didnt mean it dan  say it again  what  dan  dan love dan dearest  will that car of yours never come ive promised myself not to leave you till it does and if i stay here any longer i shall go wild i cant believe its happened say it again  say what  that  that i love you that were engaged  i dont believe it i cant she looked impatiently up the street oh there comes your car run stop it  i dont run to stop cars he made a sign which the conductor obeyed and the car halted at the further crossing  she seemed to have forgotten it and made no movement to dismiss him oh doesnt it seem too good to be standing here talking in this way and people think its about the weather or society she set her head a little on one side and twirled the open parasol on her shoulder  yes it does tell me its true love  its true how splendid you are she said it with an effect for the world outside of saying it was a lovely day  he retorted with the same apparent nonchalance how beautiful you are how good how divine  the conductor seeing himself apparently forgotten gave his bell a vicious snap and his car jolted away  she started nervously there youve lost your car dan  have i asked mavering without troubling himself to look after it  she laughed now with a faint suggestion of unwillingness in her laugh what are you going to do  walk home with you  no indeed you know i cant let you  and are you going to leave me here alone on the street corner to be run over by the first bicycle that comes along  you can sit down in the garden and wait for the next car  no i would rather go back to the art museum and make a fresh start  to the art museum she murmured tenderly  yes wouldnt you like to see it again  again i should like to pass my whole life in it  well walk back with me a little way theres no hurry about the car  dan she said in a helpless compliance and they paced very very slowly along the beacon street path in the garden this is ridiculous  yes but its delightful  yes thats what i meant do you suppose any one everever  made love there before  how can you say such things yes i always supposed it would besomewhere else  it was somewhere elseonce  oh i meantthe second time  then you did think there was going to be a second time  how do i know i wished it do you like me to say that  i wish you would never say anything else  yes there cant be any harm in it now i thought that if you had everliked me you would still  so did i but i couldnt believe that you  oh i could  alice  dont you like my confessing it you asked me to  like it  how silly we are  not half so silly as weve been for the last two months i think weve just come to our senses at least i have  two months she sighed has it really been so long as that  two years two centuries it was back in the dark ages when you refused me  dark ages i should think so but dont say refused it wasnt refusing exactly  what was it then  oh i dont know dont speak of it now  but alice why did you refuse me  oh i dont know you mustnt ask me now ill tell you some time  well come to think of it said mavering laughing it all lightly away theres no hurry tell me why you accepted me today  ii couldnt help it when i saw you i wanted to fall at your feet  what an idea i didnt want to fall at yours i was awfully mad i shouldnt have spoken to you if you hadnt stopped me and held out your hand  really did you really hate me dan  well i havent exactly doted on you since we last met  she did not seem offended at this yes i suppose so and ive gone on being fonder and fonder of you every minute since that day i wanted to call you back when you had got halfway to eastport  i wouldnt have come its bad luck to turn back  she laughed at his drolling how funny you are now im of rather a gloomy temperament did you know it  you dont look it  oh but i am just now im rather excited andhappy  so glad  go on go on i like you to make fun of me  the benches on either side were filled with nursemaids in charge of babycarriages and of young children who were digging in the sand with their little beach shovels and playing their games back and forth across the walk unrebuked by the indulgent policemen a number of them had enclosed a square in the middle of the path with four of the benches which they made believe was a fort the lovers had to walk round it and the children chasing one another dashed into them headlong or backing off from pursuit bumped up against them they did not seem to know it but walked slowly on without noticing they were not aware of an occasional benchful of rather shabby young fellows who stared hard at the stylish girl and welldressed young man talking together in such intense low tones with rapid interchange of radiant glances  oh as to making fun of you i was going to say mavering began and after a pause he broke off with a laugh i forget what i was going to say  try to remember  i cant  how strange that we should have both happened to go to the museum this morning she sighed then dan she broke in do you suppose that heaven is any different from this  i hope notif im to go there  hush dear you mustnt talk so  why you provoked me to it  did i did i really do you think i tempted you to do it then i must be wicked whether i knew i was doing it or not yes  the break in her voice made him look more keenly at her and he saw the tears glimmer in her eyes alice  no im not good enough for you i always said that  then dont say it any more thats the only thing i wont let you say  do you forbid it really wont you let me even think it  no not even think it  how lovely you are oh i like to be commanded by you  do you youll have lots of fun then im an awfully commanding spirit  i didnt suppose you were so humorousalways im afraid you wont like me ive no sense of fun  and im a little too funny sometimes im afraid  no you never are when  that night at the trevors you didnt like it  i thought miss anderson was rather ridiculous said alice i dont like buffoonery in women  nor i in men said mavering smiling ive dropped it  well now we must part i must go home at once said alice its perfectly insane  oh no not yet not till weve said something else not till weve changed the subject  what subject  miss anderson  alice laughed and blushed but she was not vexed she liked to have him understand her well now she said as if that were the next thing im going to cross here at once and walk up the other pavement and you must go back through the garden or else i shall never get away from you  may i look over at you  you may glance but you neednt expect me to return your glance  oh no  and i want you to take the very first cambridge car that comes along i command you to  i thought you wanted me to do the commanding  so i doin essentials if you command me not to cry when i get home i wont  she looked at him with an ecstasy of selfsacrifice in her eyes  ah i shant do that i cant tell what would open butalice  well what she drifted closely to him and looked fondly up into his face in walking they had insensibly drawn nearer together and she had been obliged constantly to put space between them now standing at the corner of arlington street and looking tentatively across beacon she abandoned all precautions  what i forget oh yes i love you  but you said that before dearest  yes but just now it struck me as a very novel idea what if your mother shouldnt like the idea  nonsense you know she perfectly idolises you she did from the first and doesnt she know how ive begin behaving about you ever since ilost you  how have you behaved do tell me alice  some time not now she said and with something that was like a gasp and threatened to be a sob she suddenly whipped across the road he walked back to charles street by the garden path keeping abreast of her and not losing sight of her for a moment except when the bulk of a string team watering at the trough beside the pavement intervened he hurried by and when he had passed it he found himself exactly abreast of her again her face was turned toward him they exchanged a smile lost in space at the corner of charles street he deliberately crossed over to her  o dearest love why did you come she implored  because you signed to me  i hoped you wouldnt see it if were both to be so weak as this what are we going to do  but im glad you came yes i was frightened they must have overheard us there when we were talking  well i didnt say anything im ashamed of besides i shouldnt care much for the opinion of those nurses and babies  of course not but people must have seen us dont stand here talking dan do come on she hurried him across the street and walked him swiftly up the incline of beacon street there in her new fall suit with him glossyhatted faultlessly gloved at a fit distance from her side she felt more in keeping with the social frame of things than in the garden path which was really only a shade better than the beacon street mall of the common do you suppose anybody saw us that knew us  i hope so dont you want people to know it  yes of course they will have to know itin the right way can you believe that its only half a year since we met it wont be a year till class day  i dont believe it alice i cant recollect anything before i knew you  well now as time is so confused we must try to live for eternity we must try to help each other to be good oh when i think what a happy girl i am i feel that i should be the most ungrateful person under the sun not to be good lets try to make our lives perfectperfect they can be and we mustnt live for each other alone we must try to do good as well as be good we must be kind and forbearing with every one  he answered with tender seriousness my lifes in your hands alice it shall be whatever you wish  they were both silent in their deep belief of this when they spoke again she began gaily i shall never get over the wonder of it how strange that we should meet at the museum they had both said this already but that did not matter they had said nearly everything two or three times how did you happen to be there she asked and the question was so novel that she added i havent asked you before  he stopped with a look of dismay that broke up in a hopeless laugh why i went there to meet some peoplesome ladies and when i saw you i forgot all about them  alice laughed to this was a part of their joy their triumph  who are they she asked indifferently and only to heighten the absurdity by realising the persons  you dont know them he said mrs frobisher and her sister of portland i promised to meet them there and go out to cambridge with them  what will they think asked alice its too amusing  theyll think i didnt come said mavering with the easy conscience of youth and love and again they laughed at the ridiculous position together i remember now i was to be at the door and they were to take me up in their carriage i wonder how long they waited you put everything else out of my head  do you think ill keep it out she asked archly  oh yes there is nothing else but you now  the eyes that she dropped after a glance at him glistened with tears  a lump came into his throat do you suppose he asked huskily that we can ever misunderstand each other again  never i see everything clearly now we shall trust each other implicitly and at the least thing that isnt clear we can speak promise me that youll speak  i will alice but after this all will be clear we shall deal with each other as we do with ourselves  yes that will be the way  and we mustnt wait for question from each other we shall knowwe shall feelwhen theres any misgiving and then the one thats caused it will speak  yes she sighed emphatically how perfectly you say it but thats because you feel it because you are good  they walked on treading the air in a transport of fondness for each other suddenly he stopped  miss pasmer i feel it my duty to warn you that youre letting me go home with you  am i how noble of you to tell me dan for i know you dont want to tell well i might as well but i shant let you come in you wont try will you promise me you wont try  i shall only want to come in the first door  what for  what for oh for half a second  she turned away her face  he went on this engagement has been such a very public affair so far that i think id like to see my fiancee alone for a moment  i dont know what in the world you can have to say more  he went into the first door with her and then he went with her upstairs to the door of mrs pasmers apartment the passages of the cavendish were not well lighted the little lane or alley that led down to this door from the stairs landing was very dim  so dark here murmured alice in a low voice somewhat tremulous  but not too dark     xxv  she burst into the room where her mother sat looking over some housekeeping accounts his kiss and his name were upon her lips her soul was full of him  mamma she panted  her mother did not look round she could have had no premonition of the vital news that her daughter was bringing and she went on comparing the first autumn months provision bill with that of the last spring month and trying to account for the difference  the silence broken by the rattling of the two bills in her mothers hands as she glanced from one to the other through her glasses seemed suddenly impenetrable and the prismatic world of the girls rapture burst like a bubble against it there is no explanation of the effect outside of temperament and overwrought sensibilities she stared across the room at her mother who had not heard her and then she broke into a storm of tears  alice cried her mother with that sanative anger which comes to rescue women from the terror of any sudden shock what is the matter with youwhat do you mean she dropped both of the provision bills to the floor and started toward her daughter  nothingnothing let me go i want to go to my room she tried to reach the door beyond her mother  indeed you shall not cried mrs pasmer i will not have you behaving so what has happened to you tell me you have frightened me half out of my senses  the girl gave up her efforts to escape and flung herself on the sofa with her face in the pillow where she continued to sob her mother began to relent at the sight of her passion as a woman and as a mother she knew her daughter and she knew that this passion whatever it was must have vent before there could be anything intelligible between them she did not press her with further question but set about making her a little more comfortable on the sofa she pulled the pillow straight and dropped a light shawl over the girls shoulders so that she should not take cold  then mrs pasmer had made up her mind that alice had met mavering somewhere and that this outburst was the retarded effect of seeing him during the last six weeks she had assisted at many phases of feeling in regard to him and knew more clearly than alice herself the meaning of them all she had been patient and kind with the resources that every woman finds in herself when it is the question of a daughters ordeal in an affair of the heart which she has favoured  the storm passed as quickly as it came and alice sat upright casting off the wraps but once checked with the fact on her tongue she found it hard to utter it  what is it alicewhat is it urged her mother  nothing imr maveringwe meti met him at the museum andwere engaged its really so it seems like raving but its true he came with me to the door i wouldnt let him come in dont you believe it oh we are indeed we are are you glad mamma you know i couldnt have lived without him  she trembled on the verge of another outbreak  mrs pasmer sacrificed her astonishment in the interest of sanity and returned quietly glad alice you know that i think hes the sweetest and best fellow in the world  o mamma  but are you sure  yes yes im not crazy it isnt a dream he was thereand i met himi couldnt run awayi put out my hand i couldnt help iti thought i should give way and he took it and thenthen we were engaged i dont know what we said i went in to look at the joan of arc again and there was no one else there he seemed to feel just as i did i dont know whether either of us spoke but we knew we were engaged and we began to talk  mrs pasmer began to laugh to her irreverent soul only the droll side of the statement appeared  dont mamma pleaded alice piteously  no no i wont but i hope dan mavering will be a little more definite about it when im allowed to see him why couldnt he have come in with you  it would have killed me i couldnt let him see me cry and i knew i should break down  hell have to see you cry a great many times alice said her mother with almost unexampled seriousness  yes but not yetnot so soon he must think im very gloomy and i want to be always bright and cheerful with him he knows why i wouldnt let him come in he knew i was going to have a cry  mrs pasmer continued to laugh  dont mamma pleaded alice  no i wont replied her mother as before i suppose he was mystified but now if its really settled between you hell be coming here soon to see your papa and me  yestonight  well its very sudden said mrs pasmer though i suppose these things always seem so  is it too sudden asked alice with misgiving it seemed so to me when it was going on but i couldnt stop it  her mother laughed at her simplicity no when it begins once nothing can stop it but youve really known each other a good while and for the last six weeks at least youve known you own mind about him pretty clearly its a pity you couldnt have known it before  yes thats what he says he says it was such a waste of time oh everything he says is perfectly fascinating  her mother laughed and laughed again  what is it mamma are you laughing at me  oh no what an idea  he couldnt seem to understand why i didnt say yes the first time if i meant it she looked down dreamily at her hands in her lap and then she said with a blush and a start theyre very queer dont you think  who  young men  oh very  yes alice went on musingly their minds are so different everything they say and do is so unexpected and yet it seems to be just right  mrs pasmer asked herself if this singlemindedness was to go on for ever but she had not the heart to treat it with her natural levity probably it was what charmed mavering with the child mrs pasmer had the firm belief that mavering was not singleminded and she respected him for it she would not spoil her daughters perfect trust and hope by any of the cynical suggestions of her own dark wisdom but entered into her mood as such women are able to do and flattered out of her every detail of the mornings history this was a feat which mrs pasmer enjoyed for its own sake and it fully satisfied the curiosity which she naturally felt to know all she did not comment upon many of the particulars she opened her eyes a little at the notion of her daughter sitting for two or three hours and talking with a young man in the galleries of the museum and she asked if anybody they knew had come in when she heard that there were only strangers and very few of them she said nothing and she had the same consolation in regard to the walking back and forth in the garden she was so full of potential escapades herself so apt to let herself go at times that the fact of alices innocent selfforgetfulness rather satisfied a need of her mothers nature she exulted in it when she learned that there were only nurses and children in the garden  and so you think you wont take up art this winter she said when in the process of her crossexamination alice had left the sofa and got as far as the door with her hat in her hand and her sacque on her arm  no  and the sisters of st jamesyou wont join them either  the girl escaped from the room  alice alice her mother called after her she came back you havent told me how he happened to be there  oh that was the most amusing part of it he had gone there to keep an appointment with two ladies from portland they were to take him up in their carriage and drive out to cambridge and when he saw me he forgot all about them  and what became of them  we dont know isnt it ridiculous  if it appeared other or more than this to mrs pasmer she did not say she merely said after a moment well it was certainly devoted alice and let her go     xxvi  mavering came in the evening rather excessively well dressed and with a hot face and cold hands while he waited nominally alone in the little drawing room for mr pasmer alice flew in upon him for a swift embrace which prolonged itself till the fathers step was heard outside the door and then she still had time to vanish by another the affair was so nicely adjusted that if mavering had been in his usual mind he might have fancied the connivance of mrs pasmer  he did not say what he had meant to say to alices father but it seemed to serve the purpose for he emerged presently from the sound of his own voice unnaturally clamorous and found mr pasmer saying some very civil things to him about his character and disposition so far as they had been able to observe it and their belief and trust in him there seemed to be something provisional or probational intended but dan could not make out what it was and finally it proved of no practical effect he merely inferred that the approval of his family was respectfully expected and he hastened to say oh thats all right sir mr pasmer went on with more civilities and lost himself in dumb conjecture as to whether maverings father had been in the class before him or the class after him in harvard he used his black eyebrows a good deal during the interview and mavering conceived an awe of him greater than he had felt at campobello yet not unmixed with the affection in which the newly accepted lover embraces even the relations of his betrothed from time to time mr pasmer looked about with the vague glance of a man unused to being so long left to his own guidance and one of these appeals seemed at last to bring mrs pasmer through the door to the relief of both the men for they had improvidently despatched their business and were getting out of talk mr pasmer had in fact already asked dan about the weather outside when his wife appeared  dan did not know whether he ought to kiss her or not but mrs pasmer did not in the abstract seem like a very kissing kind of person and he let himself be guided by this impression in the absence of any fixed principle applying to the case she made some neat remark concerning the probable settlement of the affair with her husband and began to laugh and joke about it in a manner that was very welcome to dan it did not seem to him that it ought to be treated so solemnly  but though mrs pasmer laughed and joked he was aware of her meaning businessbusiness in the nicest sort of a way but business after all and he liked her for it he was glad to be explicit about his hopes and plans and told what his circumstances were so fully that mrs pasmer whom his frankness gratified and amused felt obliged to say that she had not meant to ask so much about his affairs and he must excuse her if she had seemed to do so she had her own belief that mavering would understand but she did not mind that she said that of course till his own family had been consulted it must not be considered seriouslythat mr pasmer insisted upon that point and when dan vehemently asserted the acquiescence of his family beforehand and urged his fathers admiration for alice in proof she reminded him that his mother was to be considered and put mr pasmers scruples forward as her own reason for obduracy in her husbands presence she attributed to him with his silent assent all sorts of reluctances and delicate compunctions she gave him the importance which would have been naturally a husbands due in such an affair and ingratiated herself more and more with the young man she ignored mr pasmers withdrawal when it took place after a certain lapse of time and as the moment had come for that she began to let herself go she especially approved of the idea of going abroad and confessed her disappointment with her present experiment of america where it appeared there was no leisure class of men sufficiently large to satisfy the social needs of mr pasmers nature and she told dan that he might expect them in europe before long perhaps they might all three meet him there at this he betrayed so clearly that he now intended his going to europe merely as a sequel to his marrying alice while he affected to fall in with all mrs pasmer said that she grew fonder than ever of him for his ardour and his futile duplicity if it had been in dans mind to take part in the rite mrs pasmer was quite ready at this point to embrace him with motherly tenderness her tough little heart was really in her throat with sympathy when she made an errand for the photograph of an english vicarage which they had hired the summer of the year before and she sent alice back with it alone  it seemed so long since they had met that the change in alice did not strike him as strange or as too rapidly operated they met with the fervour natural after such a separation and she did not so much assume as resume possession of him it was charming to have her do it to have her act as if they had always been engaged to have her try to press down the cowlick that started capriciously across his crown and to straighten his necktie and then to drop beside him on the sofa it thrilled and awed him and he silently worshipped the superior composure which her sex has in such matters whatever was the provisional interpretation which her father and mother pretended to put upon the affair she apparently had no reservations and they talked of their future as a thing assured the dark ages as they agreed to call the period of despair for ever closed that morning had matured their love till now it was a rapture of pure trust they talked as if nothing could prevent its fulfilment and they did not even affect to consider the question of his familys liking it or not liking it she said that she thought his father was delightful and he told her that his father had taken the greatest fancy to her at the beginning and knew that dan was in love with her she asked him about his mother and she said just what he could have wished her to say about his mothers sufferings and the way she bore them they talked about alices going to see her  of course your father will bring your sisters to see me first  is that the way he asked you may depend upon his doing the right thing whatever it is  well thats the right thing she said ive thought it out and that reminds me of a duty of ours dan  a duty he repeated with a note of reluctance for its untimeliness  yes cant you think what  no i didnt know there was a duty left in the world  its full of them  oh dont say that alice he did not like this mood so well as that of the morning but his dislike was only a vague discomfortnothing formulated or distinct  yes she persisted and we must do them you must go to those ladies you disappointed so this morning and apologiseexplain  dan laughed why it wasnt such a very ironclad engagement as all that alice they said they were going to drive out to cambridge over the milldam and i said i was going out there to get some of my traps together and they could pick me up at the art museum if they liked besides how could i explain  she laughed consciously with him of course but she added ruefully i wish you hadnt disappointed them  oh theyll get over it if i hadnt disappointed them i shouldnt be here and i shouldnt like that should you  no but i wish it hadnt happened its a blot and i didnt want a blot on this day  oh well it isnt very much of a blot and i can easily wipe it off ill tell you what alice i can write to mrs frobisher when our engagement comes out and tell her how it was shell enjoy the joke and so will miss wrayne theyre jolly and easygoing they wont mind  how long have you known them  i met them on class day and then i saw themthe day after i left campobello dan laughed a little  how saw them  well i went to a yacht race with them i happened to meet them in the street and they wanted me to go and i was all broken up andi went  oh said alice the day after iyou left campobello  wellyes  and i was thinking of you all that day asand i couldnt bear to look at anybody that day or speak  well the fact is ii was distracted and i didnt know what i was doing i was desperate i didnt care  how did you find out about the yacht race  boardman told me boardman was there  did he know the ladies did he go too  no he was there to report the race for the events he went on the press boat  oh said alice was there a large party  no no not very just ourselves in fact they were awfully kind and they made me go home to dinner with them  they must have been rather peculiar people said alice and i dont see howso soon she could not realise that mavering was then a rejected man on whom she had voluntarily renounced all claim a retroactive resentment which she could not control possessed her with the wish to punish those bold women for being agreeable to one who had since become everything to her though then he was ostensibly nothing  in a vague way dan felt her displeasure with that passage of his history but no man could have fully imagined it  i couldnt tell half the time what i was saying or eating i talked at random and ate at random i guess they thought something was wrong they asked me who was at campobello  indeed  but you may be sure i didnt give myself away i was awfully broken up he concluded inconsequently  she liked his being broken up but she did not like the rest she would not press the question further now she only said rather gravely if its such a short acquaintance can you write to them in that familiar way  oh yes mrs frobisher is one of that kind  alice was silent a moment before she said i think youd better not write let it go she sighed  yes thats what i think said dan better let it go i guess it will explain itself in the course of time but i dont want any blots around he leaned over and looked her smilingly in the face  oh no she murmured and then suddenly she caught him round the neck crying and sobbing its onlybecause i wanted it to beperfect oh i wonder if ive done right perhaps i oughtnt to have taken you after all but i do love youdearly dearly and i was so unhappy when id lost you and now im afraid i shall be a trial to younothing but a trial  the first tears that a young man sees a woman shed for love of him are inexpressibly sweeter than her smiles dan choked with tender pride and pity when he found his voice he raved out with incoherent endearments that she only made him more and more happy by her wish to have the affair perfect and that he wished her always to be exacting with him for that would give him a chance to do something for her and all that he desired as long as he lived was to do just what she wished  at the end of his vows and entreaties she lifted her face radiantly and bent a smile upon him as sunny as that with which the sky after a summer storm denies that there has ever been rain in the world  ah you he could say no more he could not be more enraptured than he was he could only pass from surprise to surprise from delight to delight it was her love of him which wrought these miracles it was all a miracle and no part more wonderful than another that she who had seemed as distant as a star and divinely sacred from human touch should be there in his arms with her head on his shoulder where his kiss could reach her lips not only unforbidden but eagerly welcome was impossible and yet it was true but it was no more impossible and no truer than that a being so poised so perfectly selfcentred as she should already be so helplessly dependent upon him for her happiness in the depths of his soul he invoked awful penalties upon himself if ever he should betray her trust if ever he should grieve that tender heart in the slightest thing if from that moment he did not make his whole life a sacrifice and an expiation  he uttered some of these exalted thoughts and they did not seem to appear crazy to her she said yes they must make their separate lives offerings to each other and their joint lives an offering to god the tears came into his eyes at these words of hers they were so beautiful and holy and wise he agreed that one ought always to go to church and that now he should never miss a service he owned that he had been culpable in the past he drew her closer to himif that were possibleand sealed his words with a kiss  but he could not realise his happiness then or afterward when he walked the streets under the thinly misted moon of that indian summer night  he went down to the events office when he left alice and found boardman and told him that he was engaged and tried to work boardman up to some sense of the greatness of the fact boardman shoved his fine white teeth under his spare moustache and made acceptable jokes but he did not ask indiscreet questions and dans statement of the fact did not seem to give it any more verity than it had before he tried to get boardman to come and walk with him and talk it over but boardman said he had just been detailed to go and work up the case of a chinaman who had suicided a little earlier in the evening  very well then ill go with you said mavering how can you live in such a den as this he asked looking about the little room before boardman turned down his incandescent electric there isnt anything big enough to hold me but all outdoors  in the street he linked his arm through his friends and said he felt that he had a right to know all about the happy ending of the affair since he had been told of that miserable phase of it at portland but when he came to the facts he found himself unable to give them with the fulness he had promised he only imparted a succinct statement as to the where and when of the whole matter leaving the how of it untold  the sketch was apparently enough for boardman for all comment he reminded mavering that he had told him at portland it would come out all right  yes you did boardman thats a fact said dan and he conceived a higher respect for the penetration of boardman than he had before  they stopped at a door in a poor court which they had somehow reached without maverings privity will you come in asked boardman  what for  chinaman  chinaman then mavering remembered good heavens no what have i got to do with him  both mortal suggested the reporter  the absurdity of this idea though a little grisly struck dan as a good joke he hit the companionable boardman on the shoulder and then gave him a little hug and remounted his path of air and walked off in it     xxvii  mavering first woke in the morning with the mechanical recurrence of that shame and grief which each day had brought him since alice refused him then with a leap of the heart came the recollection of all that had happened yesterday yet lurking within his rapture was a mystery of regret a reasonless sense of loss as if the old feeling had been something he would have kept then this faded and he had only the longing to see her to realise in her presence and with her help the fact that she was his an unspeakable pride filled him and a joy in her love he tried to see some outward vision of his bliss in the glass but like the mirror which had refused to interpret his tragedy in the portland restaurant it gave back no image of his transport his face looked as it always did and he and the refection laughed at each other  he asked himself how soon he could go and see her it was now seven oclock eight would be too early of courseit would be ridiculous and ninehe wondered if he might go to see her at nine would they have done breakfast had he any right to call before ten he was miserable at the thought of waiting till ten it would be three hours he thought of pretextsof inviting her to go somewhere but that was absurd for he could see her at home all day if he liked of carrying her a book but there could be no such haste about a book of going to ask if he had left his cane but why should he be in such a hurry for his cane all at once he thought he could take her some flowersa bouquet to lay beside her plate at breakfast he dramatised himself charging the servant who should take it from him at the door not to say who left it but alice would know of course and they would all know it would be very pretty he made mrs pasmer say some flattering things of him and he made alice blush deliciously to hear them he could not manage mr pasmer very well and he left him out of the scene he imagined him shaving in another room then he remembered his wearing a full beard  he dressed himself as quickly as he could and went down into the hotel vestibule where he had noticed people selling flowers the evening before but there was no one there with them now and none of the florists shops on the street were open yet he could not find anything till he went to the providence depot and the man there had to take some of his yesterdays flowers out of the refrigerator where he kept them he was not sure they would be very fresh but the heavy rosebuds had fallen open and they were superb dan took all there were and when they had been sprinkled with water and wrapped in cotton batting and tied round with paper it was still only quarter of eight and he left them with the man till he could get his breakfast at the depot restaurant there it had a consoling effect of not being so early many people were already breakfasting and when dan said with his order hurry it up please he knew that he was taken for a passenger just arrived or departing by a fantastic impulse he ordered eggs and bacon again he felt it a fine derision of the past and a seal of triumph upon the present to have the same breakfast after his acceptance as he had ordered after his rejection he would tell alice about it and it would amuse her he imagined how he would say it and she would laugh but she would be full of a ravishing compassion for his past suffering they were long bringing the breakfast when it came he despatched it so quickly that it was only half after eight when he paid his check at the counter he tried to be five minutes more getting his flowers but the man had them all ready for him and it did not take him ten seconds he had said he would carry them at halfpast nine but thinking it over on a bench in the garden he decided that he had better go sooner they might breakfast earlier and there would be no fun if alice did not find the roses beside her plate that was the whole idea it was not till he stood at the door of the pasmer apartment that he reflected that he was not accomplishing his wish to see alice by leaving her those flowers he was a fool for now he would have to postpone coming a little because he had already come  the girl who answered the bell did not understand the charge he gave her about the roses and he repeated his words some one passing through the room beyond seemed to hesitate and pause at the sound of his voice could it be alice then he should see her after all the girl looked over her shoulder and said mrs pasmer  mrs pasmer came forward and he fell into a complicated explanation and apology at the end she said you had better give them yourself she will be here directly they were in the room now and mrs pasmer made the time pass in rapid talk but dan felt that he ought to apologise from time to time no she said letting herself go stay and breakfast with us mr mavering we shall be so glad to have you  at last alice came in and they decorously shook hands mrs pasmer turned away a smile at their decorum i will see that theres a place for you she said leaving them  they were instantly in each others arms it seemed to him that all this had happened because he had so strongly wished it  what is it dan what did you come for she asked  to see if it was really true alice i couldnt believe it  welllet me goyou mustntits too silly of course its true she pulled herself free is my hair tumbled you oughtnt to have come its ridiculous but im glad you came ive been thinking it all over and ive got a great many things to say to you but come to breakfast now  she had a businesslike way of treating the situation that was more intoxicating than sentiment would have been and gave it more actuality  mrs pasmer was alone at the table and explained that alices father never breakfasted with them or very seldom where are your flowers she asked alice  flowers what flowers  that mr mavering brought  they all looked at one another dan ran out and brought in his roses  they were trying to get away in the excitement i guess mrs pasmer i found them behind the door he had flung them there without knowing it when mrs pasmer left him with alice  he expected her to join him and her mother in being amused at this but he was as well pleased to have her touched at his having brought them and to turn their gaiety off in praise of the roses she got a vase for them and set it on the table he noticed for the first time the pretty housedress she had on with its barred corsage and underskirt and the heavy silken rope knotted round it at the waist and dropping in heavy tufts or balls in front  the breakfast was continental in its simplicity and mrs pasmer said that they had always kept up their paris habit of a light breakfast even in london where it was not so easy to follow foreign customs as it was in america she was afraid he might find it too light then he told all about his mornings adventure ending with his breakfast at the providence depot mrs pasmer entered into the fun of it but she said it was for only once in a way and he must not expect to be let in if he came at that hour another morning he said no he understood what an extraordinary piece of luck it was for him to be there and he was there to be bidden to do whatever they wished he said so much in recognition of their goodness that he became abashed by it mrs pasmer sat at the head of the table and alice across it from him so far off that she seemed parted from him by an insuperable moral distance a warm flush seemed to rise from his heart into his throat and stifle him he wished to shed tears his eyes were wet with grateful happiness in answering mrs pasmer that he would not have any more coffee then she said we will go into the drawingroom but she allowed him and alice to go alone  he was still in that illusion of awe and of distance and he submitted to the interposition of another table between their chairs  i wish to talk with you she said so seriously that he was frightened and said to himself now she is going to break it off she has thought it over and she finds she cant endure me  well he said huskily  you oughtnt to have come here you know this morning  i know it he vaguely conceded but i didnt expect to get in  well now youre here we may as well talk you must tell your family at once  yes im going to write to them as soon as i get back to my room i couldnt last night  but you mustnt write you must goand prepare their minds  go he echoed oh that isnt necessary my father knew about it from the beginning and i guess theyve all talked it over their minds are prepared the sense of his immeasurable superiority to any ones opposition began to dissipate dans unnatural awe at the pleading face which alice put on resting one cheek against the back of one of her clasped hands and leaning on the table with her elbows he began to be teased by that silken rope round her waist  but you dont understand dear she said and she said dear as if they were old married people you must go to see them and tell them and then some of them must come to see meyour father and sisters  why of course his eye now became fastened to one of the fluffy silken balls  and then mamma and i must go to see your mother mustnt we  itll be very nice of youyes you know she cant come to you  yes thats what i thought andwhat are you looking at she drew herself back from the table and followed the direction of his eye with a womans instinctive apprehension of disarray  he was ashamed to tell oh nothing i was just thinking  what  well i dont know that it seems so strange any one else should have any to do with itmy family and yours but i suppose they must yes its all right  why of course if your family didnt like it  it wouldnt make any difference to me said dan resolutely  it would to me she retorted with tender reproach do you suppose it would be pleasant to go into a family that didnt like you suppose papa and mamma didnt like you  but i thought they did said mavering with his mind still partly on the rope and the fluffy ball but keeping his eyes away  yes they do said alice but your family dont know me at all and your fathers only seen me once cant you understand im afraid we dont look at it seriously enoughearnestlyand oh i do wish to have everything done as it should be sometimes when i think of it it makes me tremble ive been thinking about it all the morning andandpraying  dan wanted to fall on his knees to her the idea of alice in prayer was fascinating  i wish our life to begin with others and not with ourselves if were intrusted with so much happiness doesnt it mean that were to do good with itto give it to others as if it were money  the nobleness of this thought stirred dan greatly his eyes wandered back to the silken rope but now it seemed to him an emblem of voluntary suffering and selfsacrifice like a devotees hempen girdle he perceived that the love of this angelic girl would elevate him and hallow his whole life if he would let it he answered her fervently that he would be guided by her in this as in everything that he knew he was selfish and he was afraid he was not very good but it was not because he had not wished to be so it was because he had not had any incentive he thought how much nobler and better this was than the talk he had usually had with girls he said that of course he would go home and tell his people he saw now that it would make them happier if they could hear it directly from him he had only thought of writing because he could not bear to think of letting a day pass without seeing her but if he took the early morning train he could get back the same night and still have three hours at ponkwasset falls and he would go the next day if she said so  go today dan she said and she stretched out her hand impressively across the table toward him he seized it with a gush of tenderness and they drew together in their resolution to live for others he said he would go at once but the next train did not leave till two oclock and there was plenty of time in the meanwhile it was in the accomplishment of their high aims that they sat down on the sofa together and talked of their future alice conditioned it wholly upon his peoples approval of her which seemed wildly unnecessary to mavering and amused him immensely  yes she said i know you will think me strange in a great many things but i shall never keep anything from you and im going to tell you that i went to matins this morning  to matins echoed dan he would not quite have liked her a catholic he remembered with relief that she had said she was not a roman catholic though when he came to think he would not have cared a great deal nothing could have changed her from being alice  yes i wished to consecrate the first morning of our engagement and im always going i determined that i would go before breakfastthat was what made breakfast so late dont you like it she asked timidly  like it he said im going with you  oh no she turned upon him that wouldnt do she became grave again im glad you approve of it for i should feel that there was something wanting to our happiness if marriage is a sacrament why shouldnt an engagement be  it is said dan and he felt that it was holy till then he had never realised that marriage was a sacrament though he had often heard the phrase  at the end of an hour they took a tender leave of each other hastened by the sound of mrs pasmers voice without alice escaped from one door before her mother entered by the other dan remained trying to look unconcerned but he was sensible of succeeding so poorly that he thought he had better offer his hand to mrs pasmer at once he told her that he was going up to ponkwasset falls at two oclock and asked her to please remember him to mr pasmer  she said she would and asked him if he were to be gone long  oh no just overnighttill i can tell them whats happened he felt it a comfort to be trivial with mrs pasmer after bracing up to alices ideals i suppose theyll have to know  what an exemplary son said mrs pasmer yes i suppose they will  i supposed it would be enough if i wrote but alice thinks id better report in person  i think you had indeed and it will be a good thing for you both to have the time for clarifying your ideas did she tell you she had been at matins this morning a light of laughter trembled in mrs pasmers eyes and mavering could not keep a responsive gleam out of his own in an instant the dedication of his engagement by morning prayer ceased to be a high and solemn thought and became deliciously amusing and this laughing alice over with her mother did more to realise the fact that she was his than anything else had yet done  in that dark passage outside he felt two arms go tenderly round his neck and a soft shape strain itself to his heart i know you have been laughing about me but you may im yours now even to laugh at if you want  you are mine to fall down and worship he vowed with an instant revulsion of feeling  alice didnt say anything he felt her hand fumbling about his coat lapel where is your breast pocket she asked and he took hold of her hand which left a cartedevisiteshaped something in his  it isnt very good she murmured as well as she could with her lips against his cheek but i thought youd like to show them some proof of my existence i shall have none of yours while youre gone  o alice you think of everything  his heart was pierced by the soft reproach implied in her words he had not thought to ask her for her photograph but she had thought to give it she must have felt it strange that he had not asked for it and she had meant to slip it in his pocket and let him find it there but even his pang of selfupbraiding was a part of his transport he seemed to float down the stairs his mind was in a delirious whirl i shall go mad he said to himself in the excess of his joyi shall die     xxviii  the parting scene with alice persisted in maverings thought far on the way to ponkwasset falls he now succeeded in saying everything to her how deeply he felt her giving him her photograph to cheer him in his separation from her how much he appreciated her forethought in providing him with some answer when his mother and sisters should ask him about her looks he took out the picture and pretended to the other passengers to be looking very closely at it and so managed to kiss it he told her that now he understood what love really was how powerful how it did conquer everything that it had changed him and made him already a better man he made her refuse all merit in the work  when he began to formulate the facts for communication to his family love did not seem so potent he found himself ashamed of his passion or at least unwilling to let it be its own excuse even he had a wish to give it almost any other appearance until he came in sight of the station and the works it had not seemed possible for any one to object to alice he had been going home as a matter of form to receive the adhesion of his family but now he was forced to see that she might be considered critically even reluctantly this would only be because his family did not understand how perfect alice was but they might not understand  with his father there would be no difficulty his father had seen alice and admired her he would be all right dan found himself hoping this rather anxiously as if from the instinctive need of his fathers support with his mother and sisters he stopped at the works when he left the train and found his father in his private office beyond the bookkeepers picketfence which he penetrated with a nod to the accountant  hello dan said his father looking up and hello father said dan being alone the father and son not only shook hands but kissed each other as they used to do in meeting after an absence when dan was younger  he had closed his fathers door with his left hand in giving his right and now he said at once father ive come home to tell you that im engaged to be married  dan had prearranged his fathers behaviour at this announcement but he now perceived that he would have to modify the scene if it were to represent the facts his father did not brighten all over and demand miss pasmer of course he contrived to hide whatever start the news had given him and was some time in asking with his soft lisp isnt that rather sudden dan  well not for me said dan laughing uneasily itsyou know her fathermiss pasmer  oh yes said his father certainly not with displeasure and yet not with enthusiasm  ive had ever since class day to think it over and itcame to a climax yesterday  and then you stopped thinking said his fatherto gain time it appeared to dan  yes sir said dan i havent thought since  well said his father with an amusement which was not unfriendly he added after a moment but i thought that had been broken off and dans instinct penetrated to the lurking fact that his father must have talked the rupture over with his mother and not wholly regretted it  there was a kind ofhitch at one time he admitted but its all right now  well well said his father this is great newsgreat news and he seemed to be shaping himself to the new posture of affairs while giving it a conditional recognition shes a beautiful creature  isnt she cried dan with a little break in his voice for he had found his fathers manner rather trying and shes good too i assure you that she isshe is simply perfect every way  well said the elder mavering rising and pulling down the rolling top of his desk im glad to hear it for your sake dan have you been up at the house yet  no im just off the train  how is her motherhow is mrs pasmer all well  yes sir said dan theyre all very well you dont know mr pasmer i believe sir do you  not since college what sort of person is he  hes very refined and quiet very handsome very courteous very nice indeed  ah thats good said elbridge mavering with the effect of not having been very attentive to his sons answer  they walked up the long slope of the hillside on which the house stood overlooking the valley where the works were and fronting the plateau across the river where the village of operatives houses was scattered the paling light of what had been a very red sunset flushed them and brought out the picturesqueness which the architect who designed them for a particular effect in the view from the owners mansion had intended  a good carriage road followed the easiest line of ascent towards this edifice and reached a gateway within it began to describe a curve bordered with asphalted footways to the broad verandah of the house and then descended again to the gate the grounds enclosed were planted with deciduous shrubs which had now mostly dropped their leaves and clumps of firs darkening in the evening light with the gleam of some garden statues shivering about the lawn next the house the breeze grew colder and stiffer as the father and son mounted toward the mansion which dan used to believe was like a chateau with its mansardroof and dormer windows and chimneys it now blocked its space sharply out of the thin pink of the western sky and its lights sparkled with a wintry keenness which had often thrilled dan when he climbed the hill from the station in former homecomings their brilliancy gave him a strange sinking of the heart for no reason he and his father had kept up a sort of desultory talk about alice and he could not have said that his father had seemed indifferent he had touched the affair only too acquiescently it was painfully like everything else when they came in full sight of the house dan left the subject as he realised presently from a reasonless fear of being overheard  it seems much later here sir than it does in boston he said glancing round at the maples which stood ragged with half their leaves blown from them  yes were in the hills and were further north answered his father theres minnie  dan had seen his sister on the verandah pausing at sight of him and puzzled to make out who was with her father he had an impulse to hail her with a shout but he could not in his last walk with her he had told her that he should never marry and they had planned to live together it was a joke but now he felt as if he had come to rob her of something and he walked soberly on with his father  why dan you goodfornothing fellow she called out when he came near enough to be unmistakable and ran down the steps to kiss him what in the world are you doing here when did you come why didnt you hollo instead of letting me stand here guessing youre not sick are you  the father got himself indoors unnoticed in the excitement of the brothers arrival this would have been the best moment for dan to tell his sister of his engagement he knew it but he parried her curiosity about his coming and then his sister eunice came out and he could not speak they all went together into the house flaming with naphtha gas and with the steam heat already on and dan said he would take his bag to his room and then come down again he knew that he had left them to think that there was something very mysterious in his coming and while he washed away the grime of his journey he was planning how to appear perfectly natural when he should get back to his sisters he recollected that he had not asked either them or his father how his mother was but it was certainly not because his mind was not full of her alice now seemed very remote from him further even than his gun or his boyish collection of moths and butterflies on which his eye fell in roving about his room for a bitter instant it seemed to him as if they were all alike toys and in a sudden despair he asked himself what had become of his happiness it was scarcely half a day since he had parted in transport from alice  he made pretexts to keep from returning at once to his sisters and it was nearly half an hour before he went down to them by that time his father was with them in the library and they were waiting tea for him     xxix  a family of rich people in the country apart from intellectual interests is apt to gormandise and the maverings always sat down to a luxurious table which was most abundant and tempting at the meal they called tea when the invention of the portuguese mancook was taxed to supply the demands of appetites at once eager and fastidious they prolonged the meal as much as possible in winter and dan used to like to get home just in time for tea when he came up from harvard it was always very jolly and he brought a boys hunger to its abundance the diningroom full of shining light and treated from the lowdown grate was a pleasant place but now his spirits failed to rise with the physical cheer he was almost bashfully silent he sat cowed in the presence of his sisters and careworn in the place where he used to be so gay and bold they were waiting to have him begin about himself as he always did when he had been away and were ready to sympathise with his egotism whatever new turn it took he mystified them by asking about them and their affairs and by dealing in futile generalities instead of launching out with any business that he happened at the time to be full of but he did not attend to their answers to his questions he was absentminded and only knew that his face was flushed and that he was obviously ill at ease  his younger sister turned from him impatiently at last father what is the matter with dan  her bold recognition of their common constraint broke it down dan looked at his father with helpless consent and his father said quietly he tells me hes engaged  what nonsense said his sister eunice  why dan cried minnie and he felt a reproach in her words which the words did not express a silence followed in which the father along went on with his supper the girls sat staring at dan with incredulous eyes he became suddenly angry  i dont know whats so very extraordinary about it or why there should be such a pother he began and he knew that he was insolently ignoring abundant reasons for pother if there had been any pother yes im engaged  he expected now that they would believe him and ask whom he was engaged to but apparently they were still unable to realise it he was obliged to go on im engaged to miss pasmer  to miss pasmer repeated eunice  but i thought minnie began and then stopped  dan commanded his temper by a strong effort and condescended to explain there was a misunderstanding but its all right now i only met her yesterday andits all right he had to keep on ignoring what had passed between him and his sisters during the month he spent at home after his return from campobello he did not wish to do so he would have been glad to laugh over that epoch of illconcealed heartbreak with them but the way they had taken the fact of his engagement made it impossible he was forced to keep them at a distance they forced him im glad he added bitterly that the news seems to be so agreeable to my family thank you for your cordial congratulations he swallowed a large cup of tea and kept looking down  how silly said eunice who was much the oldest of the three did you expect us to fall upon your neck before we could believe it wasnt a hoax of fathers  a hoax dan burst out  i suppose said minnie with mock meekness that if were to be devoured its no use saying we didnt roil the brook im sure i congratulate you dan with all my heart she added with a trembling voice  i congratulate miss pasmer said eunice on securing such a very reasonable husband  when eunice first became a young lady she was so much older than dan that in his mothers absence she sometimes authorised herself to box his ears till she was finally overthrown in battle by the growing boy she still felt herself so much his tutelary genius that she could not let the idea of his engagement awe her or keep her from giving him a needed lesson dan jumped to his feet and passionately threw his napkin on his chair  there that will do eunice interposed the father sit down dan and dont be an ass if you are engaged do you expect to come up here with a bombshell in your pocket and explode it among us without causing any commotion we all desire your happiness and we are glad if you think youve found it but we want to have time to realise it we had only adjusted our minds to the apparent fact that you hadnt found it when you were here before his father began very severely but when he ended with this recognition of what they had all blinked till then they laughed together  my pillow isnt dry yet with the tears i shed for you dan said minnie demurely  i shall have to countermand my mourning said eunice and wear louder colours than ever unless she added miss pasmer changes her mind again  this divination of the past gave them all a chance for another laugh and dans sisters began to reconcile themselves to the fact of his engagement if not to miss pasmer in what was abstractly so disagreeable there was the comfort that they could joke about his happiness they had not felt free to make light of his misery when he was at home before they began to ask all the questions they could think of as to how and when and they assimilated the fact more and more in acquiring these particulars and making a mock of them and him  of course you havent got her photograph suggested eunice you know weve never had the pleasure of meeting the young lady yet  yes dan owned blushing i have she thought i might like to show it to mother but it isnt  a very good onethey never are said minnie  and it was taken several years agothey always are said eunice  and she doesnt photograph well anyway  and this one was just after a long fit of sickness  dan drew it out of his pocket after some fumbling for it while he tolerated their gibes  eunice put her nose to it i hope its your cigarettes it smells of she said  yes she doesnt use the weed answered dan  oh i didnt mean that exactly returned his sister holding the picture off at arms length and viewing it critically with contracted eyes  dan could not help laughing i dont think its been near any other cigarcase he answered tranquilly  minnie looked at it very near to covering all but the face with her hand dan shes lovely she cried and dans heart leaped into his throat as he gratefully met his sisters eyes  youll like her min  eunice took the photograph from her for a second scrutiny shes certainly very stylish rather a beak of a nose and a little too birdlike on the whole but she isnt so bad is it like her she asked with a glance at her father  i might sayafter looking he replied  true i didnt know but dan had shown it to you as soon as you met he seemed to be in such a hurry to let us all know  the father said i dont think it flatters her and he looked at it more carefully not much of her mother there he suggested to dan  no sir shes more like her father  well after all this excitement i believe ill have another cup of tea and take something to eat if miss pasmers photograph doesnt object said eunice and she replenished her cup and plate  what coloured hair and eyes has she dan asked minnie  he had to think so as to be exact well you might say they were black her eyebrows are so dark but i believe theyre a sort of greyishblue  not an uncommon colour for eyes said eunice but rather peculiar for hair  they got to making fun of the picture and dan told them about alice and her family the father left them at the table and then came back with word from dans mother that she was ready to see him     xxx  by eight oclock in the evening the pain with which every day began for mrs mavering was lulled and her jarred nerves were stayed by the opiates till she fell asleep about midnight in this interval the family gathered into her room and brought her their news and the cheer of their health the girls chattered on one side of her bed and their father sat with his newspaper on the other and read aloud the passages which he thought would interest her while she lay propped among her pillows brilliantly eager for the world opening this glimpse of itself to her shining eyes that was on her good nights when the drugs did their work but there were times when they failed and the days agony prolonged itself through the evening and the sleep won at last was a heavy stupor then the sufferers temper gave way under the stress she became the torment she suffered and tore the hearts she loved most of all she afflicted the man who had been so faithful to her misery and maddened him to reprisals of which he afterward abjectly repented her tongue was sharpened by pain and pitilessly skilled to inculpate and to punish it pierced and burned like fire but when a good day came again she made it up to the victims by the angelic sweetness and sanity which they felt was her real self the cruelty was only the mask of her suffering  when she was better they brought to her room anybody who was staying with them and she liked them to be jolly in the spacious chamber the pleasantest things of the house were assembled and all its comforts concentrated in the place which she and they knew she should quit but once it was made gay with flowers and pictures it was the salon for those fortunate hours when she became the lightest and blithest of the company in it and made the youngest guest forget that there was sickness or pain in the world by the spirit with which she ignored her own her laugh became young again she joked she entered into what they were doing and reading and thinking and sent them away full of the sympathy which in this mood of hers she had for every mood in others girls sighed out their wonder and envy to her daughters when they left her the young men whom she captivated with her divination of their passions or ambitions went away celebrating her supernatural knowledge of human nature the next evening after some night of rare and happy excitement the family saw her nurse carrying the pictures and flowers and vases out of her room in sign of her renunciation of them all and assembled silently shrinkingly in her chamber to take each their portion of her anguish of the blame and the penalty the household adjusted itself to her humours for she was supreme in it  when dan used to come home from harvard she put on a pretty cap for him and distinguished him as company by certain laces hiding her wasted frame and giving their pathetic coquetry to her transparent wrists he was her favourite and the girls acknowledged him so and made their fun of her for spoiling him he found out as he grew up that her broken health dated from his birth and at first this deeply affected him but his young life soon lost the keenness of the impression and he loved his mother because she loved him and not because she had been dying for him so many years  as he now came into her room and the waitingwoman went out of it with her usual well mr dan the tenderness which filled him at sight of his mother was mixed with that sense of guilt which had tormented him at times ever since he met his sisters he was going to take himself from her he realised that  well dan she called so gaily that he said to himself no father hasnt told her anything about it and was instantly able to answer her as cheerfully well mother  he bent over her to kiss her and the odour of the clean linen mingling with that of the opium and the cologne with which she had tried to banish its scent opened to him one of those vast reaches of associations which perfumes can unlock and he saw her lying there through those years of pain as many as half his life and suddenly the tears gushed into his eyes and he fell on his knees and hid his face in the bedclothes and sobbed  she kept smoothing his head which shook under her thin hand and saying poor dan poor dan but did not question him he knew that she knew what he had come to tell her and that his tears which had not been meant for that had made interest with her for him and his cause and that she was already on his side  he tried boyishly to dignify the situation when he lifted his face and he said i didnt mean to come boohooing to you in this way and im ashamed of myself  i know dan but youve been wrought up and i dont wonder you mustnt mind your father and your sisters of course theyre rather surprised and they dont like your taking yourself from themwe none of us do  at these honest words dan tried to become honest too at least he dropped his pretence of dignity and became as a little child in his simple greed for sympathy but it isnt necessarily that is it mother  yes its all that dan and its all right because its that we dont like it but our not liking it has nothing to do with its being right or wrong  i supposed that father would have been pleased anyway for he has seen her andand of course the girls havent but i think they might have trusted my judgment a little im not quite a fool  his mother smiled oh it isnt a question of the wisdom of your choice its the unexpectedness we all saw that you were very unhappy when you were here before and we supposed it had gone wrong  it had mother said dan she refused me at campobello but it was a misunderstanding and as soon as we met  i knew you had met again and what you had come home for and i told your father so when he came to say you were here  did you mother he asked charmed at her having guessed that  yes she must be a good girl to send you straight home to tell us  you knew i wouldnt have thought of that myself said dan joyously i wanted to write i thought that would do just as well i hated to leave her but she made me come she is the best and the wisest and the most unselfisho mother i cant tell you about her you must see her you cant realise her till you see her mother youll like each other im sure of that youre just alike it seemed to dan that they were exactly alike  then perhaps we shant suggested his mother let me see her picture  how did you know i had it if it hadnt been for her i shouldnt have brought any she put it into my pocket just as i was leaving she said you would all want to see what she looked like  he had taken it out of his pocket and he held it smiling fondly upon it alice seemed to smile back at him he had lost her in the reluctance of his father and sisters and now his motherit was his mother who had given her to him again he thought how tenderly he loved his mother  when he could yield her the photograph she looked long and silently at it she has a great deal of character dan  there youve hit it mother id rather you would have said that than anything else but dont you think shes beautiful shes the gentlest creature when you come to know her i was awfully afraid of her at first i thought she was very haughty but she isnt at all shes really very selfdepreciatory she thinks she isnt good enough for me you ought to hear her talk mother as i have shes full of the noblest idealsof being of some use in the world of being selfdevoted andall that kind of thing and you can see that shes capable of it her aunts in a protestant sisterhood he said with a solemnity which did not seem to communicate itself to his mother for mrs mavering smiled dan smiled too and said but i cant tell you about alice mother shes perfect his heart overflowed with proud delight in her and he was fool enough to add shes so affectionate  his mother kept herself from laughing i dare say she is danwith you then she hid all but her eyes with the photograph and gave way  what a donkey said dan meaning himself if i go on i shall disgust you with her what i mean is that she isnt at all proud as i used to think she was  no girl is under the circumstances she has all she can do to be proud of you  do you think so mother he said enraptured with the notion ive done my bestor my worstnot to give her any reason to be so  she doesnt want anythe less the better you silly boy dont you suppose she wants to make you out of whole cloth just as you do with her she doesnt want any facts to start with theyd be in the way well now i can make out with your help what the young lady is but what are the father and mother theyre rather important in these cases  oh theyre the nicest kind of people said dan in optimistic generalisation youd like mrs pasmer shes awfully nice  do you say that because you think i wouldnt asked his mother isnt she rather sly and humbugging  well yes she is to a certain extent dan admitted with a laugh but she doesnt mean any harm by it shes extremely kindhearted  to you i dare say and mr pasmer is rather under her thumb  well yes you might say thumb dan consented feeling it useless to defend the pasmers against this analysis  we wont say heel returned his mother were too polite and your father says he had the reputation in college of being one of the most selfish fellows in the world hes never done anything since but lose most of his money hes been absolutely idle and useless all his days she turned her vivid blue eyes suddenly upon her sons  dan winced you know how hard father is upon people who havent done anything its a mania of his of course mr pasmer doesnt show to advantage where theres nono leisure class  poor man  dan was going to say hes very amiable though but he was afraid of his mothers retorting to you and he held his peace looking chapfallen  whether his mother took pity on him or not her next sally was consoling but your alice may not take after either of them her father is the worst of his breed it seems the rest are useful people from what your father knows and theres a great deal to be hoped for collaterally she had an uncle in college at the same time who was everything that her father was not  one of her aunts is in one of those protestant religious houses in england repeated dan  oh said his mother shortly i dont know that i like that particularly but probably she isnt useless there is alice very religious  well i suppose said dan with a smile for the devotions that came into his thought shes what would be called piscopal pious  mrs mavering referred to the photograph which she still held in her hand well shes pure and good at any rate i suppose you look forward to a long engagement  dan was somewhat taken aback at a supposition so very contrary to what was in his mind well i dont know why  it might be said that you are very young how old is agnesalice i mean  twentyone but now look here mother its no use considering such a thing in the abstract is it  no said his mother with a smile for what might be coming  this is the way ive been viewing it i may say its the way alice has been viewing itor mrs pasmer rather  decidedly mrs pasmer rather better be honest dan  ill do my best i was thinking hoping that is that as im going right into the businesshave gone into it already in factand could begin life at once that perhaps there wouldnt be much sense in waiting a great while  yes  thats all that is if you and father are agreed he reflected upon this provision and added with a laugh of confusion and pleasure it seems to be so very much more of a family affair than i used to think it was  you thought it concerned just you and her said his mother with arch sympathy  well yes  poor fellow she knew better than that you may be sure at any rate her mother did  what mrs pasmer doesnt know isnt probably worth knowing said dan with an amused sense of her omniscience  i thought so sighed his mother smiling too and now you begin to find out that it concerns the families in all their branches on both sides  oh if it stopped at the families and their ramifications but it seems to take in society and the general public  so it doesmore than you can realise you cant get married to yourself alone as young people think and if you dont marry happily you sin against the peace and comfort of the whole community  yes thats what im chiefly looking out for now i dont want any of those people in central africa to suffer thats the reason i want to marry alice at the earliest opportunity but i suppose therell have to be a mavering embassy to the high contracting powers of the other part now  your father and one of the girls had better go down  yes  and invite mr and mrs pasmer and their daughter to come up here  all on probation  oh no if youre pleased dan  i am mothermeasurably they both laughed at this mild way of putting it  why then its to be supposed that were all pleased you neednt bring the whole pasmer family home to live with you if you do marry them all  no said dan and suddenly he became very distraught it flashed through him that his mother was expecting him to come home with alice to live and that she would not be at all pleased with his scheme of a european sojourn which mrs pasmer had so cordially adopted he was amazed that he had not thought of that but he refused to see any difficulty which his happiness could not cope with  no theres that view of it he said jollily and he buried his momentary anxiety out of sight and as it were danced upon its grave nevertheless he had a desire to get quickly away from the spot i hope the mavering embassy wont be a great while getting ready to go he said of course its all right but i shouldnt want an appearance of reluctance exactly you know mother and if there should be much of an interval between my getting back and their coming on dont you know why the cat might let herself out of the bag  what cat asked his mother demurely  well you know you havent received my engagement with unmingled enthusiasm andand i suppose they would find it out from mefrom my manner andand i wish theyd come along pretty soon mother  poor boy im afraid the cat got out of the bag when mrs pasmer came to the years of discretion but you shant be left a prey to her they shall go back with you ring the bell and lets talk it over with them now  dan joyfully obeyed he could see that his mother was all on fire with interest in his affair and that the idea of somehow circumventing mrs pasmer by prompt action was fascinating her  his sisters came up at once and his father followed a moment later they all took their cue from the mothers gaiety and began talking and laughing except the father who sat looking on with a smile at their lively spirits and the jokes of which dan became the victim each family has its own fantastic medium in which it gets affairs to relieve them of their concrete seriousness and the maverings now did this with dans engagement and played with it as an airy abstraction they debated the character of the embassy which was to be sent down to boston on their behalf and it was decided that eunice had better go with her father as representing more fully the age and respectability of the family at first glance the pasmers would take her for dans mother and this would be a tremendous advantage  and if i like the ridiculous little chit said eunice i think i shall let dan marry her at once i see no reason why he shouldnt and i couldnt stand a long engagement i should break it off  i guess there are others who will have something to say about that retorted the younger sister ive always wanted a long engagement in this family and as there seems to be no chance for it with the ladies i wish to make the most of dans i always like it where the hero gets sick and the heroine nurses him i want dan to get sick and have alice come here and take care of him  no this marriage must take place at once what do you say father asked eunice  her father sat enjoying the talk at the foot of the bed with a tendency to doze you might ask dan he said with a lazy cast of his eye toward his son  dan has nothing to do with it  dan shall not be consulted  the two girls stormed upon their father with their different reasons  now i will tell you girls be still their mother broke in listen to me i have an idea  listen to her she has an idea echoed eunice in recitative  will you be quiet demanded the mother  we will be duumb  when they became so at the verge of their mothers patience of which they knew the limits she went on i think dan had better get married at once  there minnie  but what does dan say  i willmake the sacrifice said dan meekly  noble boy thats exactly what washington said to his mother when she asked him not to go to sea said minnie  and then he went into the militia and made it all right with himself that way said eunice dan cant play his filial piety on this family go on mother  i want him to bring his wife home and live with us continued his mother  in the l part cried minnie clasping her hands in rapture ive always said what a perfect little apartment it was by itself  well dont say it again then returned her sister always is often enough well in the l part go on mother dont ask where you were when its so exciting  i dont care whether its in the l part or not theres plenty of room in the great barn of a place everywhere  but what about his taking care of the business in boston suggested eunice looking at her father  theres no hurry about that  and about the excursion to aesthetic centres abroad minnie added  that could be managed said her father with the same ironical smile  the mother and the girls went on wildly planning dans future for him it was all in a strain of extravagant burlesque but he could not take his part in it with his usual zest he laughed and joked too but at the bottom of his heart was an uneasy remembrance of the different future he had talked over with mrs pasmer so confidently but he said to himself buoyantly at last that it would come out all right his mother would give in or else alice could reconcile her mother to whatever seemed really best  he parted from his mother with fond gaiety his sisters came out of the room with him  im perfectly sore with laughing said minnie it seems like old timesdoesnt it dansuch a gale with mother     xxxi  an engagement must always be a little incredible at first to the families of the betrothed and especially to the family of the young man in the girls the mother at least will have a more realising sense of the situation if there are elder sisters who have been accustomed to regard their brother as very young he will seem all the younger because in such a matter he has treated himself as if he were a man and eunice mavering said after seeing the pasmers well dan its all well enough i suppose but it seems too ridiculous  whats ridiculous about it i should like to know he demanded  oh i dont know wholl look after you when youre married oh i forgot maam pasmer  i guess we shall be able to look after ourselves said dan a little sulkily  yes if youll be allowed to insinuated his sister  they spoke at the end of a talk in which he had fretted at the reticence of both his sister and his father concerning the pasmers whom they had just been to see he was vexed with his father because he felt that he had been influenced by eunice and had somehow gone back on him he was vexed and he was grieved because his father had left them at the door of the hotel without saying anything in praise of alice beyond the generalities that would not carry favour with eunice and he was depressed with a certain sense of alices father and mother which seemed to have imparted itself to him from the others and to be the mavering opinion of them he could no longer see mrs pasmer harmless if trivial and goodhearted if inveterately scheming he could not see the dignity and refinement which he had believed in mr pasmer they had both suffered a sort of shrinkage or collapse from which he could not rehabilitate them but this would have been nothing if his sisters and his fathers eyes through which he seemed to have been looking had not shown him alice in a light in which she appeared strange and queer almost to eccentricity he was hurt at this effect from their want of sympathy his pride was touched and he said to himself that he should not fish for eunices praise but he found himself saying without surprise i suppose you will do what you can to prejudice mother and min  isnt that a little previous asked eunice have i said anything against miss pasmer  you havent because you couldnt said dan with foolish bitterness  oh i dont know about that shes a human being i supposeat least that was the impression i got from her parentage  what have you got to say against her parents demanded dan savagely  oh nothing i didnt come down to boston to denounce the pasmer family  i suppose you didnt like their being in a flat youd have liked to find them in a house on commonwealth avenue or beacon street  ill own im a snob said eunice with maddening meekness sos father  they are connected with the best families in the city and they are in the best society they do what they please and they live where they like they have been so long in europe that they dont care for those silly distinctions but what you say doesnt harm them its simply disgraceful to you thats all said dan furiously  im glad its no worse dan said his sister with a tranquil smile and if youll stop prancing up and down the room and take a seat and behave yourself in a christian manner ill talk with you and if you dont i wont do you suppose im going to be bullied into liking them  you can like them or not as you please said dan sullenly but he sat down and waited decently for his sister to speak but you cant abuse themat least in my presence  i didnt know men lost their heads as well as their hearts said eunice perhaps its only an exchange though and its miss pasmers head dan started but did not say anything and eunice smoothly continued no i dont believe it is she looked like a sensible girl and she talked sensibly i should think she had a very good head she has good manners and shes extremely pretty and very graceful im surprised she should be in love with such a simpleton  oh go on abuse me as much as you like said dan he was at once soothed by her praise of alice  no it isnt necessary to go on the case is a little too obvious but i think she will do very well i hope youre not marrying the whole family though i suppose that its always a question of which shall be scooped up they will want to scoop you up and we shall want to scoop her up i dare say maam pasmer has her little plan what is it  dan started at this touch on the quick but he controlled himself and said with dignity i have my own plans  well you know what mothers are returned eunice easily you seem so cheerful that i suppose yours are quite the same and youre just keeping them for a surprise she laughed provokingly and dan burst forth again  you seem to live to give people pain you take a fiendish delight in torturing others but if you think you can influence me in the slightest degree youre very much mistaken  well well there it shant be teased any more so it shant it shall have its own way it shall and nobody shall say a word against its little girlys mother eunice rose from her chair and patted dan on the head as she passed to the adjoining room he caught her hand and flung it violently away she shrieked with delight in his childish resentment and left him sulking she was gone two or three minutes and when she came back it was in quite a different mood as often happens with women in a little lapse of time  dan i think miss pasmer is a beautiful girl and i know we shall all like her if you dont set us against her by your arrogance of course we dont know anything about her yet and you dont really but she seems a very lovable little thing and if shes rather silent and undemonstrative why shell be all the better for you youve got demonstration enough for twenty and i think the family are well enough mrs pasmer is thoroughly harmless and mr pasmer is a most dignified personage his eyebrows alone are worth the price of admission dan could not help smiling all that there is about it is you mustnt expect to drive people into raptures about them and expect them to go grovelling round on their knees because you do  oh i know im an infernal idiot said dan yielding to the mingled sarcasm and flattery its because im so anxious and you all seem so confoundedly provisional about it eunice what do you suppose father really thinks  eunice seemed tempted to a relapse into her teasing but she did not yield oh fathers all rightfrom your point of view hes been ridiculous from the first perhaps thats the reason he doesnt feel obliged to expatiate and expand a great deal at present  do you think so cried dan instantly adopting her as an ally  well if i sad so oughtnt it to be enough  it depends upon what else you say look here now eunice dan said with a laughing mixture of fun and earnest what are you going to say to mother its no use being disagreeable is it of course i dont contend for ideal perfection anywhere and i dont expect it but there isnt anything experimental about this thing and dont you think we had better all make the best of it  that sounds very impartial  it is impartial im a purely disinterested spectator  oh quite  and dont you suppose i understand mr and mrs pasmer quite as well as you do all i say is that alice is simply the noblest girl that ever breathed and  now youre talking sense dan  well what are you going to say when you get home eunice come  that we had better make the best of it  and what else  that youre hopelessly infatuated and that she will twist you round her finger  well  but that youve had your own way so much it will do you good to have somebody elses a while  i guess youre pretty solid said dan after thinking it over for a moment i dont believe youre going to make it hard for me and i know you can make it just what you please but i want you to be frank with mother of course i wish you felt about the whole affair just as i do but if youre right on the main question i dont care for the rest id rather mother would know just how you feel about it said dan with a sigh for the honesty which he felt to be not immediately attainable in his own case  well ill see what can be done eunice finally assented  whatever her feelings were in regard to the matter she must have satisfied herself that the situation was not to be changed by her disliking it and she began to talk so sympathetically with dan that she soon had the whole story of his love out of him they laughed a good deal together at it but it convinced her that he had not been hoodwinked into the engagement it is always the belief of a young mans family especially his mother and sisters that unfair means have been used to win him if the family of his betrothed are unknown to them and it was a relief if not exactly a comfort for eunice mavering to find that alice was as great a simpleton as dan and perhaps a sincerer simpleton     xxxii  a week later in fulfilment of the arrangement made by mrs pasmer and eunice mavering alice and her mother returned the formal visit of dans people  while alice stood before the mirror in one of the sumptuously furnished rooms assigned them arranging a ribbon for the effect upon dans mother after dinner and regarding its relation to her serious beauty mrs pasmer came out of her chamber adjoining and began to inspect the formal splendour of the place  what a perfect mans house she said peering about you can see that everything has been done to order they have their own taste theyre artistic enough for thator the father isand theyve given orders to have things done so and so and the new york upholsterer has come up and taken the measure of the rooms and done it but it isnt like new york and it isnt individual the whole house is just like those girls tailormade costumes in character they were made in new york but they dont wear them with the new york style theres no more atmosphere about them than if they were young men dressed up there isnt a thing lacking in the house here theres an awful completeness but even the ornaments seem laid on like the hot and cold water i never saw a handsomer more uninviting room than that drawing room i suppose the etching will come some time after supper what do you think of it all alice  oh i dont know they must be very rich said the girl indifferently  you cant tell country people of a certain kind are apt to put everything on their backs and their walls and floors of course such a house here doesnt mean what it would in town she examined the texture of the carpet more critically and the curtains she had no shame about a curiosity that made her daughter shrink  dont mamma pleaded the girl what if they should come  they wont come said mrs pasmer and her notice being called to alice she made her take off the ribbon youre better without it  im so nervous i dont know what im doing said alice removing it with a whimper  well i cant have you breaking down cried her mother warningly she really wished to shake her as a culmination of her own conflicting emotions alice stop this instant stop it i say  but if i dont like her whimpered alice  youre not going to marry her now stop here bathe your eyes theyre all red though i dont know that it matters yes theyll expect you to have been crying said mrs pasmer seeing the situation more and more clearly its perfectly natural but she took some cologne on a handkerchief and recomposed alices countenance for her there the colour becomes you and i never saw your eyes look so bright  there was a pathos in their brilliancy which of course betrayed her to the mavering girls it softened eunice and encouraged minnie who had been a little afraid of the pasmers they both kissed alice with sisterly affection their father merely saw how handsome she looked and dans heart seemed to melt in his breast with tenderness  in recognition of the different habits of their guests they had dinner instead of tea the portuguese cook had outdone himself and course followed course in triumphal succession mrs pasmer praised it all with a sincerity that took away a little of the zest she felt in making flattering speeches  everything about the table was perfect but in a mans fashion like the rest of the house it lacked the atmospheric charm the otherwise indefinable grace which a womans taste gives it was in fact elbridge maverings taste which had characterised the whole the daughters simply accepted and approved  yes said eunice we havent much else to do so we eat and joe does his best to spoil us  joe  joes the cook all portuguese cooks are joe  how very amusing said mrs pasmer you must let me speak of your grapes i never saw anything sowellexcept your roses  there you touched father in two tender spots he cultivates both  really alice did you ever see anything like these roses  alice looked away from dan a moment and blushed to find that she had been looking so long at him  ah i have said mavering gallantly  does he often do it asked mrs pasmer in an obvious aside to eunice  dan answered for him he never had such a chance before  between coffee which they drank at table and tea which they were to take in mrs maverings room they acted upon a suggestion from eunice that her father should show mrs pasmer his rosehouse at one end of the diningroom was a little apse of glass full of flowering plants growing out of the ground and with a delicate fountain tinkling in their midst dan ran before the rest and opened two glass doors in the further side of this halfbubble and at the same time with a touch flashed up a succession of brilliant lights in some space beyond from which there gushed in a wave of hothouse fragrance warm heavy humid it was a pretty little effect for guests new to the house and was part of elbridge maverings pleasure in this feature of his place mrs pasmer responded with generous sympathy for if she really liked anything with her whole heart it was an effect and she traversed the halfbubble by its pebbled path showering praises right and left with a fulness and accuracy that missed no detail while alice followed silently her hand in minnie maverings and cold with suppressed excitement the rosehouse was divided by a wall pierced with frequent doorways over which the trees were trained and the roses hung and on either side were ranks of rare and costly kinds weighed down with bud and bloom the air was thick with their breath and the pungent odours of the rich soil from which they grew and the glass roof was misted with the mingled exhalations  mr mavering walked beside alice modestly explaining the difficulties of rose culture and his method of dealing with the red spider he had a stout knife in his hand and he cropped long heavyladen stems of roses from the walls and the beds casually giving her their different names and laying them along his arm in a massive sheaf  mrs pasmer and eunice had gone forward with dan and were waiting for them at the thither end of the rosehouse  alice just imagine the grapery is beyond this cried the girls mother  its a cold grapery said mr mavering i hope youll see it tomorrow  oh why not tonight shouted dan  because its a cold grapery said eunice and after this rosehouse its an arctic grapery youre crazy dan  well i want alice to see it anyway he persisted wilfully theres nothing like a cold grapery by starlight ill get some wraps they all knew that he wished to be alone with her a moment and the three women consenting with their hearts protested with their tongues following him in his flight with their chorus and greeting his return he muffled her to the chin in a furlined overcoat which he had laid hands on the first thing and her mother still protesting helped to tie a scarf over her hair so as not to disarrange it here he pointed we can run through it and its worth seeing better come he said to the others as he opened the door and hurried alice down the path under the keen sparkle of the crystal roof blotched with the leaves and bunches of the vines coming out of the dense sensuous vaporous air of the rosehouse into this clear thin atmosphere delicately penetrated with the fragrance pure and cold of the fruit it was as if they had entered another world his arm crept round her in the odorous obscurity  look up see the stars through the vines but when she lifted her face he bent his upon it for a wild kiss  dont dont she murmured i want to think i dont know what im doing  neither do i i feel as if i were a blessed ghost  perhaps it is only in these ecstasies of the senses that the soul ever reaches selfconsciousness on earth and it seems to be only the mansoul which finds itself even in this abandon the womansoul has always something else to think of  what shall we do said the girl if weoh i dread to meet your mother is she like either of your sisters  no he cried joyously shes like me if youre not afraid of me and you dont seem to be  youre all i haveyoure all i have in the world do you think shell like me oh do you love me dan  you darling you divine the rest was a mad embrace if youre not afraid of me you wont mind mother i wanted you here alone for just a last word to tell you you neednt be afraid to tell you tobut i neednt tell you how to act you mustnt treat her as an invalidyou must treat her like any one else thats what she likes but youll know whats best alice be yourself and shell like you well enough im not afraid     xxxiii  when she entered mrs maverings room alice first saw the pictures the bricabrac the flowers the dazzle of lights and then the invalid propped among her pillows and vividly expectant of her she seemed all eager eyes to the girl aware next of the strong resemblance to dan in her features and of the careful toilet the sick woman had made for her to youth all forms of suffering are abhorrent and alice had to hide a repugnance at sight of this spectre of what had once been a pretty woman through the egotism with which so many years of flattering subjection in her little world had armed her mrs mavering probably did not feel the girls shrinking or if she did took it for the natural embarrassment which she would feel she had satisfied herself that she was looking her best and that her cap and the lace jacket she wore were very becoming and softened her worst points the hangings of her bed and the richly embroidered crimson silk coverlet were part of the coquetry of her costume from which habit had taken all sense of ghastliness she was proud of them and she was not aware of the scent of drugs that insisted through the odour of the flowers  she lifted herself on her elbow as dan approached with alice and the girl felt as if an intense light had been thrown upon her from head to foot in the moment of searching scrutiny that followed the invalids set look broke into a smile and she put out her hand neither hot nor cold but of a dry neutral spiritual temperature and pulled alice down and kissed her  why child your hands like ice she exclaimed without preamble we used to say that came from a warm heart  i guess it comes from a cold grapery in this case mother said dan with his laugh ive just been running alice through it and perhaps a little excitement  excitement echoed his mother cold grapery i dare say and very silly of you dan but theres no occasion for excitement as if we were strangers sit down in that chair my dear and dan you go round to the other side of the bed i want alice all to myself i saw your photograph a week ago and ive thought about you for ages since and wondered whether you would approve of your old friend  oh yes whispered the girl suppressing a tremor and dans eyes were suffused with grateful tears at his mothers graciousness  alices reticence seemed to please the invalid i hope youll like all your old friends here youve begun with the worst among us but perhaps you like him the best because he is the worst i do  you may believe just half of that alice cried dan  then believe the best half or the half you like best said mrs mavering there must be something good in him if you like him have they welcomed you home my dear  weve all made a stagger at it said dan while alice was faltering over the words which were so slow to come  dont try to answer my formal stupidities you are welcome and thats enough and more than enough of speeches did you have a comfortable journey up  oh very  was it cold  not at all the cars were very hot  have you had any snow yet at boston  no none at all yet  now i feel that were talking sense i hope you found everything in your room i cant look after things as i would like and so i inquire  theres everything said alice were very comfortable  im very glad i had dan look hes my housekeeper he understands me better than my girls hes like me more thats what makes us so fond of each other its a kind of personal vanity but he has his good points dan has hes very amiable and i was too at his ageand till i came here but im not going to tell you of his good points i dare say youve found them out ill tell you about his bad ones he says youre very serious are you she pressed the girls hand which she had kept in hers and regarded her keenly  alice dropped her eyes at the odd question i dont know she faltered sometimes  well thats good dans frivolous  oh sometimesonly sometimes he interposed  hes frivolous and hes very lightminded but hes none the worse for that  oh thank you said dan and alice still puzzled laughed provisionally  no i want you to understand that hes lighthearted too and thats a great thing in this world if youre serious youll be apt to be heavyhearted and then youll find dan of use and i hope hell know how to turn your seriousness to account too he needs something to keep him downto keep him from blowing away yes its very well for people to be opposites only they must understand each other if they do that then they get along lightheartedness or heavyheartedness comes to the same thing if they know how to use it for each other you see ive got to be a great philosopher lying here nobody dares contradict me or interrupt me when im constructing my theories and so i get them perfect  i wish i could hear them all said alice with sincerity that made mrs mavering laugh as lightheartedly as dan himself and that seemed to suggest the nest thing to her  you can for the asking almost any time are you a very truthful person my dear dont take the trouble to deny it if you are she added at alices stare you see im not at all conventional and you neednt be come tell the truth for once at any rate are you habitually truthful  yes i think i am said alice still staring  dans not said his mother quietly  oh see here now mother dont give me away  hell tell the truth in extremity of course and hell tell it if its pleasant always but if you dont expect much more of him you wont be disappointed and you can make him of great use  you see where i got it anyway alice said dan laughing across the bed at her  yes you got it from me i own it a great part of my life was made up of making life pleasant to others by fibbing i stopped it when i came here  oh not altogether mother urged her son you mustnt be too hard on yourself  she ignored his interruption youll find dan a great convenience with that agreeable habit of his you can get him to make all your verbal excuses for you hell do it beautifully and dictate all the thousand and one little lying notes youll have to write he wont mind it in the least and it will save you a great wearandtear of conscience  go on mother go on said dan with delighted eyes that asked of alice if it were not all perfectly charming  and you can come in with your habitual truthfulness where dan wouldnt know what to do poor fellow youll have the moral courage to come right to the point when he would like to shillyshally and you can be frank while hes trying to think how to make yes spell no  any other little compliments mother suggested dan  no said mrs mavering thats all i thought id better have it off my mind i knew youd never get it off yours and alice had better know the worst it is the worst my dear and if i talked of him till doomsday i couldnt say any more harm of him i neednt tell you how sweet he is you know that im sure but you cant know yet how gentle and forbearing he is how patient how full of kindness to every living soul how unselfish how  she lost her voice oh come now mother dan protested huskily  alice did not say anything she bent over without repugnance and gathered the shadowy shape into her strong young arms and kissed the wasted face whose unearthly coolness was like the leaf of a flower against her lips he never gave me a moments trouble said the mother and im sure hell make you happy how kind of you not to be afraid of me  afraid cried the girl with passionate solemnity i shall never feel safe away from you  the door opened upon the sound of voices and the others came in  mrs pasmer did not wait for an introduction but with an affectation of impulse which she felt mrs mavering would penetrate and respect she went up to the bed and presented herself dans mother smiled hospitably upon her and they had some playful words about their children mrs pasmer neatly conveyed the regrets of her husband who had hoped up to the last moment that the heavy cold he had taken would let him come with her and the invalid made her guest sit down on the right hand of her bed which seemed to be the place of honour while her husband took dans place on the left and admired his wifes skill in fence at the end of her encounter with mrs pasmer she called out with her strong voice why dont you get your banjo molly and play something  a banjo oh do cried mrs pasmer its so picturesque and interesting i heard that young ladies had taken it up and i should so like to hear it she had turned to mrs mavering again and she now beamed winningly upon her  alice regarded the girl with a puzzled frown as she brought her banjo in from another room and sat down with it she relaxed the severity of her stare a little as molly played one wild air after another singing some of them with an evidence of training in her naive effectiveness there were some mexican songs which she had learned in a late visit to their country and some creole melodies caught up in a winters sojourn to louisiana the elder sister accompanied her on the piano not with the hard resolute proficiency which one might have expected of eunice mavering but with a sympathy which was perhaps the expression of her share of the family kindliness  your children seem to have been everywhere said mrs pasmer with a sigh of flattering envy oh youre not going to stop she pleaded turning from mrs mavering to molly  i think dan had better do the rheumatic uncle now said eunice from the piano  oh yes the rheumatic uncledo said mrs pasmer we know the rheumatic uncle she added with a glance at alice dan looked at her too as if doubtful of her approval and then he told in character a yankee story which he had worked up from the talk of his friend the foreman it made them all laugh  mrs pasmer was the gayest she let herself go and throughout the evening she flattered right and left and said in her goodnight to mrs mavering that she had never imagined so delightful a time o mrs mavering i dont wonder your children love their home its a revelation     xxxiv  shes a cat dan said his mother quietly and not without liking when he looked in for his goodnight kiss after the rest were gone a perfect tabby but your alice is sublime  o mother  shes a little too sublime for me but youre young and you can stand it  dan laughed with delight yes i think i can mother all i ask is the chance  oh youre very much in love both of you theres no doubt about that what i mean is that shes very high strung very intense she has idealsany one can see that  dan took it all for praise yes he said eagerly thats what i told you and that will be the best thing about it for me i have no ideals  well you must find out what hers are and live up to them  oh there wont be any trouble about that said dan buoyantly  you must help her to find them out too he looked puzzled you mustnt expect the child to be too definite at first nor to be always right even when shes full of ideals you must be very patient with her dan  oh i will mother you know that how could i ever be impatient with alice  very forbearing and very kind and indefatigably forgiving ask your father how to behave  dan promised to do so with a laugh at the joke it had never occurred to him that his father was particularly exemplary in these things or that his mother idolised him for what seemed to dan simply a matterofcourse endurance of her sick whims and freaks and moods he broke forth into a vehement protest of his good intentions to which his mother did not seem very attentive after a while she asked  is she always so silent dan  well not with me mother of course she was a little embarrassed she didnt know exactly what to say i suppose  oh i rather liked that at least she isnt a rattlepate and we shall get acquainted we shall like each other she will understand me when you bring her home here to live with us and  yes said dan rising rather hastily and stooping over to his mother im not going to let you talk any more now or we shall have to suffer for it tomorrow night  he got gaily away before his mother could amplify a suggestion which spoiled a little of his pleasure in the praiseshe thought they were unqualified and enthusiastic praisesshe had been heaping upon alice he wished to go to bed with them all sweet and unalloyed in his thought to sleep to dream upon his perfect triumph  mrs pasmer was a long time in undressing and in calming down after the demands which the different events of the evening had made upon her resources  it has certainly been a very mixed evening alice she said as she took the pins out of her back hair and let it fall and she continued to talk as she went back and forth between their rooms what do you think of banjoplaying for young ladies isnt it rather rowdy decidedly rowdy i think and dans yankee story i expected to see the old gentleman get up and perform some trick  i suppose they do it to amuse mrs mavering said alice with cold displeasure  oh its quite right tittered mrs pasmer it would be as much as their lives are worth if they didnt you can see that she rules them with a rod of iron what a will im glad youre not going to come under her sway i really think you couldnt be safe from her in the same hemisphere its well youre going abroad at once theyre a very selfconcentrated family dont you thinkvery selfsatisfied of course thats the danger of living off by themselves as they do they get to thinking theres nobody else in the world you would simply be absorbed by them its a hairbreadth escape  how splendidly dan contrasts with the others oh hes delightful hes a man of the world give me the world after all and hes so considerate of their rustic conceit what a house its perfectly baronialand ridiculous in any other country it would mean somethingsociety entertainments troops of guests but here it doesnt mean anything but money not that money isnt a very good thing i wish we had more of it but now you see how very little it can do by itself you looked very well alice and behaved with great dignity perhaps too much you ought to enter a little more into the spirit of things even if you dont respect them that oldest girl isnt particularly pleased i fancy though it doesnt matter really  alice replied to her mother from time to time with absent yeses and noes she sat by the window looking out on the hillside lawn before the house the moon had risen and poured a flood of snowy light over it in which the cold statues dimly shone and the firs in clumps and singly blackened with an inky solidity beyond wandered the hills their bare pasturage broken here and there by blotches of woodland  after her mother had gone to bed she turned her light down and resumed her seat by the window pressing her hot forehead against the pane and losing all sense of the scene without in the whirl of her thoughts  after this evening of gay welcome in dans family and those moments of tenderness with him her heart was troubled she now realised her engagement as something exterior to herself and her own family and confronted for the first time its responsibilities its ties and its claims it was not enough to be everything to dan she could not be that unless she were something to his family she did not realise this vividly but with the remoteness which all verities except those of sensation have for youth  her uneasiness was full of exultation of triumph she knew she had been admired by dans family and she experienced the sweetness of having pleased them for his sake his happy eyes shone before her but she was touched in her selflove by what her mother had coarsely characterised in them they had regarded her liking them as a matter of course his mother had ignored her even in pretending to decry dan to her but again this was very remote very momentary it was no nearer no more lasting on the surface of her happiness than the flying whiffs of thin cloud that chased across the moon and lost themselves in the vast blue around it     xxxv  people came to the first of mrs james bellinghams receptions with the expectation of pleasure which the earlier receptions of the season awaken even in the oldest and wisest but they tried to dissemble their eagerness in a fashionable tardiness we get later and later said mrs brinkley to john munt as she sat watching the slow gathering of the crowd by halfpast eleven it had not yet hidden mrs bellingham where she stood near the middle of the room from the pleasant corner they had found after accidentally arriving together mr brinkley had not come he said he might not be too old for receptions but he was too good in either case he preferred to stay at home we used to come at nine oclock and now we come at im getting into a quotation from mother goose i think  i thought it was browning said munt with his witticism manner neither he nor mrs brinkley was particularly glad to be together but at mrs james bellinghams it was well not to fling any companionship away till you were sure of something else besides mrs brinkley was indolent and goodnatured and munt was active and goodnatured and they were well fitted to get on for ten or fifteen minutes while they talked she kept an eye out for other acquaintance and he stood alert to escape at the first chance how is it we are here so earlyor rather you are she pursued irrelevantly  oh i dont know said munt accepting the implication of his superior fashion with pleasure i never mind being among the first its rather interesting to see people come indont you think  that depends a good deal on the people i dont find a great variety in their smirks and smiles to mrs bellingham i seem to be doing them all myself and theres a monotony about their apprehension and helplessness when theyre turned adrift thats altogether too much like my own no mr munt i cant agree with you that its interesting to see people come in its altogether too autobiographical what else have you to suggest  im afraid im at the end of my string said munt i suppose we shall see the pasmers and young mavering here tonight  mrs brinkley turned and looked sharply at him  youve heard of the engagement he asked  no decidedly i havent and after his flight from campobello its the last thing i expected to hear of when did it come out  only within a few days theyve been keeping it rather quiet mrs pasmer told me herself  mrs brinkley gave herself a moment for reflection well if he can stand it i suppose i can  that isnt exactly what people are saying to mrs pasmer mrs brinkley suggested munt with his humorous manner  i dare say theyre trying to make her believe that her daughter is sacrificed thats the way but she knows better  theres no doubt but shes informed herself she put me through my catechism about the maverings the day of the picnic down there  do you know them  bridge mavering and i were at harvard together  tell me about them mrs brinkley listened to munts praises of his old friend with an attention superficially divided with the people to whom she bowed and smiled the room was filling up well she said at the end hes a sweet young fellow i hope he likes his pasmers  i guess theres no doubt about his liking one of themthe principal one  yes if she is the principal one there was an implication in everything she said that dan mavering had been hoodwinked by mrs pasmer mature ladies always like to imply something of the sort in these cases they like to ignore the prime agency of youth and love and pretend that marriage is a game that parents play at with us as if we were in an old comedy it is a tradition will he take her home to live  no i heard that theyre all going abroadfor a year or two at least  ah i thought so cried mrs brinkley she looked up with whimsical pleasure in the uncertainty of an old gentleman who is staring hard at her through his glasses well she said with a pleasant sharpness do you make me out  as nearly as my belief in your wisdom will allow said the old gentleman as distinctly as his long white moustache and an apparent absence of teeth behind it would let him john munt had eagerly abandoned the seat he was keeping at mrs brinkleys side and had launched himself into the thickening crowd the old gentleman who was lank and tall folded himself down into it he continued as tranquilly as if seated quite alone with mrs brinkley and not minding that his voice with the senile crow in it made itself heard by others im always surprised to find sensible people at these things of janes theyre most extraordinary things janes idea of society is to turn a herd of human beings loose in her house and see what will come of it she has no more sense of hospitality or responsibility than the elements or divine providence you may come here and have a good timeif you can get it she wont object or you may die of solitude and inanition shed never know it i dont know but its rather sublime in her its like the indifference of fate but its rather rough on those who dont understand it she likes to see her rooms filled with pretty dresses but she has no social instincts and no social inspiration whatever she lights and heats and feeds her guests and then she leaves them to themselves shes a kind womanjane is a very goodnatured woman and i really think shed be grieved if she thought any one went away unhappy but she does nothing to make them at home in her houseabsolutely nothing  perhaps she does all they deserve for them i dont know that any one acquires merit by coming to an evening party and its impossible to be personally hospitable to everybody in such a crowd  yes ive sometimes taken that view of it and yet if you ask a stranger to your house you establish a tacit understanding with him that you wont forget him after you have him there i like to go about and note the mystification of strangers whove come here with some notion of a little attention its delightfully poignant i suffer with them its a cheap luxury of woe i follow them through all the turns and windings of their experience of course the theory is that being turned loose here with the rest they may speak to anybody but the fact is they cant sometimes i should like to hail some of these unfriended spirits but i havent the courage im not individually bashful but i have a thousand years of anglosaxon civilisation behind me there ought to be policemen to show strangers about and be kind to them ive just seen two pretty women cast away in a corner and clinging to a small watercolour on the wall with a show of interest that would melt a heart of stone why do you come mrs brinkley i should like to know youre not obliged to  no said mrs brinkley lowering her voice instinctively as if to bring his down i suppose i come from force of habit ive been coming a long time you know why do you come  because i cant sleep if i could sleep i should be at home in bed a weariness came into his thin face and dim eyes that was pathetic and passed into a whimsical sarcasm im not one of the great leisure class you know that voluntarily turns night into day do you know what i go about saying now  something amusing i suppose  youd better not be so sure of that ive discovered a fact or rather ive formulated an old one ive always been troubled how to classify people here there are so many exceptions and ive ended by broadly generalising them as women and men  mrs brinkley was certainly amused at this it seems to me that there youve been anticipated by naturenot to mention art  oh not in my particular view the women in america represent the aristocracy which exists everywhere else in both sexes you are born to the patrician leisure you have the accomplishments and the clothes and manners and ideals and we men are a natural commonalty born to business to newspapers to cigars and horses this natural female aristocracy of ours establishes the forms usages places and times of society the epicene aristocracies of other countries turn night into day in their social pleasures and our noblesse sympathetically follows their example you ladies who can lie till noon next day come to janes reception at eleven oclock and you drag along with you a herd of us brokers bankers merchants lawyers and doctors who must be at our offices and countingrooms before nine in the morning the hours of us workpeople are regulated by the wholesome industries of the great democracy which were a part of and the hours of our wives and daughters by the deleterious pleasures of the old world aristocracy thats the reason were not all at home in bed  i thought you were not at home in bed because you couldnt sleep  i know it and youve no idea how horrible a bed is that you cant sleep in the old mans voice broke in a tremor ah its a bed of torture i spend many a wicked hour in mine envying st lawrence his gridiron but what do you think of my theory  its a very pretty theory my only objection to it is that its too flattering you know i rather prefer to abuse my sex and to be set up as a natural aristocracyi dont know that i can quite agree to that even to account satisfactorily for being at your sisterinlaws reception  youre too modest mrs brinkley  no really there ought to be some men among usmen without morrows now why dont you and my husband set an example to your sex why dont you relax your severe sense of duty why need you insist upon being at your offices every morning at nine why dont you fling off these habits of lifelong industry and be gracefully indolent in the interest of the higher civilisation  bromfield corey looked round at her with a smile of relish for her satire her husband was a notoriously lazy man who had chosen to live restrictedly upon an inherited property rather than increase it by the smallest exertion  do you think we could get andy pasmer to join us  no i cant encourage you with that idea you must get on without mr pasmer hes going back to europe with his soninlaw  do you mean that their girls married  noengaged its just out  well i must say mrs pasmer has made use of her time he too liked to imply that it was all an effect of her manoeuvring and that the young people had nothing to do with it this survival from european fiction dies hard who is the young man  mrs brinkley gave him an account of dan mavering as she had seen him at campobello and of his family as she just heard of them mr munt was telling me about them as you came up  why was that john munt  yes didnt you know him  no said corey sadly i dont know anybody nowadays i seem to be going to pieces every way i dont call sixtynine such a very great age  not at all cried mrs brinkley im fiftyfour myself and brinkleys sixty  but i feel a thousand years old i dont see people and when i do i dont know em my heads in a cloud he let it hang heavily then he lifted it and said hes a nice comfortable fellow munt is why didnt he stop and talk a bit  well munts modest you know and i suppose he thought he might be the third that makes company a crowd besides nobody stops and talks a bit at these things theyre afraid of boring or being bored  yes theyre all in as unnatural a mood as if they were posing for a photograph i wonder who invented this sort of thing do you know said the old man that i think its rather worse with us than with any other people were a simple sincere folk domestic in our instincts not gregarious or frivolous in any way and when were wrenched away from our firesides and packed in our best clothes into janes gilded saloons we feel vindictive we feel wicked when the boston being abandons himselfor herselfto fashion she suffers a depravation into something quite lurid she has a bad conscience and she hardens her heart with talk thats tremendously cynical its amusing said corey staring round him purblindly at the groups and files of people surging and eddying past the corner where he sat with mrs brinkley  no its shocking said his companion at any rate you mustnt say such things even if you think them i cant let you go too far you know these young people think it heavenly here  she took with him the tone that elderly people use with those older than themselves who have begun to break there were authority and patronage in it at the bottom of her heart she thought that bromfield corey should not have been allowed to come but she determined to keep him safe and harmless as far as she could  from time to time the crowd was a stationary mass in front of them then it dissolved and flowed away to gather anew there were moments when the floor near them was quite vacant then it was inundated again with silken trains from another part of the house came the sound of music and most of the young people who passed went two and two as if they were partners in the dance and had come out of the ballroom between dances there was a good deal of nervous talk politely subdued among them but it was not the note of unearthly rapture which mrs brinkleys conventional claim had implied it was selfinterested eager anxious and was probably not different from the voice of good society anywhere     xxxvi  why theres dan mavering now said mrs brinkley rather to herself than to her companion and alone  dans face showed above most of the heads and shoulders about him it was flushed and looked troubled and excited he caught sight of mrs brinkley and his eyes brightened joyfully he slipped quickly through the crowd and bowed over her hand while he stammered out without giving her a chance for reply till the end o mrs brinkley im so glad to see you im goingi want to ask a great favour of you mrs brinkley i want to bringi want to introduce some friends of mine to yousome ladies mrs brinkley very nice people i met last summer at portland their fathergeneral wraynehas been building some railroads down east and theyre very nice people but they dont know any oneany ladiesand theyve been looking at the pictures ever since they came theyre very good pictures but it isnt an exhibition he broke down with a laugh  why of course mr mavering i shall be delighted said mrs brinkley with a hospitality rendered reckless by her sympathy with the young fellow by all means  oh thanksthank you aver so much said dan ill bring them to youtheyll understand he slipped into the crowd again  corey made an offer of going mrs brinkley stopped him with her fan nostay mr corey unless you wish to go i fancy its the people you were talking about and you must help me through with them  i ask nothing better said the old man unresentful of dans having not even seemed to see him in his generous preoccupation i should like to see how youll get on and perhaps i can be of use  of course you canthe greatest  but why hasnt he introduced them to his pasmers what eh oh corey made these utterances in response to a sharper pressure of mrs brinkleys fan on his arm  dan was opening a way through the crowd before them for two ladies whom he now introduced mrs frobisher mrs brinkley and miss wrayne  mrs brinkley cordially gave her hand to the ladies and said may i introduce mr corey mr mavering let me introduce you to mr corey the old man rose and stood with the little group  dans face shone with flattered pride and joyous triumph he bubbled out some happy incoherencies about the honour and pleasure while at the same time he beamed with tender gratitude upon mrs brinkley who was behaving with a gracious humorous kindliness to the aliens cast upon her mercies mrs frobisher after a halfhour of boston society was not that presence of easy gaiety which crossed dans path on the portland pavement the morning of his arrival from campobello but she was still a handsome effective woman of whom you would have hesitated to say whether she was showy or distinguished perhaps she was a little of both with an air of command bred of supremacy in frontier garrisons her sister was like her in the way that a young girl may be like a young matron they blossomed alike in the genial atmosphere of mrs brinkley and of mr corey he began at once to make bantering speeches with them both the friendliness of an old man and a stout elderly woman might not have been their ideal of success at an evening party used as they were to the unstinted homage of young captains and lieutenants but a brief experience of mrs bellinghams hospitality must have taught them humility and when a stout elderly gentleman whose baldness was still trying to be blond joined the group the spectacle was not without its points of resemblance to a social ovation perhaps it was a boston social ovation  hallo corey said this stout gentleman whom mrs brinkley at once introduced as mr bellingham and whose salutation corey returned with hallo charles of equal intimacy  mr bellingham caught at the name of frobisher mrs major dick frobisher  mrs colonel now but dick always said the lady with immediate comradery do you know my husband  i should think so said bellingham and a talk of common interest and mutual reminiscence sprang up between them bellingham graphically depicted his meeting with colonel frobisher the last time he was out on the plains and mrs frobisher and miss wrayne discovered to their great satisfaction that he was the brother of mrs stephen blake of omaba who had come out to the fort once with her husband and captured the garrison as they said mrs frobisher accounted for her present separation from her husband and said she had come on for a while to be with her father and sister who both needed more looking after than the indians her father had left the army and was building railroads  miss wrayne when she was not appealed to for confirmation or recollection by her sister was having a lively talk with corey and mrs brinkley she seemed to enter into their humour and no one paid much attention to dan mavering he hung upon the outskirts of the little group proffering unrequited sympathy and applause and at last he murmured something about having to go back to some friends and took himself off mrs frobisher and miss wrayne let him go with a certain shadethe lightest and yet evidentof not wholly satisfied pique women know how to accept a reparation on account and without giving a receipt in full  mrs brinkley gave him her hand with an effect of compassionate intelligence and appreciation of the sacrifice he must have made in leaving alice may i congratulate you she murmured  oh yes indeed thank you mrs brinkley he gushed tremulously and he pressed her hand hard and clung to it as if he would like to take her with him  neither of the older men noticed his going they were both taken in their elderly way with these two handsome young women and they professed regretbellingham that his mother was not there and corey that neither his wife nor daughters had come whom they might otherwise have introduced they did not offer to share their acquaintance with any one else but they made the most of it themselves as if knowing a good thing when they had it their devotion to mrs frobisher and her sister heightened the curiosity of such people as noticed it but it would be wrong to say that it moved any in that selflimited company with a strong wish to know the ladies the time comes to every man no matter how great a power he may be in society when the general social opinion retires him for senility and this time had come for bromfield corey he could no longer make or mar any success and charles bellingham was so notoriously amiable so deeply compromised by his inveterate habit of liking nearly every one that his notice could not distinguish or advantage a newcomer  he and corey took the ladies down to supper mrs brinkley saw them there together and a little later she saw old corey wander off forgetful of miss wrayne she saw dan mavering but not the pasmers and then when corey forgot miss wrayne she saw dan forlorn and bewildered looking approach the girl and offer her his arm for the return to the drawingroom she took it with a bright cold smile making white rings of ironical deprecation around the pupils of her eyes  what is that poor boy doing i wonder said mrs brinkley to herself     xxxvii  the next morning dan mavering knocked at boardmans door before the reporter was up this might have been any time before one oclock but it was really at halfpast nine boardman wanted to know who was there and when mavering had said it was he boardman seemed to ponder the fact awhile before mavering heard him getting out of bed and coming barefooted to the door he unlocked it and got back into bed then he called out come in and mavering pushed the door open impatiently but he stood blank and silent looking helplessly at his friend a strong glare of winter light came in through the naked sashfor boardman apparently not only did not close his windowblinds but did not pull down his curtains when he went to bedand shone upon his gay shrewd face where he lay showing his popcorn teeth in a smile at mavering  prefer to stand he asked by and by after mavering had remained standing in silence with no signs of proposing to sit down or speak mavering glanced at the only chair in the room boardmans clothes dripped and dangled over it throw em on the bed he said following maverings glance  ill take the bed myself said mavering and he sat down on the side of it and was again suggestively silent  boardman moved his head on the pillow as he watched maverings face with the agreeable sense of personal security which we all feel in viewing trouble from the outside you seem balled up about something  mavering sighed heavily balled up its no word for it boardman im done for yesterday i was the happiest fellow in the world and nowyes its all over with me and its my own fault as usual look at that he jerked boardman a note which he had been holding fast in his band and got up and went to look himself at the wide range of chimneypots and slated roofs which boardmans dormerwindow commanded  want me to read it boardman asked and mavering nodded without glancing round it dispersed through the air of boardmans room as he unfolded it a thin elect perfume like a feminine presence refined and strict and boardman involuntarily passed his hand over his rumpled hair as if to make himself a little more personable before reading the letter  dear mr maveringi enclose the ring you gave me the other day and i release you from the promise you gave with it i am convinced that you wronged yourself in offering either without your whole heart and i care too much for your happiness to let you persist in your sacrifice  in begging that you will not uselessly attempt to see me but that you will consider this note final i know you will do me the justice not to attribute an ungenerous motive to me i shall rejoice to hear of any good that may befall you and i shall try not to envy any one through whom it comesyours sincerely  alice pasmer  psi say nothing of circumstances or of persons i feel that any comment of mine upon them would be idle   mavering looked up at the sound boardman made in refolding the letter boardman grinned with sparkling eyes pretty neat he said  pretty infernally neat roared mavering  do you suppose she means business  of course she means business why shouldnt she  i dont know why should she  well ill tell you boardman i suppose i shall have to tell you if im going to get any good out of you but its a dose he came away from the window and swept boardmans clothes off the chair preparatory to taking it  boardman lifted his head nervously from the pillow  oh ill put them on the bed if youre so punctilious cried mavering  i dont mind the clothes said boardman i thought i heard my watch knock on the floor in my vest pocket just take it out will you and see if youve stopped it  oh confound your old waterbury all the worlds stopped why shouldnt your watch stop too mavering tugged it out of the pocket and then shoved it back disdainfully you couldnt stop that thing with anything short of a sledgehammer its rattling away like a mowingmachine you know those portland womenthose ladies i spent the day with when you were down there at the regattathe day i came from campobellomrs frobisher and her sister he agglutinated one query to another till he saw a light of intelligence dawn in boardmans eye well theyre at the bottom of it i suppose i was introduced to them on class day and i ought to have shown them some attention there but the moment i saw alicemiss pasmeri forgot all about em but they didnt seem to have noticed it much and i made it all right with em that day at portland and they came up in the fall and i made an appointment with them to drive out to cambridge and show them the place they were to take me up at the art museum but that was the day i met miss pasmer and ii forgot about those women again  boardman was one of those who seldom laugh but his grin expressed all the malicious enjoyment he felt he said nothing in the impressive silence which mavering let follow at this point  oh you think it was funny cried mavering i thought it was funny too but alice herself opened my eyes to what id done and i always intended to make it all right with them when i got the chance i supposed she wished me too  boardman grinned afresh  she told me i must though she seemed to dislike my having been with them the day after shed thrown me over but ifmavering interrupted himself to say as the grin widened on boardmans faceif you think it was any case of vulgar jealousy youre very much mistaken boardman she isnt capable of it and she was so magnanimous about it that i made up my mind to do all i could to retrieve myself i felt that it was my duty to her well last night at mrs jim bellinghams reception  a look of professional interest replaced the derision in boardmans eyes any particular occasion for the reception given in honour of anybody  ill contribute to your society notes some other time boardman said mavering haughtily im speaking to a friend not an interviewer well whom should i see after the first waltzid been dancing with alice and we were taking a turn through the drawingroom and she hanging on my arm and i knew everybody saw how it was and i was feeling wellwhom should i see but these women they were in a corner by themselves looking at a picture and trying to look as if they were doing it voluntarily but i could see at a glance that they didnt know anybody and i knew they had better be in the heart of the sahara without acquaintances than where they were and when they bowed forlornly across the room to me my heart was in my mouth i felt so sorry for them and i told alice who they were and i supposed shed want to rush right over to them with me  and did she rush asked boardman filling up a pause which mavering made in wiping his face  how infernally hot you have it in here he went to the window and threw it up and then did not sit down again but continued to walk back and forth as he talked she didnt seem to know who they were at first and when i made her understand she hung back and said those showy things and i must say i think she was wrong they were dressed as quietly as ninetenths of the people there only they are rather large handsome women i said i thought we ought to go and speak to them they seemed stranded there but she didnt seem to see it and when i persisted she said well you go if you think best but take me to mamma and i supposed it was all right and i told mrs pasmer id be back in a minute and then i went off to those women and after id talked with them a while i saw mrs brinkley sitting with old bromfield corey in another corner and i got them across and introduced them after id explained to mrs brinkley who they were and they began to have a good time and ididnt  just so said boardman  i thought i hadnt been gone any while at all from alice but the weather had changed by the time i had got back alice was pretty serious and she was engaged two or three dances deep and i could see her looking over the fellows shoulders as she went round and round pretty pale i hung about till she was free but then she couldnt dance with me she said her head ached and she made her mother take her home before supper and i mooned round like my own ghost a while and then i went home and as if that wasnt enough i could see by the looks of those other womenold corey forgot miss wrayne in the supperroom and i had to take her backthat i hadnt made it right with them even they were as hard and smooth as glass id ruined myself and ruined myself for nothing  mavering flung boardmans chair over and seated himself on its rungs  i went to bed and waited for the next thing to happen i found my thunderbolt waiting for me when i woke up i didnt know what it was going to be but when i felt a ring through the envelope of that note i knew what it was i mindread that note before i opened it  give it to the society for psychical research suggested boardman been to breakfast  breakfast echoed mavering well now boardman what use do you suppose ive got for breakfast under the circumstances  well not very much but your storys made me pretty hungry would you mind turning your back or going out and sitting on the top step of the stairs landing or something while i get up and dress  oh i can go if you want to get rid of me said mavering with unresentful sadness but i hoped you might have something to suggest boardy  well ive suggested two things and you dont like either why not go round and ask to see the old lady  mrs pasmer  yes  well i thought of that but i didnt like to mention it for fear youd sit on it when would you go  well about as quick as i could get there its early for a call but its a peculiar occasion and itll show your interest in the thing you cant very well let it cool on your hands unless you mean to accept the situation  what do you mean demanded mavering getting up and standing over boardman do you think i could accept the situation as you call it and live  you did once said boardman you couldnt unless you could fix it up with mrs frobishers sister  mavering blushed it was a different thing altogether then i could have broken off then but i tell you it would kill me now ive got in too deep my whole lifes set on that girl you cant understand boardman because youve never been there but i couldnt give her up  all right better go and see the old lady without loss of time or the old man if you prefer  mavering sat down on the edge of the bed again look here boardman what do you mean  by what  by being so confoundedly heartless did you suppose that i wanted to pay those women any attention last night from an interested motive  seems to have been miss pasmers impression  well youre mistaken she had no such impression she would have too much selfrespect too much pridemagnanimity she would know that after such a girl as she is i couldnt think of any other woman the thing is simply impossible  thats the theory  theory its the practice  certain exceptions  theres no exception in my case no sir i tell you this thing is for all timefor eternity it makes me or it mars me once for all she may listen to me or she may not listen but as long as she lives theres no other woman alive for me  better go and tell her so youre wasting your arguments on me  why  because im convinced already because people always marry their first and only loves because people never marry twice for love because ive never seen you hit before and i know you never could be again now go and convince miss pasmer shell believe you because shell know that she can never care for any one but you and you naturally cant care for anybody but her its a perfectly clear case all youve got to do is to set it before her  if i were you i wouldnt try to work that cynical racket boardman said mavering he rose but he sighed drearily and regarded boardmans grin with lacklustre absence but he went away without saying anything more and walked mechanically toward the cavendish as he rang at the door of mrs pasmers apartments he recalled another early visit he had paid there he thought how joyful and exuberant he was then and how crushed and desperate now he was not without youthful satisfaction in the disparity of his different moods it seemed to stamp him as a man of large and varied experience     xxxviii  mrs pasmer was genuinely surprised to see mavering and he pursued his advantageif it was an advantageby coming directly to the point he took it for granted that she knew all about the matter and he threw himself upon her mercy without delay  mrs pasmer you must help me about this business with alice he broke out at once i dont know what to make of it but i know i can explain it of course he added smiling ruefully the two statements dont hang together but what i mean is that if i can find out what the trouble is i can make it all right because theres nothing wrong about it dont you see  mrs pasmer tried to keep the mystification out of her eye but she could not even succeed in seeming to do so which she would have liked almost as well  dont you know what i mean asked dan  mrs pasmer chanced it that alice was a little out of sorts last night she queried leadingly  yes said mavering fervently and about herher writing to me  writing to you mrs pasmer was going to ask when dan gave her the letter  i dont know whether i ought to show it but i must i must have your help and i cant unless you understand the case  mrs pasmer had begun to read the note it explained what the girl herself had refused to give any satisfactory reason forher early retirement from the reception her mysterious disappearance into her own room on reaching home and her resolute silence on the way mrs pasmer had known that there must be some trouble with dan and she had suspected that alice was vexed with him on account of those women but it was beyond her cheerful imagination that she should go to such lengths in her resentment she could conceive of her wishing to punish him to retaliate her suffering on him but to renounce him for it was another thing and she did not attribute to her daughter any other motive than she would have felt herself it was always this way with mrs pasmer she followed her daughter accurately up to a certain point beyond that she did not believe the girl knew herself what she meant and perhaps she was not altogether wrong girlhood is often a turmoil of wild impulses ignorant exaltations mistaken ideals which really represent no intelligent purpose and come from disordered nerves illadvised reading and the erroneous perspective of inexperience mrs pasmer felt this and she was tempted to break into a laugh over alices heroics but she preferred to keep a serious countenance partly because she did not feel the least seriously she was instantly resolved not to let this letter accomplish anything more than dans temporary abasement and she would have preferred to shorten this to the briefest moment possible she liked him and she was convinced that alice could never do better if half so well she would now have preferred to treat him with familiar confidence to tell him that she had no idea of alices writing him that nonsensical letter and he was not to pay the least attention to it for of course it meant nothing but another principle of her complex nature came into play and she silently folded the note and returned it to dan trembling before her  well he quavered  well returned mrs pasmer judicially while she enjoyed his tremor whose needlessness inwardly amused herwell of course alice was  annoyed i know and it was all my faultor my misfortune but i assure you mrs pasmer that i thought i was doing something that would please herin the highest and noblest way now dont you know i did  mrs pasmer again wished to laugh but in the face of dans tragedy she had to forbear she contented herself with saying of course but perhaps it wasnt the best time for pleasing her just in that way  it was then or never i can see nowwhy i could see all the timejust how it might look but i supposed alice wouldnt care for that and if i hadnt tried to make some reparation then to mrs frobisher and her sister i never could dont you see  yes certainly but  and alice herself told me to go and look after them interposed mavering he suppressed a little uncandidly the fact of her first reluctance  but you know it was the first time you had been out together  yes  and naturally she would wish to have you a good deal to herself or at least not seeming to run after other people  yes yes i know that  and no one ever likes to be taken at their word in a thing like that  i ought to have thought of that but i didnt i wish i had gone to you first mrs pasmer somehow it seems to me as if i were very young and inexperienced i didnt use to feel so i wish you were always on hand to advise me mrs pasmer dan hung his head and his face usually so gay was blotted with gloom  will you take my advice now asked mrs pasmer  indeed i will cried the young fellow lifting his head what is it  see alice about this  dan jumped to his feet and the sunshine broke out over his face again mrs pasmer i promised to take your advice and ill do it i will see her but how where let me have your advice on that point too  they began to laugh together and dan was at once inexpressibly happy those two light natures thoroughly comprehended each other  mrs pasmer had proposed his seeing alice with due seriousness but now she had a longing to let herself go she felt all the pleasure that other people felt in doing dan mavering a pleasure and something more because he was so perfectly intelligible to her she let herself go  you might stay to breakfast  mrs pasmer i willi will do that too im awfully hungry and i put myself in your hands  let me see said mrs pasmer thoughtfully how it can be contrived  yes said mavering ready for a panic how she wouldnt stand a surprise  no i had thought of that  no behindascreen or nextroom business  no said mrs pasmer with a light sigh alice is peculiar im afraid she wouldnt like it  isnt there any little ruse she would like  i cant think of any perhaps id better go and tell her youre here and wish to see her  do you think youd better asked dan doubtfully perhaps she wont come  she will come said mrs pasmer confidently  she did not say that she thought alice would be curious to know why he had come and that she was too just to condemn him unheard  but she was right about the main point alice came and dan could see with his own weary eyes that she had not slept either  she stopped just inside the portiere and waited for him to speak but he could not though a smile from his sense of the absurdity of their seriousness hovered about his lips his first impulse was to rush upon her and catch her in his arms and perhaps this might have been well but the moment for it passed and then it became impossible  well she said at last lifting her head and looking at him with impassioned solemnity you wished to see me i hoped you wouldnt it would have spared me something but perhaps i had no right to your forbearance  alice how can you say such things to me asked the young fellow deeply hurt  she responded to his tone im sorry if it wounds you but i only mean what i say  youve a right to my forbearance and not only that but to mymy life to everything that i am cried dan in a quiver of tenderness at the sight of her and the sound of her voice alice why did you write me that letterwhy did you send me back my ring  because she said looking him seriously in the facebecause i wished you to be free to be happy  well youve gone the wrong way about it i can never be free from you i never can be happy without you  i did it for your good then which ought to be above your happiness dont think i acted hastily i thought it over all night long i didnt sleep  neither did i interposed dan  and i saw that i had no claim to you that you never could be truly happy with me  ill take the chances he interrupted alice you dont suppose i cared for those women any more than the ground under your feet do you i dont suppose i should ever have given them a second thought if you hadnt seemed to feel so badly about my neglecting them and i thought youd be pleased to have me try to make it up to them if i could  i know your motive was goodthe noblest dont think that i did you injustice or that i was vexed because you went away with them  you sent me  yes and now i give you up to them altogether it was a mistake a crime for me to think we could be anything to each other when our love began with a wrong to some one else  with a wrong to some one else  you neglected them on class day after you saw me  why of course i did how could i help it  a flush of pleasure came into the girls pale face but she banished it and continued gravely then at portland you were with them all day  youd given me upyoud thrown me over alice he pleaded  i know that i dont blame you but you made them believe that you were very much interested in them  i dont know what i did i was perfectly desperate  yes it was my fault and then when they came to meet you at the museum i had made you forget them id made you wound them and insult them again no ive thought it all out and we never could be happy dont think that i do it from any resentful motive  alice how could i think thatof you  i have triedprayedto be purified from that and i believe that i have been  you never had a selfish thought  and i have come to see that you were perfectly right in what you did last night at first i was wounded  oh did i wound you alice he grieved  but afterward i could see that you belonged to them and not me andand i give you up to them yes freely fully  alice stood there beautiful pathetic austere and dan had halted in the spot to which he had advanced when her eye forbade him to approach nearer he did not mean to joke and it was in despair that he cried out but which alice there are two of them  two she repeated vaguely  yes mrs frobisher and miss wrayne you cant give me up to both of them  both she repeated again she could not condescend to specify it would be ridiculous and as it was she felt her dignity hopelessly shaken the tears came into her eyes  yes and neither of them wants methey havent got any use for me mrs frobisher is married already and miss wrayne took the trouble last night to let me feel that so far as she was concerned i hadnt made it all right and couldnt i thought i had rather a cold parting with you alice but it was quite tropical to what you left me to a faint smile mingled with a blush of relenting stole into her face and he hurried on i dont suppose i tried very hard to thaw her out i wasnt much interested if you must give me up you must give me up to some one else for they dont want me and i dont want them alices head dropped lover and he could come nearer now without her seeming to know it but why need you give me up theres really no occasion for it i assure you  i wished she explained to show you that i loved you for something above yourself and myselffar above either  she stopped and dropped the hand which she had raised to fend him off and he profited by the little pause she made to take her in his arms without seeming to do so well he said i dont believe i was formed to be loved on a very high plane but im not too proud to be loved for my own sake and i dont think theres anything above you alice  oh yes there is i dont deserve to be happy and thats the reason why im not allowed to be happy in any noble way i cant bear to give you up you know i cant but you ought to give me upindeed you ought i have ideals but i cant live up to them you ought to go you ought to leave me she accented each little sentence by vividly pressing herself to his heart and he had the wisdom or the instinct to treat their reconciliation as nothing settled but merely provisional in its nature  well well see about that i dont want to go till after breakfast anyway your mother says i may stay and im awfully hungry if i see anything particularly base in you perhaps i shant come back to lunch  dan would have liked to turn it alt off into a joke now that the worst was apparently over but alice freed herself from him and held him off with her hand set against his breast does mamma know about it she demanded sternly  well she knows theres been some misunderstanding said dan with a laugh that was anxious in view of the clouds possibly gathering again  how much  well i cant say exactly he would not say that he did not know but he felt that he could truly say that he could not say  she dropped her hand and consented to be deceived dan caught her again to his breast but he had an odd vague sense of doing it carefully of using a little of the caution with which one seizes the stem of a rose between the thorns  i can bear to be ridiculous with you she whispered with an implication which he understood  you havent been ridiculous dearest he said and his tension gave way in a convulsive laugh which partially expressed his feeling of restored security and partly his amusement in realising how the situation would have pleased mrs pasmer if she could have known it  mrs pasmer was seated behind her coffee biggin at the breakfasttable when he came into the room with alice and she lifted an eye from its glass bulb long enough to catch his flying glance of exultation and admonition then while she regarded the chemical struggle in the bulb with the rapt eye of a magician reading fate in his crystal ball she questioned herself how much she should know and how much she should ignore it was a great moment for mrs pasmer full of delicious choice do you understand this process mr mavering she said glancing up at him warily for farther instruction  ive seen it done said dan but i never knew how it was managed i always thought it was going to blow up but it seemed to me that if you were good and true and very meek and had a conscience void of offence it wouldnt  yes thats what it seems to depend upon said mrs pasmer keeping her eye on the bulb she dodged suddenly forward and put out the spiritlamp now have your coffee she cried with a great air of relief you must need it by this time she said with a low cynical laughboth of you  did you always make coffee with a biggin in france mrs pasmer asked dan and he laughed out the last burden that lurked in his heart  mrs pasmer joined him no mr mavering in france you dont need a biggin i set mine up when we went to england  alice looked darkly from one of these light spirits to the other and then they all shrieked together  they went on talking volubly from that and they talked as far away from what they were thinking about as possible they talked of europe and mrs pasmer said where they would live and what they would do when they all got back there together dan abetted her and said that they must cross in june mrs pasmer said that she thought june was a good month he asked if it were not the month of the marriages too and she answered that he must ask alice about that alice blushed and laughed her sweet reluctant laugh and said she did not know she had never been married  it was silly but it was delicious it made them really one family deep in his consciousness a compunction pierced and teased dan but he said to himself that it was all a joke about their european plans or else his people would consent to it if he really wished it     xxxix  a period of entire harmony and tenderness followed the episode which seemed to threaten the lovers with the loss of each other mavering forbore to make alice feel that in attempting a sacrifice which consulted only his good and ignored his happiness and then failing in it so promptly she had played rather a silly part after one or two tentative jokes in that direction he found the ground unsafe and with the instinct which served him in place of more premeditated piety he withdrew and was able to treat the affair with something like religious awe he was obliged in fact to steady alices own faith in it and to keep her from falling under dangerous selfcondemnation in that and other excesses of uninstructed selfdevotion this brought no fatigue to his robust affection whatever it might have done to a heart more tried in such exercises love acquaints youth with many things in character and temperament which are none the less interesting because it never explains them and dan was of such a make that its revelations of alice were charming to him because they were novel he had thought her a person of such serene and flawless wisdom that it was rather a relief to find her subject to gusts of imprudence to unexpected passions and resentments to foibles and errors like other people her power of cold reticence which she could employ at will was something that fascinated him almost as much as that habit of impulsive concession which seemed to came neither from her will nor her reason he was a person himself who was so eager to give other people pleasure that he quivered with impatience to see them happy through his words or acts he could not bear to think that any one to whom he was speaking was not perfectly comfortable in regard to him and it was for this reason perhaps that he admired a girl who could prescribe herself a line of social conduct and follow it out regardless of individual pangswho could act from ideals and principles and not from emotions and sympathies he knew that she had the emotions and sympathies for there were times when she lavished them on him and that she could seem without them was another proof of that depth of nature which he liked to imagine had first attracted him to her dan mavering had never been able to snub any one in his life it gave him a great respect for alice that it seemed not to cost her an effort or a regret and it charmed him to think that her severity was part of the unconscious sham which imposed her upon the world for a person of inflexible design and invariable constancy to it he was not long in seeing that she shared this illusion if it was an illusion and that perhaps the only person besides himself who was in the joke was her mother mrs pasmer and he grew more and more into each others confidence in talking alice over and he admired the intrepidity of this lady who was not afraid of her daughter even in the girls most topping moments of selfabasement for his own part these moods of hers never failed to cause him confusion and anxiety they commonly intimated themselves parenthetically in the midst of some blissful talk they were having and overcast his clear sky with retrospective ideals of conduct or presentimental plans for contingencies that might never occur he found himself suddenly under condemnation for not having reproved her at a given time when she forced him to admit she had seemed unkind or cold to others she made him promise that even at the risk of alienating her affections he would make up for her deficiencies of behaviour in such matters whenever he noticed them she now praised him for what he had done for mrs frobisher and her sister at mrs bellinghams reception she said it was generous heroic but mavering rested satisfied with his achievement in that instance and did not attempt anything else of the kind he did not reason from cause to effect in regard to it a mans love is such that while it lasts he cannot project its object far enough from him to judge it reasonable or unreasonable but dans instincts had been disciplined and his perceptions sharpened by that experience besides in bidding him take this impartial and even admonitory course toward her she stipulated that they should maintain to the world a perfect harmony of conduct which should be an outward image of the union of their lives she said that anything less than a continued selfsacrifice of one to the other was not worthy of the name of love and that she should not be happy unless he required this of her she said that they ought each to find out what was the most distasteful thing which they could mutually require and then do it she asked him to try to think what she most hated and let her do that for him as for her she only asked to ask nothing of him  mavering could not worship enough this nobility of soul in her and he celebrated it to boardman with the passionate need of imparting his rapture which a lover feel boardman acquiesced in silence with a glance of reserved sarcasm or contented himself with laconic satire of his friends general condition and avoided any comment that might specifically apply to the points dan made alice allowed him to have this confidant and did not demand of him a report of all he said to boardman a main fact of their love she said must be their utter faith in each other she had her own confidante and the disparity of years between her and miss cotton counted for nothing in the friendship which their exchange of trust and sympathy cemented miss cotton in the freshness of her sympathy and the ideality of her inexperience was in fact younger than alice at whose feet in the things of soul and character she loved to sit she never said to her what she believed that a girl of her exemplary principles a nature conscious of such noble ideals so superior to other girls who in her place would be given up to the happiness of the moment and indifferent to the sense of duty to herself and to others was sacrificed to a person of maverings gay bright nature and trivial conception of life she did not deny his sweetness that was perhaps the one saving thing about him and she confessed that he simply adored alice that counted for everything and it was everything in his favour that he could appreciate such a girl she hoped she prayed that alice might never realise how little depth he had that she might go through life and never suspect it if she did so then they might be happy together to the end or at least alice might never know she was unhappy  miss cotton never said these things in so many words it is doubtful if she ever said them in any form of words with her sensitive anxiety not to do injustice to any one she took dans part against those who viewed the engagement as she allowed it to appear only to her secret heart she defended him the more eagerly because she felt that it was for alices sake and that everything must be done to keep her from knowing how people looked at the affair even to changing peoples minds she said to all who spoke to her of it that of course alice was superior to him but he was devoted to her and he would grow into an equality with her he was naturally very refined she said and if he was not a very serious person he was amiable beyond anything she alleged many little incidents of their acquaintance at campobello in proof of her theory that he had an instinctive appreciation of alice and she was sure that no one could value her nobleness of character more than he she had seen them a good deal together since their engagement and it was beautiful to see his manner with her they were opposites but she counted a good deal upon that very difference in their temperaments to draw them to each other  it was an easy matter to see dan and alice together their engagement came out in the usual way it had been announced to a few of their nearest friends and intelligence of it soon spread from their own set through society generally it had been published in the sunday papers while it was still in the tender condition of a rumour and had been denied by some of their acquaintance and believed by all  the pasmer cousinship had been just in the performance of the duties of blood toward alice since the return of her family from europe and now did what was proper in the circumstances all who were connected with her called upon her and congratulated her they knew dan the younger of them much better than they knew her and though he had shrunk from the nebulous bulk of social potentiality which every young man is to that much smaller nucleus to which definite betrothal reduces him they could be perfectly sincere in calling him the sweetest fellow that ever was and too lovely to live  in such a matter mr pasmer was naturally nothing he could not be less than he was at other times but he was not more and it was mrs pasmer who shared fully with her daughter the momentary interest which the engagement gave alice with all her kindred they believed of course that they recognised in it an effect of her skill in managing they agreed to suppose that she had got mavering for alice and to ignore the beauty and passion of youth as factors in the case the closest of the kindred with the romantic delicacy of americans in such things approached the question of dans position and prospects and heard with satisfaction the good accounts which mrs pasmer was able to give of his fathers prosperity there had always been more or less apprehension among them of a time when a family subscription would be necessary for bob pasmer and in the relief which the new situation gave them some of them tried to remember having known dans father in college but it finally came to their guessing that they must have heard john munt speak of him  mrs pasmer had a supreme control in the affair she believed with the restso deeply is this delusion seatedthat she had made the match but knowing herself to have used no dishonest magic in the process she was able to enjoy it with a clean conscience she grew fonder of dan they understood each other she was his refuge from alices ideals and helped him laugh off his perplexity with them they were none the less sincere because they were not in the least frank with each other she let dan beat about the bush to his hearts content and waited for him at the point which she knew he was coming to with an unconsciousness which he knew was factitious neither of them got tired of this or failed freshly to admire the others strategy     xl  it cannot be pretended that alice was quite pleased with the way her friends took her engagement or rather the way in which they spoke of dan it seemed to her that she alone or she chiefly ought to feel that sweetness and loveliness of which every one told her as if she could not have known it if he was sweet and lovely to every one how was he different to her except in degree ought he not to be different in kind she put the case to miss cotton whom it puzzled while she assured alice that he was different in kind to her though he might not seem so the very fact that he was different in degree proved that he was different in kind this logic sufficed for the moment of its expression but it did not prevent alice from putting the case to dan himself at one of those little times when she sat beside him alone and rearranged his necktie or played with his watch chain or passed a critical hand over his cowlick she asked him if he did not think they ought to have an ideal in their engagement what ideal he asked he thought it was all solid ideal through and through oh she said be more and more to each other he said he did not see how that could be if there was anything more of him she was welcome to it but he rather thought she had it all she explained that she meant being less to others and he asked her to explain that  well when were anywhere together dont you think we ought to show how different we are to each other from what we are to any one else  dan laughed im afraid we do alice i always supposed one ought to hide that little preference as much as possible you dont want me to be dangling after you every moment  nooo but notdangle after others  dan sighed a littlea little impatiently do i dangle after others  of course not but show that were thoroughly united in all our tastes and feelings andlike and dislike the same persons  i dont think that will be difficult said dan  she was silent a moment and then she said you dont like to have me bring up such things  oh yes i do i wish to be and do just what you wish  but i can see i can understand that you would sooner pass the time without talking of them you like to be perfectly happy and not to have any cares whenwhen youre with me this way  well yes i suppose i do said dan laughing again i suppose i rather do like to keep pleasure and duty apart but theres nothing you can wish alice that isnt a pleasure to me  im very different said the girl i cant be at peace unless i know that i have a right to be so but now after this im going to do your way if its your way itll be the right wayfor me she looked sublimely resolved with a grand lift of the eyes and dan caught her to him in a rapture breaking into laughter  oh dont mines a bad waythe worst kind of a way he cried  it makes everybody like you and mine makes nobody like me  it makes me like you and thats quite enough i dont want other people to like you  yes thats what i mean cried alice and now she flung herself on his neck and the tears came do you suppose it can be very pleasant to have everybody talking of you as if everybody loved you as muchas much as i do she clutched him tighter and sobbed  o alice alice alice nobody could ever be what you are to me he soothed and comforted her with endearing words and touches but before he could have believed her half consoled she pulled away from him and asked with shining eyes do you think mr boardman is a good influence in your life  boardman cried mavering in astonishment why i thought you liked boardman  i do and i respect him very much but that isnt the question dont you think we ought to ask ourselves how others influence us  well i dont see much of boardy nowadays but i like to drop down and touch earth in boardy once in a whileim in the air so much board has more commonsense more solid chunkwisdom than anybody i know hes kept me from making a fool of myself more times  wasnt he with you that day withwith those women in portland  dan winced a little and then laughed no he wasnt that was the trouble boardman was off on the press boat i thought i told you but if you object to boardman  i dont you mustnt think i object to people when i ask you about them all that i wished was that you should think yourself what sort of influence he was i think hes a very good influence  hes a splendid fellow boardman is alice cried dan you ought to have seen how he fought his way through college on such a little money and never skulked or felt mean he wasnt appreciated for it the men dont notice these things much but he didnt want to have it noticed always acted as if it was neither here nor there and now i guess he sends out home whatever he has left after keeping soul and body together every week  he spoke perhaps with too great an effect of relief alice listened as it seemed to his tone rather than his words and said absently  yes thats grand but i dont want you to act as if you were afraid of me in such things  afraid dan echoed  i dont mean actually afraid but as if you thought i couldnt be reasonable as if you supposed i didnt expect you to make mistakes or to be imperfect  yes i know youre very reasonable and youre more patient with me than i deserve i know all that and its only my wish to come up to your standard i suppose that gives me that apprehensive appearance  that was what vexed me with you there at campobello when youasked me  yes i know  you ought to have understood me better you ought to know now that i dont wish you to do anything on my account but because its something we owe to others  oh excuse me id much rather do it for you cried dan but alice looked so grave so hurt that he hastened on how in the world does it concern others whether we are devoted or not whether were harmonious and twosoulswithbutasinglethought and all that he could not help being light about it  how alice repeated wont it give them an idea of whatwhatof how muchhow trulyif we care for each otherhow people ought to care we dont do it for ourselves that would be selfish and disgusting we do it because its something that we owe to the idea of being engagedof having devoted our lives to each other and would showwould teach  oh yes i know what you mean said dan and he gave way in a sputtering laugh but they wouldnt understand theyd only think we were spoons on each other and if they noticed that i cooled off toward people id liked and warmed up toward those you liked theyd say you made me  should you care asked alice sublimely withdrawing a little from his arm  oh no only on your account he answered checking his laugh  you neednt on my account she returned if we sacrifice some little preferences to each other isnt that right i shall be glad to sacrifice all of mine to you isnt ourmarriage to be full of such sacrifices i expect to give up everything to you she looked at him with a sad severity  he began to laugh again oh no alice dont do that i couldnt stand it i want some little chance at the renunciations myself  she withdrew still further from his side and said with a cold anger its that detestable mrs brinkley  mrs brinkley shouted dan  yes with her pessimism i have heard her talk she influences you nothing is sacred to her it was she who took up with those army women that night  well alice i must say you can give things as ugly names as the next one i havent seen mrs brinkley the whole winter except in your company but she has more sense than all the other women i know  oh thank you  you know i dont mean you he pushed on and she isnt a pessimist shes very kindhearted and that night she was very polite and good to those army women as you call them when you had refused to say a word or do anything for them  i knew it had been rankling in your mind all along said the girl i expected it to coma out sooner or later and you talk about renunciation you never forget nor forgive the slightest thing but i dont ask your forgiveness  alice  no you are as hard as iron you have that pleasant outside manner that makes people think youre very gentle and yielding but all the time youre like adamant i would rather die than ask your forgiveness for anything and youd rather let me than give it  well then i ask your forgiveness alice and im sure you wont let me die without it  they regarded each other a moment then the tenderness gushed up in their hearts a passionate tide and swept them into each others arms  o dan she cried how sweet you are how good how lovely oh how wonderful it is i wanted to hate you but i couldnt i couldnt do anything but love you yes now i understand what love is and how it can do everything and last for ever     xli  mavering came to lunch the next day and had a word with mrs pasmer before alice came in mr pasmer usually lunched at the club  we dont see much of mrs saintsbury nowadays he suggested  no its a great way to cambridge said mrs pasmer stifling in a little sigh of apparent regret for the separation the curiosity she felt as to dans motive in mentioning mrs saintsbury she was very patient with him when he went on  yes it is a great way and a strange thing about it is that when youre living here its a good deal further from boston to cambridge than it is from cambridge to boston  yes said mrs pasmer every one notices that  dan sat absently silent for a time before he said yes i guess i must go out and see mrs saintsbury  yes you ought shes very fond of you you and alice ought both to go  does mrs saintsbury like me asked dan well shes awfully nice dont you think shes awfully fond of formulating people  oh everybody in cambridge does that they dont gossip they merely accumulate materials for the formulation of character  and they get there just the same cried dan mrs saintsbury used to think she had got me down pretty fine he suggested  yes said mrs pasmer with an indifference which they both knew she did not feel  yes she used to accuse me of preferring to tack even in a fair wind  he looked inquiringly at mrs pasmer and she said how ridiculous  yes it was well i suppose i am rather circuitous about some things  oh not at all  and i suppose im rather a trial to alice in that way  he looked at mrs pasmer again and she said i dont believe you are in the least you cant tell what is trying to a girl  no said dan pensively i cant mrs pasmer tried to render the interest in her face less vivid i cant tell where shes going to bring up talk about tacking  do you mean the abstract girl or alice  oh the abstract girl said dan and they laughed together you think alice is very straightforward dont you  very said mrs pasmer looking down with a smilefor a girl  yes thats what i mean and dont you think the most circuitous kind of fellow would be pretty direct compared with the straightforwardest kind of girl  there was a rueful defeat and bewilderment in dans face that made mrs pasmer laugh what has she been doing now she asked  mrs pasmer said dan you and i are the only frank and open people i know well she began to talk last night about influencethe influence of other people on us and she killed off nearly all the people i like before i knew what she was up to and she finished with mrs brinkley im glad she didnt happen to think of you mrs pasmer or i shouldnt be associating with you at the present moment this idea seemed to give mrs pasmer inexpressible pleasure dan went on do you quite see the connection between our being entirely devoted to each other and my dropping mrs brinkley  i dont know said mrs pasmer alice doesnt like satirical people  well of course not but mrs brinkley is such an admirer of hers  i dare say she tells you so  oh but she is  i dont deny it said mrs pasmer but if alice feels something inimicalantipaticoin her atmosphere its no use talking  oh no its no use talking and i dont know that i want to talk after a pause mavering asked mrs pasmer dont you think that where two people are going to be entirely devoted to each other and selfsacrificing to each other they ought to divide and one do all the devotion and the other all the selfsacrifice  mrs pasmer was amused by the droll look in dans eyes i think they ought to be willing to share evenly she said  yes thats what i sayshare and share alike im not selfish about those little things he blew off a long sighing breath mrs pasmer dont you think we ought to have an ideal of conduct  mrs pasmer abandoned herself to laughter o dan dan you will be the death of me  we will die together then mrs pasmer alice will kill me he regarded her with a sad sympathy in his eye as she laughed and laughed with delicious intelligence of the case the intelligence was perfect from their point of view but whether it fathomed the girls whole intention or aspiration is another matter perhaps this was not very clear to herself at any rate mavering did not go any more to see mrs brinkley whose house he had liked to drop into alice went several times to show she said that she had no feeling in the matter and mrs brinkley when she met dan forbore to embarrass him with questions or reproaches she only praised alice to him  there were not many other influences that alice cut him off from she even exposed him to some influences that might have been thought deleterious she made him go and call alone upon certain young ladies whom she specified and she praised several others to him though she did not praise them for the same things that he did one of them was a girl to whom alice had taken a great fancy such as often buds into a romantic passion between women she was very gentle and mild and she had none of that strength of will which she admired in alice one night there was a sleighing party to a hotel in the suburbs where they had dancing and then supper after the supper they danced little sally waters for a finale instead of the virginia reel and alice would not go on the floor with dan she said she disliked that dance but she told him to dance with miss langham it became a gale of fun and in the height of it dan slipped and fell with his partner they laughed it off with the rest but after a while the girl began to cry she had received a painful bruise all the way home while the others laughed and sang and chattered dan was troubled about this poor girl his anxiety became a joke with the whole sleighful of people  when he parted with alice at her door he said im afraid i hurt miss langham i feel awfully about it  yes theres no doubt of that good night  she left him to go off to his lodging hot and tingling with indignation at her injustice but kindlier thoughts came to him before he slept and he fell asleep with a smile of tenderness for her on his lips he could see how he was wrong to go out with any one else when alice said she disliked the dance he ought not to have taken advantage of her generosity in appointing him a partner it was trying for her to see him make that ludicrous tumble of course and perhaps he had overdone the attentive sympathy on the way home it flattered him that she could not help showing her jealousythat is flattering at first and dan was able to go and confess all but this to alice she received his submission magnanimously and said that she was glad it had happened because his saying this showed that now they understood each other perfectly then she fixed her eyes on his and said ive just been round to see lilly and shes as well as ever it was only a nervous shock  whether mavering was really indifferent to miss langhams condition or whether the education of his perceptions had gone so far that he consciously ignored her he answered that was splendid of you alice  no she said its you that are splendid and you always are oh i wonder if i can ever be worthy of you  their mutual forgiveness was very sweet to them and they went on praising each other alice suddenly broke away from this weakening exchange of worship and said with that air of coming to business which he lad learned to recognise and dread a little dan dont you think i ought to write to your mother  write to my mother  why you have written to her you wrote as soon as you got back and she answered you  yes but write regularlyshow that i think of her all the time when i really think im going to take you from her i seem so cruel and heartless  oh i dont look at it in that light alice  dont joke and when i think that were going away to leave her for several years perhaps as soon as were married i cant make it seem right i know how she depends upon your being near her and seeing her every now and then and to go off to europe for years perhapsof course you can be of use to your father there but do you think its right toward your mother i want you to think  dan thought but his thinking was mainly to the effect that he did not know what she was driving at had she got any inkling of that plan of his mothers for them to come and stay a year or two at the falls after their marriage he always expected to be able to reconcile that plan with the pasmer plan of going at once to his optimism the two were not really incompatible but he did not wish them prematurely confronted in alices mind was this her way of letting him know that she knew what his mother wished and that she was willing to make the sacrifice or was it just some vague longing to please him by a show of affection toward his family an unmeditated impulse of reparation he had an impulse himself to be frank with alice to take her at her word and to allow that he did not like the notion of going abroad this was dans notion of being frank he could still reserve the fact that he had given his mother a tacit promise to bring alice home to live but he postponed even this he said oh i guess thatll be all right alice at any rate theres no need to think about it yet awhile that can be arranged  yes said alice but dont you think id better get into the habit of writing regularly to your mother now so that there neednt be any break when we go abroad he could see now that she had no idea of giving that plan up and he was glad that he had not said anything i think she continued that i shall write to her once a week and give her a full account of our life from day to day itll be more like a diary and then when we get over there i can keep it up without any effort and she wont feel so much that youve gone  she seemed to refer the plan to him and he said it was capital in fact he did like the notion of a diary that sort of historical view would involve less danger of precipitating a discussion of the two schemes of life for the future its awfully kind of you alice to propose such a thing and you mustnt make it a burden any sort of little sketchy record will do mother can read between the lines you know  it wont be a burden said the girl tenderly i shall seem to be doing it for your mother but i know i shall be doing it for you i do everything for you do you think its right  oh it must be said dan laughing its so pleasant  oh said the girl gloomily thats what makes me doubt it     xlii  eunice mavering acknowledged alices first letter she said that her mother read it aloud to them all and had been delighted with the good account she gave of dan and fascinated with all the story of their daily doings and sayings she wished eunice to tell alice how fully she appreciated her thoughtfulness of a sick old woman and that she was going to write herself and thank her but eunice added that alice must not be surprised if her mother was not very prompt in this and she sent messages from all the family affectionate for alice and polite for her father and mother  alice showed dan the letter and he seemed to find nothing noticeable in it she says your mother will write later alice suggested  yes you ought to feel very much complimented by that mothers autographs are pretty uncommon he said smiling  why doesnt she write cant she does it tire her asked alice  oh yes she can write but she hates to she gets eunice or minnie to write usually  dan cried alice intensely why didnt you tell me  why i thought you knew it he explained easily she likes to read and likes to talk but it bores her to write i dont suppose i get more than two or three pencil scratches from her in the course of a year she makes the girls write but you neednt mind her not writing you may be sure shes glad of your letters  it makes me seem very presumptuous to be writing to her when theres no chance of her answering alice grieved its as if i had passed over your sisters heads i ought to have written to them  oh well you can do that now said dan soothingly  no no i cant do it now it would be ridiculous she was silent and presently she asked is there anything else about your mother that i ought to know she looked at him with a sort of impending discipline in her eyes which he had learned to dread it meant such a long course of things such a very great variety of atonement and expiation for him that he could not bring himself to confront it steadily  his heart gave a feeble leap he would have gladly told her all that was in it and he meant to do so at the right time but this did not seem the moment i cant say that there is he answered coldly  in that need of consecrating her happiness which alice felt she went a great deal to church in those days sometimes she felt the need almost of defence against her happiness and a vague apprehension mixed with it could it be right to let it claim her whole being as it seemed to do than was the question which she once asked dan and it made him laugh and catch her to him in a rapture that served for the time and then left her to more morbid doubts evidently he could not follow her in them he could not even imagine them and while he was with her they seemed to have no verity or value but she talked them over very hypothetically and impersonally with miss cotton in whose sympathy they resumed all their import and gained something more in the idealisation which the girl underwent in this atmosphere all her thoughts and purposes had a significance which she would not of herself perhaps have attached to them they discussed them and analysed them with a satisfaction in the result which could not be represented without an effect of caricature they measured alices romance together and evolved from it a sublimation of responsibility of duty of devotion which alice found it impossible to submit to dan when he came with his simplehearted singleminded purpose of getting mrs pasmer out of the room and sitting down with his arm around alices waist when he had accomplished this it seemed sufficient in itself and she had to think to struggle to recall things beyond it above it he could not be made to see at such times how their lives could be more in unison than they were when she proposed doing something for him which he knew was disagreeable to her he would not let her and when she hinted at anything she wished him to do for her because she knew it was disagreeable to him he consented so promptly so joyously that she perceived he could not have given the least thought to it  she felt every day that they were alien in their tastes and aims their pleasures were not the same and though it was sweet though it was charming to have him give up so willingly all his preferences she felt without knowing that the time must come when this could not be so that it was all wrong  but these very differences these antagonisms if you wish to call them so suggested miss cotton in talking alices misgivings over with her arent they just what will draw you together more and more isnt it what attracted you to each other the very fact that you are such perfect counterparts  yes the girl assented thats what were taught to believe she meant by the novels to which we all trust our instruction in such matters and her doubt doubly rankled after she had put it to silence  she kept on writing to dans mother though more and more perfunctorily and now eunice and now minnie mavering acknowledged her letters she knew that they must think she was silly but having entered by dans connivance upon her folly she was too proud to abandon it  at last after she had ceased to expect it came a letter from his mother not a brief note but a letter which the invalid had evidently tasked herself to make long and full in recognition of alices kindness in writing to her so much the girl opened it and after a verifying glance at the signature began to read it with a thrill of tender triumph and the fond prevision of the greater pleasure of reading it again with dan  but after reading it once through she did not wait for him before reading it again and again she did this with bewilderment intershot with flashes of conviction and then doubts of this conviction when she could misunderstand no longer she rose quietly and folded the letter and put it carefully back into its envelope and into her writing desk where she sat down and wrote in her clearest and firmest hand this note to mavering   i wish to see you immediately  alice pasmer     xliii  dan had learned with a lovers keenness to read alices moods in the most colourless wording of her notes she was rather apt to write him notes taking back or reaffirming the effect of something that had just passed between them her note were tempered to varying degrees of heat and cold so fine that no one else would have felt the difference but sensible to him in their subtlest intention  perhaps a mere witness of the fact would have been alarmed by a note which began without an address except that on the envelope and ended its peremptory brevity with the writers name signed in full dan read calamity in it and he had all the more trouble to pull himself together to meet it because he had parted with unusual tenderness from alice the night before after an evening in which it seemed to him that their ideals had been completely reconciled  the note came as her notes were apt to come while dan was at breakfast which he was rather luxurious about for so young a man and he felt formlessly glad afterward that he had drunk his first cup of coffee before he opened it for it chilled the second cup and seemed to take all character out of the omelet  he obeyed it wondering what the doom menaced in it might be but knowing that it was doom and leaving his breakfast halffinished with a dull sense of the tragedy of doing so  he would have liked to ask for mrs pasmer first and interpose a moment of her cheerful unreality between himself and his interview with alice but he decided that he had better not do this and they met at once with the width of the room between them her look was one that made it impassable to the simple impulse he usually had to take her in his arms and kiss her but as she stood holding out a letter to him with the apparent intention that he should come and take it he traversed the intervening space and took it  why its from mother he said joyously with a glance at the handwriting  will you please explain it said alice and dan began to read it  it began with a good many excuses for not having written before and went on with a pretty expression of interest in alices letters and gratitude for them mrs mavering assured the girl that she could not imagine what a pleasure they had been to her she promised herself that they should be great friends and she said that she looked forward eagerly to the time now drawing near when dan should bring her home to them she said she knew alice would find it dull at the falls except for him but they would all do their best and she would find the place very different from what she had seen it in the winter alice could make believe that she was there just for the summer and mrs mavering hoped that before the summer was gone she would be so sorry for a sick old woman that she would not even wish to go with it this part of the letter which gave dan away so hopelessly as he felt was phrased so touchingly that he looked up from it with moist eyes to the hard cold judgment in the eyes of alice  will you please explain it she repeated  he tried to temporise explain what  alice was prompt to say had you promised your mother to take me home to live  dan did not answer  you promised my mother to go abroad what else have you promised he continued silent and she added you are a faithless man they were the words of romola in the romance to tito she had often admired them and they seemed to her equally the measure of dans offence  alice  here are your letters and remembrances mr mavering dan mechanically received the packet she had been holding behind her with a perverse freak of intelligence he observed that though much larger now it was tied up with the same ribbon which had fastened it when alice returned his letters and gifts before goodbye i wish you every happiness consistent with your nature  she bowed coldly and was about to leave him as she had planned but she had not arranged that he should be standing in front of the door and he was there with no apparent intention of moving  will you allow me to pass she was forced to ask however haughtily  no he retorted with a violence that surprised him i will not let you pass till you have listened to metill you tell me why you treat me so i wont stand itive had enough of this kind of thing  it surprised alice too a little and after a moments hesitation she said i will listen to you so much more gently than she had spoken before that dan relaxed his imperative tone and began to laugh but she added and her face clouded again it will be of no use my mind is made up this time why should we talk  why because mine isnt said dan what is the matter alice do you think i would force you or even ask you to go home with me to live unless you were entirely willing it could only be a temporary arrangement anyway  that isnt the question she retorted the question is whether youve promised your mother one thing and me another  well i dont know about promising said dan laughing a little more uneasily but still laughing as nearly as i can remember i wasnt consulted about the matter your mother proposed one thing and my mother proposed another  and you agreed to both that is quite enoughquite characteristic  dan flushed and stopped laughing i dont know what you mean by characteristic the thing didnt have to be decided at once and i didnt suppose it would be difficult for either side to give way if it was judged best i was sure my mother wouldnt insist  it seems very easy for your family to make sacrifices that are not likely to be required of them  you mustnt criticise my mother cried dan  i have not criticised her you insinuate that we would be too selfish to give up if it were for the best  i do nothing of the kind and unless you are determined to quarrel with me you wouldnt say so  i dont wish a quarrel none is necessary said alice coldly  you accuse me of being treacherous  i didnt say treacherous  faithless then its a mere quibble about words i want you to take that back  i cant take it back its the truth arent you faithless if you let us go on thinking that youre going to europe and let your mother think that were coming home to live after were married  no im simply leaving the question open  yes said the girlsadly you like to leave questions open thats your way  well i suppose i do till its necessary to decide them it saves the needless effusion of talk said dan with a laugh and then as people do in a quarrel he went back to his angry mood and said besides i supposed you would be glad of the chance to make some sacrifice for me youre always asking for it  thank you mr mavering said alice for reminding me of it nothing is sacred to you it seems i cant say that you have ever sought any opportunities of selfsacrifice  i wasnt allowed time to do so they were always presented  thank you again mr mavering all this is quite a revelation im glad to know how you really felt about things that you seemed so eager for  alice you know that i would do anything for you cried dan rueing his precipitate words  yes thats what youve repeatedly told me i used to believe it  and i always believed what you said you said at the picnic that day that you thought i would like to live at ponkwasset falls if my business was there  that is not the point  and now you quarrel with me because my mother wishes me to do so  alice merely said i dont know why i stand here allowing you to intimidate me in my fathers house i demand that you shall stand aside and let me pass  ill not oblige you to leave the room said dan i will go but if i go you will understand that i dont come back  i hope that said the girl  very well good morning miss pasmer  she inclined her head slightly in acknowledgment of his bow and he whirled out of the room and down the dim narrow passageway into the arms of mrs pasmer who had resisted as long as she could her curiosity to know what the angry voices of himself and alice meant  o mr mavering is it you she buzzed and she flung aside one pretence for another in adding couldnt alice make you stay to breakfast  dan felt a rush of tenderness in his heart at the sound of the kind humbugging little voice no thank you mrs pasmer i couldnt stay thank you ii thank you very much igoodbye mrs pasmer he wrung her hand and found his way out of the apartment door leaving her to clear up the mystery of his flight and his broken words as she could  alice she said as she entered the room where the girl had remained what have you been doing now  oh nothing she said with a remnant of her scorn for dan qualifying her tone and manner to her mother ive dismissed mr mavering  then you want him to come to lunch asked her mother i should advise him to refuse  i dont think hed accept said alice then as mrs pasmer stood in the door preventing her egress as dan had done before she asked meekly will you let me pass mamma my head aches  mrs pasmer whose easy triumphs in so many difficult circumstances kept her nearly always in good temper let herself go at these words in vexation very uncommon with her indeed i shall not she retorted and you will please sit down here and tell me what you mean by dismissing mr mavering im tired of your whims and caprices  i cant talk began the girl stubbornly  yes i think you can said her mother at any rate i can now what is it all  perhaps this letter will explain said alice continuing to dignify her enforced submission with a tone of unabated hauteur and she gave her mother mrs maverings letter which dan had mechanically restored to her  mrs pasmer read it not only without indignation but apparently without displeasure but she understood perfectly what the trouble was when she looked up and asked cheerfully well  well repeated alice with a frown of astonishment dont you see that hes promised us one thing and her another and that hes false to both  i dont know said mrs pasmer recovering her goodhumour in view of a situation that she felt herself able to cope with of course he has to temporise to manage a little shes an invalid and of course shes very exacting he has to humour her how do you know he has promised her he hasnt promised us  hasnt promised us alice gasped  no hes simply fallen in with what weve said its because hes so sweet and yielding and cant bear to refuse i can understand it perfectly  then if he hasnt promised us hes deceived us all the more shamefully for hes made us think he had  he hasnt me said mrs pasmer smiling at the stormy virtue in her daughters face and what if you should go home awhile with himfor the summer say it couldnt last longer much and it wouldnt hurt us to wait i suppose he hoped for something of that kind  oh it isnt that groaned the girl in a kind of bewilderment i could have gone there with him joyfully and lived all my days if hed only been frank with me  oh no you couldnt said her mother with cosy security when it comes to it you dont like giving up any more than other people its very hard for you to give up he sees thathe knows it and he doesnt really like to ask any sort of sacrifice from you hes afraid of you  dont i know that demanded alice desolately ive known it from the first and ive felt it all the time its all a mistake and has been we never could understand each other were too different  that neednt prevent you understanding him it neednt prevent you from seeing how really kind and good he ishow faithful and constant he is  oh you say thatyou praise himbecause you like him  of course i do and cant you  no the least grain of deceitof temporising you call itspoils everything its over said the girl rising with a sigh from the chair she had dropped into were best apart we could only have been wretched and wicked together  what did you say to him alice asked her mother unshaken by her rhetoric  i told him he was a faithless person  then you were a cruel girl cried mrs pasmer with sudden indignation and if you were not my daughter i could be glad he had escaped you i dont know where you got all those silly romantic notions of yours about these things you certainly didnt get them from me she continued with undeniable truth and i dont believe you get them from your church its just as miss anderson said your church makes allowance for human nature but you make none  i shouldnt go to julia anderson for instruction in such matters said the girl with cold resentment  i wish you would go to her for a little commonsenseor somebody said mrs pasmer do you know what talk this will make  i dont care for the talk it would be worse than talk to marry a man whom i couldnt trustwho wanted to please me so much that he had to deceive me and was too much afraid of me to tell me the truth  you headstrong girl said her mother impartially admiring at the same time the girls haughty beauty  there was an argument in reserve in mrs pasmers mind which perhaps none but an american mother would have hesitated to urge but it is so wholly our tradition to treat the important business of marriage as a romantic episode that even she could not bring herself to insist that her daughter should not throw away a chance so advantageous from every worldly point of view she could only ask if you break this engagement what do you expect to do  the engagement is broken i shall go into a sisterhood  you will do nothing of the kind with my consent said mrs pasmer i will have no such nonsense dont flatter yourself that i will even if i approved of such a thing i should think it wicked to let you do it youre always fancying yourself doing something very devoted but ive never seen you ready to give up your own will or your own comfort even in the slightest degree and dan mavering if he were twice as temporising and circuitousthe word came to her from her talk with himwould be twice too good for you im going to breakfast     xliv  the difficulty in life is to bring experience to the level of expectation to match our real emotions in view of any great occasion with the ideal emotions which we have taught ourselves that we ought to feel this is all the truer when the occasion is tragical we surprise ourselves in a helplessness to which the great event death ruin lost love reveals itself slowly and at first wears the aspect of an unbroken continuance of what has been or at most of another incident in the habitual sequence  dan mavering came out into the bright winter morning knowing that his engagement was broken but feeling it so little that he could not believe it he failed to realise it to seize it for a fact and he could not let it remain that dumb and formless wretchedness without proportion or dimensions which it now seemed to be weighing his life down to verify it to begin to outlive it he must instantly impart it he must tell it he must see it with others eyes this was the necessity of his youth and of his sympathy which included himself as well as the rest of the race in its activity he had the usual environment of a young man who has money he belonged to clubs and he had a large acquaintance among men of his own age who lived a life of greater leisure or were more absorbed in business but whom he met constantly in society for one reason or another or for no other reason than that he was dan mavering and liked every one he liked them all he thought himself great friends with them he dined and lunched with them and they knew the pasmers and all about his engagement but he did not go to any of them now with the need he felt to impart his calamity to get the support of come others credence and opinion of it he went to a friend whom in the way of his world he met very seldom but whom he always found as he said just where he had left him  boardman never made any sign of suspecting that he was put on and off according to dans necessity or desire for comfort or congratulation but it was part of their joke that dans coming to him always meant something decisive in his experiences the reporter was at his late breakfast which his landlady furnished him in his room though as mrs mash said she never gave meals but a cup of coffee and an egg or two yes  well he said without looking up  well im done for cried dan  again asked boardman  again the other time was nothing boardmani knew it wasnt anything but thisthis is final  go on said boardman looking about for his individual saltcellar which he found under the edge of his plate and mavering laid the whole case before him as he made no comment on it for a while dan was obliged to ask him what he thought of it well he said with the smile that showed the evenness of his pretty teeth theres a kind of wild justice in it he admitted this with the object of meeting dans views in an opinion  so you think im a faithless man too do you demanded mavering stormily  not from your point of view said boardman who kept on quietly eating and drinking  mavering was too amiable not to feel boardmans innocence of offence in his unperturbed behaviour there was no faithlessness about it and you know it he went on half laughing half crying in his excitement and making boardman the avenue of an appeal really addressed to alice i was ready to do what either side decided  or both suggested boardman  yes or both said dan boldly accepting the suggestion it wouldnt have cost me a pang to give up if id been in the place of either  i guess thats what she could never understand boardman mused aloud  and i could never understand how any one could fail to see that that was what i intendedexpected that it would all come out right of itselfnaturally dan was still addressing alice in this belated reasoning but to be accused of bad faithof trying to deceive any one  pretty rough said boardman  rough its more than i can stand  well you dont seem to be asked to stand it said boardman and mavering laughed forlornly with him at his joke and then walked away and looked out of boardmans dormerwindow on the roofs below with their dirty smokestained february snow he pulled out his handkerchief and wiped his face with it when he turned round boardman looked keenly at him and asked with an air of caution and so its all up  yes its all up said dan hoarsely  no danger of a relapse  what do you mean  no danger of having my sympathy handed over later to miss pasmer for examination  i guess you can speak up freely boardman said dan if thats what you mean miss pasmer and i are quits  well then im glad of it she wasnt the one for you she isnt fit for you  whats the reason she isnt cried dan shes the most beautiful and noble girl in the world and the most conscientious and the bestif she is unjust to me  no doubt of that im not attacking her and im not defending you  what are you doing then  simply saying that i dont believe you two would ever understand each other you havent got the same point of view and you couldnt make it go both out of a scrape  i dont know what you mean by a scrape said dan resenting the word more than the idea boardman tacitly refused to modify or withdraw it and dan said after a sulky silence in which he began to dramatise a meeting with his family im going home i cant stand it here whats the reason you cant come with me boardman  do you mean to your rooms  no to the falls  thanks guess not  why not  dont care about being a fifth wheel  oh pshaw now boardman look here you must go i want you to go ii want your support thats it im all broken up and i couldnt stand that three hours pull alone theyll be glad to see youall of them dont you suppose theyll be glad to see you theyre always glad and theyll understand  i dont believe you want me to go yourself you just think you do  no i really do want you boardman i want to talk it over with you i do want you im not fooling  dont think i could get away yet he seemed to be pleased with the notion of the falls it made him smile  well see said mavering disconsolately im going round to my rooms now and ill be there till two oclock trains at 230 he went towards the door where he faced about and you dont think it would be of any use  any usewhat  trying tototo make it up  how should i know  no no of course you couldnt said dan miserably downcast all the resentment which alices injustice had roused in him had died out he was suffering as helplessly and hopelessly as a child well he sighed as he swung out of the door  boardman found him seated at his writingdesk in his smokingjacket when he came to him rather early and on the desk were laid out the properties of the little play which had come to a tragic close there were some small bits of jewellery among the rest a ring of hers which alice had been letting him wear a lock of her hair which he had kept for the greater convenience of kissing in the original parcel tied with crimson ribbon a succession of flowers which she had worn more and more dry and brown with age one of her gloves which he had found and kept from the day they first met in cambridge a bunch of withered bluebells tied with sweetgrass whose odour filled the room from the picnic at campobello scraps of paper with her writing on them and cards several photographs of her and piles of notes and letters  look here said dan knowing it was boardman without turning round what am i to do about these things  boardman respectfully examined them over his shoulder dont know what the usual ceremony is he said he ventured to add referring to the heaps of letters seems to have been rather epistolary doesnt she  oh dont talk of her as if she were dead cried dan ive been feeling as if she were all at once he dropped his head among these witnesses of his loss and sobbed  boardman appeared shocked and yet somewhat amused he made a soft low sibilation between his teeth  dan lifted his head boardman if you ever give me away  oh i dont suppose its very hilarious said boardman with vague kindness packed yet he asked getting away from the subject as something he did not feel himself fitted to deal with consecutively  im only going to take a bag said mavering going to get some clothes down from a closet where his words had a sepulchral reverberation  cant i help asked boardman keeping away from the sad memorials of dans love strewn about on the desk and yet not able to keep his eyes off them across the room  well i dont know said dan he came out with his armful of coats and trousers and threw them on the bed are you going  if i could believe you wanted me to  good cried mavering and the fact seemed to brighten him immediately if you want to stuff these things in while im doing up these other things he nodded his head sidewise toward the desk  all right said boardman  his burst of grief must have relieved dan greatly he set about gathering up the relics on the desk and getting a suitable piece of paper to wrap them in he rejected several pieces as inappropriate  i dont know what kind of paper to do these things up in he said at last  any special kind of paper required boardman asked pausing in the act of folding a pair of pantaloons so as not to break the fall over the boot  i didnt know there was but there seems to be said dan  silver paper seems to be rather more for cake and that sort of thing suggested boardman kind of mourning too isnt itsilver  i dont know said dan but i havent got any silver paper  newspaper wouldnt do  well hardly boardman said dan with sarcasm  well said boardman i should have supposed that nothing could be simpler than to send back a lot of loveletters but the question of paper seems insuperable manila paper wouldnt do either and then comes string what kind of string are you going to tie it up with  well we wont start that question till we get to it answered dan looking about if i could find some kind of a box  havent you got a collar box be the very thing boardman had gone back to the coats and trousers abandoning dan to the subtler difficulties in which he was involved  theyve all got labels said mavering getting down one marked the tennyson and another lettered the clarion and looking at them with cold rejection  dont see how youre going to send these things back at all then have to keep them i guess boardman finished his task and came back to dan  i guess ive got it now said mavering lifting the lid of his desk and taking out a large stiff envelope in which a set of photographic views had come  seems to have been made for it boardman exulted watching the envelope as it filled up expand into a kind of shapely packet dan put the things silently in and sealed the parcel with his ring then he turned it over to address it but the writing of alices name for this purpose seemed too much for him in spite of boardmans humorous support throughout  oh i cant do it he said falling back in his chair  let me said his friend cheerfully ignoring his despair he philosophised the whole transaction as he addressed the package rang for a messenger and sent it away telling him to call a cab for ten minutes past two  mighty good thing in life that we move by steps now on the stage or in a novel youd have got those things together and addressed em and despatched em in just the right kind of paper with just the right kind of string round it at a dash and then youd have had time to go up and lean your head against something and soliloquise or else think unutterable things but here you see how a merciful providence blocks your way all along youve had to fight through all sort of sordid little details to the grand tragic result of getting off miss pasmers letters and when you reach it you dont mind it a bit  dont i demanded dan in as hollow a voice as he could youd joke at a funeral boardman  ive seen some pretty cheerful funerals said boardman and its this principle of steps of degrees of having to do this little thing and that little thing that keeps funerals from killing the survivors i suppose this is worse than a funerallook at it in the right light you mourn as one without hope dont you live through it too i suppose  he made dan help get the rest of his things into his bag and with one little artifice and another prevented him from stagnating in despair he dissented from the idea of waiting over another day to see if alice would not relent when she got her letters back and send for dan to come and see her  relent a good deal more when she finds youve gone out of town if she sends for you he argued and he got dan into the cab and off to the station carefully making him an active partner in the whole undertaking even to checking his own bag  before he bought his own ticket he appealed once more to dan  look here i feel like a fool going off with you on this expedition be honest for once now mavering and tell me youve thought better of it and dont want me to go  yesyes i do oh yes youve got to go i i do want you iyou make me see things in just the right light dont you know that idea of yours about little stepsits braced me all up yes  youre such an infernal humbug said boardman i cant tell whether you want me or not but im in for it now and ill go then he bought his ticket     xlv  boardman put himself in charge of mavering and took him into the smoking car it was impossible to indulge a poetic gloom there without becoming unpleasantly conspicuous in the smoking and euchre and profanity some of the men were silent and dull but no one was apparently very unhappy and perhaps if dan had dealt in absolute sincerity with himself even he would not have found himself wholly so he did not feel as he had felt when alice rejected him then he was wounded to the quick through his vanity and now in spite of all in spite of the involuntary tender swaying of his heart toward her through the mere force of habit in spite of some remote compunctions for his want of candour with her he was supported by a sense of her injustice her hardness related with this was an obscure sense of escape of liberation which however he might silence and disown it was still there he could not help being aware that he had long relinquished tastes customs purposes ideals to gain a peace that seemed more and more fleeting and uncertain and that he had submitted to others which now that the moment of giving pleasure by his submission was past he recognised as disagreeable he felt a sort of guilt in his enlargement he knew by all that he had ever heard or read of people in his position that he ought to be altogether miserable and yet this consciousness of relief persisted he told himself that a very tragical thing had befallen him that this broken engagement was the ruin of his life and the end of his youth and that he must live on an old and joyless man wise with the knowledge that comes to decrepitude and despair he imagined a certain look for himself a gait a name that would express this but all the same he was aware of having got out of something was it a bondage a scrape as boardman called it he thought he must be a very light shallow and frivolous nature not to be utterly broken up by his disaster  i dont know what im going home for he said hoarsely to boardman  kind of a rest i suppose suggested his friend  yes i guess thats it said dan im tired  it seemed to him that this was rather fine it was a fatigue of the soul that he was to rest from he remembered the apostrophic close of a novel in which the heroine dies after much emotional suffering quiet quiet heart he repeated to himself yes he too had died to hope to love to happiness  as they drew near their journeys end he said i dont know how im going to break it to them  oh probably break itself said boardman these things usually do  yes of course dan assented  know from your looks that somethings up or you might let me go ahead a little and prepare them  dan laughed it was awfully good of you to come boardman i dont know what i should have done without you  nothing i like more than these little trips brightens you up to sere the misery of others makes you feel that youre on peculiarly good terms with providence havent enjoyed myself so much since that day in portland boardmans eyes twinkled  yes said dan with a deep sigh its a pity it hadnt ended there  oh i dont know you wont have to go through with it again something that had to come wasnt it never been satisfied if you hadnt tried it kind of aching void before and now youve got enough  yes ive got enough said dan if thats all  when they got out of the train at ponkwasset falls and the conductor and the brakeman who knew dan as his fathers son and treated him with the distinction due a representative of an interest valued by the road had bidden him a respectfully intimate goodnight and he began to climb the hill to his fathers house he recurred to the difficulty before him in breaking the news to his family i wish i could have it over in a flash i wish id thought to telegraph it to them  wouldnt have done said boardman it would have given em time to formulate questions and conjectures and now the astonishment will take their breath away till you can get your second wind and thenyoull be all right  you think so asked dan submissively  know so you see if you could have had it over in a flash it would have knocked you flat but now youve taken all the little steps and youve got a lot more to take and youre all braced up see youre like rock nowadamant dan laughed in forlorn perception of boardmans affectionate irony little steps are the thing youll have to go in now and meet your family and pass the time of day with each one and talk about the weather and account for my being along and ask how they all are and by the time youve had dinner and got settled with your legs out in front of the fire youll be just in the mood for it enjoy telling them all about it  dont boardman pleaded dan boardy i believe if i could get in and up to my room without anybodys seeing me id let you tell them there dont seem to be anybody about and i think we could manage it  it wouldnt work said boardman got to do it yourself  well then wait a minute said dan desperately and boardman knew that he was to stay outside while dan reconnoitred the interior dan opened one door after another till he stood within the hot brilliantly lighted hall eunice mavering was coming down the stairs hooded and wrapped for a walk on the long verandahs before supper  dan she cried  its all up eunice he said at once as if she had asked him about it my engagements off  oh im so glad she descended upon him with outstretched arms but stopped herself before she reached him its a hoax what do you mean do you really mean it dan  i guess i mean it but donthold on wheres minnie  eunice turned and ran back upstairs minnie min she called on her way dans engagements off  i dont believe it answered minnies voice joyously from within some room it was followed by her presence with successive inquiries how do you know did you get a letter when did it happen oh isnt it too good  minnie was also dressed for the verandah promenade which they always took when the snow was too deep she caught sight of her brother as she came down why dans here dan ive been thinking about you all day she kissed him which eunice was now reminded to do too  yes its true minnie said dan gravely i came up to tell you it dont seem to distress you much  dan said his sister reproachfully you know i didnt mean to say anything i only felt so glad to have you back again  i understand minniei dont blame you its all right hows mother father up from the works yet im going to my room  indeed youre not cried eunice with elder sisterly authority you shall tell us about it first  oh no let him go eunice pleaded minnie poor dan and i dont think we ought to go to walk when  dans eyes dimmed and his voice weakened a little at her sympathy yes go im tiredthats all there isnt anything to tell you hardly miss pasmer  why hes pale cried minnie eunice  oh its just the heat in here dan really felt a little sick and faint with it but he was not sorry to seem affected by the days strain upon his nerves  the girls began to take off their wraps dont ill go with you boardmans out there  boardman what nonsense exclaimed eunice  hell like to hear your opinion of it dan began but his sister pulled the doors open and ran out to see if he really meant that too  whether boardman had heard her or had discreetly withdrawn out of earshot at the first sound of voices she could not tell but she found him some distance away from the snowbox on the piazza dans just managed to tell us you were here she said giving him her hand im glad to see you do come in  come along as a sort of jobs comforter boardman explained as he followed her in and he had the silly look that the man who feels himself superfluous must wear  then you know about it said eunice while minnie mavering and he were shaking hands  yes boardman knows he can tell you about it said dan from the hall chair he had dropped into he rose and made his way to the stairs with the effect of leaving the whole thing to them  his sisters ran after him and got him upstairs and into his room with boardmans semisatirical connivance and eunice put up the window while minnie went to get some cologne to wet his forehead their efforts were so successful that he revived sufficiently to drive them out of his room and make them go and show boardman to his  you know the way mr boardman said eunice going before him while minnie followed timorously but curious for what he should say she lingered on the threshold while her sister went in and pulled the electric apparatus which lighted the gasburners i suppose dan didnt break it she said turning sharply upon him  no and i dont think he was to blame said boardman inferring her reserved anxiety  oh im quite sure of that said eunice rejecting what she had asked for youll find everything mr boardman it was kind of you to come with dan suppers at seven  how severe you were with him murmured minnie following her away  severe with dan  nowith mr boardman  what nonsense i had to be i couldnt let him defend dan to me couple of silly boys  after a moment minnie said i dont think hes silly  who  mr boardman  well dan is then to bring him at such a time but i suppose he felt that he couldnt get here without him what a boy think of such a child being engaged i hope we shant hear any more of such nonsense for one while againat least till dans got his growth  they went down into the library where in their excitement they sat down with most of their outdoor things on  minnie had the soft contrarymindedness of gentle natures i should like to know how you would have had dan bear it she said rebelliously  how like a man or like a woman how do you suppose miss pasmers bearing it do you suppose shes got some friend to help her  if shes broken it she doesnt need any one urged minnie  well said eunice with her high scorn of dan unabated i never could have liked that girl but i certainly begin to respect her i think i could have got on with hernow that its no use i declare she broke off were sitting here sweltering to death what are we keeping our things on for she began to tear hers violently off and to fling them on chairs scolding and laughing at the same time with minnie at their absentmindedness  a heavy step sounded on the verandah without  theres father she cried vividly jumping to her feet and running to the door while minnie in a nervous bewilderment ran off upstairs to her room eunice flung the door open well father weve got dan back again and at a look of quiet question in his eye she hurried on his engagements broken and hes come up here to tell us and brought mr boardman along to help  where is he asked the father with his ruminant quiet pulling off first one sleeve of his overcoat and pausing for eunices answer before he pulled off the other     xlvi  hes up in his room resting from the effort she laughed nervously and her father made no comment he took off his articles and then went creaking upstairs to dans room but at the door he paused with his hand on the knob and turned away to his own room without entering  dan must have heard him in a few minutes he came to him  well dan said his father shaking hands  i suppose eunice has told you well i want to tell you why it happened  there was something in his father that always steadied dan and kept him to the point he now put the whole case fairly and squarely and his candour and openness seemed to him to react and characterise his conduct throughout he did not realise that this was not so till his father said at the close with mild justice you were to blame for letting the thing run on so at loose ends  yes of course said dan seeing that he was but there was no intention of deceiving any one of bad faith  of course not  i thought it could be easily arranged whenever it came to the point  if youd been older you wouldnt have thought that you had women to deal with on both sides but if its all over im not sorry i always admired miss pasmer but ive been more and more afraid you were not suited to each other your mother doesnt know youre here  no sir i suppose not do you think it will distress her  how did your sisters take it  dan gave a rueful laugh it seemed to be rather a popular move with them  i will see your mother first said the father  he left them when they went into the library after supper and a little later dan and eunice left boardman in charge of minnie there  he looked after their unannounced withdrawal in comic consciousness its no use pretending that im not a pretty large plurality here he said to minnie  oh im so glad you came she cried with a kindness which was as real as if it had been more sincere  do you think mother will feel it much asked dan anxiously as he went upstairs with eunice  well shell hate to lose a correspondentsuch a regular one said eunice and the affair being so far beyond any other comment she laughed the rest of the way to their mothers room  the whole family had in some degree that foible which affects people who lead isolated lives they come to think that they are the only people who have their virtues they exaggerate these and they conceive a kindness even for the qualities which are not their virtues mrs maverings life was secluded again from the family seclusion and their peculiarities were intensified in her besides she had some very marked peculiarities of her own and these were also intensified by the solitude to which she was necessarily left so much she meditated a great deal upon the character of her children and she liked to analyse and censure it both in her own mind and openly in their presence she was very trenchant and definite in these estimates of them she liked to ticket them and then ticket them anew she explored their ancestral history on both sides for the origin of their traits and there were times when she reduced them in formula to mere congeries of inherited characteristics if eunice was selfwilled and despotic she was just like her grandmother mavering if minnie was all sentiment and gentle stubbornness it was because two aunts of hers one on either side were exactly so if dan loved pleasure and beauty and was sinuous and uncertain in so many ways and yet was so kind and faithful and good as well as shillyshallying and undecided it was because her mother and her mothers father had these qualities in the same combination  when she took her children to pieces before their faces she was sharp and admonitory enough with them she warned them to what their characters would bring them to if they did not look out but perhaps because she beheld them so hopelessly the present effect of the accumulated tendencies of the family past she was tender and forgiving to their actions the mother came in there and superseded the student of heredity she found excuse for them in the perversity of circumstance in the peculiar hardship of the case in the malignant misbehaviour of others  as dan entered with the precedence his father and sister yielded him as the principal actor in the scene which must follow she lifted herself vigorously in bed and propped herself on the elbow of one arm while she stretched the other towards him  im glad of it dan she called at the moment he opened the door and as he came toward her she continued with the amazing velocity of utterance peculiar to nervous sufferers of her sex i know all about it and i dont blame you a bit and i dont blame her poor helpless young things but its a perfect mercy its all over its the greatest deliverance i ever heard of youd have been eaten up alive i saw it and i knew it from the very first moment and ive lived in fear and trembling for you you could have got on well enough if youd been left to yourselves but that you couldnt have been nor hope to be as long as you breathed from the meddling and the machinations and the malice of that unscrupulous and unconscionable old cat  by the time mrs mavering had hissed out the last word she had her arm round her boys neck and was clutching him safe and sound after his peril to her breast and between her kissing and crying she repeated her accusals and denunciations with violent volubility  dan could not have replied to them in that effusion of gratitude and tenderness he felt for his mothers partisanship and when she went on in almost the very terms of his selfdefence and told him that he had done as he had because it was easy for him to yield and he could not imagine a cat who would put her daughter up to entrapping him into a promise that she knew must break his mothers heart he found her so right on the main point that he could not help some question of mrs pasmer in his soul could she really have been at the bottom of it all she was very sly and she might be very false and it was certainly she who had first proposed their going abroad together it looked as if it might be as his mother said and at any rate it was no time to dispute her and he did not say a word in behalf of mrs pasmer whom she continued to rend in a thousand pieces and scatter to the winds till she had to stop breathless  yes its quite as i expected she did everything she could to trap you into it she fairly flung that poor girl at you she laid her plans so that you couldnt say noshe understood your character from the startand then when it came out by accident and she saw that she had older heads to deal with and you were not going to be quite at her mercy she dropped the mask in an instant and made alice break with you oh i could see through her from the beginning and the next time dan i advise you as you never suspect anybody yourself to consult with somebody who doesnt take people for what they seem and not to let yourself be flattered out of your sensor even if you see your father is  mrs mavering dropped back on her pillow and her husband smiled patiently at their daughter  dan saw his patient smile and understood it and the injustice which his father bore made him finally unwilling to let another remain under it hard as it was to oppose his mother in anything when she was praising him so sweetly and comforting him in the moment of his need he pulled himself together to protest no no mother i dont think mrs pasmer was to blame i dont believe she had anything to do with it shes always stood my friend  oh ive no doubt shes made you think so dan said his mother with unabated fondness for him and you think so because youre so simple and good and never suspect evil of any one its this hideous optimism thats killing everything  a certain note in the invalids falling voice seemed to warn her hearers of an impending change that could do no one good eunice rose hastily and interrupted mother mr boardmans here he came up with dan may minnie come in with him  mrs mavering shot a glance of inquiry at dan and then let a swift inspection range over all the details of the room and finally concentrate itself on the silk and lace of her bed over which she passed a smoothing hand mr boardman she cried with instantly recovered amiability of course she may     xlvii  in boston the rumour of dans broken engagement was followed promptly by a denial of it both the rumour and the denial were apparently authoritative but it gives the effect of a little greater sagacity to distrust rumours of all kinds and most people went to bed after the teas and dinners and receptions and clubs at which the fact was first debated in the selfpersuasion that it was not so the next day they found the rumour still persistent the denial was still in the air too but it seemed weaker at the end of the third day it had become a question as to which broke the engagement and why by the end of a week it was known that alice had broken the engagement but the reason could not be ascertained  this was not for want of asking more or less direct pasmer of course went and came at his club with perfect immunity men are quite as curious as women but they set business bounds to their curiosity and do not dream of passing these with women who have no business of their own and can not quell themselves with the reflection that this thing or that is not their affair there is no question so intimate that they will not put it to some other woman perhaps it is not so intimate or perhaps it will not seem so at any rate they chance it mrs pasmer was given every opportunity to explain the facts to the ladies whom she met and if she was much afflicted by alices behaviour she had a measure of consolation in using her skill to baffle the research of her acquaintance after each encounter of the kind she had the pleasure of reflecting that absolutely nothing more than she meant had become known the case never became fully known through her it was the girl herself who told it to miss cotton in one of those moments of confidence which are necessary to burdened minds and it is doubtful if more than two or three people ever clearly understood it most preferred one or other of several mistaken versions which society finally settled down to  the paroxysm of selfdoubt almost selfaccusal in which alice came to miss cotton moved the latter to the deepest sympathy and left her with misgivings which became an intolerable anguish to her conscience the child was so afflicted at what she had done not because she wished to be reconciled with her lover but because she was afraid she had been unjust been cruelly impatient and peremptory with him she seemed to miss cotton so absolutely alone and friendless with her great trouble she was so helpless so hopeless she was so anxious to do right and so fearful she had done wrong that miss cotton would not have been miss cotton if she had not taken her in her arms and assured her that in everything she had done she had been sublimely and nobly right a lesson to all her sex in such matters for ever she told her that she had always admired her but that now she idolised her that she felt like going down on her knees and simply worshipping her  oh dont say that miss cotton pleaded alice pulling away from her embrace but still clinging to her with her tremulous cold little hands i cant bear it im wicked and hard you dont know how bad i am and im afraid of being weak of doing more harm yet oh i wronged him cruelly in ever letting him get engaged to me but now what youve said will support me if you think ive done rightit must seem strange to you that i should come to you with my trouble instead of my mother but ive been to her andand we think alike on so few subjects dont you know  yes yes i know dear said miss cotton in the tender folly of her heart with the satisfaction which every woman feels in being more sufficient to another in trouble than her natural comforters  and i wanted to know how you saw it and now if you feel as you say i can never doubt myself again  she tempested out of miss cottons house all tearful under the veil she had pulled down and as she shut the door of her coupe miss cottons heart jumped into her throat with an impulse to run after her to recall her to recant to modify everything  from that moment miss cottons trouble began and it became a torment that mounted and gave her no peace till she imparted it she said to herself that she should suffer to the utmost in this matter and if she spoke to any one it must not be to same one who had agreed with her about alice but to some hard skeptical nature some one who would look at it from a totally different point of view and would punish her for her error if she had committed an error in supporting and consoling alice all the time she was thinking of mrs brinkley mrs brinkley had come into her mind at once but it was only after repeated struggles that she could get the strength to go to her  mrs brinkley sacredly pledged to secrecy listened with a sufficiently dismaying air to the story which miss cotton told her in the extremity of her fear and doubt  well she said at the end have you written to mr mavering  written to mr mavering gasped miss cotton  yesto tell him she wants him back  wants him back miss cotton echoed again  thats what she came to you for  oh mrs brinkley moaned miss cotton and she stared at her in mute reproach  mrs brinkley laughed i dont say she knew that she came for that but theres no doubt that she did and she went away bitterly disappointed with your consolation and support she didnt want anything of the kindyou may comfort yourself with that reflection miss cotton  mrs brinkley said miss cotton with a severity which ought to have been extremely effective from so mild a person do you mean to accuse that poor child of dissimulationof deceitin suchaa  no shouted mrs brinkley she didnt know what she was doing any more than you did and she went home perfectly heartbroken and i hope shell stay so for the good of all parties concerned  miss cotton was so bewildered by mrs brinkleys interpretation of alices latent motives that she let the truculent hostility of her aspiration pass unheeded she looked helplessly about and seemed faint so that mrs brinkley without appearing to notice her state interposed the question of a little sherry when it had been brought and miss cotton had sipped the glass that trembled in one hand while her emotion shattered a biscuit with the other mrs brinkley went on im glad the engagement is broken and i hope it will never be mended if what you tell me of her reason for breaking it is true  oh i feel so guilty for telling you id no right to please never speak of it pleaded miss cotton  then i feel more than ever that it was all a mistake and that to help it on again would be acrime  miss cotton gave a small jump at the word as if she had already committed the crime she had longed to do it  yes i mean to say that they are better parted than plighted if matches are made in heaven i believe some of them are unmade there too theyre not adapted to each other theres too great a disparity  you mean began miss cotton from her prepossession of alices superiority that shes altogether his inferior intellectually and morally  oh i cant admit that cried miss cotton glad to have mrs brinkley go too far and plucking up courage from her excess  intellectually and morally repeated mrs brinkley with the mounting conviction which ladies seem to get from mere persistence i saw that girl at campobello i watched her  i never felt that you did her justice cried miss cotton with the valour of a hensparrow there was an antipathy  there certainly wasnt a sympathy im happy to say retorted mrs brinkley i know her and i know her family root and branch the pasmers are the dullest and most selfish people in the world  oh i dont think thats her character said miss cotton ruffling her feathers defensively  neither do i she has no fixed character no girl has nobody has we all have twenty different charactersmore characters than gownsand we put them on and take them off just as often for different occasions i know you think each person is permanently this or that but my experience is that half the time theyre the other thing  then why said miss cotton winking hard as some weak people do when they thick they are making a point do you say that alice is dull and selfish  i dontnot always or not simply so thats the character of the pasmer blood but its crossed with twenty different currents in her and from some body that the pasmer dulness and selfishness must have driven mad she got a crazy streak of piety and thats got mixed up in her again with a nonsensical ideal of duty and everything she does she not only thinks is right but she thinks its religious and she thinks its unselfish  if youd seen her if youd heard her this morning said miss cotton you wouldnt say that mrs brinkley  mrs brinkley refused this with an impatient gesture it isnt what she is now or seems to be or thinks she is its what shes going to finally harden intowhats going to be her prevailing character now dan mavering has just the faults that will make such a girl think her own defects are virtues because theyre so different i tell you alice pasmer has neither the head nor the heart to appreciate the goodness the loveliness of a fellow like dan mavering  i think she feels his sweetness fully urged miss cotton but she couldnt endure his uncertainty with her the truth is first of all things  then shes a little goose if she had the sense to know it she would know that he might delay and temporise and beat about the bush but he would be true when it was necessary i havent the least doubt in the world but that poor fellow was going on in perfect security because he felt that it would be so easy for him to give up and supposed it would be just as easy for her i dont suppose he had a misgiving and it must have come upon him like a thunderclap  dont you think timidly suggested miss cotton that truth is the first essential in marriage  of course it is and if this girl was worthy of dan mavering if she were capable of loving him or anybody else unselfishly she would have felt his truth even if she couldnt have seen it i believe this minute that that manoeuvring humbugging mother of hers is a better woman a kinder woman than she is  alice says her mother took his part said miss cotton with a sigh she took your view of it  shes a sensible woman but i hope she wont be able to get him into her toils again continued mrs brinkley recurring to the conventional estimate of mrs pasmer  i cant help feelingbelievingthat theyll come together somehow still murmured miss cotton it seemed to her that she had all along wished this and she tried to remember if what she had said to comfort alice might be construed as adverse to a reconciliation  i hope they wont then said mrs brinkley for they couldnt help being unhappy together with their temperaments theres one thing miss cotton thats more essential in marriage than miss pasmers instantaneous honesty and thats patience  patience with wrong demanded miss cotton  yes even with wrong but i meant patience with each other marriage is a perpetual pardon concession surrender its an everlasting giving up thats the divine thing about it and thats just what miss passer could never conceive of because she is selfrighteous and conceited and unyielding she would make him miserable  miss cotton rose in a bewilderment which did not permit her to go at once there was something in her mind which she wished to urge but she could not make it out though she fingered in vague generalities when she got a block away from the house it suddenly came to her love if they loved each other would not all be well with them she would have liked to run back and put that question to mrs brinkley but just then she met brinkley lumbering heavily homeward she heard his hard breathing from the exertion of bowing to her as he passed  his wife met him in the hall and went up to kiss him he smelt abominably of tobacco smoke  hullo said her husband what are you after  nothing said his wife enjoying his joke come in here i want to tell you how i have just sat upon miss cotton     xlviii  the relations between dan and his father had always been kindly and trustful they now became in a degree that touched and flattered the young fellow confidential with the rest of the family there soon ceased to be any reference to his engagement his sisters were glad each in her way to have him back again and whatever they may have said between themselves they said nothing to him about alice his mother appeared to have finished with the matter the first night she had her theory and she did it justice and when mrs mavering had once done a thing justice she did not bring it up again unless somebody disputed it but nobody had defended mrs pasmer after dans feeble protest in her behalf mrs maverings theory was accepted with obedience if not conviction the whole affair dropped except between dan and his father  dan was certainly not so gay as he used to be he was glad to find that he was not so gay there had been a sort of mercy in the suddenness of the shock it benumbed him and the real stress and pain came during the long weeks that followed when nothing occurred to vary the situation in any manner he did not hear a word about alice from boston nor any rumour of her people  at first he had intended to go back with boardman and face it out but there seemed no use in this and when it came to the point he found it impossible boardman went back alone and he put dans things together in his rooms at boston and sent them to him so that dan remained at home  he set about helping his father at the business with unaffected docility he tried not to pose and he did his best to bear his loss and humiliation with manly fortitude but his whole life had not set so strongly in one direction that it could be sharply turned aside now and not in moments of forgetfulness press against the barriers almost to bursting now and then when he came to himself from the wonted tendency and remembered that alice and he who had been all in all to each other were now nothing the pain was so sharp so astonishing that he could not keep down a groan which he then tried to turn off with a cough or a snatch of song or a whistle looking wildly round to see if any one had noticed  once this happened when his father and he were walking silently home from the works and his father said without touching him or showing his sympathy except in his tone of humorously frank recognition does it still hurt a little occasionally dan  yes sir it hurts said the son and he turned his face aside and whistled through his teeth  well its a trial i suppose said his father with his gentle soft halflisp but there are greater trials  how greater asked dan with sad incredulity ive lost all that made life worth living and its all my own fault too  yes said his father i think she was a good girl  good cried dan the word seemed to choke him  still i doubt if its all your fault dan looked round at him he added and i think its perhaps for the best as it is  dan halted and then said oh i suppose so with dreary resignation as they walked on  let us go round by the paddock said his father and see if pats put the horses up yet you can hardly remember your mother before she became an invalid i suppose he added as dan mechanically turned aside with him from the path that led to the house into that leading to the barn  no i was such a little fellow said dan  women give up a great deal when they marry said the elder its not strange that they exaggerate the sacrifice and expect more in return than its in the nature of men to give them i should have been sorry to have you marry a woman of an exacting disposition  im afraid she was exacting said dan but she never asked more than was right  and its difficult to do all thats right suggested the elder  im sure you always have father said the son  the father did not respond i wish you could remember your mother when she was well he said presently he added i think it isnt best for a woman to be too much in love with her husband  dan took this to himself and he laughed harshly shes been able to dissemble her love at last  his father went on women keep the romantic feeling longer than men it dies out of us very soonperhaps too soon  you think i couldnt have come to time asked dan well as its turned out i wont have to  no man can be all a woman wishes him to be said his father its better for the disappointment to come before its too late  i was to blame said dan stoutly she was all right  you were to blame in the particular instance his father answered but in general the fault was in heror her temperament as long as the romance lasted she might have deluded herself and believed you were all she imagined you but romance cant last even with women i don like your faults and i dont want you to excuse them to yourself i dont like your chancing things and leaving them to come out all right of themselves but ive always tried to make you children see all your qualities in their true proportion and relation  yes i know that sir said dan  perhaps continued his father as they swung easily along shoulder to shoulder i may have gone too far in that direction because i was afraid that you might take your mother too seriously in the otherthat you might not understand that she judged you from her nerves and not her convictions its part of her malady of her suffering that her inherited puritanism clouds her judgment and makes her see all faults as of one size and equally damning i wish you to know that she was not always so but was once able to distinguish differences in error and to realise that evil is of illwill  yes i know that said dan she is nowwhen she feels well  harm comes from many things but evil is of the heart i wouldnt have you condemn yourself too severely for harm that you didnt intendthats remorsethats insanity and i wouldnt have you fall under the condemnation of anothers invalid judgment  thank you father said dan  they had come up to the paddock behind the barn and they laid their arms on the fence while they looked over at the horses which were still there the beasts in their rough winter coats some bedaubed with frozen clots of the mud in which they had been rolling earlier in the afternoon stood motionless in the thin keen breeze that crept over the hillside from the march sunset and blew their manes and tails out toward dan and his father dans pony sent him a gleam of recognition from under his frowsy bangs but did not stir  bunch looks like a caterpillar he said recalling the time when his father had given him the pony he was a boy then and the pony was as much to him it went through his mind as alice had ever been was it all a jest an irony he asked himself  hes getting pretty old said his father lets see you were only twelve  ten said dan weve had him thirteen years  some of the horses pricked up their ears at the sound of their voices one of them bit anothers neck the victim threw up his heels and squealed  pat called from the stable heigh you divils  i think hed better take them in said dans father and he continued as if it were all the same subject i hope youll have seen something more of the world before you fall in love the next time  thank you there wont be any next time but do you consider the world such a school of morals then i supposed it was a very bad place  we seem to have been all born into it said the father he lifted his arms from the fence and dan mechanically followed him into the stable a warm homely smell of hay and of horses filled the place a lantern glimmered a faint blot in the loft where pat was pitching some hay forward to the edge of the boards the naphtha gas weakly flared from the jets beside the harnessroom whence a smell of leather issued and mingled with the other smell the simple earthy wholesomeness of the place appealed to dan and comforted him the hay began to tumble from the loft with a pleasant rustling sound  his father called up to pat i think youd better take the horses in now  yes sir ive got the boxstalls ready for em  dan remembered how he and eunice used to get into the boxstall with his pony and play at circus with it he stood up on the pony and his sister was the ringmaster the picture of his careless childhood reflected a deeper pathos upon his troubled present and he sighed again  his father said as they moved on through the barn some of the best people ive ever known were what were called worldly people they are apt to be sincere and they have none of the spiritual pride the conceit of selfrighteousness which often comes to people who are shut up by conscience or circumstance to the study of their own motives and actions  i dont think she was one of that kind said dan  oh i dont know that she was but the chances of happiness of goodness would be greater with a less selfcentred personfor you  ah yes for me said dan bitterly because i hadnt it in me to be frank with her with a man like me a woman had better be a little scampish too father i could get over the loss she might have died and i could have got over that but i cant get over being to blame  i dont think id indulge in any remorse said his father theres nothing so useless so depraving as that if you see youre wrong its for your warning not for your destruction  dan was not really feeling very remorseful he had never felt that he was much to blame but he had an intellectual perception of the case and he thought that he ought to feel remorseful it was this persuasion that he took for an emotion he continued to look very disconsolate  come said his father touching his arm i dont want you to brood upon these things it can do no manner of good i want you to go to new york next week and look after that lafflin process if its what he thinksif he can really cast his brass patterns without airholesit will revolutionise our business i want to get hold of him  the portuguese cook was standing in the basement door which they passed at the back of the house he saluted father and son with a glittering smile  hello joe said dan  ah joe said his father he touched his hat to the cook who snatched his cap off  what a brick you are father thought dan his heart leaped at the notion of getting away from ponkwasset he perceived how it had been irking him to stay if you think i could manage it with lafflin  oh i think you could hes another slippery chap  dan laughed for pleasure and pain at his fathers joke     xlix  in new york dan found that lafflin had gone to washington to look up something in connection with his patent in his eagerness to get away from home dan had supposed that his father meant to make a holiday for him and he learned with a little surprise that he was quite in earnest about getting hold of the invention he wrote home of lafflins absence and he got a telegram in reply ordering him to follow on to washington  the sun was shining warm on the asphalt when he stepped out of the pennsylvania depot with his bag in his hand and put it into the hansom that drove up for him the sky overhead was of an intense blue that made him remember the boston sky as pale and grey when the hansom tilted out into the avenue he had a joyous glimpse of the white house of the capitol swimming like a balloon in the cloudless air a keen march breeze swept the dust before him and through its veil the classic treasury building showed like one edifice standing perfect amid ruin represented by the jagtooth irregularities of the business architecture along the wide street  he had never been in washington before and he had a confused sense of having got back to rome which he remembered from his boyish visit throughout his stay he seemed to be coming up against the facade of the temple of neptune but it was the patent office or the treasury building or the white house and under the gay southern sky this reversion to the sensations of a happier time began at once and made itself a lasting relief he felt a lift in his spirits from the first they gave him a room at wormleys where the chairs comported themselves as selfrespectfully upon two or three legs as they would have done at boston upon four the cooking was excellent and a mercenary welcome glittered from all the kind black faces around him after the quiet of ponkwasset and the rush of new york the lazy ease of the hotel pleased him the clack of boots over its pavements the clouds of tobacco smoke the southern and western accents the spectacle of people unexpectedly encountering and recognising each other in the office and the diningroom all helped to restore him to a hopefuller mood without asking his heart too curiously why he found it lighter he felt that he was still young  in the weather he had struck a cold wave and the wind was bitter in the streets but they were full of sun he found the grass green in sheltered places and in one of the circles he plucked a blossomed spray from an adventurous forceythia this happened when he was walking from wormleys to the arlington by a roundabout way of his own involuntary invention and he had the flowers in his buttonhole when lafflin was pointed out to him in the reading room there and he introduced himself lafflin had put his hat far back on his head and was intensely chewing a toothpick with an air of rapture from everything about him he seemed a very simple soul to dans inexperience of men and the young fellow had no difficulty in committing him to a fair conditional arrangement he was going to stay some days in washington and he promised other interviews so that dan thought it best to stay too he used a sheet of the arlington letterpaper in writing his father of what he had done and then as lafflin had left him he posted his letter at the clerks desk and wandered out through a corridor different from that which he had come in by it led by the door of the ladies parlour and at the sound of womens voices dan halted for no other reason than that such voices always irresistibly allured him he went in putting on an air of having come to look for some one there were two or three groups of ladies receiving friends in different parts of the room at the window a girls figure silhouetted itself against the keen light and as he advanced into the room peering about it turned with a certain vividness that seemed familiar this young lady whoever she was had the advantage of dan in seeing him with the light on his face and he was still in the dark about her when she advanced swiftly upon him holding out her hand  you dont seem to know your old friends mr mavering and the manly tones left him no doubt  he felt a rush of gladness and he clasped her hand and clung to it as if he were not going to let it go again bubbling out incoherencies of pleasure at meeting her why miss anderson you here what a piece of luck of course i couldnt see you against the windowmake you out but something looked familiarand the way you turned and when you started toward me im awfully glad whenwhere are youthat is  miss anderson kept laughing with him and bubbled back that she was very glad too and she was staying with her aunt in that hotel and they had been there a month and didnt he think washington was charming but it was too bad he had just got there with that blizzard the weather had been perfectly divine till the day before yesterday  he took the spray of forceythia out of his buttonhole i can believe it i found this in one of the squares and i think it belongs to you he offered it with a bow and a laugh and she took it in the same humour  what is the language of forceythia she asked  it has noneonly expressive silence you know  a middleaged lady came in and miss anderson said my aunt mr mavering  mr mavering will hardly remember me said the lady giving him her hand he protested that he should indeed but she had really made but a vague impression upon him at campobello he knew that she was there with miss anderson he had been polite to her as he was to all women but he had not noticed her much and in his heart he had a slight for her as compared with the boston people he was more naturally thrown with he certainly had not remembered that she was a little hard of hearing  miss van hook was in a steelgrey effect of dress and she had carried this up into her hair of which she worn two short vertical curls on each temple  she did not sit down and dan perceived that the ladies were going out in her tailormade suit of closefitting serge and her paris bonnet carried like a crest on her pretty little head miss anderson was charming she had a short veil that came across the base of her lively nose and left her mouth and chin to make the most of themselves unprejudiced by its irregularity  dan felt it a hardship to part with them but he prepared to take himself off miss anderson asked him how long he was to be in washington and said he must come to see them they meant to stay two weeks yet and then they were going to old point comfort they had their rooms engaged  he walked down to their carriage with the ladies and put them into it and miss anderson still kept him talking there  her aunt said why shouldnt you come with us mr mavering were going to mrs secretary millers reception  dan gave himself a glance i dont knowif you want me  we want you said miss anderson very well then ill go  he got in and they began rolling over that smooth washington asphalt which makes talk in a carriage as easy as in a drawingroom dan kept saying to himself now shes going to bring up campobello but miss anderson never recurred to their former meeting and except for the sense of old acquaintance which was manifest in her treatment of him he might have thought that they had never met before she talked of washington and its informal delights and of those plans which her aunt had made like every one who spends a month in washington to spend all the remaining winters of her life there  it seemed to dan that miss anderson was avoiding campobello on his account he knew from what alice had told him that there had been much surmise about their affair after he had left the island and he suspected that miss anderson thought the subject was painful to him he wished to reassure her he asked at the first break in the talk about washington how are the trevors  oh quite well she said promptly availing herself of the opening have you seen any of our campobello friends lately in boston  no ive been at home for the last monthin the country he scanned her face to see if she knew anything of his engagement but she seemed honestly ignorant of everything since campobello she was not just the kind of new york girl who would visit in boston or have friends living there probably she had never heard of his engagement somehow this seemed to simplify matters for dan she did not ask specifically after the pasmers but that might have been because of the sort of break in her friendship with alice after that night at the trevors she did not ask specifically after mrs brinkley or any of the others  at mrs secretary millers door there was a rapid arrival and departure of carriages of coupes of hansoms and of herdics all managed by a man in plain livery who opened and shut the doors and sent the drivers off without the intervention of a policeman it is the genius of washington which distinguishes it from every other capital from every other city to make no show of formality of any manner of constraint anywhere people were swarming in and out coming and going on foot as well as by carriage the blandest of coloured uncles received their cards in the hall and put them into a vast tray heaped up with pasteboard smiling affectionately upon them as if they had done him a favour  dont you like them asked dan of miss anderson he meant the southern negroes  i adoye them she responded with equal fervour you must study some new types here for next summer she added  dan laughed and winced too yes then he said solemnly i am not going to campobello next summer  they felt into a stream of people tending toward an archway between the drawingrooms where mrs secretary miller stood with two lady friends who were helping her receive they smiled wearily but kindly upon the crowd for whom the secretarys wife had a look of impartial hospitality she could not have known more than one in fifty and she met them all with this look at first breaking into incredulous recognition when she found a friend dont go away yet she said cordially to miss van hook and her niece and she held their hands for a moment with a gentle look of relief and appeal which included dan let me introduce you to mrs tolliver and to miss dixon  these ladies said that it was not necessary in regard to miss anderson and miss van hook and as the crowd pushed them on dan felt that they had been received with distinction  the crowd expressed the national variety of rich and poor plain and fashionable urbane and rustic they elbowed and shouldered each other upon a perfect equality in a place where all were as free to come as to the white house and they jostled quaint groups of almondeyed legations in the yellows and purples of the east who looked dreamily on as if puzzled past all surmise by the scene certain young gentlemen with the unmistakable air of being european or south american attaches found their way about on their little feet which the stalwart boots of the republican masses must have imperilled and smiled with a faint diplomatic superiority not visibly admitted but all the same indisputable several of these seemed to know miss anderson and took her presentation of mavering with exaggerated effusion  i want to introduce you to my cousin over yonder she said getting rid of a minute brazilian undersecretary and putting her hand on dans arm to direct him mrs justice averill  miss van hook keeping her look of severe vigilance really followed her energetic niece who took the lead as a young lady must whenever she and her chaperon meet on equal terms  mrs justice averill who was from the far west somewhere received dan with the ease of the far east and was talking london and paris to him before the end of the third minute it gave dan a sense of liberation of expansion he filled his lungs with the cosmopolitan air in a sort of intoxication without formulating it he felt with the astonishment which must always attend the bostonians perception of the fact that there is a great social life in america outside of boston at campobello he had thought miss anderson a very jolly girl bright and up to all sorts of things but in the presence of the portable boston there he could not help regarding her with a sort of tolerance which he now blushed for he thought he had been a great ass she seemed to know all sorts of nice people and she strove with generous hospitality to make him have a good time she said it was cabinet day and that all the secretaries wives were receiving and she told him he had better make the rounds with them he assented very willingly and at six oclock he was already so much in the spirit of this free and simple society so much opener and therefore so much wiser than any other that he professed a profound disappointment with the two or three cabinet ladies whose failure to receive brought his pleasure to a premature close  but i suppose youre going to mrs whittingtons tonight miss anderson said to him as they drove up to wormleys where she set him down miss van hook had long ceased to say anything dan thought her a perfect duenna you know you can go late there she added  no i cant go at all said dan i dont know them  theyre new england people urged miss anderson as if to make him try to think that he was asked to mrs whittingtons  i dont know more than half the population of new england said dan with apparent levity but real forlornness  if youd like to goif youre sure youve no other engagement  oh im certain of that  we would come for you  do  at halfpast ten then  miss anderson explained to her aunt who cordially confirmed her invitation and they both shook hands with him upon it and he backed out of the carriage with a grin of happiness on his face it remained there while he wrote out the order for his dinner which they require at wormleys in holograph the waiter reflected his smile with ethnical warmheartedness for a moment dan tried to think what it was he had forgotten he thought it was some other dish then he remembered that it was his broken heart he tried to subdue himself but there was something in the air of the place the climate perhaps or a pleasant sense of its facile social life that kept him buoyant in spite of himself he went out after dinner and saw part of a poor play and returned in time to dress for his appointment with miss anderson her aunt was with her of course she seemed to dan more indefatigable than she was by day he could not think her superfluous and she was very goodnatured she made little remarks full of conventional wisdom and appealed to his judgment on several points as they drove along when they came to a street lamp where she could see him he nodded and said yes or no respectfully between times he talked with miss anderson who lectured him upon washington society and prepared him for the difference he was to find between mrs whittingtons evening of invited guests and the cabinet ladies afternoon of volunteer guests  volunteer guests is good he laughed do you mean that anybody can go  anybody that is able to be about this is cabinet day theres a supreme court day and a senators day and a representatives day do you mean to say you werent going to call upon your senator  i didnt know i had any  neither did i till i came here but youve got two everybodys got two and the presidents wife receives three times a week and the president has two or three days they say the public days at the white house are great fun ive been to some of the invited or semiinvited or official evenings  he could not see that difference from the great public receptions which miss anderson had promised him at mrs whittingtons though he pretended afterward that he had done so the people were more uniformly well dressed there were not so many of them and the hostess was sure of knowing her acquaintances at first glance but there was the same ease the same unconstraint the same absence of provincial anxiety which makes a washington a lighter and friendlier london there were rather more sallow attaches in their lowcut white waistcoats with small brass buttons they moved more consciously about and looked weightier personages than several foreign ministers who were present  dan was soon lost from the side of miss anderson who more and more seemed to him important socially she seemed in her present leadership to know more of life than he to be maturer but she did not abuse her superiority she kept an effect of her last summers friendliness for him throughout several times finding herself near him she introduced him to people  guests kept arriving till midnight among the latest when dan had lost himself far from boston in talk with a young lady from richmond who spoke with a slur of her vowels that fascinated him came mr and mrs brinkley he felt himself grow pale and inattentive to his pretty virginian that accent of mrs brinkleys recalled him to his history he hoped that she would not see him but in another moment he was greeting her with a warmth which bostonians seldom show in meeting at boston  when did you come to washington she asked trying to keep her consciousness out of her eyes which she let dwell kindly upon him  day before yesterdayno yesterday it seems a month ive seen and done so much he said with his laugh miss andersons been showing me the whole of washington society have you been here long  since morning said mrs brinkley and she added miss anderson  yescampobello dont you know  oh yes is she here tonight  i came with her and her aunt  oh yes  how is all boston asked dan boldly  i dont know im just going down to old point comfort to ask every other house on the back bay has been abandoned for the hygeia mrs brinkley stopped and then she asked are you just up from there  no but i dont know but i shall go  hello mavering said mr brinkley coming up and taking his hand into his fat grasp on your way to fortress monroe better come with us why munt  he turned to greet this other bostonian who had hardly expressed his joy at meeting with his fellowtownsmen when the hostess rustled softly up and said with the irony more or less friendly which everybody uses in speaking of boston or recognising the intellectual preeminence of its people im not going to let you keep this feast of reason all to your selves i want you to leaven the whole lump and she began to disperse them and to introduce them about right and left  dan tried to find his virginian again but she was gone he found miss anderson she was with her aunt shall we be tearing you away she asked  oh no im quite ready to go  his nerves were in a tremble those boston faces and voices had brought it all back again it seemed as if he had met alice he was silent and incoherent as they drove home but miss anderson apparently did not want to talk much and apparently did not notice his reticence  he fell asleep with the pang in his heart which had been there so often  when dan came down to breakfast he found the brinkleys at a pleasant place by one of the windows and after they had exchanged a pleased surprise with him that they should all happen to be in the same hotel they asked him to sit at their table  there was a bright sun shining and the ache was gone out of dans heart he began to chatter gaily with mrs brinkley about washington  oh better come on to fortress monroe said her husband better come on with us  no i cant just yet said dan ive got some business here that will keep me for awhile perhaps i may run down there a little later  miss anderson seems to have a good deal of business in washington too observed brinkley with some hazy notion of saying a pleasant rallying thing to the young man he wondered at the glare his wife gave him with those panned oysters before him he had forgotten all about dans love affair with miss pasmer  mrs brinkley hastened to make the mention of miss anderson as impersonal as possible  it was so nice to meet her again she is such an honest wholesome creature and so bright and full of sense she always made me think of the broad daylight i always liked that girl  yes isnt she jolly said dan joyously she seems to know everybody here its a great piece of luck for me theyre going to take a house in washington next winter  yes i know that stage said mrs brinkley her aunts an amusingly newyork respectability i dont think youd find just such miss mitford curls as hers in all boston  yes they are like the portraits arent they said dan delighted shes very nice dont you think  very but miss anderson is more than that i was disposed to be critical of her at campobello for a while but she wore extremely well all at once you found yourself admiring her uncommon commonsense  yes thats just it cried dan she is so sensible  i think shes very pretty said mrs brinkley  well her nose suggested dan it seems a little capricious  its a trifle bizarre i suppose but what beautiful eyes and her figure i declare that girls carriage is something superb  yes she has a magnificent walk  walks with her carriage mused brinkley aloud  his wife did not regard him i dont know what miss andersons principles are but her practices are perfect i never knew her do an unkind or shabby thing she seems very good and very wise and that deep voice of hers has such a charm its so restful you feel as if you could repose upon it for a thousand years well you will get down before we leave  yes i will said dan im here after a man whos after a patent and as soon as i can finish up my business with him i believe i will run down to fortress monroe  this elevenoclock train will get you there at six said brinkley better telegraph for your rooms  or let us know said mrs brinkley and well secure them for you  oh thank you said dan  he went away feeling that mrs brinkley was the pleasantest woman he ever met he knew that she had talked miss anderson so fully in order to take away the implication of her husbands joke and he admired her tact he thought of this as he loitered along the street from wormleys to the arlington where he was going to find miss anderson by an appointment of the night before and take a walk with her and thinking of tact made him think of mrs pasmer mrs pasmer was full of tact and how kind she had always been to him she had really been like a mother to him he was sure she had understood him he believed she had defended him with a futility of which he felt the pathos he made her defend him now to alice alice was very hard and cold as when he saw her last her mothers words fell upon her as upon a stone even mrs pasmers tears which dan made her shed had no effect upon the haughty girl not that he cared now  the blizzard of the previous days had whirled away the sunshine lay still with a warm glisten and sparkle on the asphalt which seemed to bask in it and which it softened to the foot he loitered by the gate of the little park or plantation where the statue of general jackson is riding a cockhorse to banbury cross and looked over at the frenchitalian classicism of the white house architecture with a pensive joy at finding pleasure in it and then he went on to the arlington  miss anderson was waiting for him in the parlour and they went a long walk up the avenues and across half the alphabet in the streets and through the pretty squares and circles where the statues were sometimes beautiful and always picturesque and the sparrows made a vernal chirping in the naked trees and on the green grass in two or three they sat down on the iron benches and rested  they talked and talkedabout the people they knew and of whom they found that they thought surprisingly alike and about themselves whom they found surprisingly alike in a great many things and then surprisingly unlike dan brought forward some points of identity which he and alice had found in themselves it was just the same with miss anderson she found herself rather warm with the sealskin sacque she had put on she let him carry it on his arm while they walked and then lay it over her shoulders when they sat down he felt a pang of selfreproach as if he had been inconstant to alice this was an old habit of feeling formed during the months of their engagement when at her inspiration he was always bringing himself to book about something he replied to her bitterly in the colloquy which began to hold itself in his mind and told her that she had no claim upon him now that if his thoughts wandered from her it was her fault not his that she herself had set them free but in fact he was like all young men with a thousand potentialities of loving there was no aspect of beauty that did not tenderly move him he could not help a soft thrill at the sight of any pretty shape the sound of any piquant voice and alice had merely been the synthesis of all that was most charming to this fancy this is a truth which it is the convention of the poets and the novelists to deny but it is also true that she might have remained the sum of all that was loveliest if she would or if she could  it was chiefly because she would not or could not that his glance recognised the charm of miss andersons back hair both in its straying gossamer and in the loose mass in which it was caught up under her hat when he laid her sacque on her shoulders they met that afternoon at a senators and in the house of a distinguished citizen to whose wife dan had been presented at mrs whittingtons and who had somehow got his address and sent him a card for her evening they encountered here with a jocose old friendliness and a profession of being tired of always meeting miss anderson and mr mavering he brought her salad and ice and they made an appointment for another walk in the morning if it was fine  he carried her some flowers a succession of fine days followed and they walked every morning sometimes dan was late and explained that it was his patentright man had kept him she was interested in the patentright man whom dan began to find not quite so simple as at first but she was not exacting with him about his want of punctuality she was very easygoing she was not always ready herself when he began to beat about the bush to talk insincerities and to lose himself in intentionless plausibilities she waited with serene patience for him to have done and met him on their habitual ground of frankness and reality as if he had not left it he got to telling her all his steps with his patentright man who seemed to be growing mote and more slippery and who presently developed a demand for funds then she gave him some very shrewd practical advice and told him to go right into the hotel office and telegraph to his father while she was putting on her bonnet  yes he said thats what i thought of doing but he admired her for advising him he said to himself that miss anderson was the kind of girl his father would admire she was good and she was of the world too that was what his father meant he imagined himself arriving home and saying well father you know that despatch i sent you about lafflins wanting money and telling him about miss anderson then he fancied her acquainted with his sisters and visiting them and his father more and more fond of her and perhaps in declining health and eager to see his son settled in life and he pictured himself telling her that he had done with love for ever but if she could accept respect fidelity gratitude he was ready to devote his life to her she refused him but they always remained good friends and comrades she married another perhaps boardman while dan was writing out his telegram and he broke into whispered maledictions on his folly which attracted the notice of the operator  one morning when he sent up his name to miss anderson whom he did not find in the hotel parlour the servant came back with word that miss van hook would like to have him come up to their rooms but it was miss anderson who met him at the door  it seemed rather formal to send you word that miss van hook was indisposed and miss anderson would be unable to walk this morning and i thought perhaps youd rather come up and get my regrets in person and i wanted you to see our view  she led the way to the window for it but they did not look at it though they sat down there apparently for the purpose dan put his hat beside his chair and observed some inattentive civilities in inquiring after miss van hooks health and in hearing that it was merely a bad headache one of a sort in which her niece hated to leave her to serve herself with the wet compresses which miss van hook always bore on her forehead for it  one thing its decided us to be off for fortress monroe at last we shall go by the boat tomorrow if my aunts better  tomorrow said dan whats to become of me when youre gone  oh we shall not take the whole population with us suggested miss anderson  i wish you would take me i told mrs brinkley i would come while she was there but im afraid i cant get off lafflin is developing into all sorts of strange propositions  i think youd better look out for that man said miss anderson  oh i do nothing without consulting my father but i shall miss you  thank you said the girl gravely  i dont mean in a business capacity only  they both laughed and dan looked about the room which he found was a private hotel parlour softened to a more domestic effect by the signs of its prolonged occupation by two refined women on a table stood a leather photograph envelope with three cabinet pictures in it along the top lay a spray of withered forceythia dans wandering eyes rested on it miss anderson went and softly closed the door opening into the next room  i was afraid our talking might disturb my aunt she said and on her way back to him she picked up the photograph case and brought it to the light these are my father and mother we live at yonkers but im with my aunt a good deal of the time in towneven when im at home she laughed at her own contradictory statement and put the case back without explaining the third figurea figure in uniform dan conjectured a military brother or from her indifference perhaps a militia brother and then forgot about him but the partial yonkers residence accounted for traits of unconventionality in miss anderson which he had not been able to reconcile with the notion of an exclusively new york breeding he felt the relief the sympathy the certainty of intelligence which every person whose life has been partly spent in the country feels at finding that a suspected cockney has also had the outlook into nature and simplicity  on the yonkers basis they became more intimate more personal and dan told her about ponkwasset falls and his mother and sisters he told her about his father and she said she should like to see his father she thought he must be like her father  all at once and for no reason that he could think of afterward except perhaps the desire to see the case with her eyes he began to tell her of his affair with alice and how and why it was broken off he told the whole truth in regard to that and did not spare himself  she listened without once speaking but without apparent surprise at the confidence though she may have felt surprised at times she looked as if her thoughts were away from what he was saying  he ended with im sure i dont know why ive told you all this but i wanted you to know about me the worst  miss anderson said looking down i always thought she was a very conscientious giyl then after a pause in which she seemed to be overcoming an embarrassment in being obliged to speak of another in such a conviction i think she was very moybid she was like ever so many new england giyls that ive met they seem to want some excuse for suffering and they must suffer even if its through somebody else i dont know theyre romantic new england giyls are they have too many ideals  dan felt a balm in this he too had noticed a superfluity of ideals in alice he had borne the burden of realising some of them they all seemed to relate in objectionable degree to his perfectionation so he said gloomily she was very good and i was to blame  oh yes said miss anderson catching her breath in a queer way she seyved you right  she rose abruptly as if she heard her aunt speak and dan perceived that he had been making a long call  he went away dazed and dissatisfied he knew now that he ought not to have told miss anderson about his affair unless he meant more by his confidence than he really didunless he meant to follow it up  he took leave of her and asked her to make his adieux to her aunt but the next day he came down to the boat to see them off it seemed to him that their interview had ended too hastily he felt sore and restless over it he hoped that something more conclusive might happen but at the boat miss anderson and her aunt were inseparable miss van hook said she hoped they should soon see him at the hygeia and he replied that he was not sure that he should be able to come after all  miss anderson called something after him as he turned from them to go ashore he ran back eagerly to know what it was better lookout for that mr lafflin of yours she repeated  oh oh yes he said indefinitely disappointed i shall keep a sharp eye on him he was disappointed but he could not have said what he had hoped or expected her to say he was humbled before himself for having told miss anderson about his affair with alice and had wished she would say something that he might scramble back to his selfesteem upon he had told her all that partly from mere weakness from his longing for the sympathy which he was always so ready to give and partly from the willingness to pose before her as a broken heart to dazzle her by the irony and persiflage with which he could treat such a tragical matter but he could not feel that he had succeeded the sum of her comment had been that alice had served him right he did not know whether she really believed that or merely said it to punish him for some reason but he could never let it be the last word he tingled as he turned to wave his handkerchief to her on the boat with the suspicion that she was laughing at him and he could not console himself with any hero of a novel who had got himself into just such a box there were always circumstances incidents mitigations that kept the hero still a hero and ennobled the box into an unjust prison cell     l  on the long sunny piazza of the hygeia mrs brinkley and miss van hook sat and talked in a community of interest which they had not discovered during the summer before at campobello and with an equality of hearing which the sound of the waves washing almost at their feet established between them in this pleasant noise miss van hook heard as well as any one and mrs brinkley gradually realised that it was the trouble of having to lift her voice that had kept her from cultivating a very agreeable acquaintance before the ladies sat in a secluded corner wearing light wraps that they had often found comfortable at campobello in august and from time to time attested to each other their astonishment that they needed no more at old point in early april  they did this not only as a just tribute to the amiable climate but as a relief from the topic which had been absorbing them and to which they constantly returned  no said mrs brinkley with a sort of finality i think it is the best thing that could possibly have happened to him he is bearing it in a very manly way but i fancy he has felt it deeply poor fellow hes never been in boston since and i dont believe hed come here if hed any idea how many boston people there were in the hotelwe swarm it would be very painful to him  yes said miss van hook young people seem to feel those things  of course hes going to get over it thats what young people do too at his age he cant help being caught with every pretty face and every pretty figure even in the midst of his woe and its only a question of time till he seizes some pretty hand and gets drawn out of it altogether  i think that would be the case with my niece too said miss van hook if she wasnt kept in it by a sense of loyalty i dont believe she really dares much for lieutenant willing any more but he sees no society where hes stationed of course and his constancy is aa rebuke and aaan incentive to her they were engaged a long time ago just after he left west pointand weve always been in hopes that he would be removed to some post where he could meet other ladies and become interested in some one else but he never has and so the affair remains its most undesirable they should marry and in the meantime she wont break it off and its spoiling her chances in life  it is too bad sighed mrs brinkley but of course you can do nothing i see that  no we can do nothing we have tried everything i used to think it was because she was so dull there at yonkers with her family and brooded upon the one idea all the time that she could not get over it and at first it did seem when she came to me that she would get over it she is very fond of gaietyof young mens society and shes had plenty of little flirtations that didnt mean anything and never amounted to anything every now and then a letter would come from the wilds where he was stationed and spoil it all she seemed to feel a sort of chivalrous obligation because he was so far off and helpless and lonely  yes i understand said mrs brinkley what a pity she couldnt be made to feel that that didnt deepen the obligation at all  ive tried to make her said miss van hook and ive been everywhere with her one winter we were up the nile and another in nice and last winter we were in rome she met young men everywhere and had offers upon offers but it was of no use she remained just the same and till she met mr mavering in washington i dont believe  miss van hook stopped and mrs brinkley said and yet she always seemed to me particularly practical and levelheadedas the men say  so she is but she is really very romantic about some things and when it comes to a matter of that kind girls are about all alike dont you think  oh yes said mrs brinkley hopelessly and both ladies looked out over the water where the waves came rolling in one after another to waste themselves on the shore as futilely as if they had been lives  in the evening miss anderson got two letters from the clerk at the hour when the ladies all flocked to his desk with the eagerness for letters which is so engaging in them one she pulled open and glanced at with a sort of impassioned indifference the other she read in one intense moment and then ran it into her pocket and with her hand still on it hurried vividly flushing to her room and read and read it again with constantly mounting emotion  wormleys hotel washington april 7 188  dear miss andersoni have been acting on your parting advice to look out for that mr lafflin of mine and i have discovered that he is an unmitigated scamp consequently there is nothing more to keep me in washington and i should now like your advice about coming to fortress monroe do you find it malarial on the boat your aunt asked me to come but you said nothing about it and i was left to suppose that you did not think it would agree with me do you still think so or what do you think i know you think it was uncalled for and in extremely bad taste for me to tell you what i did the other day and i have thought so too there is only one thing that could justify itthat is i think it might justify itif you thought so but i do not feel sure that you would like to know it or if you knew it would like it ive been rather slow coming to the conclusion myself and perhaps its only the beginning of the end and not the conclusionif there is such a difference but the question now is whether i may come and tell you what i think it isjustify myself or make things worse than they are now i dont know that they can be worse but i think i should like to try i think your presence would inspire me  washington is a wilderness since missvan hook left it is not a howling wilderness simply because it has not enough left in it to howl but it has all the other merits of a wilderness  yours sincerely  d f mavering   after a second perusal of this note miss anderson recurred to the other letter which she had neglected for it and read it with eyes from which the tears slowly fell upon it then she sat a long time at her table with both letters before her and did not move except to take her handkerchief out of her pocket and dry her eyes from which the tears began at once to drip again at last she started forward and caught pen and paper toward her biting her lip and frowning as if to keep herself firm and she said to the central figure in the photograph case which stood at the back of the table i will i will you are a man anyway  she sat down and by a series of impulses she wrote a letter with which she gave herself no pause till she put it in the clerks hands to whom she ran downstairs with it kicking her skirt into wild whirls as she ran and catching her foot in it and stumbling  will it gogo tonight she demanded tragically  just in time said the clerk without looking up and apparently not thinking that her tone betrayed any unusual amount of emotion in a lady posting a letter he was used to intensity on such occasions  the letter ran  dear mr maveringwe shall now be here so short a time that i do not think it advisable for you to come  your letter was rather enigmatical and i do not know whether i understood it exactly i suppose you told me what you did for good reasons of your own and i did not think much about it i believe the question of taste did not come up in my mind  my aunt joins me in kindest regards  yours very sincerely  julia v h anderson  psi think that i ought to return your letter i know that you would not object to my keeping it but it does not seem right i wish to ask your congratulations i have been engaged for several years to lieutenant willing of the army he has been transferred from his post in montana to fort hamilton at new york and we are to be married in june   the next morning mrs brinkley came up from breakfast in a sort of duplex excitement which she tried to impart to her husband he stood with his back toward the door bending forward to the glass for a more accurate view of his face from which he had scraped half the lather in shaving  she had two cards in her hand miss van hook and miss anderson have gone they went this morning i found their p p cs by my plate  mr brinkley made an inarticulate noise for comment and assumed the contemptuous sneer which some men find convenient for shaving the lower lip  and guess whos come of all people in the world  i dont know said brinkley seizing his chance to speak  the pasmersalice and her mother isnt it awful  mr brinkley had entered upon a very difficult spot at the corner of his left jaw he finished it before he said i dont see anything awful about it so long as pasmer hasnt come too  but dan mavering hes in washington and he may come down here any day just think how shocking that would be  isnt that rather a theory asked mr brinkley finding such opportunities for conversation as he could i dare say mrs pasmer would be very glad to see him  ive no doubt she would said mrs brinkley but its the worst thing that could happenfor him and i feel like writing him not to cometelegraphing him  you know how the man made a fortune in chicago said her husband drying his razor tenderly on a towel before beginning to strop it i advise you to let the whole thing alone it doesnt concern us in any way whatever  then said mrs brinkley there ought to be a committee to take it in hand and warn him  i dare say you could make one up among the ladies but dont be the first to move in the matter  i really believe said his wife with her mind taken off the point by the attractiveness of a surmise which had just occurred to her that mrs pasmer would be capable of following him down if she knew he was in washington  yes if she know but she probably doesnt  yes said mrs brinkley disappointedly i think the sudden departure of the van hooks must have had something to do with dan mavering  seems a very influential young man said her husband he attracts and repels people right and left did you speak to the pasmers  no youd better when you go down theyve just come into the diningroom the girl looks like death  well ill talk to her about mavering thatll cheer her up  mrs brinkley looked at him for an instant as if she really thought him capable of it then she joined him in his laugh  mrs brinkley had theorised alice pasmer as simply and primitively selfish like the rest of the pasmers in whom the family traits prevailed  when mavering stopped coming to her house after his engagement she justly suspected that it was because alice had forbidden him and she had rejoiced at the broken engagement as an escape for dan she had frankly said so and she had received him back into full favour at the first moment in washington she liked miss anderson and she had hoped with the interest which women feel in every such affair that her flirtation with him might become serious but now this had apparently not happened julia anderson was gone with mystifying precipitation and alice pasmer had come with an unexpectedness which had the aspect of fatality  mrs brinkley felt bound of course since there was no open enmity between them to meet the pasmers on the neutral ground of the hygeia with conventional amiability she was really touched by the absent wanness of the girls look and by the latercoming recognition which shaped her mouth into a pathetic snide alice did not look like death quite as mrs brinkley had told her husband with the necessity her sex has for putting its superlatives before its positives but she was pale and thin and she moved with a languid step when they all met at night after mrs brinkley had kept out of the pasmers way during the day  she has been ill all the latter part of the winter said mrs pasmer to mrs brinkley that night in the corner of the spreading hotel parlours where they found themselves mrs pasmer did not look well herself she spoke with her eyes fixed anxiously on the door alice had just passed out of she is going to bed but i know i shall find her awake whenever i go  perhaps suggested mrs brinkley this soft heavy sea air will put her to sleep she tried to speak drily and indifferently but she could not she was in fact very much interested by the situation and she was touched in spite of her distaste for them both by the evident unhappiness of mother and daughter she knew what it came from and she said to herself that they deserved it but this did not altogether fortify her against their pathos i can hardly keep awake myself she added gruffly  i hope it may help her said mrs pasmer the doctor strongly urged our coming  mr pasmer isnt with you said mrs brinkley feeling that it was decent to say something about him  no he was detained mrs pasmer did not explain the cause of his detention and the two ladies slowly waved their fans a moment in silence are there many boston people in the house mrs pasmer asked  its full of them cried mrs brinkley  i had scarcely noticed sighed mrs pasmer and mrs brinkley knew that this was not true alice takes up all my thoughts she added and this might be true enough she leaned a little forward and asked in a low entreating voice over her fan mrs brinkley have you seen mr mavering lately  mrs brinkley considered this a little too bold a little too brazen had they actually come south in pursuit of him it was shameless and she let mrs pasmer know something of her feeling in the shortness with which she answered i saw him in washington the other dayfor a moment she shortened the time she had spent in dans company so as to cut mrs pasmer off from as much comfort as possible and she stared at her in open astonishment  mrs pasmer dropped her eyes and fingered the edge of her fan with a submissiveness that seemed to mrs brinkley the perfection of duplicity she wanted to shake her i knew sighed mrs pasmer that you had always been such a friend of his  it is the last straw which breaks the camels back mrs brinkley felt her moral vertebrae give way she almost heard them crack but if there was really a detonation the drowned the noise with a harsh laugh oh he had other friends in washington i met him everywhere with miss anderson this statement conflicted with the theory of her single instant with dan but she felt that in such a cause in the cause of giving pain to a woman like mrs pasmer the deflection from exact truth was justifiable she hurried on i rather expected he might run down here but now that theyre gone i dont suppose hell come you remember miss andersons aunt miss van hook  oh yes said mrs pasmer  she was here with her  miss van hook was such a new york typeof a certain kind said mrs pasmer she rose with a smile at once so conventional so heroic and so pitiful that mrs brinkley felt the remorse of a generous victor  she went to her room hardening her heart and she burst in with a flood of voluble exasperation that threatened all the neighbouring rooms with overflow  well she cried they have shown their hands completely they have come here to hound dan mavering down and get him into their toils again why the woman actually said as much but i fancy i have given her a fit of insomnia that will enable her to share her daughters vigils really such impudence i never heard of  do you want everybody in the corridor to hear of it asked brinkley from behind a newspaper  i know one thing continued mrs brinkley dropping her voice a couple of octaves they will never get him here if i can help it he wont come anyway now miss anderson is gone but ill make assurance doubly sure by writing him not to come ill tell him theyve gone and than we are going too  you had better remember the man in chicago said her husband  well this is my businessor ill make it my business cried mrs brinkley she went on talking rapidly rising with great excitement in her voice at times and then remembering to speak lower and her husband apparently read on through most of her talk though now and then he made some comment that seemed of almost inspired aptness  the way they both made up to me was disgusting but i know the girl is just a tool in her mothers hands her mother seemed actually passive in comparison for skilful wheedling i could fall down and worship that woman i really admire her as long as the girl was with us she kept herself in the background and put the girl at me it was simply a masterpiece  how do you know she put her at you asked brinkley  how by the way she seemed not to do it and because from what i know of that stupid pasmer pride it would be perfectly impossible for any one who was a pasmer to take her deprecatory manner toward me of herself you ought to have seen it it was simply perfect  perhaps said brinkley with a remote dreaminess she was truly sorry  truly stuff no indeed she hates me as much as evermore  well then may be shes doing it because she hates youdoing it for her souls goodsort of penance sort of atonement to mavering  mrs brinkley turned round from her dressingtable to see what her husband meant but the newspaper hid him we all know that our own natures are mixed and contradictory but we each attribute to others a logical consistency which we never find in any one out of the novels alice pasmer was cold and reticent and mrs brinkley who had lived half a century in a world full of paradoxes could not imagine her subject to gusts of passionate frankness she knew the girl to be proud and distant and she could not conceive of an abject humility and longing for sympathy in her heart if alice felt when she saw mrs brinkley that she had a providential opportunity to punish herself for her injustice to dan the fact could not be established upon mrs brinkleys theory of her if the ascetic impulse is the most purely selfish impulse in human nature mrs brinkley might not have been mistaken in suspecting her of an ignoble motive though it might have had for the girl the last sublimity of selfsacrifice the woman who disliked her and pitied her knew that she had no arts and rather than adopt so simple a theory of her behaviour as her husband had advanced she held all the more strenuously to her own theory that alice was practising her mothers arts this was inevitable partly from the sense of mrs pasmers artfulness which everybody had and partly from the allegiance which we payand women especially like to payto the tradition of the playwrights and the novelists that social results of all kinds are the work of deep and more or less darkling design on the part of other womensuch other women as mrs pasmer  mrs brinkley continued to talk but the god spoke no more from behind the newspaper and afterward mrs brinkley lay a long time awake hardening her heart but she was haunted to the verge of her dreams by that girls sick look by her languid walk and by the effect which she had seen her own words take upon mrs pasmeran effect so admirably disowned so perfectly obvious before she could get to sleep she was obliged to make a compromise with her heart in pursuance of which when she found mrs pasmer at breakfast alone in the morning she went up to her and said holding her hand a moment i hope your daughter slept well last night  no said mrs pasmer slipping her hand away i cant say that she did there was probably no resentment expressed in the way she withdrew her hand but the other thought there was  i wish i could do something for her she cried  oh thank you said mrs pasmer its very good of you and mrs brinkley fancied she smiled rather bitterly  mrs brinkley went out upon the seaward verandah of the hotel with this bitterness of mrs pasmers smile in her thoughts and it disposed her to feel more keenly the quality of miss pasmers smile she found the girl standing there at a remote point of that long stretch of planking and looking out over the water she held with both hands across her breast the soft chuddah shawl which the wind caught and fluttered away from her waist she was alone said as mrs brinkleys compunctions goaded her nearer she fancied that the saw alice master a primary dislike in her face and put on a look of pathetic propitiation she did not come forward to meet mrs brinkley who liked better her waiting to be approached but she smiled gratefully when mrs brinkley put out her hand and she took it with a very cold one  you must find it chilly here said the elder woman  i had better be out in the air all i could the doctor said answered alice  well then come with me round the corner theres a sort of recess there and you wont be blown to pierces said mrs brinkley with authority they sat down together in the recess and she added i used to sit here with miss van hook she could hear better in the noise the waves made i hope it isnt too much for you  oh no said alice mamma said you told her they were here mrs brinkley reassured herself from this miss van hooks name had rather slipped out but of course mrs pasmer had not repeated what she had said about dan in this connection i wish i could have seen julia alice went on it would have been quite like campobello again  oh quite said mrs brinkley with a short breath and not knowing whither this tended alice did not leave her in doubt  i should like to have seen her and begged her for the way i treated her the last part of the time there i feel as if i could make my whole life a reparation she added passionately  mrs brinkley believed that this was the mere frenzy of sentimentality the exaltation of a selfish asceticism but at the break in the girls voice and the aversion of her face she could not help a thrill of motherly tenderness for her she wanted to tell her she was an unconscious humbug bent now as always on her own advantage and really indifferent to others she also wanted to comfort her and tell her that she exaggerated and was not to blame she did neither but when alice turned her face back she seemed encouraged by mrs brinkleys look to go on i didnt appreciate her then she was very generous and highmindedtoo highminded for me to understand even but we dont seem to know how good others are till we wrong them  yes that is very true said mrs brinkley she knew that alice was obviously referring to the breach between herself and miss anderson following the night of the trevor theatricals and the dislike for her that she had shown with a frankness some of the ladies had thought brutal mrs brinkley also believed that her words had a tacit meaning and she would have liked to have the hardness to say she had seen an unnamed victim of alice doing his best to console the other she had specified but she merely said drily yes perhaps thats the reason why were allowed to injure people  it must be said alice simply did miss anderson ever speak of me  no i cant remember that she ever did mrs brinkley did not feel bound to say that she and miss van hook had discussed her at large and agreed perfectly about her  i should like to see her i should like to write to her  mrs brinkley felt that she ought not to suffer this intimate tendency in the talk  you must find a great many other acquaintances in the hotel miss pasmer  some of the frankland girds are here and the two bellinghams i have hardly spoken to them yet do you think that where you have even been in the right if you have been harsh if you have been hasty if you havent made allowances you ought to offer some atonement  really i cant say said mrs brinkley with a smile of distaste im afraid your question isnt quite in my line of thinking its more in miss cottons way youd better ask her some time  no said alice sadly she would flatter me  ah i always supposed she was very conscientious  shes conscientious but she likes me too well  oh commented mrs brinkley to herself then you know i dont like you and youll use me in one way if you cant in another very well but she found the girls trust touching somehow though the sentimentality of her appeal seemed as tawdry as ever  i knew you would be just added alice wistfully  oh i dont know about atonements said mrs brinkley with an effect of carelessness it seems to me that we usually make them for our own sake  i have thought of that said alice with a look of expectation  and we usually astonish other people when we offer them  either they dont like it or else they dont feel so much injured as we had supposed  oh but theres no question  if miss anderson  miss anderson ohoh yes  if miss anderson for example pursued mrs brinkley felt aggrieved with you but really ive no right to enter into your affairs miss pasmer  oh yes yesdo i asked you to the girl implored  i doubt if it will help matters for her to know that you regret anything and if she shouldnt happen to have thought that you were unjust to her it would make her uncomfortable for nothing  do you think so asked the girl with a disappointment that betrayed itself in her voice and eyes  i never feel i myself competent to advise said mrs brinkley i can criticiseanybody canand i do pretty freely but advice is a more serious matter each of us must act from herselffrom what she thinks is right  yes i see thank you so much mrs brinkley  after all we have a right to do ourselves good even when we pretend that its good to others if we dont do them any harm  yes i see alice looked away and then seemed about to speak again but one of mrs brinkleys acquaintance came up and the girl rose with a frightened air and went away  alices talk with you this morning did her so much good said mrs pasmer later she has always felt so badly about miss anderson  mrs brinkley saw that mrs pasmer wished to confine the meaning of their talk to miss anderson and she assented with a penetration of which she saw that mrs pasmer was gratefully aware  she grew more tolerant of both the pasmers as the danger of greater intimacy from them which seemed to threaten at first seemed to pass away she had not responded to their advances but there was no reason why she should not be civil to them there had never been any open quarrel with them she often found herself in talk with them and was amused to note that she was the only bostonian whom they did not keep aloof from  it could not be said that she came to like either of them better she still suspected mrs pasmer of design though she developed none beyond manoeuvring alice out of the way of people whom she wished to avoid and she still found the girl as she always thought her as egotist whose best impulses toward others had a final aim in herself she thought her very crude in her ideascruder than she had seemed at campobello where she had perhaps been softened by her affinition with the gentler and kindlier nature of dan mavering mrs brinkley was never tired of saying that he had made the most fortunate escape in the world and though brinkley owned he was tired of hearing it she continued to say it with a great variety of speculation she recognised that in most girls of alices age many traits are in solution waiting their precipitation into character by the chemical contact which time and chances must bring and that it was not fair to judge her by the present ferment of hereditary tendencies but she rejoiced all the same that it was not dan maverings character which was to give fixity to hers the more she saw of the girl the more she was convinced that two such people could only make each other unhappy from day to day almost from hour to hour she resolved to write to mavering and tell him not to come  she was sure that the pasmers wished to have the affair on again and part of her fascination with a girl whom she neither liked nor approved was her belief that alices health had broken under the strain of her regrets and her despair she did not get better from the change of air she grew more listless and languid and more dependent upon mrs brinkleys chary sympathy the older woman asked herself again and again what made the girl cling to her was she going to ask her finally to intercede with dan or was it really a despairing atonement to him the most disagreeable sacrifice she could offer as mr brinkley had stupidly suggested she believed that alices selfishness and morbid sentiment were equal to either  brinkley generally took the girls part against his wife and in a heavy jocose way tried to cheer her up he did little things for her fetched and carried chairs and cushions and rugs and gave his attentions the air of pleasantries one of his offices was to get the ladies letters for them in the evening and one night he came in beaming with a letter for each of them where they sat together in the parlour he distributed them into their laps  hello ive made a mistake he said putting down his head to take back the letter he had dropped in miss pasmers lap ive given you my wifes letter  the girl glanced at it gave a moaning kind of cry and fell beak in her chair hiding her face in her hands  mrs brinkley possessed herself of the other letter and though past the age when ladies wish to kill their husbands for their stupidity she gave brinkley a look of massacre which mystified even more than it murdered his innocence he had to learn later from his wifes more elicit fury what the women had all known instantly  he showed his usefulness in gathering alice up and getting her to her mothers room  oh mrs brinkley implored mrs pasmer following her to the door is mr mavering coming here  i dont knowi cant sayi havent read the letter yet  oh do let me know when youve read it wont you i dont know what we shall do  mrs brinkley read the letter in her own room you go down she said to her husband with unabated ferocity and telegraph dan mavering at wormleys not to came say were going away at once  then she sent mrs pasmer a slip of paper on which she had written not coming  it has been the experience of every one to have some alien concern come into his life and torment him with more anxiety than any affair of his own this is perhaps a hint from the infinite sympathy which feels for us all that none of us can hope to free himself from the troubles of others that we are each bound to each by ties which for the most part we cannot perceive but which at the moment their stress comes we cannot break  mrs brinkley lay awake and raged impotently against her complicity with the unhappiness of that distasteful girl and her more than distasteful mother in her revolt against it she renounced the interest she had felt in that silly boy and his ridiculous love business so really unimportant to her whatever turn it took she asked herself what it mattered to her whether those children marred their lives one way or another way there was a lurid moment before she slept when she wished brinkley to go down and recall her telegram but he refused to be a fool at so much inconvenience to himself  mrs brinkley came to breakfast feeling so much more haggard than she found either of the pasmers looking that she was able to throw off her lingering remorse for having told mavering not to come she had the advantage also of doubt as to her precise motive in having done so she had either done so because she had judged it best for him not to see miss pasmer again or else she had done so to relieve the girl from the pain of an encounter which her mother evidently dreaded for her if one motive seemed at moments outrageously meddling and presumptuous the other was so nobly good and kind that it more than counterbalanced it in mrs brinkleys mind who knew very well in spite of her doubt that she had acted from a mixture of both with this conviction it was both a comfort and a pang to find by the register of the hotel which she furtively consulted that dan had not arrived by the morning boat as she groundlessly feared and hoped he might have done  in any case however and at the end of all the ends she had that girl on her hands more than ever and believing as she did that dan and alice had only to meet in order to be reconciled she felt that the girl whom she had balked of her prey was her innocent victim what right had she to interfere was he not her natural prey if he liked being a prey who was lawfully to forbid him he was not perfect he would know how to take care of himself probably in marriage things equalised themselves she looked at the girls thin cheeks and lacklustre eyes and pitied and hated her with that strange mixture of feeling which our victims aspire in us  she walked out on the verandah with the pasmers after breakfast and chatted a while about indifferent things and alice made an effort to ignore the event of the night before with a pathos which wrung mrs brinkleys heart and with a gay resolution which ought to have been a great pleasure to such a veteran dissembler as her mother she said she had never found the air so delicious she really believed it would begin to do her good now but it was a little fresh just there and with her eyes she invited her mother to come with her round the corner into that sheltered recess and invited mrs brinkley not to come  it was that effect of resentment which is lighter even than a touch the waft of the arrows feather but it could wound a guilty heart and mrs brinkley sat down where she was realising with a pang that the time when she might have been everything to this unhappy girl had just passed for ever and henceforth she could be nothing she remained musing sadly upon the contradictions she had felt in the girls character the confusion of good and evil the potentialities of misery and harm the potentialities of bliss and good and she felt less and less satisfied with herself she had really presumed to interfere with fate perhaps she had interfered with providence she would have given anything to recall her act and then with a flash she realised that it was quite possible to recall it she could telegraph mavering to come and she rose humbly and gratefully as if from an answered prayer to go and do so  she was not at all a young woman and many things had come and gone in her life that ought to have fortified her against surprise but she wanted to scream like a little frightened girl as dan mavering stepped out of the parlour door toward her the habit of not screaming however prevailed and she made a tolerably successful effort to treat him with decent composure she gave him a rigid hand where in the world did you come from did you get my telegram  no did you get my letter  yes  well i took a notion to come right on after i wrote and i started on the same train with it but they said it was no use trying to get into the hygeia and i stopped last night at the little hotel in hampton ive just walked over and mr brinkley told me you were out here somewhere thats the whole story i believe he gave his nervous laugh but it seemed to mrs brinkley that it had not much joy in it  hush she said involuntarily receding to her chair and sinking back into it again he looked surprised you know the van hooks are gone  he laughed harshly i should think they were dead from your manner mrs brinkley but i didnt come to see the van hooks what made you think i did  he gave her a look which she found so dishonest so really insincere that she resolved to abandon him to providence as soon as she could oh i didnt know but there had been some little understanding at washington  perhaps on their part they were people who seemed to take a good many things for granted but they could hardly expect to control other peoples movements  he looked sharply at mrs brinkley as if to question how much she knew but she had now measured him and she said oh then the visits to me  entirely cried dan the old sweetness came into his laughing eyes again and went to mrs brinkleys heart she wished him to be happy somehow she would have done anything for him she wished she knew what to do ought she to tell him the pasmers were there ought she to make up some excuse and get him away before he met them she felt herself getting more and more bewildered and helpless those women might come round that corner any moment and then she know the first sight of alices face would do or undo everything with dan did she wish them reconciled did she wish them for ever parted she no longer knew what she wished she only knew that she had no right to wish anything she continued to talk on with dan who grew more and more at ease and did most of the talking while mrs brinkleys whole being narrowed itself to the question would the pasmers come back that way or would they go round the further corner and get into the hotel by another door  the suspense seemed interminable they must have already gone that other way suddenly she heard the pushing back of chairs in that recess she could not bear it she jumped to her feet  just wait a moment mr mavering ill join you again mr brinkley is expectingi must                       one morning of the following june mrs brinkley sat well forward in the beautiful church where dan and alice were to be married the lovely day became a still lovelier day within enriched by the dyes of the stained windows through which it streamed the still place was dim yet bright with it the figures painted on the walls had a soft distinctness a body of light seemed to irradiate from the depths of the dome like lamplight  there was a subdued murmur of voices among the people in the pews they were in a sacred edifice without being exactly at church and they might talk now and then a muffled nervous laugh escaped a delicate scent of flowers from the masses in the chancel mixed with the light and the prevailing silence there was a soft continuous rustle of drapery as the ladies advanced up the thickly carpeted aisles on the arms of the young ushers and compressed themselves into place in the pews  two or three people whom she did not know were put into the pew with mrs brinkley but she kept her seat next the aisle presently an usher brought up a lady who sat down beside her and then for a moment or two seemed to sink and rise as if on the springs of an intense excitement  it was miss cotton who while this process of quiescing lasted appeared not to know mrs brinkley when she became aware of her all was lost again mrs brinkley she cried as well as one can cry in whisper is it possible  i have my doubts mrs brinkley whispered back but well suppose the case  oh its all too good to be true how i envy you being the means of bringing them together mrs brinkley  means  yesthey owe it all to you you neednt try to deny it hes told every one  i was sure she hadnt said mrs brinkley remembering how alice had marked an increasing ignorance of any part she might have had in the affair from the first moment of her reconciliation with dan she had the effect of feeling that she had sacrificed enough to mrs brinkley and mrs brinkley had been restored to all the original strength of her conviction that she was a solemn little unconscious egotist and dan was as unselfish and good as he was unequal to her exactions  oh no said miss cotton she couldnt implying that alice would be too delicate to speak of it  do you see any of his family here asked mrs brinkley  yes over thereup front miss cotton motioned with her eyes toward a pew in which mrs brinkley distinguished an elderly gentlemans downmisted bald head and the back of a young ladys bonnet his father and sister the others a bridemaid mother bedridden and couldnt come  they might have brought her in anarmchair suggested mrs brinkley ironically on such an occasion but perhaps they dont take much interest in such a patchedup affair  oh yes they do exclaimed miss cotton they idolise alice  and mrs pasmer and mister too  i dont suppose that so much matters  they know how to acquiesce ive no doubt  oh yes youve heard the young people are going abroad first with her family for a year and then they come back to live with hiswhere the works are  poor fellow said mrs brinkley  why mrs brinkley do you still feel that way asked miss cotton with a certain distress it seems to me that if ever two young people had the promise of happiness they have just see what their love has done for them already  and you still think that in these cases love can do everything  miss cotton was about to reply when she observed that the people about her had stopped talking the bridegroom with his best man in whom his few acquaintances there recognised boardman with some surprise came over the chancel from one side  miss cotton bent close to mrs brinkley and whispered rapidly alice found out mr mavering wished it and insisted on his having him it was a great concession but shes perfectly magnanimous poor fellow how he does look  alice on her fathers arm with her bridemaids of whom the first was minnie mavering mounted the chancel steps where mr pasmer remained standing till he advanced to give away the bride he behaved with great dignity but seemed deeply affected the ladies in the front pews said they could see his face twitch but he never looked handsomer  the five clergymen came from the back of the chancel in their white surplices the ceremony proceeded to the end  the young couple drove at once to the station where they were to take the train for new york and wait there a day or two for mrs and mr pasmer before they all sailed  as they drove along alice held dans wrist in the cold clutch of her trembling little ungloved hand on which her wedding ring shone o dearest let us be good she said i will try my best i will try not to be exacting and unreasonable and i know i can i wont even make any conditions if you will always be frank and open with me and tell me everything  he leaned over and kissed her behind the drawn curtains i will alice i will indeed i wont keep anything from you after this  he resolved to tell her all about julia anderson at the right moment when alice was in the mood and as soon as he thoroughly understood what he had really meant himself  if he had been different she would not have asked him to be frank and open if she had been different he might have been frank and open this was the beginning of their married life
