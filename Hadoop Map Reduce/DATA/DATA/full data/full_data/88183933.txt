introduction   my dear boys this book is a complete story in itself but forms the fourth volume in a line issued under the general title the second rover boys series for young americans  as mentioned in some volumes of the first series this line was started years ago with the publication of the rover boys at school on the ocean and in the jungle in which i introduced my readers to dick tom and sam rover the twenty volumes of the first series related the doings of these three youths while attending putnam hall military academy brill college and while on numerous outings  having acquired a thorough education the three young men established themselves in business and were married presently dick rover became the father of a son and a daughter and so did his brother sam while tom rover became the father of twin boys the four lads were later on sent to boarding school as related in the first volume of this second series entitled the rover boys at colby hall  from colby hall the scene was shifted to snowshoe island where the lads went for a winter outing then they came back to the military academy and later on participated in the annual encampment as related in the third volume entitled the rover boys under canvas  in the present volume the scene is shifted from lively times at colby hall to still more livelier times in the woods to which the lads journeyed for a season of hunting they came upon a mysterious house in the forest and there uncovered a secret which i will leave the pages that follow to relate  once more i wish to thank my numerous readers for the many nice things they have said about these rover boys books i trust that the reading of the volumes will do them all good  affectionately and sincerely yours  edward stratemeyer     contents          i the

boys  wait a minute jack  cant wait life is too short cried jack rover gayly he was seated at the front of a long bobsled holding six boys remember weve got to be back at the hall in half an hour  please dont mention it pleaded randy rover his cousin  hi you fellows are you going to race or not came from another youth on a bobsled standing close by  you bet were going to race sang out fred rover who was at the tail end of the first sled and well beat you too bill glutts  you will like fun grumbled the cadet addressed a rather heavyset and bynomeans prepossessing youth come on now unless youre afraid  were afraid of nobody sang out andy rover and leaning sideways from where he sat on the bobsled he scooped up a handful of loose snow and threw it playfully at glutts  hi you what do you mean roared bill glutts in anger as the snow landed directly behind his right ear  hello i guess it must have begun to snow again cried randy rover mischievously  ill snow you retorted glutts i guess you fellows are afraid to race thats why you are cutting up  never mindrace them anyway bill came from a small pastyfaced youth who was usually called codfish on account of his broad mouth go ahead and show em what your new bobsled can do  thats the talk cried another cadet a newcomer at the academy show em that the yellow streak can lick anything on this hill  thats a dream that will never come true cried spouter powell come ahead jack lets start this race he added to the oldest rover boy  the scene was long hill a rise of ground located about midway between colby hall military academy and the town of haven point there was something of a wagon road leading up the hill from the main highway which skirted clearwater lake and this road had been converted by the cadets of the academy into a slide for their bobsleds  from the top of the hill the slide ran down and over two smaller hills then crossed the main highway and shot down another road onto the lake which at this season of the year was covered with ice  it was a saturday afternoon and as usual the cadets of the military academy were making the most of their off time some with bobsleds and other with ordinary handsleds and what were locally called bread shovels  for some weeks before this the boys as well as many other residents in that vicinity had enjoyed skating on the lake but a rather wet snow had fallen which the wind had been unable to sweep away and consequently skating became a thing of the past then the lads turned to their bobsleds the rovers getting out one they had used the season before this they painted and varnished very carefully and christened the blue moon  because you see explained randy with a wink its only once in a blue moon that shell be beaten  the rovers and their chums as well as many other cadets and boys and girls from that vicinity had been using the hill for a couple of hours when the race between the blue moon and the yellow streak was proposed by nick carncross the new friend of bill glutts  now as my old readers know the rovers and bill glutts were by no means on good terms with each other in the past glutts had proved himself anything but a friend and they had had more than one personal encounter with this freckledfaced bully  but it was not in the nature of any of the rover boys to refuse a challenge to race knowing well that if this was done many would think they were afraid of being beaten so the challenge was accepted and immediately the details were arranged  each bobsled was to carry six cadets and they were to start down the hill side by side the blue moon keeping well to the right and the yellow streak well to the left the first sled to cross a mark located out on the lake was to be declared the winner  with the four rover boys were their intimate chums spouter powell and gif garrison with glutts were codfish carncross and three other of the bullys cronies  gee i wish i was in that race came from will hendry who on account of his unusual stoutness was always called fatty  nothing doing fatty remarked dan soppinger another cadet youd make the rovers lose sure  all ready questioned walt baxter who had been settled on as the starter of the race  all ready answered jack rover after a glance around to see that nothing was out of order  been ready half an hour grumbled bill glutts  all right then cried walt onetwothreego  as he finished fred rover who was at the rear of the blue moon gave that bobsled a quick push and leaped aboard at the same time carncross sent the yellow streak forward and also sprang to his seat then side by side the two bobsleds moved down the long hill slowly at first but gradually gathering speed  it was five oclock of an afternoon in early december and consequently quite dark even on the snowclad hills many of the smaller children and also the girls had gone home leaving the place to the cadets and a few others  i hope we win this remarked randy as the two sleds continued to speed forward side by side  of course well win it came promptly from gif garrison  weve got to win it added fred rover  if you dont win bill glutts will never stop crowing over you put in spouter powell  hi there glutts keep to your side of the run warned jack suddenly the yellow streak had swerved over well into the middle of the road  i know what im doing growled glutts you tend to your own business  well you know the rules warned jack you keep over on your own side if you dont therell be trouble  humph you dont have to tell me what to do growled the other cadet and then striking a bit of extra smooth roadway the yellow streak bounded ahead much to the delight of its riders  hurrah here is where we leave them behind sang out codfish  nothing to it but the shouting added another of bill glutts cronies  well be a mile ahead by the time we reach the lake exulted nick carncross  for half a minute it looked as if his prophecy might be true the yellow streak was gliding over the icy surface of the long hill and consequently going ahead while the blue moon struck several soft spots where going was anything but good  oh jack cant you pull out of this queried gif garrison anxiously pull over to the left where the going is harder its too soft here entirely  im sticking to my side of the road just as i was expected to do said jack grimly  the yellow streak disappeared over the first rise and for a few seconds was lost to view but then the blue moon came along and beyond this rise found going somewhat easier slowly but surely they crawled up behind the other bobsled  keep to your side of the road glutts yelled jack in a second warning if you dont therell be trouble  and youll get the worst of it added randy  i know what im doing retorted glutts he had found the snow somewhat soft on his side of the road and was now running near the center and occasionally crowding to jacks side  well run into em sure came from spouter powell in alarm look out jack  look out echoed fred  over on your own side or well smash you glutts yelled jack for the blue moon had suddenly found going much easier and was forging forward rapidly get out of the way  the call was so peremptory that glutts felt bound to obey he swerved to his side of the road and with not a second to spare for almost instantly the blue moon shot past and continued down the slope toward the lake  we win we win yelled andy gayly  but the yellow streak is just behind us cried spouter looking back here they come  yes and on our side of the road too cried fred in alarm he turned his head still further around glutts get to your own side  aw dry up cried the other cadet in disgust you dont have to act as if you owned the whole road  you know the rules of the race flung back fred  crossing the highway which skirted the lake was not so easy and beyond this the snow was rather deep and consequently the speed of the blue moon was slackened the yellow streak came dangerously close and then bill glutts seemed to lose his head completely he slued around to his own side of the road but made such a short turn that in a twinkling the long bobsled was upset and the occupants hurled in all directions  there they go they are upset yelled fred and then he lost sight of those left behind as the blue moon shot out on the surface of the lake and beyond the mark set for the end of the race  we win we win cried andy leaping from the bobsled and in the exuberance of his spirits he turned a handspring in the snow  what happened to the other sled asked jack who had been so busy steering the blue moon he had paid little attention to what had been going on behind  they had a spill answered fred but before they took it they came pretty close to running into us  it was up to them to keep to their side of the road said gif garrison why we might have had a terrible accident if they had run into us  there were about a dozen boys on the lake who had witnessed the finish of the race and these along with those who had come down on the blue moon now turned back to see what had happened to the glutts party they found the cadets who had been spilled picking themselves up and brushing the snow from their garments one was nursing a bruised ankle and another a bruised elbow while bill glutts was wiping some blood from a scratch on his chin  well we won the race said jack briefly he had no desire to crow over his opponents  huh you didnt win it fairly growled glutts glaring at him  didnt win it fairly exclaimed jack what do you mean by that  i mean you got in our way so we couldnt get past youthats what i mean growled the other  that is false glutts and you know it retorted the oldest rover boy  see here jack rover you cant talk to me in that fashion roared bill glutts he had been in a more or less bad humor all the afternoon and the defeat had not improved his temper i say you got in my way and that is why i lost the race  and i say your statement isnt true returned jack sturdily  it is true and i wont let you or anybody else say any different said bill glutts and then in sudden passion he stepped forward and gave jack a shove which sent the oldest rover boy flat on his back in a snowbank     chapter ii  about the rovers   the attack upon jack rover was so unexpected that he had no chance to save himself from going down into the snowbank he went down so hard and the snow was so soft that for the moment he was almost covered and had to flounder around quite some to regain his feet  see here bill glutts what do you mean by attacking my cousin cried randy leaping forward and catching the bully by the arm  he had no right to talk to me the way he did retorted glutts let go of me and he shook himself free  what jack said was true put in fred quickly i was on the back of our bobsled and watched you nearly all the time you came over on our side of the road at least three different times  by this time half a dozen of the cadets were speaking at once carncross and several others upholding bill glutts in the midst of the discussion jack managed to regain his feet and leaping forward he caught bill glutts firmly by both wrists  glutts you listen to me said he sternly looking the bully in the eyes if i wasnt an officer at the hall id give you a sound thrashing for what you just did as it is i expect you to apologize or else take the consequences  huh i suppose you mean by that youll play sissy and report me said the bully  no i wont report you but ill see to it that you get what is coming to you answered jack  knowing he is an officer and cant fight you you took a mean advantage of jack broke in gif garrison you ought to be thrashed for it glutts  i dont think bill meant to shove him down into the snow put in codfish somewhat timidly  he did mean to do it said jack quickly and hell either apologize for his actions or hell take the consequences  well ill take the consequences whatever they are retorted bill glutts with a sickly grin i know that race wasnt a fair one come on fellows lets get back to the hall its almost supper time and with that he trudged away he and his cronies pulling the yellow streak behind them  he sure is one sweettempered fellow was spouters comment  jack why didnt you pitch into him anyway questioned andy anxiously  i didnt have to returned jack briefly just the same i wont forget the way he has acted if it wasnt that i am captain of company c and am expected not to fight id have given him the thrashing of his life  to the many young folks who have read the former volumes in this series the rover boys will not need an introduction but for the benefit of new readers a few words concerning my characters will be necessary  in the first volume entitled the rover boys at school i related how three brothers dick tom and sam rover were sent to putnam hall military academy where they made a great number of friends including a cadet named lawrence colby  from putnam hall the boys went to brill college and after leaving that institution of learning joined their father in business in new york city with offices on wall street they organized the rover company of which dick was president tom secretary and general manager and sam treasurer  during their cadet days at putnam hall the three rovers had become acquainted with a number of charming girls including dora stanhope and her cousins nellie and grace laning when dick went into business he made dora stanhope his life partner and a short while after this tom married nellie laning and sam married grace the three brothers purchased a fine plot of ground on riverside drive overlooking the hudson river and there they built three connecting houses dick and his wife living in the middle house with tom on one side and sam on the other  about a year after their marriage dick and his wife became the proud parents of a little son who was named john after mr laning this son was followed by a daughter named martha after her greataunt martha of valley brook farm little jack as he was commonly called was a manly lad with many of the qualities which made his father so successful in life  it was about this time that tom and nellie rover sprang a great surprise on all the others this surprise was in the shape of a pair of very lively boy twins one christened anderson after his grandfather and the other randolph after his greatuncle randolph of valley brook farm andy and randy as the twins were always called were decidedly active lads taking after their father who was never still a minute to quote grandpa rover  shortly after the twins were born sam and grace rover came along with a beautiful girl named mary after mrs laning then a year later the girl was followed by a sturdy boy who was called fred in honor of sam rovers old and well known school chum fred garrison  residing so close together the younger generation of rovers were brought up very much like one big family they usually spent their winters in new york city and during the summers often went out to valley brook farm where their grandfather anderson rover still resided with uncle randolph and aunt martha  when the boys and girls grew old enough they were at first sent to private schools in the metropolis but soon the lads led by andy and randy showed a propensity for cutting loose that their parents were compelled to hold a consultation  well have to send them to some strict boarding schoolsome military academy said dick rover and so it was decided  lawrence colby their old putnam hall chum had since that time become a colonel in the state militia and had then opened a military academy called colby hall to this institution jack fred and the twins were sent as related in detail in the first volume of my second series entitled the rover boys at colby hall  this military school was located about half a mile from the town of haven point on clearwater lake a beautiful sheet of water about two miles long the school consisted of a large stone building facing the lake it was a threestoried structure and contained the classrooms and the mess hall and also dormitories and private rooms for the students besides the main building there was a smaller structure occupied by colonel colby and his family and some of the professors and also an uptodate gymnasium and boathouses and bathing pavilions  on arriving at the academy the younger rovers found several of their friends awaiting them one of these being dick powell the son of songbird powell a former schoolmate of their fathers dick was always called spouter because of a fondness for long speeches another cadet was gif garrison a son of fred garrison after whom fred rover had been named there was also walter baxter a son of dan baxter who years previous had been an enemy of the older rovers but who had since reformed and who was doing well  as mentioned colby hall was situated about half a mile from haven point on the opposite side of the town was located clearwater hall a boarding school for girls during a panic in a moving picture theatre jack and his cousins became acquainted with a number of these school girls including ruth stevenson may powell alice strobell and annie larkins they soon found out that may was spouter powells cousin and the whole crowd of young people became friends later on mary and martha rover became pupils at clearwater hall  ruth stevenson had an old uncle barney who in times past had had a bitter quarrel with ruths parents the rover boys while out hunting one day had occasion to save the old mans life for this the old fellow was exceedingly grateful and as a result he invited them to spend their winter holidays with him which they did as related in the rover boys on snowshoe island  on this island the lads met two of their former enemies nappy martell and slugger brown as well as asa lemm a discharged teacher of colby hall the boys exposed a plot against old uncle barney and in the end caused the old fellows enemies to leave in disgust  i guess we havent seen the last of nappy and slugger said jack when he and his cousins had left snowshoe island  and he was right nappy and slugger turned up once more as related in the volume previous to this entitled the rover boys under canvas in that volume i told how the cadets went into their annual encampment this being after a spirited election for officers in which jack rover had been elected captain of company c and fred had been elected first lieutenant of the same command  among the cadets who wished to become a captain was one named gabe werner a great chum at that time of bill glutts having failed of election werner did all he could to make things uncomfortable for the rovers and in his actions he was seconded by glutts but in the end werner and glutts were discovered in some of their nefarious doings and becoming alarmed gabe werner left the school camp early in the morning and did not return glutts was brought before captain dale the teacher in charge of the camp and received a stern lecture and was deprived of many liberties he might otherwise have enjoyed he laid his troubles at the door of the rovers and vowed that sooner or later he would pay them back for the way he had been treated  while the rover boys were at colby hall the great war in europe had opened and our country was now overrun with german spies and sympathizers during their time at the encampment the boys made several surprising discoveries and in the end helped the secret service officers to capture a hidden german submarine they also rounded up the fathers of nappy martell and slugger brown mr brown and mr martell were sent to prison while slugger and nappy were marched off to a detention camp in the south and that for the time being was the last the rovers heard of them  well one thing is certainwere well rid of slugger and nappy and their fathers remarked jack as this news was brought to them  yes and i guess were rid of gabe werner too said fred he seems to have dropped out completely but in his remark concerning werner the young lieutenant was mistaken gabe werner was destined to turn up in their path unexpectedly and cause them not a little trouble  when the call for volunteers came dick rover and sam had lost no time in enlisting at first tom rover had been unable to get away but now the business in new york city had been left in reliable hands and all three fathers of the boys were in the trenches in europe doing their bit for uncle sam they had been in several small engagements and so far had come through unwounded  but there is no telling if they will come through every time was the way fred expressed himself anxiously  right you are answered jack do you know i dread to look at the lists of the killed and wounded in the newspapers for fear ill see one of their names  oh if only this awful war was over put in randy     chapter iii  news of importance   battalion attention shoulder arms forward march  boom boom boom boom boom the drums beat and away marched the three companies forming the colby hall battalion they marched around the school building as was the custom and then marched into the place put away their rifles and entered the mess hall  the roll call and brief drill and march took place less than half an hour after the encounter on the hill following the finish of the bobsled race captain jack and lieutenant fred had lost no time in hurrying back to the school and their chums had gone with them bill glutts and his cronies had gone ahead as already stated and they did not show themselves until the call came to appear on the parade ground  as captain and lieutenant jack and fred were in rather a delicate position when it came to quarreling with the other cadets in the past colonel colby had laid down the rule that there should be no fighting at the hall and this rule was particularly enforced when it came to officers now that the master of the military academy had joined the army and gone with the older rovers to europe captain dale who was in general command was enforcing this rule with more strictness than ever before  the afternoon spent coasting had given the rovers and their chums good appetites and they fell to with gusto over the ample supper provided for them unlike many boarding schools the table at colby hall was always a bountiful one and it is needless to say that the growing cadets always did full justice to everything that was set before them  what are you going to do about bill glutts jack questioned fred after the meal was over and the two were on their way to get several reference books from the school library  i dont know yet was the young captains answer he ought to have a thrashing but you know how matters stand  of course and jack we cant think of that with the end of the term so near you dont want to spoil your record and neither do i  its a confounded shame that glutts didnt leave when gabe werner went continued the oldest rover boy they were two of a kind  did you hear what andy saidthat he thought glutts had a lot of german blood in him  that might be his face looks it and the name sounds a little that way too  andy and randy both want to pitch into him continued the young lieutenant  you warn them not to do itat least not until this term comes to an end warned jack they have been cutting up so much since last september that their averages are none too high as it is theyd be mighty sorry if captain dale sent home a bad report about them it would just about break aunt nellies heart im sure  having procured the reference books the two made their way upstairs to the rooms occupied by them the rovers had a suite of four rooms one of which was used as a sitting room and for studying as they walked through the upper hallway they passed nick carncross and bill glutts glutts looked sourly at them but did not say a word and they refused to notice the pair  i guess youve got their goat bill remarked carncross as they passed on that race really belonged to you and they know it  of course it belonged to me returned glutts if they hadnt got in my way id have won with ease there isnt a bobsled anywhere around that can beat the yellow streak  im glad you shoved him over in the snow even if he is a captain continued carncross hes got too big an opinion of himself  he only got to be captain by a fluke nick gabe werner should have had that office continued glutts  is that why werner left questioned carncross curiously  oh no he left because he got sick of the discipline around here he said there was no chance for any fun answered glutts  where is he now did his folks approve of his leaving school  oh i guess they didnt care one way or the other old man werner is pretty rich and he didnt get his money by being educated either so i guess he doesnt care much for education  does he let gabe have much spending money  quite a littlebut of course not as much as gabe would like to have you know gabe is a good deal of a sport bill glutts face lit up with satisfaction i expect we are going to have a bangup time together during the holidays  then you expect to see him  yes were planning a trip together  gee ill envy you returned carncross  andy and randy had not yet come upstairs neither could resist the temptation to have a little fun and after supper they had gone outside and begun to snowball shout plunger the school janitor and bob nixon the chauffeur  its all in fun you know explained andy as he let fly a snowball at the old janitor who was always called shout because he was so deaf  hi there you stop that roared shout and then when they continued to snowball him he came after them with a wooden snowshovel  look out here comes the enemy cried randy gayly and let fly a snowball which struck the upraised snowshovel and sent a shower of loose snow into the janitors face  you young rascals roared plunger and then lost his footing on some ice in endeavoring to keep his balance he sent the snowshovel whirling through the air it landed at andys feet catching that funloving youth in the shins and sending him flat on his face  hurrah one down came from bob nixon goodnaturedly and then the chauffeur picked up a large chunk of snow and threw it high in the air to land directly on randys shoulder  great pyramids of egypt gasped randy is that a snowslide for some of the snow had filled his ear and gone down his neck  oh we didnt begin this you know cried the chauffeur gleefully come on shout lets show em what the older generation can do and then he picked up another chunk of snow and hurled it at andy nearly burying that youth while he was endeavoring to regain his feet  hi hi you spluttered andy we went in for snowballing we didnt go in for avalanches  when you start something always be sure you can finish it admonished bob nixon and then he picked up a third chunk of snow but before he could make use of it the rover twins had dived out of sight around a corner of the school building  i guess thats the time we got the worst of it remarked andy ruefully  and maybe we deserved it was randys ready response come on and snowball some of the other cadets  a number were willing and an impromptu snowballing battle took place which lasted the best part of a quarter of an hour then one of the teachers came out and ordered the youths upstairs for this was the study hour  on sundays such of the cadets as desired to do so were permitted to attend one or another of the churches in haven point all of the rovers went to church and there met not only mary and martha but also ruth stevenson may powell and some of the other girls  well jack i suppose this snowy weather puts you in mind of the time you went to my uncle barneys place on snowshoe island remarked ruth stevenson with a bright smile at the young captain who of course was dressed in his best uniform  thats what it does ruth he answered and my what a good time we did have how is your uncle getting along  very well indeed he is a changed man since he stopped quarreling with my folks and since it has been proved that snowshoe island is really and truly his property  im glad we were able to help the old man  have you decided on what you intend to do during the coming holidays continued the girl from clearwater hall  not exactly ruth more than likely well go home with the girls and spend some time with our mothers they probably feel pretty lonely now that our dads have gone to europe  yes i can imagine how that must be  you girls ought to come down with mary and martha  were talking of doing that put in may powell you see we wanted them to come up to my house first and then ruth wanted them but as their mothers are now all alone in new york they thought it best that we should spend the time down there we could have something of a house party and that would help cheer the older folks up  a good idea came from fred do it by all means  yes you girls can have a fine time in new york during the winter holidays added randy  i suppose you boys will want to go off hunting said may pouting a little i wish i was a boy and could do that  gee i wish we could go off hunting like we did that time at snowshoe island cried randy wistfully such an outing would suit me right down to the ground  gif garrison said something a few days ago about going off on a hunt remarked fred he says his father some years ago bought a place known as cedar lodge he didnt tell me very much about it in fact he acted quite mysteriously  i suppose he didnt want to hurt your feelings fred returned jack more than likely he knew you would feel bad to have him going off for a good time up in the woods and have you and the rest of us staying at home  two days passed and the young cadets were so busy getting ready for the examinations previous to the midwinter holidays that they had no time to pay attention to anything else they heard that bill glutts was openly boasting that the yellow streak could beat any bobsled in that vicinity and that the blue moon had won the contest by a foul but to this just then they paid no attention  ill get at bill laterjust wait was the way jack expressed himself and the others knew that the young captain would keep his word  on wednesday the boys received letters from home stating that word had come in that their fathers were still in the trenches in france no serious fighting had so far taken place in their sector and none of them had been wounded and all were in the best of health  thats the best news yet said fred with satisfaction and the others agreed with him  gif garrison had also received a letter and this he read with tremendous satisfaction his face was aglow as he called the rover boys to him  ive got an important announcement to make to you fellows he said let us go up to your rooms and talk it over  what is the announcement questioned andy eagerly  ill tell you when we are alone answered gif     chapter iv  something about cedar lodge   oh go ahead gif and get it off your chest  dont keep us waiting  has some one died and left you a fortune  such were some of the remarks made after gif garrison had said that he had an important announcement to make to the four rover boys  not another word until we get to your rooms said gif and andy wont you please run off and get spouter powell i just saw him heading for the gymnasium  all right gif but dont you dare to let the others in on the secret until i get back returned the funloving rover boy and away he sped on his errand  a few minutes later all of the lads mentioned were assembled in the rover boys sitting room some on chairs one on a table and two on a couch andy playfully started to throw a pillow at fred but gif at once put up his hand in protest  any horseplay and ill call it all off he warned  ill be good gif cried andy reluctantly and got rid of the pillow by using it for a back rest  this letter is from my uncle louis who is a partner with my father in the ownership of a large tract of land not far from the seacoast began gif there is a small but comfortable bungalow on it known as cedar lodge nobody was going to use the lodge this winter and i suggested to my folks and uncle louis that they allow us fellows to occupy it during the holidays  and what did they say questioned randy eagerly  they said i could go there if i wanted to and i could take you rover boys and spouter with me provided you could get consent to go  isnt that dandy  of course well go gif horses couldnt hold us back  how is the hunting there can we get a deer or a moose  how do you get there  these were a few questions hurled at gif after he had made his important announcement he placed his hands over his ears in despair  one question at a time please he begged what do you think i am anyhowan encyclopædia to get there you go from here to portview and then along the coast to a place called timminsport from timminsport you have either to take a sleigh or else hike to the camp which is about five or six miles away there is an old fellow named jed wallop who lives near the property in a little shack some distance from the bungalow if we want him to he will get a sled and drive us to the place and he will also assist us in getting settled and in getting what stores we may needthat is provided you fellows can really go  you can count of me declared spouter promptly my folks said i could do as i pleased during the holidays provided i kept out of mischief and what mischief could a fellow get into in the midst of those grand primeval forests where perhaps the woodsman has never dared to lay his axe to the heart of the sturdy oak and where the timid deer in fancied freedom ambles through the darkening glades and  turn off the spigot spouter or youll have us flooded burst out randy  save your orations for the day before election came from fred  you can give us the rest of it spouter when we are in camp some night and have nothing to read and dont know what to do suggested jack  thats italways cutting my rhetorical effusions short remarked spouter reproachfully some day when you are aching to have me make a speech youll find me dumb  tell us more about this camp gif cried fred  thereupon gif garrison related all he knew concerning the camp which was located on a small stream of water that in the summer time ran down to a bay emptying into the atlantic ocean there was a good deal of timber on the tract and so far as gif knew there was quite some small game  i dont know about deer he continued more than likely the big animals have gone further north but one might get a chance at a wolf or a fox and maybe some brook mink well be sure to get plenty of rabbits and squirrels and ducks and most likely some partridges and maybe wild turkeys but first of all you rovers have got to make sure that you can go  oh well arrange that somehow gif said jack of course well want to go home first and see our folks and cheer them up a bit they are pretty lonely now that our dads are over in france  oh im going home myself first but we can have at least three weeks up there because the school is going to be closed more than a month before and after christmas  gifs announcement was such a pleasing one that the rovers found it hard work after that to settle down to their studies letters were at once written to their mothers and presently word came back that they might go to the camp immediately after christmas if they wanted to do so then jack telephoned to his sister at clearwater hall and got word back that ruth and may would go down to new york with mary and martha and remain there until it was time to return to the girls school  its too bad we cant be at home while the girls are there remarked jack to his cousins he sighed deeply  you mean its too bad you cant be there while ruth is there put in andy slyly  thats the time you struck the nail on the head cried randy  humph you neednt rap me about it returned the young captain briefly i guess youd like to see the girls yourselves  now that they knew what they were going to do during the midwinter holidays the rover boys and their chums were eager to have the school session come to an end but they did not neglect their studies nor did jack and fred neglect their duties as officers  jack had an essay to write on the real training of a soldier and he spent a great deal of time over this  not but what there is a good deal about it that i dont know said jack to his cousins i guess dad could write a better essay than i can turn out hes seen some of the real side of a soldiers life  what wonderful things our dads will have to tell when they get back said fred that is if they ever do get back he added anxiously  oh theyve got to come back fred theyve simply got to returned jack but his face too showed his worry the rover boys did not care to admit it to each other yet each day every one of them worried over their parents it was dreadful to think that ones father or ones beloved uncle might be killed by the germans or even badly wounded  on the saturday following the bobsled contest the boys assembled once more on the long hill and this time they were accompanied by many of the girls from clearwater hall jack and his cousins gave ruth and the others many rides down the hill much to their mutual delight  here comes bill glutts with his yellow streak cried fred presently  heres a chance to have another race with him jack said fatty hendry he says you won the other race by a foul  thats the talk jack cried dan soppinger show him and the whole crowd that you beat him fairly  at first jack did not care to pit himself again against glutts but there was so much talk that at length he consented but insisted upon it that the whole course of the slide must be policed by the cadets  all right well do that said major ralph mason and then ordered all the cadets he could collect to station themselves on each side of the slide from the top to where it ran out on the lake  oh jack i hope you do win again said ruth anxiously  i intend to do my best he answered  you have got to win jack rover cried his sister martha if you dont beat that great big clumsy glutts ill never speak to you again  with so many cadets stationed along the course bill glutts felt that his chances of winning the race were diminishing he had thought that he could crowd jack as he had done before but now walt baxter laid down the law in such a manner that it could not be misunderstood  i will toss up a coin said walt and if you guess right glutts you can take your choice of sides and whichever side you or jack rover select that side you must stick to from start to finish  the coin was tossed up and bill glutts called out tails and won then he said he would take the right side of the slide that which jack rover and his chums had previously used  all right then glutts announced walt now then remember that you have got to keep to the right all the way down and you jack rover must keep to the left if either of you crosses the middle of the course that one will be disqualified and the race will be given to the other  all right walt i will stick to the left from start to finish just watch me and see declared jack  and ill stick to the right announced bill glutts but his face showed anything but a happy expression as he spoke  jack had the same crowd on board that he had before but glutts made several changes he retained nick carncross and codfish but for the other three cadets substituted youths who were slightly built and consequently rather light in weight  hes saving all the pounds he can whispered randy  jack do you think the right side of the course is better than the left questioned gif  i dont know one looks about as good as the other to me was the young captains reply  professor frank grawson had come up and was quite interested in the proposed contest  i used to do a lot of bobsledding myself said the professor who was well liked by nearly all the cadets i used to have a homemade sled which was my pride for several seasons now to make this more interesting ill put up a prize for the winner  fine professor fine was the cry  whats the prize  the teacher thought for a moment  well every boy likes a good pocket knife he said presently now to the one who wins this race ill give a firstclass fourbladed buckhandled knife i saw some very good ones down in the hardware store at the point and ill get one monday  thats splendid professor cried jack ill do my best to win that knife  youll see that knife coming to me exclaimed bill glutts glaring at the young captain  walt baxter now called for the contestants to get ready in a minute more the two bobsleds stood side by side each with its load of passengers and with fred ready to push one to the front and nick carncross ready to shove the other  all ready shouted walt onetwothree go  and away both bobsleds dashed and the great race was on     chapter v  the defeat of the bully   go ahead jack youve got to win  dont let em beat you bill put it all over those rovers  oh jack dont let them get the best of you cried ruth  youve got to win screamed martha  here is where glutts shows em what the yellow streak can do  so the cries ran on as the two bobsleds slowly gathered momentum and started down the long slope leading to clearwater lake  at the beginning glutts had a little the better of it because the right side of the slide seemed to be more slippery than the other he was the first to gain the top of the nearest rise and he shot over this while jacks bobsled was still climbing the slope  hurrah bill glutts is ahead  he said the yellow streak could beat any thing in this vicinity  oh do you really think glutts will win questioned ruth anxiously as she turned to dan soppinger  well i should hope not answered dan  if he does win there will be no holding him down put in ned lowe another chum of the rovers hell crow to beat the band all winter  forward went the two bobsleds each steersman doing his best to guide his sled where running might be the easiest  just as jack topped the first rise and started to speed down on the other side he saw bill glutts start to resume his old tactics the bully was running close to the center of the course and now he overlapped the other side by at least six inches  hi there glutts get over on your side yelled one of the cadets who was helping to police the course  thats right bill get over or youll be disqualified added another  keep to the right keep to the right was the cry from several others and then knowing that the eyes of all the cadets in that vicinity were upon him the bully slowly steered over to his side of the course and he was not any too quick for otherwise there might have been a serious disaster down the slope of the first hill rushed the blue moon jack was on his side but had not more than six inches to spare had glutts kept on as he was running the blue moon would have sideswiped the yellow streak and there would undoubtedly have been a serious accident  here comes the blue moon  say but they are gathering some speed  hurrah the rovers are ahead  go on glutts go on dont let em beat you  it was true that the blue moon was now ahead and was slowly but surely increasing the distance between the rovers and those aboard the yellow streak  push her ahead bill push her ahead yelled nick carncross desperately  weve got to win cried codfish  im doing the best i can muttered bill glutts between his set teeth and his eyes glowed with hatred as he saw the blue moon vanishing over the second rise of the course  after that as fatty hendry remarked it was all over but the shouting down toward the highway skirting the lake shot the blue moon then it ran swiftly along the final lap of the course and came out on clearwater lake shooting several hundred feet beyond the finishing mark the line was crossed while the yellow streak was still on the roadway beyond the lake shore  illustration down toward the highway shot the blue moon  hurrah the blue moon wins  my but that was some run believe me  what will bill glutts have to say now  he cant say this wasnt a fair race  the run for the blue moon had certainly been a swift one and while jack was congratulated on his victory he was also praised for the way in which he had handled his speedy bobsled  we certainly came down fast remarked randy i thought my ears were going to blow right off my head and this remark caused a general laugh  glutts had finished the race twelve seconds behind his opponent and was in anything but a happy frame of mind  there were a number of sticks and stones on my side of the slide and they held us back he protested lamely i guess some of the fellows who didnt want to see the yellow streak win put em there  i cant believe that glutts answered major mason flatly i looked over the course and it was just as clear on one side as it was on the other  dont be a sorehead bill just because you lost put in fatty hendry be a good sport and shake hands with jack over your defeat  ill do as i please roared the bully i dont need any advice from you you fellows are all against me and with this remark he turned his back on the crowd and soon he and his cronies were making their way up along the lake shore dragging the yellow streak behind them  it was a well won race captain rover said professor grawson you can be proud of being the possessor of such a speedy bobsled on monday i shall take great pleasure in getting that knife for you  thank you professor and ill take great pleasure in accepting the knife said jack with a grin  well thats the time you squared up with bill glutts remarked spouter after the fun on long hill had come to an end and the boys had said goodbye to the girls and were on the return to colby hall you certainly paid him back for shoving you into that snowbank  i dont know whether i did or not answered the young captain evidently glutts doesnt know when hes had enough i suppose hell be more bitter now than ever against me  oh i wouldnt worry about glutts put in gif hes nothing but a great big overgrown butcher boy he said this because it was a wellknown fact that bill glutts was the only son of a wholesale butcher who had made a small fortune in manufacturing and selling frankfurters  i dont see how a fellow like nick carncross can take up with him remarked fatty hendry  i know why he does that came from ned lowe bill has had plenty of money to spend latelyan uncle or somebody sent him quite a wadand nicks pocketbook i imagine is rather thin  say ned come around to our rooms tonight and give us some music just to celebrate this glorious event cried fred for ned lowe was quite a performer on the mandolin and usually had some very funny songs to sing  all right ill be glad to come answered the mandolin player any eats  oh maybe we can scrape up something answered randy the idea of a little spread on the quiet appealed to him  the idea of a little spread appealed to the others too and as a consequence it was arranged between the rovers and their chums that two of them should go to haven point for some things for the spread this task was delegated to andy and fred and they hurried off early in the evening returning with several packages containing sandwiches cake candy nuts and a large hand of bananas in the meantime the other rover boys and ned lowe had gathered in gif garrisons room and there enjoyed themselves singing and listening to neds playing of the mandolin  as soon as the monitors had gone their rounds to see that everything was quiet for the night spouter gif fatty ned dan walt and several others found their way to the rover boys suite  now dont make too much noise admonished fred who let them in remember bill glutts and his gang will be only too glad to find out what is going on and report us  and we dont want to get any black marks when its so near the end of the term added jack  righto came from andy  the new arrivals proceeded to make themselves at home and then the rovers passed around the good things which had been obtained  say this is all right declared walt munching a tongue sandwich  couldnt be beat came from gif who had his mouth full of layer cake  here fatty have some nuts cried andy gayly and let several almonds slide down the fat youths collar  hi there let up cried fatty i dont eat nuts that way and he made a pass at andy with a pillow  no horseplay now cut it out andy warned jack  after that the cadets conversed in low tones and at the same time enjoyed the many good things to eat  what are you going to do with those banana skins andy questioned his twin as he saw the youth place several of the skins in a bit of newspaper  oh ive got a plan to use them was the answer  well if there is any fun on foot let me in on it went on randy promptly  i was thinking we might send some of these good things over to bill glutts codfish and nick carncross went on the funloving rover it might make em feel better over their defeat  what give up some of these good eats to them demanded fred  well i dont know whether they would be very good eats or not answered andy closing one eye suggestively do you see what ive got in this little package he went on bringing a small paper bag from his pocket smell it  fred did so but with caution then he gave a sudden sneeze  cayenne pepper  right you are freddie boy how did you guess it and andy grinned broadly  say thats the talk burst out randy lets send them over a few sandwiches and a couple of slices of cake all well doctored with cayenne pepper  theyll be suspicious especially if you take them over remarked jack we ought to get some outsider to do the job  ill do it if you want me too responded walt baxter promptly i dont love those chaps any more than you do you just fix up some sandwiches and the cake and ill go around and explain that dan and ned and fatty and some of the rest of us are giving the rovers a little spread in honor of the victory and that we dont think it any more than right that they should have some of the good things  so it was decided and a little while later the cover of a pasteboard box was fixed up as a tray containing several tempting looking sandwiches some slices of layer cake and two bananas then walt baxter marched off with the things in the direction of the room occupied by bill glutts  come on and listen to what happens said andy and presently having slipped off their shoes he and the others followed walt down the corridor but kept well in the background  when baxter arrived at bill glutts room he heard low voices and was much pleased to learn that glutts was talking to nick carncross when he knocked lightly on the door there was an uneasy stir within  maybe its one of the monitors come back whispered carncross uneasily  who is there questioned glutts sharply  its iwalt baxter was the answer open the door glutts ive got something good for you fellows  the door was opened cautiously and walt explained his errand at the same time holding out the improvised tray  i dont know that we want anything said glutts rather sourly  oh well we might as well take it put in carncross hastily he was a growing cadet and always hungry  wed like to have codfish have some of this too said walt will you see that he gets some  sure answered carncross readily hes right across the hall ill call him  in a few minutes more codfish came from his room clad in his pajamas and slippers he sneaked over into the room occupied by glutts and carncross and then the three began dividing the things walt had brought for them  ill have to go now said walt hastily remember this is with regards from our whole crowd he added significantly  thanks muttered carncross briefly while glutts and codfish said nothing  then the bully closed the door and he and his cronies prepared to enjoy the things which had been brought to them     chapter vi  at the moving picture theatre   therell be something doing in a minute or two murmured randy as he and the others came to a halt before bill glutts door  you fellows be careful and dont step on any of these whispered andy as he bent down and laid the banana skins he had saved on the floor splendid doormat for them when they come out he added grinning  fortunately those within the room were so busy dividing the sandwiches and cake that they paid no attention to what was going on outside  rather nice of them to remember us remarked codfish thank you i dont think i care for any sandwiches but ill take that piece of cake instead  me for a sandwich bill murmured carncross im quite hungry  then the three began to munch away on the sandwiches and the cake at a lively rate  all had their mouths full when suddenly codfish began to splutter  hello whats the matter cried glutts trying to swallow too much at once  you dont want to make a pig of yourself codfish admonished carncross  oh oh cried the sneak of the school oh  whats wrong  oh im burning up oh they must have poisoned me  gee do you suppose they put something in that cake cried carncross in sudden alarm  oh my mouth is on fire groaned codfish  to this neither glutts nor carncross made any answer each was beginning to feel a sudden strange sensation on his tongue and in his throat both began to feel as if their mouths were burning up  its something theyve put in the eats exclaimed glutts theyre trying to poison us or something  its pepper thats what it iscayenne pepper came from codfish oh give me a drink of water or something this is dreadful  the sneak made a dash across the room to where a water pitcher stood on a stand with a glass beside it but the pitcher proved to be empty  my gracious this is terrible spluttered carncross and began to cough  in the meantime glutts smelled of the food that remained on the improvised tray and suddenly gave a loud sneeze followed by several others  hurrah they are enjoying it all right enough remarked jack in a low tone  ive got to have a drink yelled carncross recklessly gee im burning up clean from my mouth to my stomach  youre no worse off than i am spluttered glutts oh just wait until i get hold of that walt baxter  it was the whole bunch that did it ill bet the trick was gotten up by those rovers  the door was flung open and all of the occupants of the room dashed out into the hallway bent upon getting to the nearest bathroom or water cooler for a drink not one of them noticed the slippery banana skins spread out on the floor and on the instant bill glutts went sliding along and came down flat on his back carncross did likewise codfish tripping over him and pitching headlong  say whats this exploded glutts oh my back i guess ive broken my shoulder  they must have soaked the floor came from carncross no its banana skins he added in deep disgust say codfish take your feet off my stomach will you  ii couldnt help falling over you you went down so suddenly apologized the sneak oh dear let me get a drink of waterim all on fire inside  the rovers and their chums had retreated to a distance and this was wise for had glutts and carncross been able to get hold of them there would certainly have been a fight but as it was the bully and his cronies passed down a back corridor to the nearest bathroom where they proceeded to wash out their mouths and get a long drink  now wed better get back to our rooms and get into bed as soon as possible said jack they may report us and some of the professors may come around to investigate  let them come well all be asleep like so many innocent lambs remarked randy  theyll find that ive been asleep for the last two hours added walt baxter and at this the others had to smile  the crowd separated and the four rovers returned to their rooms where they lost no time in getting rid of all the evidences of the feast then they undressed turned out the lights and crept into their beds  i dont believe theyll dare to report this whispered andy to his twin and in this surmise the funloving rover was correct glutts and his cronies did a good deal of grumbling but there the matter for the time being ended  but ill get square some day you just wait and see glutts told the others  the school term was now drawing to an end and it was definitely announced that owing to the war conditions colby hall would remain closed for a period of six weeks for the winter holidays this would give the rovers and their chums a full months vacation after new years  and what a good time we will have up at cedar lodge cried fred  it certainly was grand of gif to ask us to go up there with him and spouter added jack  the rovers and their chums and especially walt baxter kept a close eye on bill glutts and his cronies but beyond scowling at them whenever they passed the bully did nothing regarding the peppered food which had been presented  hes laying low for something i suppose said walt however im not going to worry  one day he received a soaker of a snowball in his left ear while hurrying to the gymnasium he did not know who threw the missile but was satisfied in his mind that it came from either glutts or carncross  the examinations for the term were held and much to the rover boys satisfaction all acquitted themselves creditably spouter and gif did very well too and were equally elated  let us go down to town this evening and celebrate suggested jack that afternoon i think captain dale will let us go and i understand they are giving a very good war picture at mr falsteins moving picture theater  that will suit me answered fred  the matter was talked over by a number of the cadets and they went to see captain dale about it and as a result nine of them set out for haven point where was located the moving picture theater at which jack and his cousins first met the girls from clearwater hall  this looks like a pretty good picture remarked gif as he pointed to one advertised on the billboards a real war play with some of the scenes taken at the front  either at the front or on the hackensack meadows remarked randy dryly they tell me that more than threefourths of those socalled war pictures are faked up  well you wouldnt expect the moving picture actors to go right out in the middle of a battlefield and perform would you queried jack  heres a good comic too put in fatty hendry that suits me all right i like a good laugh  fatty you ought to go in the movies remarked fred you would make a hit as the living skeleton  he would unless his face broke the camera added ned lowe  i understand some of those fat fellows in the movies get a couple of hundred dollars a week for acting said fatty i wouldnt mind doing some of those stunts myself at that price  the cadets purchased their tickets and were soon inside the showhouse an educational film was being thrown on the screen and they were much interested in seeing the details of tanning leather and making leather belts handbags and shoes  gee how easy it is to learn about these things in a moving picture remarked gif  what a pity it is they cant teach a fellow algebra and geometry in the same way sighed randy  the educational film was followed by the war play and whether this was given with fakedup backgrounds or not it proved to be a very interesting production especially to the rover boys there were pictures of life in the soldiers camps and on the transports bound for europe and then scenes of life in the french trenches culminating in a terrific bombardment by big cannons and then a thrilling charge over nomans land  gee isnt that immense murmured fred think of dad being in such a charge as that  it brings the war pretty close doesnt it fred asked jack  the scenes of the mighty conflict not alone thrilled the rover boys but also sobered them especially when there came a picture of the dead and the dying with the ambulances rushing hither and thither to take the wounded to the field hospitals  poor fred felt the tears coming into his eyes and was glad that the moving picture house was rather dark so that he might use his handkerchief without being noticed  the war picture was followed immediately by one depicting the trials and tribulations of a fat man who obtained a position as a bellboy in a country hotel he did some wonderful stunts and managed to break up a great deal of crockeryware and innumerable pies and this set all the cadets as well as the majority of the audience to roaring with laughter  i guess those fellows earn their money remarked spouter to fatty just think of being slammed around in front of the camera like that  yes and think of having three or four pies plastered all over your face returned the stout youth i guess after all id rather go into ordinary business  i imagine some of those socalled stunts are only trick picturesi mean those things like climbing up the side of a house and holding on to the top of a church steeple remarked jack just the same those moving picture actors have to risk their lives more than once especially when they take wild rides on horseback or in automobiles or get in railroad smashups  immediately following the comic picture all the lights in the theater were turned on and a gentleman stepped on the stage to address the audience  i wonder what hes going to talk about whispered randy  liberty loan or something like that i suppose answered his twin  he was right there was a new drive on to raise money for the government to be used for war purposes and this gentleman as a member of the local committee had come forth to urge every man and woman in the audience to invest in liberty bonds  that is what my father was doing in and around new york before he went to war explained andy to walt baxter he made quite a success of it too he was on a whole lot of committees  and he did a lot of work for the red cross too added randy  while the lights were turned on the cadets had a chance to look around the showhouse they thought that possibly some of the girls from clearwater hall might be present but they were disappointed  the talk about liberty bonds had come to an end and several men and women were passing through the audience trying to get subscribers for the bonds when half a dozen newcomers entered the moving picture theater one of the number was in cadet uniform and as he came down the aisle and took a seat on the other side of the showhouse jack caught fred by the arm  look whos here will you he whispered excitedly  why its bill glutts returned fred  exactly and do you see who is with him  no i cant make out who is it  gabe werner  gabe werner are you sure jack  positive i saw him full in the face just before he sat down  soon the lights in the showhouse went out once more and the moving picture performance continued     chapter vii  the end of the term   what can gabe werner be doing around here questioned randy who had heard the conversation between his two cousins  im sure i dont know answered jack he doesnt live anywhere in this vicinity and i thought after he left the school he went home  evidently glutts must have known about his being here otherwise they wouldnt be together said andy  jack stood up so that he might get a better view of the other side of the showhouse he noticed several vacant seats directly behind those occupied by glutts and werner  im going to slip over there just as soon as the lights are turned down he said to fred if they are hatching out any mischief perhaps well hear something worth listening to  ill go with you was the ready reply  the pair explained to the others what they were about to do and then slipped out of their seats and made their way to the back of the moving picture theater then when the lights were being turned out they moved forward and slipped into two seats directly behind glutts and werner without being noticed by the two bullies  the educational film was now being shown again and this caused glutts to give a snort of disgust  i dont care for that sort of stuff said the wholesale butchers son i wish they would put on the war play tell me some more about this scheme youve got for spending the winter holidays  oh its a dandy scheme all right bill responded werner and then he began a description of a winters camp and told how he had permission to go there and how he wanted glutts to go with him  while gabe werner was speaking some people sitting next to him had arisen and were trying to get out gabe and bill arose and as they did so the former turned around and caught sight of the two rovers  say what do you know about this he cried in astonishment  jack rover and fred rover murmured glutts and his face likewise betrayed astonishment  did you fellows follow us into the theater demanded werner  we certainly did not returned fred quickly we were in the theater long before you came in  huh werner was stumped for a moment i didnt notice them here did you he questioned his crony  if i had i should have taken a seat elsewhere was glutts ready reply he glared at the rovers i suppose you have been listening to everything we said  if you dont want to be heard you had better not talk in a place like this replied jack  i dont care what they did hear grumbled werner im not ashamed of what i am doing or intend to do  if i were you glutts id cut werner advised fred captain dale wont give you any credit for sticking to him after what happened at the encampment  i suppose you are going to tell captain dale you saw me with him retorted glutts  i shant say a word unless i am questioned  i havent forgotten what happened at the encampment said gabe werner turning to jack some day im going to square accounts with you  when that time comes i think ill be able to defend myself werner answered the young captain coldly  by this time a number of people in the audience were turning around evidently annoyed by the conversation one heavyset man turned back and tapped werner on the shoulder  say if you fellows want to hold a talkfest go outside and do it he growled we want to look at the pictures  come ahead jack whispered fred it wont do us any good to stay here now that glutts and werner have discovered our presence  right you are was the answer and a moment later the two rovers slipped out of their seats and made their way to the rear of the showhouse here they were joined by the others of their crowd and all went outside and across the street to a drugstore where jack treated the others to hot chocolate soda  they are hatching out something that is sure remarked jack  as near as i could make out werner is going off into the woods on a hunt and wants glutts to go with him returned fred i wonder where they are going  no one could answer that question and presently the crowd began to talk of other things and especially of the war play they had just witnessed  gosh but a play like that brings the war pretty close to a fellow said randy with a sigh  makes a fellow think of how our dads are making out over there doesnt it said fred  when they showed those ambulance scenes with all the dead and dying lying around it gave me the cold shivers came from andy i tell you whatwar is a terrible thing  yes and you have got to see something like that to realize how really terrible it is put in jack  several days later the term at colby hall came to an end there was something of an entertainment with prize speaking in which spouter distinguished himself and then came the final drill and parade around the campus following this the cadets indulged in several snowball fights and in quite some horseplay and then rushed off to their rooms to pack their suitcases and other baggage so as to be ready to depart for home in the early morning  wow but it feels good to know i havent got to look at a grammar or an algebra for the next few weeks cried randy with satisfaction  say it makes me feel as happy as a clown in a circus declared andy and in high spirits he began a jig and ended by turning a flipflap over one of the beds then he and his twin indulged in a pillow fight in which fred joined  hi you fellows stop your rumpus cried jack who was trying to pack his suitcase you keep on and youll have the ceiling of the floor below down  cant help it cried andy gayly weve got to break loose once in a while and he playfully landed a cake of soap in the open suitcase  ill soap you cried the young captain and taking the article in question he made a leap over the bed caught his cousin by the neck and allowed the cake of soap to slip down andys back  great salt mackerel ejaculated the funloving rover and pulling his coat tight he arched his back anybody notice the camels hump  it isnt a hump andy its only a wart on your backbone answered his twin  well hump or wart it isnt going to stay there very long remarked the other and immediately proceeded to stand on his hands shaking his body in such a manner that presently the soap rattled out on the floor then quietness was restored for the time being and the rovers continued their packing  a conference was held with gif and it was decided that all of the crowd were to go home for christmas several days later the rovers were to meet gif and spouter at portview and then all would proceed to cedar lodge  and dont forget to bring your guns and all your other traps said gif  you trust us for that responded fred  well be there with everything that is necessary outside of the provisions those of course we can get at portview or at timminsport  i hope we get a chance at a moose sighed randy  gee why dont you make it a lion or an elephant or a polar bear while you are at it cried his twin might as well wish for everything in the menagerie it doesnt cost any more and at this there was a general smile  i know what id like to get said jack i was reading about one in the paper the other day they must be beautiful creatures  whats that questioned gif  a silver fox  oh say jack that would be fine but i imagine silver foxes are exceedingly rare  oh i know that just the same id like to bag one the fur would make a very fine piece for some lady to wear  ruth stevenson for instance murmured andy and at this his cousin made a playful pass at him with his fist which the funloving rover easily dodged  the next morning the cadets had an early breakfast and a short while later saw many of them on their way by carriage and automobile to haven point many girls were also coming in from clearwater hall so that the railroad station present an unusually lively appearance  in the crowd was bill glutts but he took care to keep away from the rovers gabe werner was nowhere to be seen and the rovers rightfully conjectured that he had left the town  the boys had hardly arrived when a carryall came in from clearwater hall containing mary and martha as well as ruth and may and a dozen other girl students there was a general handshaking and then all took a stand on the station platform to wait for the coming of two trains which were to bear the various students in opposite directions everybody had already procured a ticket and the trains which were expected were extras for it would have been impossible for the ordinary locals to have taken care of such heavy traffic  i am sorry youre not going to travel with us to new york said jack to ruth  well im sorry youre not coming my way answered the girl with a smile  but youll be down to our house directly after christmas wont you  yes well be down the day aftermay and i  well that will give us a whole day together anyhow before us fellows start for cedar lodge went on the young captain then he nudged ruth in the elbow come over here he whispered i want to show you something that i dont want the others to see  together they slipped out of the crowd and around the corner of the little railroad station then jack brought out a large flat package from an inner pocket of his overcoat i had these taken as a christmas surprise to mother and martha what do you think of them and he brought forth several photographs of himself taken in his cadet uniform they had been taken by the leading photographer of haven point who made a specialty of work for the two schools and they certainly showed the young captain at his best  oh how lovely jack cried ruth in genuine pleasure i declare they are splendid pictures  then you like them he queried anxiously  i certainly do i dont think they could be better she looked at the three poses presented critically if its all the same to you ill keep this one she said finally  oh ruth you dont want my picture do you he questioned and there was a trace of wistfulness in his voice  of course i do jack i can keep this one cant i and the girl looked full at him in a manner that spoke volumes  why sure if you want it he answered quickly but say dont i get one of yours in return he added  well ill see about that she hesitated  oh now ruth  i havent had one taken in an awfully long time jack  never mind you will let me have one of them anyhow wont you  ii guessmaybe so ill give it to you for a christmas present only dont tell the others  i wont ruth and you can keep about my picture to yourself too added the captain and thereupon the decidedly interesting conversation between the pair had to come to an end as one of the trains came puffing inthat which was to carry ruth and some of the other girls as well as many of the cadets away     chapter viii  christmas at home   well here we are at last i wonder if anybody will be at the station to meet us said martha rover  oh im sure somebody will come down answered mary  the six rovers had had a long and uneventful train ride from haven point to the grand central terminal fortysecond street new york city they had had to change cars at the junction where some months before they had had such fun with mr asa lemm the discharged teacher of the hall as related in detail in the volume previous to this the train had been crowded with passengers but the rovers had managed to get seats together much to their satisfaction and they had also managed to get pretty fair accommodations when it came time to go into the diner  they had telegraphed ahead concerning their coming and found two chauffeurs employed by dick rover and tom rover on hand to receive them and take charge of their baggage then they went out to the street where they found two automobiles awaiting them one containing jacks mother and the other the mothers of fred and the twins  hello ma cried the young captain as he rushed forward to embrace his parent how are you you are looking pretty good  oh i am feeling quite fair answered mrs dick rover with a smile  home again and glad of it exclaimed fred as he embraced his mother  my my but im glad that that term at the school is at an end cried andy as he gave mrs tom rover the hug he knew she would be expecting a hug which was speedily duplicated by his twin hope youve got a good big dinner waiting for us traveling has made me hungry  not but what we had a pretty good meal on the train added his twin  youll get all you want tonight answered mrs tom rover affectionately  in the meantime mary and martha had come up and joined their parents there was a good deal of kissing and questioning and while this was going on the chauffeurs assisted the young people to their seats and stowed away their handbaggage there were no trunks to come for all the young folks had left a large part of the belongings at the schools  there was only one thing which saddened the homecoming of the young people and that was the absence of their fathers although jack had said that his mother was looking well still he had not failed to notice that her face showed a certain paleness and some lines of care  dont worry mother im sure dad will come back all right he said later on in an endeavor to comfort her  i am hoping so jack but oh how i wish this awful war would come to an end and mrs dick rover sighed deeply  all too quickly the next few days passed young folks and old folks were busy doing their shopping for christmas and in addition to this the boys went out to purchase a number of things they thought they might need while at the camp  im afraid were in for it said randy dismally on the afternoon before christmas this looks like a regular blizzard  it certainly did look like a blizzard with the snow coming down thickly and the wind blowing it first in one direction then in another by nightfall the streets were almost impassable and in the morning traffic along riverside drive was practically suspended  merry christmas shouted randy who was the first to get up  merry christmas replied andy and how do you like to live at the north pole he added as he glanced out of the window at the stormbound street and the river and the palisades beyond  there was a grand reunion of the three families in the dick rover residence and presents were exchanged all around the boys had purchased a number of small but appropriate gifts for their mothers and the two girls and also for the various servants of the families in return they received a number of gifts both useful and ornamental including goldmounted stylographic pens which each one had desired and also some new hockey skates and story books  martha had knit a bright sweater for her brother and mary had done the same for fred and the girls between them had likewise knit sweaters for the twins  we sure are the lucky kids remarked andy when all of them were looking over their gifts this sweater suits me to a t and my just wait until i get on those hockey skates there wont be a thing in new york or on clearwater lake that will beat me  i see you doing some tall skating today replied his twin with a grin what you will need is a snow shovel if you want to get anywhere  the storm kept up until noon of christmas and then cleared away almost as rapidly as it had come the night being clear and cold with a beautiful moon and twinkling stars shining from above  i hope it stays clear so that may and ruth will have a chance to come down remarked fred during the course of the afternoon  i guess we all hope that answered jack  with so much to think of in connection with their proposed trip to cedar lodge the rover boys put in a busy time all of that day and part of the next then they went down to the grand central terminal with the girls to meet the expected visitors  there they are cried martha after the long train had rolled into the station and a moment later she and ruth were in each others arms while mary was embracing may then the boys shook hands and all drove away to the rover residences  did you get that picture for me ruth questioned jack as soon as he could get a chance to speak to the girl in private  oh you dont want any picture she declared mischievously  aw come now he pleaded dont try to put me off that way you know what you promised  well cant you wait until we get to the house  oh sure but i wanted to make certain that you had brought the picture along  youll be scared when you see it declared ruth i look a perfect fright the man snapped the picture before i was half ready  but later on when jack received the gift he declared that the picture was a very good one indeed although it did not look half as pretty as ruth did herself the two had quite a little fun over the picture and then jack placed it in his pocket  now youve got it what are you going to do with it questioned ruth curiously  im going to carry it right here he declared for he had it in an inside pocket over his heart  oh you big goose cried ruth but then she blushed and looked pleased nevertheless  it was announced that part of the lake in central park had been scraped clear of the snow and the following day the young folks went skating and had a most glorious time then in the evening all attended a theatrical performance at one of the leading theaters  oh my but i am having a splendid time said ruth to martha  its too bad the boys are going away was the answer but i dont blame them for wanting to go on a hunt if i were a boy id like to go on a hunt myself  on the following morning came a letter from dick rover stating that matters were still somewhat quiet in the sector in france where they were located but that word was being passed around that they were to make an advance in the near future  hurrah i guess theyll show those huns what americans can do cried jack  oh i dread to think of their going into battle said his mother  ma while we are away dont forget to send us any news that may come in said jack quickly you can telegraph to timminsport and we will leave word there at the telegraph office so that any important message will be delivered to us  ill certainly do that jack and later on mrs tom rover and mrs sam rover promised to do the same thing  there is no telling what may happen to our dads if they get into a regular firstclass battle remarked fred that night when the four boys were holding a little conference among themselves  well weve got to take what comes returned randy briefly however ill be as much worried as ma until this war is at an end or until our dads come home  the boys had looked over their traps with care and examined their rifles and shotguns and had even gone down into the cellar of one of their residences to try out the weapons to make certain that they were in working order  with a shotgun in his hand andy wanted to have some fun with one of the servant girls but randy quickly stopped him  nothing doing andy he said youll only make ma nervous and she is nervous enough already thinking about dad you save your tomfoolery until we are on the way or up at the camp  at length came the time for the boys to take their departure jack hated to think of running away from ruth and fred was equally sorry to leave may powell behind yet the thought of what was ahead brightened all of the lads considerably  we ought to have the time of our lives declared fred that is if hunting is half as good as gif garrison said it was  and if i can get that silver fox added jack  nothing but a moose for me declared randy either a moose or a sixlegged jack rabbit  wouldnt you like to shoot a bear that weighed about a thousand pounds questioned jack  and lug the carcass to camp yourself came from fred  speaking about carrying a thousandpound bear puts me in mind of something cried randy quickly a fellow was telling me of a man here in the city who carried twelve hundred pounds  twelve hundred pounds exclaimed his twin it cant be done  why thats more than a half a ton said jack incredulously  never mind the fellow carried the twelve hundred pounds went on randy a whole lot of people saw him do it  where was this questioned fred  it was down at one of the broadway banks answered randy innocently the fellow was an english army officer he had twelve hundred pounds in english money that he was exchanging for good old u s a coin  fooled cried fred and this was followed by a general laugh     chapter ix  the railroad accident   the four rover boys journeyed from new york city to baxton and there changed from one station to another nearby and took the next train for portview  arriving in portview they took a taxicab to the leading hotel and were there met by gif and spouter who had come in a few hours earlier and had already signed for their accommodations  mighty glad to see you got here declared gif i read about the awful storm you had down around new york and i thought you might be delayed  well i see they have had some of the snow up here answered jack although it isnt as heavy as it was down our way  dont worry about snow jack youll get all you want of it after we reach cedar lodge  the rover boys were tired out from their allday trip and as gif and spouter had likewise had their fill of traveling for the time being all were glad enough to retire for a good nights rest even andy being too worn out to play any of his jokes but the following morning found the youths as bright and fresh as ever and eager to continue their journey  we can get a train for timminsport at tenthirty announced gif that will give us plenty of time for breakfast and to do a little shopping if we need anything portview has as good stores as many big towns when you get to timminsport you will find it nothing but a onehorse country town  they had a substantial breakfast and then wandered down the main street as far as a small park and then came back on the other side of the thoroughfare they made a number of small purchases including some cakes of choice chocolate and a bag of almonds of which spouter and randy were particularly fond  when we get to timminsport dont forget to add a good big bag of sugar to our stores said randy then if we are snowed in sometime we can spend a few hours making some homemade candy  yes and we can try our hands at some cookies added fred ive watched our cook make them quite a few times and i think i could make some myself if i tried real hard  anyway you might be able to turn out some sinkers said andy with a grin and if we couldnt eat em we could take em back to colby hall and present em to some of the teachers for paperweights and at this there was a laugh  with the bundles the boys returned to the hotel paid their bill and with their suitcases in hand returned once more to the depot here in the smoky trainshed the cars were already waiting and they climbed aboard and a few minutes later were on their way to timminsport  the coast in this vicinity is very irregular so that the train did not run close to the shore they skirted a bay and then branched off at a small place called leeways for the town for which they were bound at leeways they met several heavy lumber trains and also met a gang of men bound for one of the lumber camps  we are certainly getting away from the big towns now remarked fred  i just saw a few hunters with their guns cried randy that looks interesting to me  there was no diner on the train but around noon it stopped at a waystation where there was a lunch counter and here the young travelers had ten minutes in which to satisfy their appetites  maybe wed better take a few sandwiches along remarked jack we may not have another chance to eat until we get to the lodge  oh there is a little restaurant at timminsport declared gif its not a very nice place but well be able to get as much as we want there  soon the train was on its way again having backed up at leeways to drop a passenger car and take on one of mixed freight the character of the passengers had largely changed and most of them were now country folks lumberjacks and city people bound for a season of hunting the steam heat had died out in the car which the boys occupied and it was growing colder and colder  the train doesnt go any farther than timminsport explained gif and i suppose the engineer is saving on steam  say gif i didnt think you were going to give us such a cold reception cried randy  never mind the cold reception exclaimed spouter who was gazing out of the window at the scenery just look at this truly wonderful picture see those hillsides with massive pines and those clusters of bushes all bent down with their weight of snow and see how the sunshine sparkles making each snowdrop look like a diamond its a wonderful sight and it fills ones soul with a feeling of awe and admiration for  hurrah spouter has come into his own again cried andy thats right spout warm up good and maybe youll help warm this car  if those snowdrops were really diamonds spouter what do you thing theyd be worth a dozen came from randy  aw thats just like you fellows grumbled the wouldbe orator in disgust you havent any poetry in your souls  havent any poetry in my soul cried andy you bet i havetons and tons of it just listen to this and he chanted gayly      i love to see a snowdrop        ahanging on a tree      aglistening in the sunshine        as happy as can be  great redheaded snakes burst out jack andy has turned poet  dont you think you ought to take something for it andy cough mixture or measles eradicator or something like that questioned fred  i think what he needs is a good dose of codliver oil served hot came from gif  no codliver oil for me cried the funloving rover you deal that out to spouter it will help oil his tongue and make his flow of oratory better  speaking of cough mixtures i think ill get a bottle of some sort when we get to timminsport if they have a drugstore said jack some of us may catch cold and need it  with such talk going on the journey continued they were now running for a small station named enwood where they were to pick up two extra cars from a small side road coming down from the north in this section there was a good deal of snow and the train consequently had to run rather slowly  i think i could get out and walk almost as fast as this train is moving remarked spouter presently  it isnt as bad as that spouter returned jack looking out of the window we are making at least fifteen miles an hour and you couldnt hoof it as quick as that  it certainly seems awfully slow remarked fred he was beginning to grow sleepy and now he rested his head on the back of the seat and closed his eyes  perhaps we wont be able to get through to timminsport came from randy that would be a fine state of affairs eh  i dont see any houses along the line wed have one sweet job finding a place to go to if the train became snowbound said andy  they generally manage to keep this road open no matter how bad the storms are declared gif you see the hunters are coming and going all the time as well as the lumbermen and the folks that live in and around timminsport and enwood they dont like to be cut off from the rest of the world even for a day or two  i hope we dont have to wait for that other train when we get to enwood said spouter that may be awfully late you know  i asked the conductor awhile ago and he said they hoped it would be on time it comes down hill most of the way and that is in its favor if they had to pull uphill much they might get stuck  presently they passed a small lumber camp and one of the other passengers told the boys they were now within half a mile of enwood  and that is only twelve miles from timminsport said gif we ought to be there in about half an hour or so  they had struck a portion of the track which was comparatively free of snow and the engineer of the train was now trying to make up some of the lost time the boys were congratulating themselves on this when they suddenly heard a shriek of the locomotive whistle followed instantly by the sudden application of the steam brakes the train shuddered and shook and two seconds later there came a crash from the front and then the train came to a sudden stop  the rover boys and their chums had leaped to their feet at the first shock the second threw spouter headlong and randy went down almost on top of him fred was awakened from his brief nap by having his forehead bumped upon the seat ahead of him  whats the matter  what did we strike  are we going to upset  let me get out of here i dont want to be smashed up  such were some of the cries which rent the air while the train was still in motion and after it came to a standstill every passenger had been shaken up and not a few were knocked down fortunately however no one in that particular car seemed to be much hurt although several were bruised and every one was more or less nervous  are you hurt fred questioned jack quickly as he saw his young cousin feeling of his forehead  well i got a pretty good bump answered the youngest rover and i guess im going to have a lump there as a consequence  well get out and see whats doing and then you can put some snow on it  some of the passengers were already leaving the car and the rover boys and their chums quickly followed the trouble was all ahead and they had some difficulty in wading through the snow alongside the track to get to the front of the train  here it was plain to be seen what had happened the train from the north had come in and tried to take the siding as was the custom but the switch had become blocked with snow and the train had been thrown out on the main track which at this point crossed the track on which the train from portview was coming the big locomotive of the latter train had ploughed through the middle of the train from the north hitting the latter between two of the cars and sending those cars in either direction to the sides of the track  gee this is some wreck exclaimed gif  i should say it was declared jack it looks to me as if somebody might be killed  from the two wrecked cars came cries of pain and yells for help one of the cars still stood up but at a dangerous angle while the other had turned completely over and rested on its top in the snow  all was excitement and for the time being everyone seemed to be so dazed that but little was done passengers were leaping from both of the wrecked cars some coming through the doorways and some through the brokenout windows jack and randy ran to one of the cars and were able to assist a woman with a little girl to alight and reach a place of safety in the meanwhile the other lads assisted two elderly men one had his foot hurt and they carried him into the railroad station where they laid him on one of the benches  look look cried fred suddenly forgetting all about his hurt forehead look that car over yonder is on fire  the car he mentioned was that which had turned over and was resting on its top in the snow from the interior thick black smoke was coming and this was presently followed by a tongue of flame the car was a combination baggage and smoker and it was afterwards learned that one of the passengers had been carrying a can of kerosene which had broken open in the smashup and had evidently become ignited by some throwndown cigar or cigarette  those people will be in danger of burning up gasped randy  they will be unless they get out in a hurry answered spouter  from the interior of the car came more cries and presently all outside heard a man yelling in a tone of agony  help help somebody save me my leg is caught fast and i cant get out save me     chapter x  the rescue   theres a man left in there  he says his leg is caught fast  help help came more faintly from the interior of the burning car help or ill be burnt to death  only a few passengers seemed to hear these cries for most of the men who had come from the other train were gathered near the car which was still standing the rover boys and their chums listened in horror to the call for assistance jack was the first to leap forward  well have to save that fellow if we can he cried determinedly  i think he is close to one of these windows said randy pointing to several brokenout windows through which some other passengers in the car had climbed  wait ive got an idea exclaimed fred see that stick of wood why cant we place that against one of the windows and climb up on it  he had pointed to a plank one end of which in some manner had become torn up from the roadbed all of the boys rushed for this plank and turned and twisted it until they had the fastened end under the snow loose then they rushed over to the burning car and placed the plank on a slant from the snow to the brokenout window which because the overturned car was not on a level was two or three feet above their heads  jack was the first to get on the plank and speedily crawled up to the window fortunately a draft was taking most of the smoke to the other side of the car so that he could see into the interior quite plainly  a scene of great confusion met the eyes of the young captain a number of broken seats had fallen down on the ceiling of the car and in the midst of this wreckage lay a short stocky man with several cuts and bruises on his face from which the blood was flowing the man had his arms and one leg free but several seats and some handbaggage were wedged in across his left leg and his stomach in such a manner that he seemed unable to extricate himself the fire was creeping up to within a few inches of his caught foot and this had caused him to raise his wild cry for assistance  help help he repeated as soon as he caught sight of jacks face framed in the brokenout window get me out of here before the fire reaches me  well do it answered jack come on randy i think the two of us can do the trick he added to his cousin who had come up behind him on the plank  want any more help questioned the others simultaneously  if we do well let you know quick enough  jack dropped down into the car and randy followed they landed among a mass of broken glass and other wreckage but to this paid no attention  here randy take hold of this seat and pull it back ordered jack and between them they set to work with vigor  but it was no mean task to get all of the wreckage off of the trapped passenger there were half a dozen heavy suitcases among the broken seats and these the boys hurled through the broken windows where they were picked up by those outside and carried to a safe place in the meanwhile the flames were creeping closer and now a sudden change in the air caused a heavy volume of smoke to drift toward them  gee this is getting fierce spluttered randy and began to cough while the tears started from his eyes  dont leave me please dont leave me pleaded the passenger under the wreckage i dont want to be burnt up and then he said something in a foreign tongue which the others did not understand  the last bit of wreckage was the hardest of all to get away from where it rested across the mans stomach this was wedged in between the ceiling and the side of the car and the boys had to use all their strength before they could dislodge it but at last it came loose and then the man was able to sit up  here well help you cried jack as the passenger seemed to be too weak to regain his feet he and randy caught the fellow under his arms and standing him upright dragged him to the window upon which the end of the plank rested they shoved him out and he went rolling and sliding down the plank into the snow randy followed him quickly and then came jack  illustration he went rolling and sliding down the plank into the snow  the rescue had occurred none too soon for the wind was now coming up and soon the overturned car was a mass of smoke and flames from end to end the boys left the plank where it was and assisted the rescued passenger to the little railroad station where all the others who had been injured had already been taken  the short stocky man was very much excited and he thanked the lads over and over again for what they had done  i wish i was a rich man he said sadly and now they noticed that he spoke with a decided accent if i was rich i would pay all of you well for what you have done it was very noblevery noble indeed i shall never forget it  we dont want any reward answered jack  you young gentlemen do not look as if you needed any reward said the man with a little smile as he noted how well dressed the youths were i am a poor man so i can offer you nothing but my thanks but those i give you with all my heart and now may i ask your names  they told him and all shook hands he said his name was herman crouse and that he was a farmer working a small place some miles away he was plainly dressed and evidently far from wealthy  while the boys were assisting herman crouse to the little railroad station others had gone into the burning car and picked up such baggage and other things as could be gotten out then the car which was nothing but an old rattletrap affair was allowed to burn up  of course the accident had caused a great deal of excitement and telegrams were at once dispatched to leeways and timminsport for assistance  i think ill send word home that we are all right said jack the folks may hear about this accident and worry over it and as soon as he had an opportunity he sent a message and gif and spouter did the same  as the trains from the north ran no farther on that branch than enwood all of the passengers on board had been bound for either that place or timminsport consequently many of those who were injured remained in the town while the others were made as comfortable as possible on the other train and taken to timminsport fortunately no one had been killed or fatally hurt herman crouse remained at enwood he thanked the boys again most heartily when they left him  maybe some day i shall be able to pay you back for your goodness to me said he if it comes that way i shall certainly do it and then he shook hands once more  i guess hes a german all right enough remarked jack when the boys were once again in the train and it was moving forward the track having been cleared he spoke with a very strong german accent  yes and his name is undoubtedly german said randy but he was a pretty decent sort anyway  oh a good many of the germanamericans socalled are all right said gif why there are thousands of them in the army and in the navy as well as in the air service and they are fighting just as hard and loyally for uncle sam as anybody  sure declared andy look at hans mueller who used to be a great chum of our dads at putnam hall hes as loyal as they make em and hes in the army too and will undoubtedly give a good account of himself  oh i dont doubt but what a lot of the germans are loyal to this country came from spouter just the same its a good thing to keep your eyes on them  right you are cried andy dont forget those german spies we ran into at the offices in wall streetthe same chaps who were in with mr brown and mr martell  i tell you one thing remarked gif changing the subject this accident is going to get us into timminsport very late and i dont know whether jed wallop will be there to meet us or not they had sent word ahead for the old fellow who lived near the cedar lodge property to come with his boxsled for them and their traps  probably he was hanging around the railroad station waiting for the train to come in and if so he must have heard about the accident and he would be very anxious about you gif remarked jack  well well see when we get there but if jed isnt there i dont know what we can do for the night i dont believe timminsport has any hotel fit to stop at and it wouldnt be a very nice hike of five or six miles to cedar lodge in the dark and through the snow  with so many hurt passengers on board the engineer was careful and so did not run very fast and as a consequence it was well after dark by the time they rolled into timminsport quite a crowd was collected at the depot anxious to get the particulars of the accident and also to meet those who needed assistance the two doctors living in that vicinity had been summoned and were on hand to give all the aid possible  there is jed wallop now cried gif presently and pointed to a tall angular individual wrapped up in a shaggy overcoat and wearing an equally shaggy cap with the eartabs tied down under his chin  hello jed he cried cheerfully and shoved his way forward to greet the man  jed wallop proved to be so excited that he hardly paid attention to gifs greetings nor to his introduction to the other youths from colby hall  im lookin fer a cousin o minetim doolittle he exclaimed i heard as how he was in the accident did you see him  i dont know the man jed answered gif the hurt ones are all in the forward car  jed wallop pushed his way through the crowd and soon found the man he was seeking the poor fellow had one arm in a sling and had several cuts on his face and declared himself very much shook up and rather weak  well by gosh im mighty glad you wasnt killed tim declared wallop now what you goin to do with yourself you cant go up to burkes camp in that condition  no i cant answered tim doolittle ive got to rest up fer a spell and git this sprained arm o mine fit fer work agin i was thinkin i might ride over to uncle joes place if i could git anyone to take me  i can take you there myself i can git a sleigh from hank miller and do itthat is if these young fellers would be willin to drive over to cedar lodge alone added jed wallop looking anxiously at gif and his companions  i suppose i could do that answered gif slowly i dont know the way very well but i think i could make it  oh its a putty straight road gif said wallop you cant miss your way if you keep your eyes open whenever you strike the crossroads keep to the right every time and then you wont git left and he chuckled a little over his joke  how are the team and the boxsled  all right you know them horsesmary and john a very reliable team they wont run away and theyll make good time  all right then jed just show me where the sled is and then you can go off and take care of your cousin said gif well have to stay in town for a while and see if we cant pick up some grub and at least enough supplies to last us for a few days  so the matter was arranged and a few minutes later jed wallop went off to see what he could do about caring for his injured cousin  its all right for him to look after his cousin remarked gif but that leaves us to go on alone i hope we find everything at cedar lodge all right  oh it will be a lark to go on all alone cried fred we dont want that fellow along we can get along alone very well  i know what i want to do first of all declared andy i want to get a bite to eat that sandwich i had didnt satisfy me at all  all right well go to that restaurant i spoke about said gif then well get our provisions and be on the way to the lodge     chapter xi  on the way to cedar lodge   the restaurant gif had in mind was a small affair located on a side street directly behind the railroad station leaving their handbaggage at the station in a pile with numerous other bags and their guns with the stationmaster they made their way to this resort ordinarily at this time of night the restaurant was doing very little business but on account of the accident many people had dropped in so the tables presented a lively appearance  well have some difficulty in finding seats i guess remarked jack looking around  there are a couple of small tables over in the alcove came from spouter we might shove them together and i guess theyll hold us all  this was done and after a wait of several minutes a girl came to take their orders  what have you got ready questioned gif there is no use of our waiting to have anything cooked to order he continued to his chums  the girl named over a variety of things including hot pork and beans roast beef with potatoes and turnips and also several kinds of sandwiches and pies and also tea and coffee  those things will do first rate i guess cried fred me for a dish of pork and beans and a good hot cup of coffee  it did not take the cadets long to give their orders and the girl bustled off to serve them while the lads were waiting for the things to be brought andy happened to glance across the restaurant at the other patrons and suddenly gave a low whistle of surprise  look whos here will you he exclaimed  all looked in the direction pointed out and there at a side table saw bill glutts gabe werner and henry stowell  my gracious what do you know about that ejaculated randy glutts werner and codfish  what can those fellows be doing in timminsport demanded spouter  say i think i know the answer to that question returned jack quickly he looked at his cousin fred dont you remember what bill and gabe said in the moving picture theater about going up to some camp to hunt i wager that camp is located somewhere in this vicinity  that must be it answered fred  however did they get poor codfish to come along with them queried andy theyll plague the life out of that little sneak  theyll make a regular servant of him thats what theyll do answered his twin  if they came up here to hunt i hope they are not going to settle down anywhere near cedar lodge remarked gif id hate to have those fellows saddled on me while i was trying to have some fun  i wonder if they saw us questioned fred  lets not take any notice of them advised jack id rather go my way and let them go theirs  to this the others readily agreed they were soon served with the things they had ordered and lost no time in making away with the food then they hurried out of the resort leaving glutts werner and codfish still at the table which they occupied the two bullies had lighted cigarettes  now lets skip over to one of the general stores and see what we can get in the way of provisions said gif well have to hurry up or the storekeeper may close up on us  ive got the list here gif declared jack show us where the store is and then you bring around the team with the boxsled by that time maybe well have most of our things bought  the store proved to be a low rambling affair filled with a hundred and one varieties of goods some looking quite fresh and others with the appearance of having been in stock for some years  the storekeeper was pleased to serve them especially when he realized that their purchases would be for cash jack and the others knew exactly what they wanted and picked out everything with care  i guess you young fellows have been up in the woods before remarked the storekeeper with a shrewd look  we have been although not around here answered jack  thought you had by the way youre ordering some of them fellows that come up here have no more idee about what is wanted in a camp than nothing at all they take along the most ridiculous things and sometimes leave out coffee and sugar and salt and bacon and things like that which a feller has jest got to have  gif had brought around the boxsled and into this the storekeepers assistant piled the various boxes and bags which contained the provisions they had purchased the things made quite a load so that the six cadets had about all they could do to get in themselves  we sure would have been crowded had jed wallop been along remarked fred who was squeezed in on top of some boxes with randy on one side of him and spouter on the other gif was up in front driving with jack and andy beside him  let her go cried andy gayly hurrah for cedar lodge  hold on exclaimed jack suddenly are you fellows going up there without your suitcases and guns  at this there came a groan from nearly all of the others  gee i forgot all about those suitcases and firearms  where in the world are we going to place them  if we put the suitcases in well surely have to walk  oh well stow em in somehow declared gif you fellows dont know how to load a boxsled  i know what we can do cried jack let us get a few loose packingcase boards and stand them up around the back of the sled we can place the boxes against them and then pile the suitcases on top and the tops of the boards will hold them in the guns can go in anywhere  thats the stuff said spouter and he and gif and andy hurried back to the store to get the boards and arrange them as suggested  in the meantime jack fred and randy hurried in the direction of the railroad station to get the six suitcases and the guns which had been left there they found the crowd had thinned out somewhat although quite a few people were still present  it did not take the three lads long to find the six suitcases and armed with two each and with all the guns they trudged back to where they had left the boxsled then the suitcases were piled up and tied fast to the upright boards and to the boxsled itself so that they might not be jounced off the guns were placed in the bottom alongside the boxes  now then pile in and well be getting to the lodge cried gif i can tell you fellows i am mighty anxious to see the old place to see if it looks like it did when i was here last  the youths were just stowing themselves away on the sled when there came a cry from out of the darkness and three fellows came hurrying through the snow from the direction of the railroad station  hi there stop called out the foremost of the trio stop i tell you  why its gabe werner exclaimed randy what can he want of us  in a moment more the big bully was beside the sled and glutts and codfish followed him  thought you were mighty smart eh cried gabe werner angrily another minute and i suppose you would have been gone  what do you want werner demanded jack  what are you fellows doing in this neighborhood questioned fred  what we are doing here is our business answered werner sourly what i want of you is my suitcase  your suitcase queried several of the others  yes my suitcase oh you neednt play the innocent i know youve got my suitcase somewhere on this boxsled but youre not going to get away with it hand it over or ill call a policeman  gabe werner was very much in earnest and his face was red with anger and resentment he reached up and caught hold of the lines which gif held in his hands  drop those lines werner cried gif quickly drop them i say  i want my suitcase you had no business to touch it  i dont know anything about your suitcase declared gif he turned to the others we havent anything but our own bags have we  i dont think we have declared jack  i know better grumbled werner  ill bet theyve got it and are hiding it away declared bill glutts they took a whole lot of bags away just as we were coming up the baggage master saw em  im glad they didnt get my bag cried codfish who was lugging a goodsized gladstone  if we took your bag it must have been by mistake said randy i looked at the markings pretty carefully though  so did i said fred  well well make sure remarked jack and brought out a flashlight which he had taken from his own suitcase for possible use on the road he flashed the light in the direction of the six suitcases and he and his chums looked over all of the markings with care  how is your bag marked questioned gif  g a w answered werner  well you can see for yourself that there is no such marking on any of these bags declared jack there is my own these two belong to andy and randy this is freds and here is gifs and that one is spouters  maybe theyve got it hidden under the blankets or something like that suggested glutts  there are no other suitcases in this boxsled declared gif flatly  well take a look and make sure  youll do nothing of the sort gabe werner and now with flashing eyes gif raised his whip as if to bring it down over the bullys head  hold on gif dont do anything like that advised jack let them look around the sled if they want to then they will know were telling the truth if we go off without giving them a chance to look they may complain to the authorities here and make a lot of trouble for us  all right then go ahead and look answered gif leaping from the boxsled but dont you harm any of our things or youll hear from me  jack flashed the light into the sled and werner and glutts made an examination of the contents of course they found no other baggage and so drew back in disgust  i dont understand it said werner lamely i left that bag there in the station masters care while i and the others went to get something to eat now my bag is gone  well that is none of our affair answered jack come on fellows its getting late lets be on the way  ill get that bag back or ill make the station master pay for it grumbled gabe werner and then he and his cronies turned on their heels and walked back in the direction of the railroad station  gee somebody must have walked off with his bag while he was eating remarked fred rather tough luck if he had anything of real value in it  serves him rightfor being so cross and cranky was andys comment but the bag had not been stolen it had been simply misplaced as was afterwards proven  once more the boys adjusted themselves on the boxsled and then gif took up the reins and spoke to the team off they started at a walk but soon broke into a slow trot as the sled began to go down a long slope leading in the direction of cedar lodge  the way was little more than a woods road winding in and out among the trees they had to mount several small hills and on these the horses settled down to a very slow walk  i guess jed wallop was right about mary and john not running away came from randy i dont think anything short of an earthquake could start em into a gallop  they are lumbercamp horses used to drawing pretty heavy loads explained gif they may not be very much on speed but on the other hand you can depend on their pulling us out of any tight hole where fancy horses might get stuck     chapter xii  at the frozenup spring   on and on went the boxsled carrying the rovers and their chums deeper and deeper into the woods occasionally the road was so narrow that they brushed the snowladen bushes on one side or the other  hi there gif look out cried randy presently a bush had been turned aside by those ahead and now it slipped back covering randys face with loose snow  im sorry randy returned gif but weve got to take this road as it comes youll have to watch out just as the others are doing  there was a smoky lantern dangling from the front of the boxsled but this gave little light the moon was down beyond the trees and only the diamondlike stars glittered overhead  how much further have we got to go questioned jack presently after they had passed a crossroads and kept to the right as jed wallop had directed  i think we have covered about half the distance jack was the reply of the young driver still im not sure you know a boxsled isnt like an autoit doesnt carry a speedometer  gee an auto would have been there and back two or three times since we started was freds comment  not in this snow came from spouter i think youd get stuck in some of these deep places  they do use a few cars up here in the winter but not many said gif its too uncertain  to make the time pass more quickly jack started one of the old school songs and the others joined him then they ended with the wellknown colby hall cry      who are we     cant you see     colby hall     dum dum dum dum dum     here we come with fife and drum     colby colby colby hall  i wonder what the neighbors will think if they hear us remarked randy  i dont think there are any neighbors very close answered gif there was a house some distance back but i dont know of any others between here and cedar lodge the other places are beyond the point where we turn off to go down to the bungalow  they had now to make several sharp turns and at these spots the road was unusually rough one runner of the boxsled went up on some rocks and for a moment it looked as if the turnout would upset  look out there gif  youll have us in the snow with the sled on top of us  git along there mary and john cried the young driver git along and he cracked his whip and soon the team had pulled the boxsled from the rocks and then going became better  we ought to be coming to a signboard soon declared gif a few minutes later i remember there used to be one on the road pointing to a number of camps north of this place  in a few minutes they came to the spot he had mentioned but to his disappointment there was no signboard to be seen  someone must have taken it down or else it fell of itself he remarked  are you quite sure youre on the right road questioned andy  it would be fierce to have to turn back this time of night added his twin  oh im pretty sure this is the right road answered their chum nevertheless his face showed a doubtful look not to find the signboard which had been a landmark in that vicinity for many years puzzled him  a little later they came to where the road branched out in three directions the road on the right being narrow and running directly into a thick patch of woods  whoa cried gif to the team and then he looked around more puzzled than ever and shook his head  whats wrong now asked jack  i guess im stumped was the slow reply i cant remember this spot at all  oh gif dont tell us were on the wrong road after all exclaimed andy  jed wallop told us to keep to the right announced spouter weve been doing that and we might as well do it now  but that road doesnt look as if it leads to anywhere declared fred  its a mighty narrow road too returned gif we might get down in among the trees and be unable to turn around and then what would we do  better stay here gif while i walk ahead and investigate said jack  better take a gun along in case you stir up something you dont want to meet warned fred  not a bad idea and reaching down into the boxsled jack brought out one of the weapons that had been placed there  if you see a moose shoot him on the spot cried randy  what spot queried his twin gayly a spot on the end of his tail or the tip of his ear wouldnt be of much account  i dont see how you can joke andy when were lost away out here in the woods and its past midnight came ruefully from fred id give as much as a dollar to be at the lodge and lying down in front of a roaring fire im getting pretty cold  they were all cold for since nightfall the thermometer had been going down steadily more than this the wind was rising and this in the open places was anything but pleasant to the cadets  ill go with you jack announced spouter and he too armed himself with his gun a doublebarreled affair of which he was quite proud  holding his flashlight so that they might see where they were walking jack led the way and spouter came close behind they walked a distance of several hundred feet and here found that the road came to an end among some rocks which were now covered with ice  its a road to a spring thats all said jack the water is frozen now but i suppose in the summer time the lumbermen and the other folks around here occasionally travel in for a drink we may as well go back  well its a mighty good thing we didnt drive in here we might have had a job turning around on that rough ice answered spouter  the frozenup spring was a beautiful sight the water standing out in columns and waves as if made of milky glass behind the columns there was still a trickle of water  to get a better view of the sight jack swept the rays of the flashlight first to one side and then to the other as he did this he caught a glimpse of a pair of gleaming eyes from the brushwood and snow behind the spring the eyes looked full of curiosity and fright  look look spouter he cried and then dropped the flashlight into his overcoat pocket  what is it  i just saw the eyes of some wild animal back there see there they are now  as jack spoke he raised his gun and blazed away this shot was followed by one from spouter  the reports were followed almost immediately by a snarl and a whining cry and they heard some animal thrashing around wildly in the bushes behind the spring sending the loose snow flying in all directions  we hit it whatever it is announced jack  what do you suppose it can be questioned spouter quickly it wasnt a deer was it  i dont think so spouter it was too low down for that maybe it was a fox although it didnt sound like it  perhaps there are brook mink around this spring  maybe  are you going back there to find out went on spouter for the sounds in the brushwood had now ceased  sure im going back there you dont suppose im going to let any game get away from us  be careful jack that animal may be playing possum you know and may spring out at you  dont worry ill be on my guard answered jack  he had slipped another charge into his gun and spouter quickly did likewise then with their weapons ready for use and with the flashlight held so that it cast its rays ahead they cautiously moved around to one side of the frozen spring and made their way in the direction of the bushes and rocks in the rear  hello there what are you shooting at the cry came from where the pair had left the boxsled it was gif who was calling  we dont know yet answered jack  we saw a pair of eyes and we shot at them added spouter  gee what do you know about that exclaimed fred hunting before we even reach the lodge  lets go ahead and see what they struck came from randy  thats the talk added his twin  gif was willing and in a moment more the four lads had scrambled down from the boxsled and were making their way along the road leading to the spring by this time jack and spouter had advanced through the brushwood and over the rocks close to the spot where they had last seen the gleaming eyes as they went on jack imagined once or twice he saw something moving through the snow but of this he was not certain  here is where we hit it whatever it was declared spouter when they reached the point directly behind the spring see how the snow is dug up  yes and here are some drops of blood said jack as he turned the flashlight on the snow but whatever it was it got away he added disappointedly  what have you got sang out gif for he and the others had come up on the opposite side of the spring  we havent got anything answered spouter dolefully we hit something but it got away from us  it wasnt a moose was it queried randy with great interest  no i think it was a threehorned elephant replied jack who was not then in the best of humor he hated to have the first thing he shot at get away from him  well this seems to be the end of this road remarked gif looking around  yes it only led down to this frozenup spring answered spouter  i move we go on said fred im cold and im sleepy too  i think were all that way answered gif come on you fellows no use of remaining around here if that animal got away it probably moved off quite a distance  that would depend on how badly it was wounded answered jack just wait a minute and ill see if i cant find its trail  aided by the flashlight he looked around carefully and presently made out some tracks in the snow leading in the direction of a nearby thicket he moved to this coming presently to several lowhanging trees  see anything questioned fred impatiently  not yet but the trail is here as plain as can be  maybe those are only rabbit tracks remarked randy  or tracks of the animals that came down to the spring for a drink put in gif  jack did not answer he was flashing the light around carefully inspecting all the trees and bushes in that vicinity suddenly the light was flashed upward and as the rays ran along one of the branches of the tree directly in front of the youth there came a sudden snarl of rage and protest  its a wildcat ejaculated spouter whose eyes had also been following the rays of light a wildcat  yes and its the animal we wounded answered jack see how it is holding up one of its front paws  be careful sang out gif in alarm a wounded wildcat is no beast to play with  scarcely had he uttered the words when the wildcat gave another snarl of rage then the tail of the beast began to quiver and suddenly with a cry it leaped down from the tree striking the ground directly in front of the surprised boys     chapter xiii  the meeting on the road   that the wildcat was in a savage mood and prepared to fight to a finish there could be no doubt evidently the wounded paw had made the beast more savage than usual and hardly had it struck the ground than it tried to make a leap forward at jack  look out jack  he means to claw you to death  bang went spouters gun but he did not dare to take too close an aim for fear of hitting jack and as a consequence the charge of shot merely damaged the wildcats tail  it must not be thought that the oldest rover was slow in moving had this been true the wildcat would undoubtedly have fastened its claws and its teeth into the youth and done serious damage as the animal came forward the young captain leaped to one side and the wildcat landed in the snow facing the others who had come up  shoot him shoot him came from fred excitedly  plug him quick added andy  none of those who had followed jack and spouter were armed so the fight rested entirely upon the shoulders of that pair circling around so as to avoid the others jack pulled the trigger and fired the wildcat began flipping and flopping on the snow badly wounded then spouter discharged his firearm once more and after this the creature lay quiet where it dropped  isis he dead questioned fred who was the first to speak the youngest rover was very much excited and with good cause  wait dont go forward ordered jack as he stepped back a few paces he may be playing possum anyway we had better load our guns first he added to spouter  this advice to load immediately after discharging a weapon was one which had been well drilled into the cadets and so now the pair lost no time in putting new charges into their weapons then they approached with caution and jack turned the wildcat over with the barrel of the gun keeping his hand meanwhile on the trigger ready for action  but the beast was quite dead the charges from the two guns having gone completely through its body  what are you going to do with the carcass questioned randy after all had made an inspection  might as well leave it here declared fred it isnt good for anything even the skin is all torn from the shot  no we might as well take it along we can hang it on the back of the boxsled said gif perhaps we can use the meat to trap some other wild animals  a strap which one of the boys happened to carry was fastened around the neck of the wildcat and then they carried it from the spring to where they had left the boxsled the excitement for the time being had caused all of the cadets to forget how late it was and how cold and windy it was growing but now when they were once more ready to drive off several of them began to shiver  its going to be mighty cold before morning announced randy  yes and i wish we were at that bungalow in front of a good log fire added andy  now that weve discovered that wasnt the road which way do you propose to go gif questioned jack  we wont count that as a road and well take the other one on the right was the reply i dont know of anything else to do gif added somewhat helplessly  none of the others could give advice for the reason that this territory was entirely new to them even spouter who had visited the woods a number of times had never been in that vicinity  onward they went once more up a gentle hill and then down the slope on the other side at the foot of the hill the road became rougher and rougher and presently the horses had all they could do to make any progress  gif this cant be the right road declared jack at last if it was as rough as this jed wallop would have told us about it he said we wouldnt have any trouble at all in reaching cedar lodge  yes and besides we must have come at least five or six miles added spouter  ill bet weve come all of eight miles broke in fred  thats just what i think declared randy ill bet an elephant against a mouse were on the wrong road  well i wont dispute that randy answered the young driver of the boxsled but youll all bear witness to it that i followed directions and kept to the right  the road now ran along the side of a hill here the heavy fall of snow had slid down over the rocks and the going was anything but safe the faithful old horses had all they could do to keep their footing  well upset the first thing you know exclaimed fred and he had scarcely spoken when the runner on the up side of the road struck a series of rocks and the next minute all of the boys including gif went tumbling from the boxsled and some of their provisions followed  whoa there whoa there mary and john called gif to the team but this command was not needed for the tired old horses were only too glad to stop and had come to a halt the moment the youths tumbled off  all had landed in the snow which at this point was rather deep so none of them was seriously hurt although somebody stepped on one of randys hands and spouter got a scratch on his ear from some nearby bushes  well heres a mess exclaimed fred as he picked himself up now we are in a pickle  oh it might have been worse declared jack as cheerfully as he could because he could easily see that gif was in a state of mind bordering on desperation nobody is seriously hurt i hope  all scrambled up and then looked at the roadway immediately ahead here was a somewhat level spot and to this the sled was driven and the lads picked up the stuff which had fallen off in the snow and replaced it this time tying it down with some ropes and straps which were handy  i dont believe ill drive any further on this road said gif it doesnt seem to lead to anywhere and im quite certain now that it isnt the way to cedar lodge  what will you do asked andy go back to that other road  everybody was stumped and for several seconds nobody made any reply  might as well go back said spouter  fred and randy walked on ahead trying to determine where the road led to but all they could see was the blackness of the forest and the roadway seemed to grow rougher and more perilous at every step  it was no easy task to turn the team and the boxsled around without spilling everything again but it was accomplished at last and then slowly and painfully they climbed along the hill until they reached the point where there had been another split in the road here they came to a halt  listen cried randy suddenly  all did as requested and from a distance heard the low musical jingle of sleigh bells  theres a sleigh exclaimed gif and unless im mistaken its coming this way  they listened again and were overjoyed to note that the sounds were gradually coming nearer then they stepped out behind the boxsled and presently discerned a large twoseated sleigh drawn by a powerful pair of horses approaching  the steeds were making good time despite the roughness of the road and the depth of the snow  hi there hi there called out gif and then jack sent the rays of his flashlight toward the oncoming turnout  there were exclamations of astonishment from those in the sleigh and for a moment it looked to the boys as if the occupants were bent upon passing them without paying any attention to their call but then gif spouter and fred took a position directly in front of the oncoming horses and the driver brought them snortingly to a sudden stop  what do you fellows want demanded a heavy guttural voice from the sleigh  the words were uttered in a german accent and by the look of his face the speaker who sat on the front seat beside the driver was evidently of teutonic origin he glared suspiciously at those in the roadway and jack and gif afterward declared that they saw the gleam of a pistol in the mans hand as it was thrust in the flap of his overcoat  weve lost our way said gif coming a few steps closer we thought maybe you folks could direct us  huh i dont know about that said the man in his thick german accent where do you want to go  we want to go to cedar lodge its located somewhere up here about five or six miles from timminsport  cedar lodge said one of the men who were seated on the rear seat of the sleigh do you mean the hunting lodge that is owned by the garrisons  yes  then you are on the wrong road to get to that place said the man youll have to go back the way we came for about half a mile and then take the road to the left it is in from this road i think about a quarter of a mile  is it the first road we shall come to from here questioned gif bound to fix matters so that he could not make another mistake  yes  thank you that is all we want to know  what are you young fellows going to do at that place queried the german who was on the front seat  we came up here for a season of hunting answered jack  the place belongs to my father and my uncle explained gif my name is gifford garrison  i see well have a good time said the man on the front seat of the sleigh but he did not seem to be particularly pleased  have you a hunting lodge around here questioned fred curiously  no we are just taking a little trip to visit some friends up here answered the man on the back seat who previously had not spoken we shall stay only a day or two he added then the man on the front seat spoke to the driver and away they went once more and were soon out of sight taking the road the cadets had just been thinking of pursuing  well im mighty glad we met those men declared gif now i know where i am thank goodness we are not so very far out of the way after all  dont crow gif until you are out of the woodsor at least until we are in sight of the lodge cried andy  i didnt like the looks of those fellows declared jack  they were a bunch of germans and not very nice germans at that said fred  isnt it queer that we are running into so many germans remarked spouter first that herman crouse on the train and now these chaps  oh hurry up fellows dont stand here and gas ejaculated randy lets see if we cant find that lost lodge i want to get warmed up and i want to go to bed  then the boxsled was turned around once more and the journey to cedar lodge was resumed     chapter xiv  the first hunt   the six cadets from colby hall found the side road the germans had mentioned with ease and after that it was not long before they came to a spot which looked familiar to gif  thank fortune were on the right road at last cried the young driver of the boxsled see those peculiar trees over there he pointed to three all growing together i know those very well we ought to come in sight of the lodge now in a few minutes  well you cant get there any too quick for me declared fred as he gave a deep yawn  the way was over a small bridge which spanned the river gif had mentioned to the rover boys and then they passed through a patch of woods and to a clearing about half an acre in extent in the center of this clearing was located the lodge  it was a substantial and artistic log structure a single story in height with a broad veranda running the length of the front right at either end of the lodge was a huge cedar tree and more cedars were at the edge of the clearing behind the bungalow was a small barn and also a fairsized woodshed and close by was a small building which gif explained to them was used in the summer time for a kitchen  gif was the first out of the boxsled and he lost no time in unlocking the front door for the party jack brought his flashlight into play and they lit two lamps after filling them with oil which had been brought along  now well get the stuff in from the sled and then ill have to put the team away said gif  let me do that gif said jack just show me where they are to go then you and the others can light the fire  yes and well fix something to eat too declared randy  ill go out to the stable with jack came from spouter who was no shirker when it came to doing his share of the work  it was not a hard task to transfer the baggage and provisions as well as the guns and team was driven around to the stable where ammunition to the lodge and this done the sled was run in under a shed then jack and spouter proceeded to make mary and john at home for the night  in the meantime all of the others had gone to the woodshed and returned to the lodge with sticks of various sizes for the fire the building of this was left to gif as it was felt that he was in a certain sense the host yet all were ready to help and soon they had a big blaze roaring up the wide chimney and gradually filling the bungalow with its warmth  the arrangement of the lodge was very simple the living room occupied the center with a sort of winter kitchen and entryway behind it to each side of the living room were located two bedrooms one in the front and the other in the rear above the living room was a loft which could be reached by a rustic pair of stairs a loft which could be used only for a storeroom since it was less than five feet high in the center sloping to the eaves front and back the big chimney was in the rear of the living room and behind it in the kitchen was a stove for cooking  say this is just all right declared fred after he had warmed up a bit and taken a look around we ought to be as snug as bugs in a rug here  well have to arrange about sleeping quarters remarked gif two of the rooms have a double bed each and the other rooms have two single beds each the doors to the various rooms had been left open so that the heat from the fire might draw through the entire lodge  it was great sport for the boys to divest themselves of their heavy overcoats and caps and then get to work preparing the lodge for occupancy all of the bedclothes had to be shaken out and warmed and they also had to get out some linen which had been packed away gif assisted by andy and randy did this and meanwhile jack spouter and fred brought out the dishes and other things and set the table and also began to boil water for some hot chocolate which they had decided to have along with some smoked beef and cheese sandwiches and some doughnuts that had been brought along  soon the boys were seated around the big square table the living room contained enjoying themselves to their hearts content the steaming chocolate and the things to eat put them in the best possible humor and their troubles with bill glutts and gabe werner and also with the wildcat and on the road were for the time being forgotten outside the wind was rising making a mournful sound as it swept through the cedars and the other trees in that vicinity but inside the fire crackled merrily and the heat of the fitful flames as they roared up the chimney filled the lads with satisfaction  we sure had a tough time getting here declared randy but it was worth it  isnt this just peachy cried his twin as with a final doughnut in hand he sank deep in a rocking chair at one side of the fireplace this suits me right down to the tips of my toes  i should think it would suit anybody declared spouter why this whole surroundings has the most artistic setting i ever beheld just think of this rustic bungalow nestling away in the midst of this gigantic forest and think of this deepthroated fireplace with the flames soaring upward casting their flickering shadows hither and thither over the bright faces  of six well fed and sleepy young fellows who ought to be in bed this minute broke in jack i move we adjourn for the night and let spouter finish his oration in the morning  thats it always cutting me short when i have some beautiful sentiments to express grumbled the wouldbe orator never mind ill get square with you some day  never mind spout dont take it too hard broke in andy remember that even slipping down on a banana peel is a good deal of a skin game  to bed it is announced gif unless of course andy and fred want to remain up to wash the dishes  nothing doing yawned fred i could go to sleep sitting in this chair ill wash the dishes tomorrow morning before breakfast  it was decided that the twins should occupy one of the rooms with a double bed gif and spouter took the other double bed and fred and jack went into one of the rooms containing two single beds  well keep the fourth room for possible visitors announced gif you know glutts and werner may call on us he added quizzically  of course theyll callwhen they are invited declared jack not but what its your house gif he added quickly  theyll never come here on my invitation was the ready response  their previous experience in camping out stood the six cadets in good stead and they knew exactly how to leave their fire so that it would keep burning until morning without doing any damage then one after another they speedily shoved off to bed and soon all of them were slumbering peacefully after a long and arduous days traveling  in the morning jack was the first to arise and he was speedily followed by gif and spouter  might as well let the others sleep for a while said the oldest rover boy they were pretty well tired out fred and andy especially  sure let em sleep as long as they want to our time is our own and there is no use in hurrying just the same i bet fred wakes up pretty quick when he smells boiling coffee and pancakes  some pancake flour had been brought along and soon the appetizing odor of the cakes along with the odor of steaming coffee filled the lodge then came a call from one of the bedrooms and sure enough it was fred speaking  hi there dont you eat all those good things up before i get there he called out say this air certainly gives a fellow an appetite  by the time breakfast was ready all of the boys were dressed jack and spouter had gone outside for more wood and they reported that it had begun to snow hard  all right let it snow said randy now that we are here what do we care  well we dont want to get snowed in remarked spouter  oh i dont think the storm will be as bad as that returned gif just the same im glad we didnt get caught last night in a downfall we might have had worse luck than ever in getting here  by the time breakfast was finished it was snowing heavily there was a fairly strong wind blowing and this sent the fine particles flying in all directions when they went out to feed the horses they found the snow already an inch or more in depth  i think this is going to add quite a little to what is already on the ground said jack if it keeps on for any length of time it will make hunting rather difficult  why cant we go out and do some hunting before the storm gets too bad questioned fred now that he had reached the lodge he was exceedingly anxious to try his skill with a gun  when i was here before there was quite a rabbit run on the other side of the cedars behind this bungalow declared gif it isnt a long way off we could easily go that distance even through the snow  there wouldnt be any chance of our losing our way queried spouter  oh no its not far enough off for that  then lets go before the storm gets any worse cried andy  yes but how about the dishes to be washed asked gif  oh gif cant we do them just as soon as we get back questioned fred  last nights dishes are still standing in the kitchen declared jack looking somewhat sternly at his cousins  well get at them the minute we get back from our hunt for rabbits exclaimed fred wont we andy  thats a contract declared the funloving rover  all right then see that you keep your word answered jack remember gif no more grub for anybody until the dishes are washed  its too bad we didnt bring some wooden dishes with us remarked randy then after we had used them we could put em in the fire  lazybones called out spouter you are as bad as the tramp who said he didnt care to eat prunes because it was such a job to spit out the pits and at this there was a general smile  a little later the boys were ready for their first hunt they had discarded their overcoats for a number of hunting jackets of which the bungalow boasted and had also donned leggings and caps each looked to see that his weapon was in firstclass order and that he had a sufficient supply of ammunition  well take only the shotguns along said gif you wont find any big game in this immediate vicinity  fixing the fire so that it would keep until they returned they locked up and then started away the snow was still coming down steadily and they were glad when they reached the shelter of the woods  you dont suppose jed wallop will come here during our absence questioned jack  if he does hell know what to do answered gif he knows where the key to the bungalow is and i left a note for him in the stable stating that if he wanted to take the team away he could do so he usually keeps the horses up at his place which is about half a mile from here  forward they trudged along a narrow trail leading through the woods gif was at the front with spouter and jack close behind and the others following feeling that the rabbits might be on the alert they relapsed into silence making practically no noise as they advanced  they had covered a distance of several hundred feet when jack happening to glance overhead saw something that interested him very much a flock of wild ducks was circling about and he pointed them out to gif  i have often seen em around here whispered gif but youd have to go a long distance to get em unless you could shoot em on the wing they never settle down in the vicinity of the bungalow  some day im going to take a crack at them said jack that is if they fly low enough  presently gif slowed his pace and motioned for the others to do likewise they had come out to where there was a small clearing here all gazed around sharply trying to find some trace of the rabbit run gif had mentioned  i see one exclaimed spouter presently see him over yonder and he pointed with his hand  yes and there is another answered jack  i see four or five of them put in gif  oh say there is our chance ejaculated fred excitedly lets get busy at once and he made as if to raise his shotgun  dont fire yet cautioned jack were not close enough  come on ill show you a place where well have a good chance to get at those rabbits said gif come follow me     chapter xv  a cry for help   making as little noise as possible the other lads followed gif back into the woods and then along a snowladen trail skirting the clearing  less than two minutes walk brought the young hunters to a spot where were located a series of rough rocks and here gif motioned for his companions to halt  i think you will find the rabbits in the hollow just on the other side of these rocks he whispered now get you guns ready before you show yourselves  slowly and cautiously they mounted the rocks and then lay down in the snow on top they peered into the hollow below and presently made out the forms of at least a dozen rabbits running to and fro evidently trying to find something among the trees and bushes opposite that would be fit to eat  we might as well fire all at the same time said jack because after the first shot those bunnies will do their best to get to cover  it was quickly decided that some of the hunters should shoot at the rabbits directly ahead while others were to shoot at those to the right or to the left  it must be admitted that fred and andy were trembling with excitement and randy was also agitated the others were quite calm or else they did not allow their real feelings to show it was decided that jack should give the order to fire  all right said the oldest rover boy now take aim and when i say three shoot  there were several seconds of silence during which all of the young hunters got in readiness to shoot then while they were still aiming their weapons one of the rabbits suddenly stopped running around and sat upright directly facing them with his long ears pointed skyward  quick exclaimed jack excitedly they see us onetwothree fire  the six shotguns spoke almost as one piece and as the reports echoed across the clearing and through the woods several of the rabbits were seen to leap into the air and then fall back lifeless several others were seriously wounded and these were speedily put out of their misery by a second shot from gif and spouter  hurrah seven rabbits exclaimed fred running forward thats what i call a pretty good start  come on let us go after the others leave these where they are cried jack and plunged into the wood where he had seen several of the rabbits seeking refuge he managed to bring down one of them and randy brought down another the others got away  nine rabbits is by no means a bad haul was gifs comment after the boys had brought the dead game together  enough for a splendid potpie and then some came from spouter  do you suppose we can get any more exclaimed andy he was quite certain he had brought down one of the bunnies  we can try andy answered gif it isnt late yet and the snow isnt so deep but what it might be deeper  having divided the rabbits between them so that each lad might carry some of the game they moved forward across the little clearing and then through the woods for the best part of a quarter of a mile during that time they saw several squirrels but were unable to get a shot at the frisky animals  a squirrel is as quick as they make em declared gif youve got to act like lightning to catch em  by this time it was snowing so heavily that all concluded it would be a wise move to return to cedar lodge the wind was rising shaking the tops of the trees violently and causing a strange moaning sound through the thickets which was anything but pleasant  id hate to be caught out here all alone and in the darkness remarked randy to fred as they trudged along  would give a fellow the creeps wouldnt it was the reply  as they continued on their way they kept their eyes wide open for the possible appearance of more game but no animals showed themselves nor did they see any birds circling through the snow which seemed every moment to be coming down thicker than ever  if this snow continues and the wind keeps on rising well have a regular blizzard before morning announced gif  dont say a word about the wind panted andy who had dropped a few paces behind my nose and my ears are almost frozen  well thank goodness andy were not very far from the lodge youll soon be able to warm up  they were still deep in the woods when from a distance they heard a peculiar whistle twice repeated  thats jed wallops whistle announced gif he must have just come in  he whistled in return and presently they came out at a point where the cedars fringed the clearing in the midst of which was located the bungalow they saw jed wallop standing outside the little stable and waved their hands to him and he waved in return  thought you might have gone out huntin announced wallop when they came up had some luck too i see  nine rabbits said fred a bit proudly  good enough i guess that means some good oldfashioned rabbit stew tonight and jed wallop grinned  he had not seen gifs note and so the lads explained the situation to which the man listened with much concern  well by gum what do you know about that he ejaculated i certain did mix it when i give you them directions i might o told you about turnin to the left when it come to the road past this lodge you see i got all twisted up in my mind as soon as i heard about my cousin tim doolittle bein hurt  thats just the way i figured it jed answered gif however as we got here at last it doesnt matter  goin to have a pretty good fall o snow boys and jed wallop looked anxiously at the sky  do you think we shall be snowed in questioned randy  might beif the storm keeps up long enough but you got plenty o provisions aint you  oh weve got enough to last us for a week or ten days answered gif  then i guess youll be all right but say maybe you fellers would like me to stay here with you continued jed wallop not but wot youre big enough to take care of yourselves  well get along all right jed dont worry answered gif  then ill be atakin the team and gettin over to my own place announced the man and i wont lose no time nuther i dont want to git stuck on the road with mary and john they are a purty good team but they are apt to loose heart if the wind gits to blowin too strong agin em  how is your cousin getting along questioned jack kindly  oh hes adoin tolerable i took him over to our uncle joes you know and the women folks over there will give him the best o care  the boys assisted jed wallop to hook up the team to the boxsled and in a few minutes more the man was off with a crack of his whip which sent the team away at a fairly respectable pace  now have a good time he called back to the boys and dont shoot all the game in the state  when will you be back sang out spouter  in a few days if you want me before that time give the signal for it had been arranged that when the boys wanted jed wallop to come over from where he lived they were to shoot a gun two times twice in succession  he wont have any sweet job of it getting to his place announced fred  fortunately it isnt a great distance off answered gif if he had several miles to go i doubt if he would be able to make it  shutting up the stable and loading their arms with firewood from the shed the six cadets made their way into the lodge when they opened the door the wind rushed in causing the sparks and the ashes from the smouldering fire to fly in all directions  shut that door gif cried quickly my how that wind is rising  maybe itll blow the bungalow over remarked randy  oh i dont believe it will get as bad as all that randy said jack this looks as if it was a pretty substantial building  youre right came from gif those logs are good and heavy and they were put together by some of the best workmen around here this house wont go down unless the woods go down with it but i am mighty glad we are under shelter where we can take it comfortable  do you know what i think said fred i think we ought to bring in more of that firewood there is no telling if well be able to get any of it by morning if this snow keeps coming down  a good idea fred said jack let us go out at once and pile all the wood we can in the entryway beside the kitchen  leaving gif to stir up the fire so that the lodge might get warm once more the others hurried out to the woodshed they made four trips from that place to the entryway beside the kitchen each time bringing in all the logs they could carry  there that wood ought to last us for two or three days declared jack when the task was done  now i know what im going to do said fred as they reentered the main building  whats that queried spouter  im going to get at those dishes  so are we declared andy and randy in a breath  water was heated and it did not take long to dispose of the dirty dishes while the three boys were doing this the others cleaned up the living room of the bungalow and also straightened out their beds from time to time all gazed out of the smallpaned windows to see that the snow was coming down as thickly as ever  were in for it and no mistake said gif finally i dont think well be able to do much hunting for a day or two  well that will give us a good chance to rest declared jack i dont know but what i would just as lief take a nap after lunch that tramp in the wind after the rabbits made me sleepy  all were rather tired and as a consequence the lunch was an informal affair the boys warming up and opening a large can of pork and beans and making themselves a large pot of steaming chocolate  well have dinner tonight said gif and to this the others agreed  then they cleared the dishes away and took it easy some resting in front of the fire and others on the beds in the rooms  if it gets much colder well have to pull some of those beds out into the living room and close the doors to the bedrooms announced gif i remember we did that one time when i was up here  by five oclock the boys felt rested and then began preparations for a regular dinner several of the rabbits were cleaned and cooked and they also boiled some potatoes and onions then gif and jack prepared a pan of biscuits and a pot of tea  some day im going to take a few hours off and make some pies and cakes announced randy he had always had a great liking for desserts  yes and dont forget were going to make some candy too added his twin  in the evening the boys read some magazines they had brought along and jack and spouter played checkers before retiring they looked out of the windows to find that it was snowing and blowing just as furiously as ever  its going to be a wild night believe me announced spouter i dont believe there will be many people traveling around in this vicinity  they retired as they had done the night before and soon despite the whistling of the wind all of the lads were sound asleep  suddenly jack awakened with a start how long he had been asleep he did not know he sat up quickly for he realized that some sound from without had awakened him  help help came from outside the bungalow help let us in were freezing to death     chapter xvi  undesirable visitors   wake up fred there is somebody at the door trying to get in called out jack as the cry from outside was repeated  whats that whats the matter came sleepily from the other rover boy  from outside came a feeble kicking and pounding on the main door to the lodge two boys were calling piteously for assistance  get up everybody sang out jack as he jumped up and stuck his feet into a pair of slippers which were handy  his call and the noise from outside aroused gif and spouter as well as fred and soon the four cadets were hurrying into the living room they wore nothing but their pajamas and slippers but now each slipped hastily into his overcoat  who is it demanded gif for he had no desire to have the lodge overrun by a crowd of noisy and possibly halfdrunken lumberjacks  its usbill glutts and gabe werner was the faint reply please leave us in before we are frozen to death  werner and glutts ejaculated fred and now the continued noise brought andy and randy on the scene  what can they be doing out here this time of night demanded fred  say let us in wont you came pleadingly in gabe werners voice you dont want to let us freeze to death do you  what brought you here this time of night demanded jack  were on our way to tony duvals place answered gabe werner but the storm is so fierce we couldnt get any further our horse is completely winded  you are sure you are alone demanded gif  yes yes please let us in my nose and ears are frozen  and i dont know whether ive got any feet left or not broke in bill glutts piteously  the main door to the bungalow had not only been locked but also barred now the door was unfastened and gif with the others beside him allowed the portal to swing open a few inches  a terrible scene met their eyes the snow was piled up against the door to the depth of two feet or more and the wind was swirling the white particles in all directions so that the snow came into the living room in a perfect cloud in this mass of white stood bill glutts and gabe werner their heavy clothing covered with a ghostlike mantle behind them was a oneseated sleigh drawn by a horse that looked ready to drop from exhaustion  come in said gif briefly  no such invitation was needed for as soon as the door was opened wide enough bill glutts staggered into the living room followed by his crony a swirl of snow followed them and continued until gif and jack managed to close the door once more  gee im all in gasped glutts as he sank down on a chair close to the smouldering fire  i thought wed drop before we got you fellows up added werner you sure are some sleepers he grumbled as he too sank down on a seat  ordinarily the rovers and their chums would have treated these two bullies with scant courtesy but now glutts and werner appeared to be suffering so much from the cold that they had not the heart to find fault with their enemies  ill stir up that fire a little said gif and did so while andy and randy went out into the entryway to bring in some additional sticks of wood  we cant leave that horse out there remarked jack hell be frozen to death  well im not going out to take care of him declared gabe werner quickly i wouldnt go out in that storm again for a thousand dollars  neither would i growled glutts the nag can look after himself  thats a shameful way to treat any animal glutts declared gif but as you fellows seem to be so exhausted well look after him he continued  if you go out gif ill go with you said jack quickly but we had better slip some of our clothing right over our pajamas ill bet its as cold as greenlands icy mountains around that stable  while the newcomers continued to make themselves comfortable before the fire and spouter and fred prepared a pot of hot tea for them to drink gif and jack hurried into their clothing and then went outside  the blast that struck them as they hurried toward the exhausted horse was terrific and for the moment they thought they would have to turn back and abandon the animal but then they took another grip on themselves and finally managed to turn the horse in the direction of the stable  they saw that the sleigh was filled with provisions and other things and so managed to haul it under the shed where it would be partly protected then they placed the horse in the stable gave him a drink and likewise left some hay for him to chew on  we may not be able to get here in the morning said gif so well leave him some supper and some breakfast at the same time  i dont much like the idea of glutts and werner loading down on us in this fashion remarked jack as the pair prepared to go back to the lodge  like it exclaimed his chum i should say not but what are we going to do about it jack  oh well have to make the best of it  if this storm keeps up we may have those fellows on our hands for some days  well if they stay here that long they can pay their own way declared jack they have some provisions in that sleigh and there is no reason why we should feed them for nothing if we divide up our stuff they can divide up theirs  it wouldnt be any more than fair  where is this tony duvals place they mentioned continued the oldest rover boy  its about two miles from here off to the eastwardin fact the road on which this lodge is located ends at duvals place he is a frenchcanadian and he hasnt a very good reputation in these parts some of the old hunters used to think tony was a good deal of a thiefthat he would go around in the night or early morning and empty their traps he came from down east  what do you suppose werner and glutts are going to do there  of late years duval has made a specialty of hiring out his place to hunters there are two or three shacks on his land and he lets the various crowds have those buildings and then if the hunters want it he cooks for them for he is said to be quite a handy man with a coffeepot and a frying pan more than likely from what you heard at the moving picture theater gabe werner has a chance to use one of those shacks and has got glutts to go with him  i wonder why codfish isnt with themhe was at that restaurant in timminsport  im sure i dont know except that codfish may have got cold feet when it came to traveling up this way in such a snowstorm you know there is nothing brave about that little sneak and in this surmise gif was correct stowell had found a boarding place in the town and had said he would remain there until the storm cleared away and the others returned to get him  in the meantime glutts and werner were seated at the livingroom table drinking the hot tea which had been prepared and eating some doughnuts which fred and andy had offered the bullies had become thawed out and their usual aggressiveness was beginning to assert itself  of course we could have kept on until we got up to tonys place but what was the use on such a wild night as this when we knew this place was handy remarked werner  im afraid youre going to be snowed in with us said spouter  huh i dont know as that will be very pleasant grumbled glutts have you fellows got enough for all hands to eat he demanded eagerly  weve got some provisions answered fred cautiously we shot nine rabbits today he added proudly  nine rabbits exclaimed werner how did you do it  they must have driven the poor rabbits together in a bunch and then slaughtered them was glutts comment  we did not cried fred  im sure well get all the rabbits we want when we reach tony duvals place continued werner boastfully i believe hunting up there is much better than it is around here  and they tell me tony is one of the best guides in these parts added glutts we expect to get a deer or two and a whole lot of other game  say have you fellows got a place where we can sleep questioned the other bully looking around the living room  there is a bedroom here that is not being used answered spouter but youll have to ask gif about that this bungalow you know belongs to mr garrison and his brother  when gif and jack returned the situation was explained to them and gif said that for the balance of the night the two newcomers could occupy the bedroom which was not in use  and then well see what can be done tomorrow morning he added  of course well pay for our accommodations said werner in his most lordly manner  we dont want any pay werner declared gif but if you have to stay here very long youll have to divide your stores with us it is quite a task to get new stuff all the way from timminsport so if youve got anything in the sleigh outside it wont be any more than fair for you to divide with us  what did you do with the sleigh and the stuff  we placed it under the shed next to the stable and covered your stuff with a horse blanket the snow is sifting in there some but i dont think anything will get hurt unless of course youve got some stuff that might freeze  let it freeze grumbled glutts im not going out again now im comfortable here  as there was no love lost between the newcomers and our friends the conversation languished after this gif showed glutts and werner where they might sleep in the bedroom which had not been occupied and gave them the necessary bedding and some extra blankets then the pair shoved off without even saying goodnight and closed the door behind them  real loving and thankfuli dont think whispered randy  i dont see why those fellows were wished on us growled his twin id just as lief have a skunk in the place as to have either of that pair  well we couldnt leave them out in the storm to perish answered jack in a low tone so well have to make the best of it  just the same whispered fred im going to keep my eyes and ears wide open while they are here     chapter xvii  new years day in camp   when randy and andy retired it was a long while before the merry twins could get to sleep again  we ought to play some good joke on them was the way andy expressed it something they would remember  id do it in a minute andy if it wasnt that they are so worn out responded his twin but i dont think jack and fred would like it at all if we disturbed em and besides you must remember that while we are here were gifs guests  gif and jack were the first to get up in the morning and they had the fire revived and breakfast underway before any of the others showed themselves  where are glutts and werner questioned spouter when he appeared  they havent showed themselves yet spouter answered jack might as well let them sleep as long as they want to they cant leave here in such a storm as this  the snow was still coming down and the wind was blowing almost as fiercely as it had during the early part of the night gazing through the windows the cadets saw that all of the cedars were bent down with the weight of the fine white crystals the snow had swept up along one side of the little barn until there was an unbroken line reaching up to the very top  well i never ejaculated jack turning around suddenly to his chums happy new year everybody  happy new year came from the others including fred and the twins who had just got up  gosh i forgot all about its being new years exclaimed fred  this looks like a real new years day and no mistake remarked randy look outside isnt it just like a picture on a new years card  it is assuredly a spectacle to fill one with awe and reverence came from spouter just gaze upon that magnificent stretch of snowy mantle and those tall cedars bending low before the wintry blasts can you imagine what this must be in the solemn depth of the mighty forest where not a footfall is heard nor a  jack rabbit can get as much as a turnip to eat finished randy gayly spouter if you are going to orate why dont you stand on the table when you turn on the spigot  let us have a regular new years dinner cried gif and then spouter can do the speechmaking  while we do the eating finished randy say spout how about it  nothing doing was the prompt reply i want my share of the eats every time  well make a regular rabbit potpie to take the place of turkey announced gif  and for dessert how about that canned plum pudding we brought along queried fred  great thought fred answered randy and we can have some of those nuts too and tonight well try our hand at some candy making  one thing you fellows are forgetting remarked gif and that is that we have werner and glutts with us theyll certainly want their share of the good things  what plum pudding and all questioned fred with a gloomy look settling over his face  we cant deny them anything that we have ourselves fred replied jack  i dont think glutts or werner deserve it exclaimed randy i think as soon as this storm clears away they ought to be sent about their business it isnt so very far to that tony duvals place and with their horse and sleigh they ought to be able to make it somehow  randy had scarcely finished speaking when the door to the bedroom the two bullies occupied was flung open and werner strode into the living room  fine way you have of talking about us rover he said with a sour look on his face we didnt come here because we wanted to we came because it was necessary  and we said we would pay for whatever we had to eat or drink added glutts who had followed his crony  i told you before that you wouldnt have to pay a cent broke in gif just the same glutts we might as well come to an understanding you know as well as i do that there is no love lost between you fellows and our crowd you are welcome to stay here and have your dinner and if you think you cant get out today you can stay here for supper and sleep here again tonight by that time i think the storm will have cleared away and you will be able to get over to tonys place without trouble  you can take it from me we wont stay here an hour longer than we have to declared werner and then he turned back into the bedroom to finish his dressing closing the door behind him  the presence of the two bullies put a good deal of a damper on our friends and as a consequence the breakfast was rather a silent one then gif suggested that glutts and werner go out and look after their horse and this they agreed to do  if you wont take any pay well stand for our share of the grub announced werner just before he went out weve got some goods in the sleigh as you know what shall i bring in  bring in whatever you think is fair said gif after a few whispered words to jack and spouter  the two bullies were gone the best part of an hour and during that time the rovers and their chums cleaned several of the rabbits and also got ready some potatoes and turnips for dinner  that will give us quite a meal along with the dried lima beans that i put to soak last night said gif of course well have the plum pudding well steamed as fred suggested  and well make a pan of biscuits too added spouter gee by the time we get through up here fellows well be able to get jobs as chefs in some of the firstclass new york hotels  when glutts and werner returned they carried two packages which they threw on the livingroom table  there are some dried apricots and a package of rice said werner they ought to help out for a new years dinner  very well well cook what we need for the meal werner said gif briefly and the rest you can take with you  gif and spouter made a small rice pudding and also stewed some of the apricots all told the new years dinner proved to be quite a bountiful affair and after all of the lads had eaten their fill it must be confessed that everybody felt in better humor the plum pudding especially came in for a large share of their attention as well as did the nuts and the small amount of raisins which followed  i think well go and take a nap announced werner presently i didnt get very much sleep last night  and ill do the same added glutts  what about washing those dishes remarked fred with a significant look at the two bullies  thats right glutts and werner cried jack you ought to be willing to do your share of the dishwashing  me wash dishes roared bill glutts i never did anything like that in my life  you washed your own dishes at the encampment answered spouter sharply  oh well that was different  oh dont gas grumbled werner well wash our own dishes anyway and he went to work without another word although with very bad grace and presently glutts followed him  gif and the other boys also took hold so the dishwashing and the pot cleaning did not take very long  the majority of the boys felt sleepy so the rest of the day was spent in taking it easy or in reading then toward night they had a light supper and fred and the twins started to make some homemade candy  by this time the storm had cleared away no more snow was coming down and the wind had also ceased overhead the stars glittered like so many diamonds  it will be a great day tomorrow announced gif  perhaps we can get out and get on the track of a deer cried fred  say fred you must think the deer in this vicinity are standing around just waiting to be shot came from jack with a smile  i dont care jack im going to get a crack at something worth while before i go home announced the youngest rover  declining to partake of the taffy and the nut candy the twins and fred had made glutts and werner retired early  well be going in the morning if the storm will permit it said werner to gif and then he added curtly much obliged for taking us in  dont mention it werner answered gif just as briefly  remember well pay you if youll tell us how much it is added glutts  you cant pay me anything glutts  just as you say  then the door to the bedroom was closed as before and gif and his chums were left to themselves  some new years day believe me was freds whispered comment the presence of those fellows is about as cheering as a funeral  randy and andy had their heads close together and were whispering presently randy got up and stretched himself  now that it has stopped snowing i am going to go out and get a little fresh air in my lungs he remarked  and im going along responded his twin quickly  so am i broke in fred  and that means we can wash the dishes said jack all right there are only a handful anyway go ahead only dont walk too far and get lost  the three lads were soon outside ploughing around through the deep snow then randy caught fred by the arm  come on down to the stable he said andy and i have a little something up our sleeves  just what i thought chuckled fred i bet youre planning to play some trick on glutts and werner  can you blame us demanded andy  certainly not im with you what do you propose to do  we want to find out first what those fellows are carrying in the way of provisions quite something i imagine  reaching the stable the three rovers passed around one corner to where was located the shed here they found the sleigh and its contents just as it had been left by glutts and werner when they had procured the rice and the apricots randy carried a flashlight and this was turned on so they might see what was stored there  a pretty complete lot of stuff was randys comment after they had looked over the various bundles and packages each one of which was marked  here is a bag of sugar and another bag of salt announced andy i think the flavor of each will be vastly improved by mixing them up a bit and he grinned  and heres a bottle of vinegar and two bottles of catsup and maple syrup came from randy i think a little mixing up here will help matters also  say dont go too far cried fred in alarm  too far exclaimed randy you couldnt go too far with gabe werner and bill glutts just remember what they did to us at colby hall and at the encampment both of those fellows are nothing but rascals they didnt deserve to be taken in  after that fred joined the twins in doctoring up the provisions as andy expressed it the three had quite some fun doing this and all returned to the bungalow grinning broadly  there will be something doing when they start to use those stores chuckled andy my wont glutts and werner be mad  they wont know we did it returned his twin  they wont know it answered fred but theyll take it for granted nevertheless ill tell you fellows i dont know about this he added dubiously  oh dont worry answered andy gayly gabe werner and bill glutts deserve all that they are getting and more too     chapter xviii  fishing through the ice   with nothing of importance to do and nobody to awaken them the rover boys and their chums slept late the next morning gif was the first to get up and seeing that the others were still asleep he made as little noise as possible when he went out into the livingroom to stir up the smouldering fire and place upon it a couple of extra logs  hello gif up already came from spouter when the other cadet came back to finish his dressing what sort of a day is it  clear as crystal spouter it couldnt be better  then perhaps well get a chance to go out hunting  perhaps gif looked doubtful for a moment i dont know that i care to leave this place until glutts and werner have gone  i dont blame you gif it would be just like those mean chaps to try to do some damage before they left they are not the kind to appreciate in the least what we have done for them  hardlyafter the way they kicked up about washing a few dishes it made me sick  gif and spouter began preparations for breakfast and while they were at this the four rovers appeared one after another the door to the room turned over to glutts and werner remained closed  those fellows are certainly putting in some sleep was jacks comment  shall i wake em up questioned fred quickly  no let them take their own time answered gif with such fine weather they ought to have no trouble in getting away and there is no use of another row before they start  the lads prepared a generous breakfast of pancakes and some sausage meat that had been brought along from timminsport washed down with a copious supply of hot coffee as they ate they cast sundry glances at the closed bedroom door but saw no sign of glutts or werner  gee they must be sleeping like rocks was andys comment  youd think the smell of the pancakes and sausage would wake em up on such a cold morning as this added his twin my but its good  perhaps they thought they wouldnt bother us about breakfast and take it out in sleep instead suggested fred  say did any of you fellows get up during the night to get something to eatcrackers or cheese or anything like that questioned gif quickly  all of the others shook their heads  what makes you ask that question gif remarked jack  why i saw a lot of crumbs scattered over the kitchen table and on the floor  maybe glutts and werner got up to get something began fred and then a sudden idea came into his mind and he gave a start gee what would you say if they were gone  gone echoed the others  maybe theyre not in that room at all added jack  ill soon find out answered gif and leaving the breakfast table he went over and tried the bedroom door it was unlocked and he opened it and went inside  theyre gone all right enough he called out and immediately the others followed him into the room here they found the beds mussed up and empty all of the things belonging to glutts and werner were gone and the single window of the room was wide open  thats a fine way to leave i must say grumbled gif  yes and to leave this window wide open so the room can get as cold as a barn added spouter as he pulled down the sash some mean fellows believe me  lets see if the horse and sleigh are gone too cried randy  in a few minutes he and fred were ready to go out and they lost no time in hurrying down to the barn and the shed sure enough the horse and sleigh were gone and the barn door had been left wide open  i wonder when they went remarked fred  most likely as soon as it was daylight they probably had this all fixed last night thats why they went to bed early  well it doesnt hurt my feelings to have them missing  id like to know if they took any of our things with them  the two rovers returned to the lodge and there told of what they had discovered a search around the lodge was immediately instituted the boys looking over their clothing and firearms and then their stores and the regular belongings of the bungalow  as far as i can make out there is only one flannel blanket from the bed missing said gif i suppose they took that along to keep warm on the ride they didnt have but one small robe in the sleigh  i dont know about these stores announced spouter who had been going over them carefully it seems to me we had more canned stuff than thissome green corn and asparagus and also some canned salmon and sardines  i wouldnt put it past em to take anything they thought they needed declared fred they are just that sort and everybody here knows it  all i can say is good riddance to bad rubbish said randy  and may we fail to see em again while were in this vicinity added his twin  my but its a real relief to have them gone announced jack now we can do as we please and have the best times ever and his face showed his pleasure  everybody felt glad to think the two bullies were gone and soon they were chatting gayly then after the breakfast dishes had been put away all went outside and there indulged in a snowball fight which lasted the best part of the morning  after such a glorious time in the open all the cadets ought to have felt in the best of spirits but it was observed by jack at dinner time that fred and the twins looked rather preoccupied they were whispering together and presently randy spoke  i and andy and fred have been thinking that perhaps it would be best for us to let you other fellows know how matters stand said he maybe you wont approve of what we did just the same we think glutts and werner deserve it and thereupon he and the others related what had been done the evening before down at the shed all of the others had to grin at the recital yet jack and gif shook their heads  i dont blame you said the oldest rover boy just the same it may lead to more trouble  if they find out that you did it theyll probably come here and try to pay us back was gifs comment  let them come announced spouter i guess we can hold our own against them i am glad we did something for them to remember us by especially if they walked off with some of our stuff  that afternoon the boys went hunting again but on account of the heavy fall of snow did not go any great distance they managed however to get two more rabbits and also two squirrels and two quail  well thats something anyhow declared fred who had laid one of the squirrels low a bird and squirrel potpie wont go bad for a change  righto cried andy  say gif whats the matter with trying our hand at fishing through the ice questioned jack the deep snow ought not to interfere with that sport  just as you say we can go down to the river tomorrow if the crowd is willing  the day passed without their seeing or hearing any more of werner and glutts nor did anyone come to disturb them through the night once andy awoke to hear a noise at a distance but he soon figured out that this was nothing more than a hoot owl  ten oclock of the next day found them on the river bank they had brought their fishing tackle with them and also an axe with which to chop some holes through the ice  pretty thick im thinking announced jack as they came out on the ice well have our own troubles making holes  how foolish we were not to bring our skates along cried randy we could have a dandy skate their skates had been left up at the lodge  never mind well skate some other time said spouter were out for some fish today  it took over half an hour to knock several fairsized holes through the ice and then the boys began their fishing following directions that had been given to gif by some of the older hunters  if i catch a whale i dont see how im going to bring him up through this hole remarked andy with a grin  oh thats easy returned his brother gayly all youll have to do will be to jump in and push him up through the hole where i can get hold of him  thank you you can do the jumping in yourself this water is about twenty degrees below cicero  i was thinking that we could enlarge one of the holes and keep it open said jack with a serious look on his face then all you fellows can come down here every morning and take a dip at present they were obtaining water from a deep well directly outside of the kitchen  they fished for a long time without getting even a nibble but then jack felt a gentle tug and after some little excitement managed to bring out a fairsized catch  hurrah the first fish he cried holding it up proudly  and may he be the forerunner of many more proclaimed spouter  i want a whale declared randy  such a catch was an incentive to all of the others to do their best and as a result inside of three hours the lads had eleven fish between them some of fair size and others quite small one in fact so tiny that it was thrown back into the stream so it might grow a little as fred expressed it  one oclock announced gif looking at his watch i think we had better go back to the lodge and have some of these fish fried for dinner  second the commotion cried randy quickly  properly fried the freshlycaught fish proved delicious eating and the boys lingered over the repast while a scrap of those which had been served was left half of the catch was packed away in snow to be served at another time  the day had just come to an end when the boys heard a jingle of sleighbells on the road and then came a whistle  its jed wallop announced gif  yes and hes coming from the direction of timminsport cried fred he must have been down to the town  look hes holding up some letters ejaculated jack letters  letters letters was the general cry and then the whole crowd of cadets rushed down to meet the old hunter     chapter xix  letters from home   while gif was sorting out the mail which included not only letters but also several packages which had been sent by parcel post jack and spouter told the old hunter about the coming of the two bullies to the lodge and how they had sneaked away at daybreak  accordin to that them fellers cant be very good friends o yourn remarked the old hunter dryly  they are our enemies answered spouter they did all sorts of mean things at colby hall and when they were found out werner got so scared that he ran away and never came back  i guess their folks ought to take em in hand if they dont theyll be sorry fer it later on said wallop but i must be gittin on now fer ive got to git ready tonight fer a big days work tomorrow  some day we want you to come down here and go out hunting with us said jack cant you show us where we can get a chance at a deer or something else that is worth while  wots the matter with stirrin up a bear replied the old hunter with a grin his eyes twinkling  that would suit me to a t exclaimed randy  trot out your bears and well polish em off added his twin  not many bears round here announced jed wallop but you might strike something jest as bad especially if the snow keeps on gittin deeper the wolves in this neighborhood git mighty pestiferous when they cant git nothin to eat  wolves exclaimed fred gee i dont know that i want to run up against a savage wolf  after promising to come down and see them during the following week jed wallop drove off leaving the boys to return to the lodge and look over their letters and parcel post packages  here is a letter from mother and it encloses a letter from dad cried jack as he glanced over the epistle  ive got a letter from mary said fred and here is one from may powell too  who is your second letter from jack queried spouter  oh never you mind about that  looks as if it might be in ruth stevensons handwriting said andy with a grin  there were letters for everybody two of the packages were from the rover boys homes and the third had been sent to spouter by his mother  a fruit cake exclaimed fred as he opened the package addressed to him ill tell you it takes my mother to remember what us fellows like and he smacked his lips  the other package addressed to andy and randy contained a box of homemade sugar cookies while that which spouter had received contained a long loaf of ginger cake and a box of hard candies  well one thing is surethey havent forgotten us was spouters remark as he passed the candies around  all the boys were anxious to read their letters and for the time being everything else was forgotten mrs dick rover wrote that nothing of importance had happened at home since they had gone away ruth stevenson and may powell were still with them but all of the girls expected to go to the stevenson homestead to finish their school vacation  the letter from dick rover had been sent from the battlefront in france in it he related how he and his brothers as well as some of their old school chums had been in a number of small engagements in one of these tom and sam rover had been slightly wounded by the fragments from a shell and he himself had been in a gas attack but had escaped without serious injury all had been sent to the field hospital to be treated but now they were once more at the front in what were called their winter quarters                                       the boches are watching us like a cat watches a mouse and we are equally on the alert wrote dick rover there have been no big battles but sniping is going on constantly and several of our men have been killed or wounded we are all anxious to have the cold weather break up so that we can go forward and finish this war we feel that we can wallop the enemy if only we have a chance to get at them                                       thats dad all right murmured jack admiringly he had read the letter aloud for the benefit of the others  oh dear i hope dad wasnt seriously hurt murmured fred  i think if our fathers were very badly hurt uncle dick would let us know answered randy he isnt one to hold back newshe knows we want the truth  if only this war was over remarked andy and now there was little of his usual lightheartedness in his tone i wont feel at ease until our soldiers are bound for home  the six cadets talked over the letters they had received for some time they had brought stationery with them and they spent the evening writing letters in return  i dont see how were going to get these down to timminsport unless we walk down there remarked jack and a walk of five or six miles through this snow each way wouldnt be an easy job  i know what we can do replied gif we can skate down the river to a place called henryville there is a postoffice there and letters are sent over to timminsport at least once a day  how far is it to henryville questioned randy  oh not more than three miles  do you suppose the skating is any good  i dont see why it shouldnt be  lets do it broke in spouter we wanted to have a skate anyway we can take our guns along in case we see any game and so it was arranged  the next day dawned bright and clear and after breakfast the boys got their letters and their skates and started for the river  ill wager well find the ice covered with snow in some places remarked randy  i dont know about that answered gif i was hoping the high wind had swept it pretty clean  they were soon on the ice their skates ringing merrily as they struck out into an impromptu race they swept down the river and around a broad bend and were soon well out of sight of the tract of forest land upon which the lodge was located  i hope glutts and werner dont visit the bungalow during our absence remarked spouter  well thats a risk weve got to run answered jack we cant remain at home all the time  exactly so put in gif and it would be no fun for some of us to stay behind on guard while the others were off enjoying themselves  for the most part they found the river swept clear of snow although here and there were drifts more or less deep over which they had to plough their way as best they could this however was nothing but fun for the lads and nobody complained  arriving at henryville they found that the mail for timminsport would go out in less than an hour and also learned that the mail from that place came in twice daily morning and evening  lets have all our mail readdressed from timminsport to henryville suggested fred then we can come down here on our skates any time we feel like it and get it and this was done  they found a fairly good general store at henryville and made a few purchases of such things as they thought they could use to advantage during their outing they were about to start up the river again when jacks attention was attracted to a large sleigh drawn by a pair of powerful horses the sleigh was driven by a man who looked as if he might be a german and on the back seat wedged in by a number of packages were two other germanlooking individuals  one of those men on the back seat is that herman crouse the fellow we rescued from the burning car said jack to the others  yes and that driver and the other man are two of the fellows we met on the road when we were trying to locate the lodge added randy  its queer that that herman crouse should be up here said fred  oh i dont know he said he worked a small farm somewhere in this vicinity  i thought it was down near enwood remarked spouter  one thing certaini dont like the looks of those other germans came from gif they look like mighty suspicious characters to me  even had the boys wished to do so they got no opportunity to speak to the man they had rescued from the burning railroad car the sleigh had stopped at a house in henryville and now it passed on around a corner of the road and was soon lost to sight in the woods  now that they knew their letters were on the way the cadets were in no hurry to get back to the lodge they had brought along a few sandwiches and now purchased some fresh doughnuts in case they stayed away from the lodge during the lunch hour  lets take our time and skate up one or two branches of this river suggested gif it will be easier than walking and we may have a chance at some game  all were willing and it was suggested that gif led the way which he did they left the main stream and started up a smaller watercourse leading directly into the forest  i just saw a rabbit exclaimed randy presently there he is now and raising his gun he fired quickly but his aim was not good and the bunny hopped behind a tree and out of sight  too bad you had to take a shot for nothing remarked fred that may put the other game in this vicinity on the alert  soon they came to a point where skating was not so easy at first they thought to go back but then it was suggested that they tramp along the frozenup watercourse on foot  i was thinking we might run across some brook mink up here said gif or some ducks  oh id like to get a mink or a duck if there are any in this vicinity answered jack  on they tramped until a good quarter of a mile had been covered then they caught sight of several rabbits and brought down two of them later still they saw a squirrel but though spouter shot at the frisky creature it managed to elude him  well we cant expect to bag everything we shoot at consoled jack  i think i know of a short cut from here to the lodge said gif so if you would rather tramp through the woods than go back by way of the river we might do so and get a chance at some other game  all right gif lead the way said jack and they went forward under gifs guidance  they were deep in the forest when they heard a whir overhead they looked up quickly to see a number of partridges sailing past close to the tree tops  quick yelled jack and blazed away while all of the others did the same     chapter xx  lost in the woods   there was no time wasted in shooting at the partridges which were flying along so close to the tree tops the six cadets did their best but four of the charges went wild the aim of jack and gif was effective and one wounded partridge came fluttering down to the snow while another dropped dead on the branches of a nearby cedar  hurrah weve got two of them anyhow cried gif as he reached forward and quickly put the wounded bird out of its misery  weve got two provided we can reach that one up in the tree answered jack im afraid its going to be some climb to get it down  thats so said randy  oh i can get up there in no time cried andy gayly here take my gun and with his usual agility he was soon mounting the branches of the big tree taking particular delight in shaking down great masses of loose snow on the heads of those below  as is usual with cedars the branches were close together and andy soon found he would have his own troubles in reaching the point where the dead partridge rested however he kept on worming his way upward as best he could until he was within a few feet of the prize  some climb believe me he called out to those below this tree is almost as closegrown as a cedar bush  up went andy and presently managed to get hold of the dead partridge and drew the game toward him just as he did this he heard a peculiar sound a few feet below him on the other side of the tree  hello is somebody following me he questioned looking down to see what the movement among the branches below meant  there was no reply to his question and andy came to the conclusion that the branches must have become crossed in some way and then loosened themselves he continued his descent but just as he reached a branch two feet further down a peculiar cry came to his alert ears a cry not unlike that of an angry cat  hello something is up in this tree that is sure he told himself  he listened and then heard another cry this time less than two yards below him coming from one of the larger branches of the big cedar at once he sent up a shout  whats wanted questioned his twin why dont you hurry up down so we can do some more hunting  there is some wild animal in this tree answered andy i dont know what it is but it sounds like a wildcat  a wildcat burst out several of the others  and andy hasnt any gun cried gif come on let us see if we cant shoot the thing  go slow there cautioned jack let us see if we cant locate it and find out what it is first we dont want it to attack andy while he is unarmed  are you in any danger andy called out fred  where is the cator whatever it is asked randy  its just below me somewhere i cant see it but i can hear it plainly enough its moving around in those lower branches i guess i had better stay up here for a while and as he spoke andy mounted to a higher limb with no weapon handy he had no desire to face any wild animal  those below slowly circled the big cedar keeping their eyes on the alert for a view of whatever might be prowling around among the branches they had their guns ready for use but realized that they must fire with great caution or otherwise they might hit the lad who was in peril  i suppose the wildcat or whatever it is was up in the tree and didnt know what to do when andy started to come up the beast knew we were down here or otherwise it would probably have jumped down and run off  squirrels dont cry like a cat and i heard that beast just cry said jack all squirrels do is to chatter  theres another danger said gif if we come too close to that tree well probably drive the wildcat or whatever it is up to where andy is  heres the bird shouted andy from above and threw the partridge down and away from the tree  jack and andys twin took a few steps closer to the big cedar at the same time holding their guns ready for instant use they peered upward among the snowladen branches and presently caught sight of a slinking form resting in a crotch of the tree  there it is exclaimed randy and was on the point of firing when the wildcatfor such it had proved to bedropped out of sight and leaped to a branch on the other side of the tree trunk  hi there dont drive that beast up here called out andy  andy called back his twin suddenly werent you carrying that flashlight  no i left it at the lodge i didnt think i would want it on the trip to henryville  ive got my flashlight remarked gif here it is and he brought it forth  the light was flashed up into the tree and around from branch to branch as the rays traveled through the cedar there was a sudden wild cry from the animal and then came a swish and a whirr as the wildcat sprang to the outer end of a limb and then down into the snow  bang bang bang went the guns in the hands of gif randy and spouter but whether they hit the wildcat or not they could not tell there was a whirl in the snow and then in a twinkling the beast had disappeared into the forest behind them  well its gone anyhow declared jack in a tone of great relief you can come down andy  andy was soon out of the tree and having picked up the two partridges the six young hunters continued on their way as they supposed in the direction of cedar lodge  presently they came to another clearing and on the far side of this noted some animals hopping about which they felt certain must be rabbits  lets go over there cried fred excitedly maybe we can make a good haul  its a pretty good tramp around to the other side of this clearing remarked gif and it looks to me as if it might begin to snow again he added with a glance at the sky which was now heavily overcast  but all of the others wanted a chance to get more game so in the end the six cadets tramped around one edge of the clearing until they reached a point close to the spot where the rabbits had been seen here the bunnies were out in force trying to find something to eat and they had but little difficulty in bagging four of the creatures  well thats not so bad but what it might be worse announced jack  we should have had more than four grumbled randy there were at least fifteen or sixteen rabbits to be seen he had missed what he had thought to be a comparatively easy shot  well we cant have everything declared spouter philosophically  they trudged on once more gif as before taking the lead but presently the tall cadet called a halt  whats the matter now questioned randy see any more game ahead  no gif was staring around first to the right and then to the left hang it if i know whether we are on the right trail or not  do you mean to say gif you dont know in what direction the lodge is located questioned spouter quickly  i think its off in that direction spouter was the reply and gif pointed with his hand but im not dead sure of it circling that clearing threw me off the track  well were you sure of the trail before we came over here questioned jack if you were we can go back you know even though it is quite a tramp  i thought i was sure jack but now im not sure of anything answered gif helplessly someway or other i seem to be completely turned around  gee then were in a pretty pickle groaned fred who was beginning to grow tired of tramping through the snow  if we could only get down to the river again wed be all right came from randy  i wonder if i could locate the lodge from the top of one of these trees remarked jack it would be quite a climb to get such a view but it would be better than tramping around without knowing where one was going  ill do the climbing answered gif quickly i got you fellows into this mess and its up to me to get you out  oh dont think im complaining returned spouter quickly  none of us is complaining gif we all know its the easiest thing in the world to get lost in a big woods like thisespecially when there is snow on the ground to cover up the landmarks  a tall pine was selected and the others boosted gif upward as far as they could then he mounted from branch to branch and the others waited below as patiently as possible for what he might have to report in the meantime a few flakes of snow came drifting downward and soon it was snowing steadily  well what can you see called out jack after those below had waited quite a while for their chum to make a report  i cant see very much on account of the snow coming down announced gif i can see the edge of a clearing that might be the one where cedar lodge is located but i am not certain of it  well take another good look advised spouter wish we had field glasses he added  it was a full fifteen minutes before gif rejoined the others he had located but one place that looked like the clearing surrounding the lodge but as he had said before he was by no means certain that this was the right location  well we might as well try it anyway announced jack we cant stay here all night  illustration bang bang bang went the guns in the hands of gif randy and spouter  its too bad it began to snow so heavily just as i was climbing the tree remarked gif if it hadnt been for that i might have gotten quite a view and maybe located the bungalow without difficulty however this may prove to be the right trail after all come on before it gets dark  wish i had something more to eat remarked andy the few sandwiches and doughnuts they had brought along had long since been eaten  as they walked on the way seemed to grow more difficult they soon found themselves at a point where there were a series of rocks backed up by lowhanging bushes thickly covered with snow there was no wind but the snow was now coming down more thickly than ever  gee it looks to me as if we were lost remarked fred  all gazed around them but saw little to give them satisfaction behind them lay the thick forest and in front of them the rocks and bushes it was now growing dark and this added to their uneasiness  well what shall we do next questioned gif  nobody answered that question they were undoubtedly lost and what was to be done about it was a serious problem     chapter xxi  a night under the cliff   one thing is sure said jack presently we cant stand out here in this snowstorm all night  lets go on at least a short distance further broke in spouter  maybe well come to some sort of trail that gif will recognize put in randy  im getting dead tired i cant tramp more than a mile or two further said fred  i dont believe any of us care to go any such distance as that fred returned jack kindly here give me your gun ill carry it for you for it was plainly to be seen the youngest rover was becoming exhausted  all were tired out from their skate and their tramp and climbing among the rough rocks covered with snow was by no means easy  soon they reached another line of rocks this time much higher than those they had been crossing at one end of the rocks was a small cliff at the top of this several cedars had once stood but the winds of the winter before had blown them over so that while the roots were still imbedded in the cliff the tops rested in the snow below  great salt mackerel cried gif in dismay well now i have spilled the beans  whats up now questioned randy quickly  i heard my uncle tell about this place he visited it just after those trees fell over he said the spot was about three miles from the lodge  at this there was a groan from the twins and fred  we cant walk that distance in this snowstorm said the latter decidedly  not over those rough rocks anyway added randy i feel as if my ankles were getting twisted out of shape  do you know in what direction the lodge is from here questioned spouter  i do not except that you have to be on the top of the cliff to get to it we were evidently headed the right way although we must have walked in a big semicircle since we left the river  im going to climb to the top of the cliff and have a look around declared jack here take these guns and the game  it was no easy matter to mount to the top of the cliff which at this point was at least fifteen feet over their heads but jack finally made it and was followed by spouter and gif  here however the view was no better than from belowthe thickly falling snow hiding the landscape on every side night was coming on and it was growing colder and the boys could not help but shiver  i guess the best thing we can do it to try to make ourselves comfortable for the night remarked jack  how can we make ourselves comfortable without anything to eat questioned spouter  weve got the game we can start a fire and cook some of that  and besides you must remember we have the things we bought at henryville said gif  the three rejoined the others and the question of what to do was put to the younger rovers fred and andy declared they could not tramp much further and at once agreed that it would be best to try to make themselves comfortable for the night  it looks as if there might be some kind of shelter under those fallen cedars said randy hanging down from the top of the cliff they form a sort of leanto  i was thinking of that said jack let us get under them and investigate  beware of more wildcats cautioned andy  well use my flashlight said gif  this was done he and several of the others investigated the spot under the fallen cedars with care no trace of any wild animal not even a rabbit or a squirrel was found then the boys began to size up the situation trying to determine how they could make themselves at home there for the night  first of all i think we had better build a fire suggested gif then after we have warmed up and rested a bit we can prepare supper  with so much wood at hand it was an easy matter to start a campfire this was placed at one side of the opening under the fallen cedars the boys taking care that the flames should not reach the trees with their hatchet they cut off some of the cedar boughs and scattered these over the ground for a flooring the driest they placed to one side to use for bedding later  fortunately while at henryville they had purchased a fairsized box of cocoa this box was of tin and jack suggested that they dump the cocoa out on a sheet of paper which he had in his pocket and then use the tin for a pot in which to boil water  it wont make a very large cocoa pot but it will be better than nothing and we can fill it as many times as we please  the boys had several collapsible drinking cups with them and these they would take turns in using  im mighty glad we bought that cheese remarked spouter that will help out quite a little for they carried a piece weighing almost two pounds  of the other things purchased at henryville only a box of fancy crackers could be used there were two dozen all told and these were divided by randy four crackers to each cadet  well clean a couple of the rabbits and see what we can do about broiling them over the flames said gif now you fellows can show what you can do he added with a grin its all well enough to work when youve got the tools to work with but quite another story when youve got next to nothing  water was obtained by melting a quantity of the snow and soon they had the first can of hot cocoa ready in the meanwhile several of the lads were broiling the rabbits as best they could  i know how im going to heat the next can of water declared andy im going to do as the indians diddrop a clean redhot stone into it and this he did later on and got his boiling water in short order  it was not a very satisfactory meal but the lads had fun eating it and they did not complain when they found portions of the broiled rabbits slightly burnt and found that four fancy crackers with cheese each did not take the place of a big pan of biscuits or a goodsized loaf of bread  one thing is in our favor anyhow said fred with a sigh of satisfaction after they had finished their scant meal we wont have to wash the dishes  the can was dried over the fire the cocoa was replaced and then the lads proceeded to make themselves comfortable for the night they missed their blankets and it was therefore decided that they should take turns in sitting up and guarding the fire so that all might keep warm without running the danger of setting fire to the cedars under which they were resting  it proved to be a long and wearisome night for most of them the resting places were anything but soft and a fitful wind often blew the smoke of the campfire toward the wouldbe sleepers causing them to cough and shift their positions but neither man nor beast came to disturb them for which they were thankful  going to bother about breakfast questioned jack as he sat up and saw that gif and spouter were already stirring  i dont think so was the answer if you fellows are willing well strike right out for the lodge we can get a better meal there  the others agreed and almost before daylight they were on their way again they climbed to the top of the cliff and after moving around cautiously for several hundred feet reached a well defined trail running in the direction gif thought they ought to take  the storm had cleared away and soon the sun came peeping over the treetops  gee i wont do a thing to a good hot breakfast when we reach the lodge remarked randy to his twin  ill be with you returned andy a big heaping plate of pancakes with maple syrup for me flanked by a couple of goodsized sausage cakes and washed down with a big cup of that cocoa  say andy you make me hungry clean down to my shoes burst out fred  i think well all be able to eat a good breakfast by the time we get there announced gif  are you sure you are on the right trail gif questioned spouter anxiously  yes i know where i am now its queer how i got mixed up before  how much further questioned jack  about half a mile  they crossed another small clearing and on the edge of this caught sight of several more rabbits jack and randy fired simultaneously and were lucky to bring down two of the bunnies  they will help out the larder just so much more announced gif after they had tried for several minutes to stir up more of the rabbits but without success  i wish we could get a chance at some other kind of game remarked jack  presently they caught sight of cedar lodge at a distance and then all hurried their pace  looks mighty good to a fellow after hes been away all night declared spouter  look look burst out gif what can that mean every window and every door of the lodge is wide open  sure as youre born gif is right ejaculated fred something is wrong thats sure  all set off on a run to ascertain as quickly as possible what had occurred at the lodge during their absence gif was the first to enter the place but he was quickly followed by the others  gee what do you know about this ejaculated andy  this is the work of our enemies murmured jack  the doors and windows had evidently been open for some time for the lodge was bitter cold inside and not a little snow had drifted in through the openings the wind had likewise entered blowing the ashes of the dead fire in all directions  ill bet glutts and werner did this cried spouter  just what i think answered jack     chapter xxii  at tony duvals camp   the six cadets lost no time in making a thorough examination of the lodge in the bedrooms they found everything topsyturvy the bed clothes having been hauled near the windows where the incoming snow might fall upon them in the kitchen they found many of their cooking utensils in the sink and over them had been poured a mixture of flour catsup maple syrup and condensed milk in the storeroom many other things were upset and not a few of the supplies appeared to be missing  this is certainly the worst yet groaned fred as he looked at the mussedup and ruined food  i said glutts and werner would get back at you for meddling with their supplies remarked jack sharply they have certainly paid us back with interest  i wish we had those two fellows here now id hammer them good and proper declared randy just the same i suppose this is our fault and im mighty sorry for it he added looking at jack gif and spouter  they either took a large share of our supplies away or else hid them said gif after another look around my what a mess they did make  well as we are largely responsible for this its up to us to take hold and clean up the best we can announced randy to his twin and fred  right you are answered andy come ahead well clean up the livingroom first and get a fresh fire started  all right you fellows do that and well tackle the bedrooms said jack well have to dry out that bedding before night  soon the whole crowd was busy breakfast for the time being forgotten all went at the task with a will and before long everything was straightened out but the kitchen doors and windows had been closed a fresh fire had been lit and then the roaring logs sent a grateful warmth through the entire bungalow  now well get breakfast and then well clean up this mess in the kitchen announced gif  and what are we going to do after that questioned jack  what do you think we ought to do jack  square accounts with glutts and werner if they are the guilty parties  they only paid us back for what fred and the twins did said spouter i dont know but what we might as well call it quits  well well go over there anyway and see what theyve got to say for themselves said jack perhaps at the least well be able to scare them so that theyll leave us alone in the future  all right we might do that answered gif and so it was decided  the boys came to the conclusion that glutts and werner accompanied possibly by codfish must have visited the lodge some time in the middle of the previous afternoon evidently the marauders had been afraid that the bungalows occupants might return at any moment for they had worked with great speed  they took a big chance with that fire remarked randy if the wind had blown the sparks too farinto the bedrooms for instancethe whole place might have gone up in flames  at first the lads thought to go over to tony duvals place without delay but by the time they had straightened out the bungalow and gotten their breakfast the older cadets were in a different frame of mind  more than likely theyll be on their guard today looking for us to come over said jack let us wait two or three days and try to catch them unawares and this change was made in their plans  several days including sunday passed and the six cadets took it easy it snowed part of the time so that they went out hunting only once on that trip they managed to get several more rabbits and four quail but that was all  i thought i saw a fox said gif on the morning following i heard him bark during the night too  was he a silver fox questioned jack eagerly  i didnt see him well enough to find out and i cant tell the color of a fox from his bark was gifs somewhat dry reply and at this there was a laugh  then the storm cleared away once more and on the following morning the boys resolved to tramp in the direction of tony duvals place and see if they could locate werner and glutts  i dont believe this tony duval is a very nice fellow to meet remarked gif when they were on their way i saw him twice and he looked like anything but a pleasant character  the middle of the forenoon found them on the grounds occupied by the various shacks belonging to the frenchcanadian they were small structures built for the most part of slabsides and each contained but two windows and a door  i wonder which shack is that used by glutts and werner remarked randy as they looked around  nobody was in sight there were five of the shacks located several hundred feet apart and each with some timber around it  well try the nearest place said gif and going up to it he knocked sharply on the door he waited for fully a minute but there was no reply  seems to be empty remarked jack after looking in through one of the windows there is no sign of a fire in the fireplace  they tramped on to the next shack and found that was likewise vacant  i think well find somebody at home in the third shack announced spouter anyway i see smoke coming from the chimney  they were approaching the doorway of this rude structure when it was suddenly flung open and a man stepped into view he wore a hunters outfit and carried a doublebarreled shotgun in his hands  who are you he questioned and his tone had a strong french accent what do you want here  we are looking for a fellow named werner who hired one of these shacks answered gif  who are you repeated the man sharply and then gif recognized tony duval  i am the son of one of the men who own cedar lodge we want to find werner and the two fellows who are with him  aha so you are the young fellows from cedar lodge who made so much trouble for mistaire werner and his friends cried tony duval he has told me all about that  did he tell you what he did down at cedar lodge demanded jack  he say he would square the account why should he not do that you have no right to destroy his things and hurt his horse  we didnt touch his horse answered fred quickly  his horse is gone lame and he say you do that cried tony duval i do not want such people as you around my place you can go back and you must stay off my property and tony duval emphasized his words by handling his shotgun suggestively  if werner and his friend are here we want to see them cried jack sharply which shack do they live in  they live there duval pointed with his thumb they are not at home now they go on a hunt but you shall not make more trouble for them or you will hear from me and again he handled his gun suggestively the mans face was very red and looked as if he had been drinking evidently he was in an ugly humor  after that the cadets attempted to argue with tony duval but all to no purpose he was very stubborn and he insisted upon it that they had already made a great deal of trouble for his patrons he finally ordered them away and acted so threateningly that they retired  well weve had our walk for nothing remarked fred when they were in the woods again  i dont know about that answered randy let us keep our eyes open maybe well run across werner and glutts  the four rovers and their chums walked leisurely through the woods keeping their eyes open for the possible appearance of their enemies and also for any game that might present itself thus the best part of an hour went by and they managed to bring down one more rabbit and also a squirrel then they heard some shooting at a distance and walked cautiously in that direction  there they are cried randy presently and pointed out of the woods and across a small clearing  all looked in the direction indicated and there saw werner glutts and codfish each had a gun and the three had been shooting at a number of rabbits only werner had been successful the others shooting wide of the mark  let us circle the clearing and surprise them said jack and to this the others immediately agreed  with caution they made their way around the clearing doing their best to remain hidden from the other boys they had no desire to be mistaken for game and shot at so they had to keep their eyes on the alert as they advanced  werner and his cronies had passed into the woods and now were making their way down a hillside into a hollow where they had built a fairsized campfire as the rovers and their chums came closer they saw the three sitting around the campfire and evidently getting ready to have a midday lunch  come on were six to three so we ought to be able to manage those fellows with ease cried fred  wait a minute ive got an idea exclaimed randy holding his cousin back  what is it questioned spouter  do you see how much higher the other side of the slope is went on andy well that slope runs right down to where they are sitting and have their fire now a few big snowballs started down that slope  ive got you andy burst out his twin with twinkling eyes it will be great come on fellows well smother em with snow     chapter xxiii  six big snowballs   it did not take the four rovers and their chums long to reach that part of the slope pointed out by andy as he had said this was much higher than the spot where they had stood before and the slope was much steeper leading directly down to where werner glutts and codfish were now busy over their campfire preparing the midday meal  the bully and his cronies were good feeders and had brought a considerable quantity of food for their lunch some of this was now spread out on a napkin resting on the snow and the rest of it was being warmed over the campfire  its the chance of our lives said randy softly come on fellows lets make the biggest snowballs we can  all of the others were willing and soon they had rolled six snowballs each of which was two feet or more in diameter  of course our friends were well out of sight of those in the hollow and as they spoke in low tones their enemies had no suspicion of what was coming  now then place all the snowballs in a line on the very edge of the slope said jack and gif you give the word when we are to push them down  soon the six massive snowballs were lined up side by side those behind them looked below to make sure that none of the trio was close to the fire because they did not wish anybody to be burnt  now then whispered gif suddenly when he saw the three lads sit down with the cooked stuff between them all ready go  everybody gave a shove and over the edge of the slope went the six snowballs slowly at first but gradually gathering both size and speed through the snow they rolled and over the bare rocks until almost to the foot of the slope  hi whats this coming roared glutts happening to glance around as a strange noise reached his ears  its a snowslide screamed werner  oh oh let me get out of the way shrieked codfish  all three attempted to spring to their feet glutts knocking over a pot of hot coffee as he did so but the movement came too late for the next instant the six snowballs bowled over the three boys hurling them in all directions one ball rolled through the lunch carrying most of this along imbedded in the snow another snowball went directly through the campfire smashing that flat and leaving the embers hissing and blackened  dont let them see you called jack as the twins were about to dash down the slope get back there out of sight  oh theyll know we did it all right enough answered spouter come on down and have it out with them  this was what the majority desired and before glutts and the others could recover from their astonishment and dismay gif and his crowd were down the slope  huh so you were the fellows to roll those snowballs down on us growled bill glutts as he rubbed his leg where some of the hot coffee had been spilled upon it  thats a fine way to treat a fellow said werner digging some snow from his ear  and you spoiled all the lunch wailed codfish looking around for his cap which had been knocked off oh dear i wish i hadnt come to this outoftheway place  shut up your whining roared werner you make me sick  i dont care i told you yesterday i wanted to go home answered codfish complainingly i hate it up here  well go home then snapped werner go home this minute if you want to im sick of having you around  youd do much better codfish if you wouldnt train with fellows like werner and glutts remarked jack  if i leave them will you fellows show me the way back to timminsport questioned the sneak of colby hall pleadingly it was plainly to be seen that he had had no easy time of it since he had come up into the woods  that depends said gif and caught the youth by the wrist tell me codfish were you at our lodge the other daythe day the whole place was roughhoused  no i wasnt gif really and truly i wasnt cried the sneak in alarm  were werner and glutts alone  yes yes i had nothing to do with it  see here codfish you keep your mouth shut roared glutts and he moved forward as if to strike the small youth who cowered before him  you keep your distance glutts admonished jack if codfish is tired of staying with you fellows hes going to leave and youre not to say anything about it  what right had you fellows to smash those snowballs down on us questioned werner with an angry look in his eyes  what right had you fellows to come and upset cedar lodge destroying some of our stores and walking off with some of the others questioned jack sternly  we didnt walk off with anything answered werner quickly what we did we had a right to doto pay you back for what you did to our stores in the sleigh  we didnt take any of your things put in fred quickly and a whole lot of our stuff is missing  we didnt take a thing awaynot a thing put in glutts and he smiled grimly to himself as he spoke  i know what they did cried codfish quickly if youll take me along with you and see that i get to timminsport safely ill tell you where your things are  you say a word codfish and ill lambaste the life out of you yelled werner  you wont touch codfish broke in jack sturdily and if he wants to go with us hell go  i want to go wailed the sneak i dont want to stay with them another minute but how am i to get my things that are up at their shack he questioned helplessly  well go up there with you answered gif  a war of words followed and then in uncontrolled rage werner and glutts attacked jack and gif half a dozen blows were exchanged and then glutts attempted to run away while werner attempted to use the butt of his gun as a club andy tripped glutts up and spouter caught werner from behind and as a consequence of the general mixup the two bullies received a welldeserved drubbing then their weapons were discharged and their ammunition was taken away from them and they were told to march back to tony duvals shacks  here as they expected our friends had another setto with the frenchcanadian tony duval wanted to take sides with werner and glutts but the others would not listen  this young man is going with us and he is going to take his things with him announced gif pointing to codfish if you make any trouble for us duval ill at once notify my father and my uncle and likewise the authorities at portview your reputation around here is already none of the best and ill see to it that you are treated as you deserve  bah what do i care for you or your father or your uncle cried tony duval in a rage this is my property you will leave it at once  well leave when this young man has his things and not before answered jack and now he too fingered his gun in a suggestive manner  tony duval realized that he was outnumbered and that the boys from cedar lodge meant business he grumbled a good deal and talked in a whisper with werner and glutts in the meanwhile codfish hurriedly gathered together his few belongings and presently announced that he was ready to leave  now one thing more said gif turning to the two bullies dont you dare to show your faces anywhere near cedar lodge again if you come on our property you come at your own peril  oh you dont know how to take a joke grumbled glutts  well do as we please added werner but it was plainly to be seen that he was much disturbed  the boys were about ready to leave the shack when they heard the sound of sleigh bells and soon a twoseated sleigh came into sight drawn by a pair of powerful horses the turnout drove directly to the front of the shack occupied by tony duval  hello there are those men again cried gif  all looked and saw that he referred to the germans they had met on the road when looking for cedar lodge the newcomers paid no attention to them but leaped out of the sleigh and entered the duval shack  i must go said tony duval abruptly and i want you to go too and never come back here again he added and then hurried away  who are those men questioned jack turning to werner and glutts  thats none of your business answered werner sourly you clear out of here and never come back  there seemed nothing to do but to leave the premises yet the rovers and their chums were curious to know who the germans were and what their errand to tony duvals shack could be yet they had no excuse for lingering longer so presently they took their departure werner and glutts looking sourly after them as they walked away  do you know id give a good deal to know more about those germans remarked jack as they trudged along i wonder what they want here they cant be hunters because they havent any hunting outfits  they certainly couldnt be up here for business returned spouter because there is no business to speak of in this vicinity why there isnt even a farm or a farmer around here and the nearest logging camp is miles away so they told me at henryville  ill tell you what we might do said gif we might pass into the woods and then turn around and come back again up behind tony duvals shack we can watch and see what the germans do and maybe well hear what they and duval have to say  thats an idea cried jack i dont know but what we had better act on it     chapter xxiv  a conversation of importance   do you know anything about those germans questioned fred turning to codfish  i know they came to see tony duval once or twice before answered the sneak of colby hall they and duval seem to have some secret business between them  do you know what it is asked jack  at this codfish shook his head  did werner and glutts have anything to do with it came from gif  they went to duvals cabin once when the germans were there i asked to go along but they wouldnt let me after that bill and gabe took some kind of a message down to timminsport for them it was on their way back from the town that they stopped and made a mess of things at your lodge they were laughing and joking about it when they got back and that is how i know what took place  you said you would tell us where the things that were taken away are came from spouter  they are all in the barn under the hayat least that is what bill and gabe said they took em out there in one of the bed sheets  i guess thats right came quickly from gif i noticed that one of the sheets was missing  they had now reached the shelter of the forest and here after a little talk it was decided that the twins and fred should return to cedar lodge at once taking codfish with them while jack gif and spouter took a roundabout course leading to the rear of tony duvals shack  weve got to be careful announced jack for all we know those germans may be desperate characters  and on the other hand they may be the most innocent fellows in the world added spouter remember not all the germanamericans in this country are unpatriotic  the three soon reached a point where they could catch sight of duvals shack they approached with caution so that they might not be seen from the single back window of which the rough building boasted as the boys drew closer they saw that the window had been raised several inches evidently there was a good fire going inside of the shack and with so many occupants the place had become overly warm  then its all settled and youll attend to the matter they heard one of the germans remark as they crawled up close to the building  yes ill do it answered tony duval but ill be running a big risk  not if you are careful said another of the germans  and dont forget that you are being well paid for your work added a third german and that you are doing this for the country in which your mother was born  i should not want to be caught grumbled tony duval if i was the authorities might hang me  poof be not so chickenhearted said the german who had first spoken now it is all arranged be careful that you do not disappoint us he added sternly  the three cadets had listened to this talk with intense interest now jack could not resist the temptation to peer in at one corner of the window he saw one of the germans returning a wallet to his pocket and saw tony duval take up several bank bills from the table and place them away in his hunting jacket all of the germans were on their feet and now turned to the door which one of them flung wide open  its all over get back as far as you can to the woods whispered the oldest rover boy and led the way with the others at his heels  when the cadets gained the shelter of the trees they saw the germans get into the sleigh once more and a few seconds later they drove away tony duval watching their departure  now what do you make of that jack questioned gif his face showed that he was puzzled  it looks to me as if those fellows were up to no good returned jack  did you notice what they said about tony duvals mother cried spouter that seemed to me as if his mother might have been a german woman  thats the way i took it too returned jack and then dont forget what duval saidthat the authorities might hang him if he was caught that sounds as if they were asking him to do something which was against the law  yes and a big crime at that put in gif  i wonder where the germans live  most likely at a distance otherwise they wouldnt be using a sleigh  we ought to look into this and without delay said jack decidedly  let us make it our business to find out all about the germans tomorrow said gif and so it was decided  when the three arrived at cedar lodge they found the others were already there and had uncovered the goods hidden by glutts and werner under the hay in the barn there they likewise found the bedsheet and the blanket which had previously been taken  well anyway they didnt rob us was randys comment  i guess they were afraid to do that answered his twin they thought we might bring the law down on them  i dont like those fellows any more and i intend to have nothing more to do with em said codfish  i guess they got you up here simply to make you toady to them  thats what they did andy they made me carry all the things for em and made me cut the wood and wash the dishes and everything i was a big fool to leave home where i might have had a splendid time during the holidays  that evening came the first real drawback of the outing in returning from the barn spouter slipped on some ice and fell down with his foot under him when he got up he found that his ankle was sprained so that he could scarcely walk upon it the others assisted him into the bungalow and did what they could to make him comfortable  i guess ill be all right in a day or two grumbled spouter but this will prevent me from going out with you tomorrow to find out about those germans  well anyway spouter youll have codfish here to keep you company and im sure hell be glad enough to get something to eat for you said jack  ill do that willingly if only you wont call me codfish any more pleaded the cadet mentioned  all right henry well have to call you by your right name after this and at this the sneak of the school seemed much relieved secretly he hated the nickname of codfish exceedingly  early in the morning came a surprise the boys heard a wellknown whistle and beheld jed wallop approaching this time on foot the old hunter had his gun with him  thought id make a day of it with you he announced that is unless youve some other plans  we were thinking of coming over to your place answered jack we want to get some information  all right im the walkin dictionary and cyclopædia of this hull district answered jed wallop with a grin go on and fire all the questions at me that you want to  the old hunter listened with interest to what the cadets had to say concerning the germans and tony duval and also about the message glutts and werner had carried to timminsport for the strangers  that dont look right to me at all he said shaking his head gravely ive seen them germans a few times myself drivin around in that big sleigh of theirn sometimes theres only two of em and then agin the four are in a bunch someone once told me that duval had german blood in his veins and i guess thats right  and im sure glutts is german and maybe werner too said randy  my idee is that them germans are holdin out at an old house up river bend way it was the old parkingham estate but it hasnt been used for years its a mighty lonely place too right in the midst of the woods  how far is that from here questioned fred  about three miles i should say  is there a pretty good road questioned jack  the way by the mountain road would be all of five miles but i know a fair trail through the woods that we might take  then lets get there as soon as possible cried gif will you go with us jed  o course i will if them germans are traitors to this country or anything like that i want to know it answered the old hunter decidedly im too old to enlist for the war but i aint too old to do my duty by uncle sam  we might combine business with pleasure remarked jack we can take our guns and game bags and also a substantial lunch then if we see any signs of game going or coming we can take our time about getting back here  one thing that brought me over was this went on jed wallop i heard one of you young fellers sayin you wanted to get a crack at a silver fox well i know a holler about two miles from here where quite a few foxes are hangin out ive heard em barkin around there more than once i saw a silver fox up that way too and if he shows himself you might git what you are wishin fer  fine exclaimed jack with enthusiasm but is that hangout of the foxes on the way to the old mansion you mentioned  no it aint but we might work around that way comin back  a substantial lunch was prepared and packed and then after seeing to it that their guns were in good order the five cadets and jed wallop left the lodge  mighty sorry i cant go along said spouter dolefully however i wish you all the best of luck not only in getting some information about those germans but also in locating the foxes  and you can depend on me taking good care of dick said henry stowell  all right henry answered gif for he and all of the others had been told how codfish hated his nickname and they had decided to do what they could toward dropping it although as andy had remarked it might be pretty hard to stop calling a donkey a donkey all the time  well give the little sneak a chance to turn over a new leaf was what jack had said in return i dont believe codfish is bad at hearthes only been traveling in the wrong company  it was a fair day with the sun coming up clearly over the treetops it was still intensely cold but there was little or no wind for which the lads were thankful  i suppose you have thinned out the game a good deal right around this lodge remarked jed wallop you know rabbits and squirrels dont like to hear the bangin of a gun they know mighty well it spells trouble fer em  a mile was covered before they sighted anything that looked like game then a big fat rabbit ran directly across their path to give the boys a chance jed wallop did not fire and as a consequence the bunny got away none of the cadets being quick enough to get a shot at it  youve got to have your eyes open if you want to lay low all the game in these woods chuckled the old hunter  he was too close to us grumbled gif why he was out of sight before i could think of raising my gun  you mustnt think gif jest fire and let it go at that and jed wallop grinned broadly he was a man who loved company and he thought it great sport to be out in the woods with the cadets  after this they trudged along in silence each of the lads keeping his eyes wide open for the possible appearance of any game but nothing came to view  now well soon be in sight of that old house announced jed wallop presently its on the other side of this hill  they topped the rise and there saw before them a small clearing beyond which was a rough mountain road on the other side of the road was a thick patch of timber and in the midst of this stood a long low house with a wide veranda in front  there is the parkingham house said jed wallop and unless im greatly mistaken thats where them germans are hangin out     chapter xxv  tee mysterious house in the woods   we dont want anyone to see us remarked jack as they came to a halt on the edge of the clearing  oh them germans wont know but what youre simply out huntin answered jed wallop  nevertheless the boys were anxious to approach the old house unobserved and so skirted the clearing and crossed the mountain road which at this point was lined with thick pines then they entered the forest again coming up presently at a point in the rear of the building where there was a small barn and also several sheds  the parkingham house was a rambling structure which had seen better days one end sagged and here a porch post had fallen away along with several steps but the other end of the long building had evidently been put in some kind of repair for some boards on the piazza were new as were also several window sashes all the curtains were drawn down  somebody mast be living here remarked randy otherwise they wouldnt have gone to the trouble and expense of making repairs  they looked around the old house carefully but could see nobody then they peered into the barn  no horses here announced gif and that big sleigh isnt here either  then if those germans live here they must be away on a trip remarked jack after a pause  i dont see anything suspicious around this place said andy  the barn showed signs of use and so did the other outbuildings and there were numerous tracks in the snow leading from the barn to the house at the well some water had been spilled and this had not yet had time to freeze  they cant have gone away so very long ago was gifs comment he turned to the others well whats the next move  i dont see why you dont walk right up and knock on the door and if them fellers are around have a talk with em declared jed wallop if they are above board they wont hesitate about answerin questions  let us wait around the barn for a while and see if anybody comes in or goes out suggested jack he could not get it out of his mind how queerly the germans had acted and he felt certain that something was wrong and that the fellows ought to be reported to the authorities  gee its rather cold around here remarked fred as they walked up and down in the big barn to keep warm  im going to cover myself in the hay if you fellows are going to stay here any length of time cried andy and in a playful mood he and his twin made a dash for what looked to be a large quantity of hay at one side of the barn both burrowed down in this and then randy set up a cry of surprise  hello this isnt a pile of hay at all its bundles of wire  bundles of wire queried jack  what kind of wire asked gif  looks like fence wire or telegraph wire to me said andy who was holding some of the hay to one side so that he might get a better look at what was underneath it looks brand new too  there were numerous coils of the wire and these the cadets and jed wallop looked at with interest then they found several packing cases all nailed up tightly and marked in english and in german  this is certainly queer said jack  say whats the matter with opening one or two of the cases and seeing whats in em suggested fred  have we any right to do that asked gif doubtfully  well take the right decided jack im satisfied that those fellows are up to no good you know what tony duval said when they asked him to do something  not far from the barn was a woodshed and here the cadets procured an axe and a hammer with these implements they managed to pry open one of the packing cases inside was what looked to be electrical machinery but just what it was they could not make out  looks like that telephone or telegraph line all right enough remarked randy but what are those fellows going to do with any such line as that away up here  its a riddle aint it remarked jed wallop jest the same that stuff looks mighty suspicious to me  they continued their investigation and behind the packing cases found some machinery all of it was new and strange to them  if theyve got so much queer stuff out here in the barn how much more do you suppose theyve got in the house questioned fred  if i was sure no one was at home id be strongly tempted to find a way inside and take a look around said jack  come ahead and do it burst out randy i dont believe theres a soul around  ill tell you what ill do said jack finally you keep out of sight and ill go out on the road and walk toward the house and knock on the door then if anybody comes ill say that im out hunting and would like to buy a bit to eat they cant refuse me a bite and that will give me a little chance to look around while im inside  i dont think you ought to go alone said gif they know there are a bunch of us at the lodge and they would be rather suspicious if you were by yourself why not let me go with you  so it was arranged and leaving the others hidden in the barn the two cadets started to walk through the woods to the road  keep your guns with you advised jed wallop and if you git into anything like a tight place shoot off one of the guns as a signal and well be to the rescue in no time  the two boys were soon out on the lonely mountain road and then they headed for the old house boldly mounting the main piazza they knocked sharply on the door  at first there was no response and the lads were just congratulating themselves on the fact that the premises were deserted when they heard shuffling footsteps then came the tremulous voice of an elderly woman speaking in broken english  who ist der vat you vants  we are a couple of boys out hunting answered jack we would like to know if we can buy something to eat  i haf nodings for you you besser go somevhere else  cant we come in and get warm asked gif  nein you go avay  who lives here questioned jack loudly for the woman had made no attempt to open the door  dis ist mister bauermanns house  is he in id like very much to speak to him i am sure he would let us have something to eat went on jack in the smoothest tone he could command  do you know mister bauermann questioned the woman cautiously  isnt he the gentleman who has been riding around here in his sleigh with two or three other men asked gif if he is he continued we have met him near my fathers place  i think you might at least let us have a little to eat were willing to pay well for it broke in jack just a little bread and butter and maybe a cup of hot coffee or tea if you have it  i cant open de door for you said the woman firmly mister bauermann he gifs orders not to let anypody in de house you haf to go avay unt get somedings to eat somevhere else  when do you expect mr bauermann back asked gif  dot i cant say maybe he was come back by dinner time unt maybe not bis night  all right then well go but i think you are rather mean not to sell us something to eat said jack  to this the woman did not make any reply but they heard her fumbling at the door evidently making certain that the lock and bolt were secure  as there seemed nothing else to do the two cadets retired and feeling that the woman must be watching them from behind the tightly drawn curtains at the windows walked on down the rough road until a bend hid the house from view then they came up through the woods again and rejoined those at the barn  well we found out one thing anyway declared jack there is a woman keeping guard in the house and the menfolks are all away and wont be back until noon or tonight  evidently those chaps are very secretive said gif i agree with jack that the whole thing looks mighty suspicious  do you intend to wait around here until those germans come back asked fred a bit impatiently  why not go out on a hunt and come back later suggested randy  thats the talk broke in andy im getting tired of hanging around here doing nothing to him it had been a long wait while the others had gone to the house  i suppose we might as well go on a hunt announced gif anyway im willing to do whatever the others say  so it was decided that they should go off on a hunt to return to the house either later that day or else on the day following this suited jed wallop for the old hunter did not feel in the humor for investigating the old mansion or the germans staying there  come on come on said he and maybe well git a chance at a fox or two  now youre saying something cried fred  leaving the old parkingham house and outbuildings behind they struck off through the woods crossed the mountain road and a small frozenup watercourse and then mounted one of the hills lying to the northwest of cedar lodge here they found traveling rather difficult and more than once the old hunter said he wished they were on snowshoes  purty hard to use em at first said he but after a while travelin that way gits to be as easy as the reglar way  oh we know something about snowshoes said jack but we didnt think wed need any on this trip  they tramped around for the rest of the forenoon managing to stir up several rabbits and also a partridge which fred was fortunate enough to bring down then they built a small campfire and made themselves a pot of hot chocolate and had this with the lunch they had brought along  the middle of the afternoon found them in the location jed wallop had had in mind when speaking of foxes the old hunter told all of them to be on the alert  you know mr fox aint goin to stand still to be shot at said he quizzically as soon as he spots you hell be off quicker than greased lightning  they advanced with caution and had hardly proceeded a hundred yards when jed wallop suddenly put up his hand for silence they were coming to a series of rocks and beyond this was a small clearing backed up by brushwood still thickly covered with snow they looked over toward this brushwood in the direction which jed wallop pointed out and there saw a fox standing on a high rock gazing expectantly at the woods beyond     chapter xxvi  what the big barn contained   theres your chance whispered wallop to the cadets quick now or he may leap away before you can say jack robinson  go ahead gif said jack quickly for he felt that their host should have the first chance to shoot  there was no time to argue the matter and raising his gun gif took hasty aim and fired his aim was not of the best for only a few of the scattering shot pierced the foxs side the animal wheeled around in evident astonishment and for a second did not know which way to escape  fire at him fire at him called out jed wallop quickly fire or hell git away  this time all of the others blazed away one after another several of the charges went wild but randy managed to catch the fox directly in the shoulder and he leaped high in the air and then came down floundering around and kicking the loose snow in all directions  hurrah weve got him cried randy  mebbe you have and mebbe you havent answered jed wallop better run in and finish him  gif was the first to do this and a final charge caused the fox to cease his struggles  a purty goodsized animal remarked the old hunter when they were inspecting it that skin is worth some money  the old hunter said he would carry the dead fox for them and again they went forward they spent the best part of the afternoon looking for more foxes but in this they were disappointed however deep in the woods they came upon a covey of partridges all banged away at a lively rate and had the satisfaction of killing three of the birds  a pretty good haul after all remarked fred with satisfaction  dont you think it about time that we returned to that old parkingham house questioned jack after the game had been placed in their bags  we might as well work around that way answered gif remember well have quite a tramp after that getting back to the lodge  they turned in the direction of the old house in the woods and on their way kept their eyes open for more game but all they sighted were two small squirrels and these they thought not worth shooting at  they were just about to cross the mountain road not far from the old house when they heard a pair of horses hitched to a long boxsled approaching the sled was piled high with several boxes and three bales of hay  get back cried jack quickly that may be one of those germans coming and i dont think it would be wise to let him see us  they stepped behind some trees and brushwood and soon the boxsled came closer then another surprise awaited them for the driver of the sled who was alone was none other than the farmer they had rescued from the burning railroad car  its that fellow crouse whispered gif what do you know about that  shall we go out and speak to him questioned andy  i dont see that it would do any harm said jack we have a perfect right to be out hunting in this neighborhood  accordingly they stepped out in the roadway almost directly in front of the oncoming boxsled the driver who was crouched down with the big collar of his overcoat turned up around his ears had evidently been in deep thought for when he noticed them he straightened up in surprise and brought his team to a sudden halt  why if it isnt our friend from the railroad train remarked jack with a smile  well i never declared herman crouse with a momentary look of pleasure on his face how did you young gentlemen get up here and then of a sudden a cloud came over his features  cant you see were out hunting answered fred pointing to the guns and game in their bags  yes yes to be sure i forgot that you came up here to go hunting have you had much success  a little answered gif weve got a fox and weve had quite a few rabbits squirrels quail and partridges  not so bad herman crouse looked anxiously at the boys and jed wallop where are you staying  at cedar lodge its several miles from here answered jack and then he continued you belong around here i thought you said you had a farm near enwood  so i have but during the winter i make a little extra money trucking thats what i am doing now i am feeling pretty good again  where are you bound questioned randy  at this question herman crouse seemed somewhat disturbed  oh ive got to go up the road quite a distance he answered evasively i might offer to give you a ride only you can see i am loaded down as it is and this statement was correct for the boxsled was carrying about all the team could haul  we met some other germans around herefour men who drive around in a big sleigh said jack boldly and looking herman crouse full in the eyes  yes yes i know the eyes of the man fell for an instant i am not a german he said somewhat lamely that is i was born on the other side but i came to this country before i was twentyone and now i am an american  then you dont side with germany in this war  i dont side with the kaiser i am sorry for the common people for they have had no sayso in this awful slaughter that is going on  well im glad to hear that you stick up for the good old u s a cried jack you know there are a good many germans and germanamericans here who are the other way  i want nothing to do with them and nothing to do with war answered herman crouse i am only a hardworking man who wants to be left alone he paused for an instant dont imagine that i have forgotten what you did for me he continued with a little smile you were my very good friends and i shall never forget it now if you please i must hurry on because i want to get back home before it gets too dark i wish you all the best of luck with your hunting and he took up the reins again  do you know anything about the hunting in that direction questioned randy pointing to where the old parkingham house was located  i do not think it is very good up there was the quick reply and anyway if i were you gentlemen i would not go anywhere near the old house up there  why not demanded jed wallop  the people who are staying there are very queer they do not like any strangers around  then you know them questioned gif  yes i know them but not very well some of them are germanamericans like me but they are not my friends i would advise you to stay away from them the hunting anyway is better elsewhere now goodbye and good luck and thus speaking herman crouse urged forward his team and continued on his way  ill bet a new hat against a lemon that he is bound for the old parkingham house exclaimed randy when the german was out of earshot  let us follow him and make sure returned his twin  all right said jack but we had better keep out of sight among the trees  with so much timber standing around this was an easy matter following crouse they saw the man at last turn in at the old house and drive around to where the barn was located then he got out of the boxsled and walked to a back door of the residence  now i guess well find out if those germans are back or not announced gif  they waited for several minutes and then the door was again opened and herman crouse came out followed by two of the men the boys had previously seen all three hurried down to the barn and there began to unload the boxsled then the boys saw the unknown germans give crouse some money the three talked together for a few minutes in german and then the owner of the boxsled drove away and the other germans returned to the house  this is getting interesting remarked jack of course that hay was meant for the horses but what do you suppose can be in those packing cases  come on around to the back of the barn and maybe we can learn something further said fred  its gettin purty late boys announced jed wallop  if you want to go home dont let us keep you returned gif quickly  well i dont want to see any of you lads git into trouble answered wallop at the same time i hate to leave my family alone after dark  well you go on then put in jack quickly there are five of us and i guess we can take care of ourselves especially as we have our guns with us  o course everything may be perfectly reglar here continued jed wallop although like you i have my doubts but unless you want me to stay ill git home and a little later he took his departure  left to themselves the rovers and gif watched their chance and unobserved entered the big barn here they found that all of the packing cases which had been brought in by herman crouse had been placed out of sight under the hay  one thing is certainthey dont want any outsiders to know about these cases remarked jack  suddenly fred who was looking out of the doorway toward the house uttered a low cry of alarm  get under cover fellows just as quick as you can he said three of those germans are coming down here     chapter xxvii  the coming of the wolves   freds announcement came as a surprise the germans were coming from the house so rapidly that there was no time to leave the barn the back door being closed and having some packing cases and hay against it  come on up in the loft cried jack be quick now  why not hide down here in the hay suggested andy  because they may try to get at those packing cases and then they would probably discover us was the reply quick this way  gif was already acting on the oldest rover boys suggestion and going up a ladder nailed to one side of the barn randy and the others followed fred being the last  at the top of the ladder was an opening to a large loft here there was more hay and also some old farm implements which had evidently been hoisted there by means of a block and tackle  hush now warned gif and the five cadets tiptoed their way toward the hay bent upon secreting themselves should it become necessary to do so  the germans carried two lanterns for it was now quite dark in the barn they were talking volubly in their native tongue so that the cadets could understand very little of what was said one man a tall burly individual who was evidently more prosperous than the others was addressed as herr bauermann and he was the man mentioned by the woman who had refused to open the door and let jack and gif in  herr bauermann had come out to inspect the contents of the packing cases brought in by herman crouse he had the two other men open the cases and take out layers of excelsior so that he might look at what was underneath he gave a grunt of satisfaction and nodded his head approvingly at the same time continuing to speak in german  all of the cadets were anxious to see what the boxes contained and looked cautiously down the ladder opening and through some cracks in the loft flooring all they could make out was some machinery apparently electrical and similar to that in the other cases there was also a large round package covered with heavy bagging and this was found to contain more coils of wire of various sizes  while the men were looking around one of them suddenly stooped and picked up something from the floor he passed this to the others at the same time making some remark which of course the lads could not understand  hes got a glove whispered jack  its one of my gloves i dropped it when we climbed the ladder returned randy in sudden alarm  the finding of the glove interested the germans very much they looked all around the barn and for a few minutes the cadets were fearful that they would come up in the loft but then they evidently concluded that the glove had been dropped by herman crouse and placed it on a shelf  it was a good half hour before the germans left the barn and returned to the house and by that time the five cadets in the loft were almost frozen they had been unable to move around and thus keep warm and with the coming of night the thermometer was going down steadily  come on let us get out of here said fred his teeth chattering if we dont move soon ill be frozen stiff  the boys came cautiously out of the barn and looked toward the house every curtain was tightly drawn and lights shown only from the kitchen and the dining room of the old dwelling  those fellows are going to get supper said randy and i move we go home and do likewise we cant learn anything more standing here and if we went to the door and showed ourselves those men might get very suspicious  all right lets go back to the lodge then announced jack just the same im going to investigate this matter further and im not going to wait so very long either  oh i guess we all want to investigate these germans said fred quickly dont you remember how we helped to round up those submarine rascals he added referring to an affair which has been related in detail in the volume entitled the rover boys under canvas  losing no more time the five cadets hurried down the rough mountain road and then struck off through the woods on a bee line for cedar lodge this time gif took good care that they should not become lost but it was a long wearisome journey and before the lodge was reached every one of the lads was almost ready to drop from exhaustion they were bitterly cold and some of them thought their ears or noses must be frozen  theres the light cried fred at last and he pointed to a candle which spouter had had stowell place in one of the windows  spouter must have done that to help us to find the way said jack very thoughtful of him  as soon as they were a little closer they set up a ringing shout and at once henry stowell came to the door and flung it open all were glad enough to troop in and throw themselves down in comfortable seats before the blazing fire  me for a big hot supper announced randy and i cant get it inside of me any too quick  ditto right here added fred  and dont forget to pass me a large portion please came from andy  under spouters directions stowell had already set a pot of water to boiling and had likewise baked a large pan of pork and beans and made another pan of biscuits even though he had asked the sneak of colby hall to work spouter had spoken kindly to stowell and given him some firstclass advice and this was evidently having its effect  ive got my skates and im going to skate down to henryville tomorrow said stowell from there i can take the public sleigh to timminsport and go home that way wish i was there now  soon supper was under way and while eating the other cadets related to their chum what they had seen and heard around the old house in the woods  there sure is something wrong up there declared spouter whose sprained ankle was much better those fellows are up to no good i think jack we ought to notify the authorities  we talked that over spouter and we have concluded that we will take another look around the place first was the reply  the others questioned stowell again but could get little further information from the young cadet he was satisfied however that werner had been doing some queer things for tony duval and that bill glutts had assisted his crony  there is something strange about the whole business said he once or twice i asked bill or gabe about it but i never could get any satisfaction i sometimes think carrying that message was only a bluff and that the germans were merely trying to test out bill and gabe to see if they could not get them to do something else  in the morning came a big surprise it was snowing and blowing furiously and to go hunting or to do anything else outside was practically out of the question the windows were coated with ice  i guess ill have to stay with you fellows for awhile remarked stowell dolefully i wouldnt dare to try to get to henryville in such a snowstorm as this  you stay right where you are henry and make yourself comfortable said gif as long as youre willing to do your share of the work around here you shall have your share of whatever there is to eat  its very nice of you fellows to treat me this way after all that has happened said the young cadet of course ill do my full share of the work when i was with bill and gabe they always wanted me to do everything  the storm continued all that day the wind if anything increasing in violence all the boys could do was to keep the fire going and make themselves as comfortable as possible inside the lodge they read wrote letters and played games and also tried their hands at more candymaking and also the baking of some pies and cookies  gee those pies are pretty good announced spouter after a piece of one of them had been passed to him  they ought to be good returned fred my face was nearly burned off baking them  and please dont ask me to make any more doughnuts announced randy if i had to run a bake shop id charge about twice as much as the regular bakers do  hed charge for the hole in the doughnut came from his twin with a grin  during the day they had once or twice heard a sound outside that was new to them they were not sure but jack thought it might be a wolf and to this gif agreed  there are wolves prowling around here said the latter but i never knew of any to come close to the lodge  more than likely hes hungry and wants something to eat and has smelled our stuff cooking ventured fred  they had an early supper and then gif said they would have to get in another supply of wood from the shed before retiring  and we might as well get in a good supply while we are at it he added if this snow keeps coming down we may not be able to get out at all tomorrow unless we do a lot of shoveling  it was no easy job to get to the woodshed for the wind was still blowing furiously when they opened the back door of the lodge the snow came swirling in almost blinding them  no use of you fellows trying it announced jack to fred and stowell  thats it said gif four of us going out will be more than enough you fellows can push the snow away from the door if you want to  with their overcoats buttoned up tightly and their caps pulled well down over their ears gif jack and the twins sallied forth in the direction of the woodshed which was about fifty yards away they had all they could do to make any progress and when the shed was gained they were almost winded  say we were foolish not to get this wood before panted gif  well there is no use of finding fault now answered jack come on now we have packed down the path a little it wont be quite so hard  the four boys made two trips to the woodshed each time bringing all the logs they could carry then randy wanted to call a halt  im about played out said he let us get the rest in tomorrow  thats just what i say gasped his twin no use of killing ourselves  im going to make one more trip said gif  and so am i added jack  the pair stepped out of the house with the others watching them in a minute more they disappeared from view in the storm and the darkness  gee but its going to be one awful night cried fred  youve said it returned randy then of a sudden he gave a start whats that he ejaculated  what he referred to was a long mournful howl which arose on the stormladen air this howl was followed by another and then by a third  its wolves cried fred  look look ejaculated andy look out there will you a whole pack of wolves  yes and theyre coming right for the house wailed stowell shut that door quick or theyll jump in on us     chapter xxviii  the man in the grey overcoat   dont shut the door cried randy remember gif and jack are outside  hello out there yelled spouter hobbling to the door in the excitement beware of the wolves  whether his voice carried to jack and gif through the storm they could not tell then came another howl from the wolves this time in concert and suddenly two of the slinking forms appeared close to the open door the eyes of the beasts appeared so baneful to the cadets that they quickly slammed the barrier shut and bolted it  but we cant leave jack and gif out there cried fred remember they are unarmed  get the guns ordered spouter hurry up well give those wolves all they are looking for  he hobbled across the floor to his own weapon resting against the wall in a corner and looked to see if it was loaded the others also made a wild dash to arm themselves  in the meanwhile the howls of the wolves kept increasing two more of the beasts had come up close to the lodge so that the total number was now five  oh oh do you think theyll break into the house and eat us up wailed stowell  if they break in theyll get one mighty warm reception answered andy come on let us open that door and go after them he continued boldly  now that they were armed the rovers and spouter felt much safer and they lost no time in getting back to the door which they had just closed  oh dear dont open the door pleaded stowell theyll jump right in on top of us  not after we give em a few doses of shot answered spouter here henry you stand behind the door along with fred you andy and randy fire as soon as you catch sight of the wolves ill reserve my shot for any beast that tries to enter  wait called out randy suddenly when you shoot at the wolves be sure to aim low otherwise the shots may carry through the storm and hit gif or jack  the door was opened cautiously by fred stowell being too frightened to assist those ready to fire saw several of the wolves in a bunch less than fifteen feet away the beasts had found some scraps of food which had been thrown out of the bungalow and were pawing for more in the snow  bang bang went the shotguns in the hands of the twins the wolves gave loud yelps of pain and one leaped high in the air another uttered a fierce snarl and then seeing the young hunters made a dash directly for them  it was a moment of great peril for the wolf had been wounded just enough to make it tremendously ugly its eyes gleamed wickedly and it showed every tooth in its wideopen mouth  but spouter was on guard he waited until the wolf was less than five feet from the door and then blazed away the charge of shot was so heavy that the beast fell back its neck completely shattered  now give em a second barrel boys cried spouter and a moment later three more reports rang out  then unable to resist the temptation to get into the fight fred caught up his gun and also fired managing to catch one of the fleeing beasts in the hind quarters  i guess thats the last of those wolves remarked spouter i dont believe theyll come around here again all winter  the wolf shot through the neck was dead while at least two of the others were so badly wounded they could scarcely drag themselves away through the storm the others disappeared as if by magic racing along at the top of their speed  hello there came from out of the storm how did you make out with those wolves it was jack who was calling and a moment later he appeared with gif following  there is what is left of the pack cried randy pointing to the dead wolf spouter brought that one down and we managed to wound at least two others  and those that could do it left quicker than them came added his twin  good for you spouter cried jack evidently spraining your ankle didnt interfere with your marksmanship  huh anybody could hit a target if he was right on top of it answered the other cadet nevertheless spouter was immensely pleased over his success in laying the big wolf low  the carcass of the dead beast was dragged into the entryway and then gif and jack brought a few more sticks of wood from the shed  well have to skin that wolf said gif spouter you can get a very nice rug out of it or maybe use the fur for some kind of a garment  ill send it home said spouter i know it will please the folks very much  it was not until some days later that the storm cleared away sufficiently for the boys to go out once more then as they were running short of supplies they decided to accompany stowell down to henryville going as before on their skates  i must say i rather hate to leave you fellows declared the little cadet youve treated me very nicelymuch better than i was treated by bill and gabe when we get back to colby hall i wont forget it  well you turn over a new leaf henry and join the right crowd and youll get along much better answered jack it will never do a fellow any good to train with chaps like glutts and werner or with fellows like nappy martell and slugger brown  they found quite a little snow on the river and had often to plough across the drifts on their skates as best they could but there were many long cleared spaces and here all of the cadets made good time for even stowell was a fairly good skater  youll be just in time henry said gif as they came in sight of the town its now halfpast ten and if i remember rightly the public sleigh for timminsport leaves at eleven oclock  gifs surmise proved correct and all walked over to the hotel from which the sleigh for the other town started it was an easy matter for stowell to obtain accommodations in this turnout and soon he had said goodbye and was bound for home  im mighty glad he is going to give up training with glutts and werner remarked fred and the others agreed with him  the boys had made out a list of what they wanted and leaving the hotel they went over to the general store where they had traded before the proprietor was glad to see them especially when he found out they needed so many things  i had a man in here last night asking about you said the storekeeper when he was busy putting up their things  asking about us repeated jack who was he  i dont know he was in here once before two or three weeks ago asking about the different hunting lodges and lumber camps in this vicinity he didnt give any name and he didnt say what his business was  what sort of looking man was he asked gif  oh just an ordinary looking sort of fellownot very tall and not very short either he had a cleanshaven face and dark hair and dark eyes  how was he dressed questioned fred  he wore a dark grey overcoat and a slouch hat and fur gloves he bought a couple of my best cigars and stood around awhile talking about the people who came to the store to trade then he asked about cedar lodge and he wanted to know all about who was staying there when he heard the name rover he was very much interested and when i told him you were a bunch of cadets from colby hall he said he would have to look you up  maybe hes a friend of ours cried randy too bad you didnt get the name  i dont know as he was any particular friend you see he asked about some of the other places around here tooabout jed wallops place and those shacks belonging to tony duval and about the old hunker cabin and the deserted parkingham house and the old crosby camp and those shacks down at millers saw mill and a lot of places like that i thought maybe he had an idea of buying some place and locating here  he may have been nothing but a real estate agent declared andy  what did you tell him about the old parkingham house questioned jack curiously  i told him a bunch of foreigners were staying up therei thought possibly they might be germans trying to hide themselves so as to keep out of the draft say do you suppose he might be a government agent rounding up the slackers continued the storekeeper with interest  im sure i dont know answered jack if he calls again ask him his name and if he is a friend of ours tell him we would be glad to see him up at the lodge at any time  all right ill do that  had they not been hampered by so many bundles and packages some of which were quite heavy the cadets would have remained out hunting for the rest of the day but as it was they decided to skate directly home and obtain a belated lunch at the lodge and then if they felt like it go out later  were up here just for the fun of it so there is no necessity of being too strenuous said gif we want to go back to colby hall feeling really refreshed  they had reached the river once more and were busy putting on their skates when they heard a shout behind them turning they beheld a man who as soon as he saw they were looking in his direction waved his hand at them  excuse me but are some of you the rover boys he questioned as he came closer  yes answered jack i am one of the rovers and these are my cousins and he indicated the others  i was up at the store and the storekeeper told me you had just gone away and were bound up the river if you dont mind i would like to have a talk with you  the man was of medium size with dark hair and dark eyes and as he wore a dark grey overcoat and a slouch hat the cadets immediately put him down for the individual mentioned to them by the storekeeper he had a quiet smile on his face which was reassuring to all of the lads  what is it you want to know questioned fred  are you the rovers from colby hallthe young men who had so much to do with rounding up those germans at camp barlight and capturing that hidden submarine  yes  and you also helped in rounding up those other fellows who were trying to put through some deal with two men named brown and martell  we did said andy  it was a fine thing to do and it shows that you fellows are true blue returned the man with satisfaction  are you a secret service man questioned jack suddenly  why do you want to know that rover was the counter question  if you belong to the secret service you are just the man we are looking for     chapter xxix  what happened at the lodge   so you want to see a secret service man eh said the newcomer after a slight pause whats in the wind  we think we have discovered something that the government ought to know about answered jack slowly  but there isnt any use of our saying anything about it unless you are really a public official of some sort or other broke in randy hastily  after this there followed quite a conversation the newcomer leading the boys on to tell what they knew concerning the germans at the old parkingham house and also what they knew about herman crouse and tony duval  i think i am on the right track at last said the man and since you have told me so much i will return your confidences by stating that i am a secret service officer we had an idea that the germans might try something of that sort in this vicinity and i am pretty sure now that we are on the right track  try something of what sort questioned andy  we received word in a roundabout way over six weeks ago that an attempt would be made by the germans to establish a radio station somewhere along this portion of the coast the hills back of timminsport and henryville would make an ideal spot for such a station  do you mean a radio station from which they could send wireless messages all the way to germany cried fred  oh no not such a distance as that such a station would require more power than they would be able to generate without heavy and complicated machinery but it was thought they might establish a lesser station from which they could send wireless messages to any of their submarines or warships that might be sailing within a given distance of our shore  you surely have struck it cried randy those coils of wire and the electrical things we saw in the packing cases up at their barn prove it  the secret service agent who gave his name as william pollock questioned them still further and then said he would get into immediate communication with his superiors  youll hear more from me in the near future said he when the talk had come to an end ill probably be at cedar lodge in two or three days in the meantime if you want to do uncle sam a real service say nothing at all to any outsider of what you have discovered or of your meeting with me  to this the cadets readily consented and then william pollock hurried off to obtain a private turnout in which to get to timminsport as speedily as possible  now i guess there will be something doing up at the parkingham house before long declared gif when they were once more on their way to the lodge  yes and there will be something doing at tony duvals place too returned jack  i wish we could be on hand to see what happens cried randy wistfully  perhaps if the secret service men come up here to make an arrest they will allow us to go along with them added his twin  on account of his ankle which was still somewhat weak spouter had remained at the bungalow when the others returned he listened with keen interest to all they had to tell  gee thats great he exclaimed if those germans are really guilty i hope the government officials round them up in short order  yes and round up tony duval too added fred  what about glutts and werner questioned andy  well if they have been guilty of any treachery toward our government they ought to suffer was the way gif expressed himself  do you know ill feel rather sorry for that herman crouse if he is mixed up in this said jack he seemed to be a pretty decent sort  well in these war times a man has either got to be for uncle sam or against him answered spouter  feeling certain that william pollock would be unable to do anything that afternoon the boys got a hasty lunch and late in the afternoon went out for some more hunting they tramped a distance of over two miles through the snow and managed to bring down several rabbits and likewise a pheasant and some smaller birds  i hope we dont see any more of those wolves said fred when they had started to return to the lodge  look look cried gif suddenly  he had scarcely spoken when jack raised his gun and fired then the oldest rover boy fired again both shots being taken before the others could get their guns into action  its a fox cried randy jack i guess you got him too  i hope so was jacks answer as he stopped to reload his weapon  the animal he had fired at had been running across a small opening between the trees at the first shot the game had made a turn and at the second had given a leap and disappeared into a small hollow filled with snow  when the boys reached the hollow all they could see at first was the snow which had been kicked in several directions but then they caught sight of a bushy tail peeping forth from the white covering  its a fox all right enough exclaimed gif  look out there he may not be dead warned fred if hes alive and you touch him he may give you quite a bite  they advanced with caution and gif turned the animal over with the end of his gun barrel he exposed a large fox of a silvery grey color it was quite dead  a silver fox came from andy  jack youve had your wish said gif its a silver fox all right enough  they dragged it forth from the hollow and examined the animal with much interest the fur was somewhat reddish next to the hide but the tips were white and silver grey  a beautiful piece of fur thats certain said gif your folks will be glad to get it  how about ruth stevenson getting it said randy with a grin and at this remark jack blushed  a part of the next day was spent in skinning both the fox and the wolf the boys wondered if they would see anything of the secret service agent but he did not show himself  they may take their own time about working up this case remarked spouter they may want to get just the right kind of evidence before they close in on the rascals  another day went by and again the lads went forth to try their skill both at hunting and at fishing this time spouter went along and while the others were fishing with more or less success the orator of colby hall had the honor of stirring up a brook mink of fair size and laying it low  youve got a nice little neckpiece there for somebody said jack as he looked at the soft fur of the mink you can count yourself lucky  another sunday was passed in camp but still the secret service agent did not show himself on the sabbath day jed wallop came down to see them they said nothing to the old hunter of what was in the wind  i am sorry to hear your vacation is drawin to a close said jed wallop but you ought to be purty well satisfied over what youve got it aint everybody that can git a silver fox and other foxes too and a wolf and a brook mink not to say anything about rabbits squirrels partridges and sech i think you lads have done wonderful well  i think so myself answered gif  monday morning the young hunters took it easy and it was not until after lunch that they thought of going out once again with their guns  might as well make the best of what time is left to us was the way fred expressed himself before long well have to be at the colby hall grind again  dont mention school to me answered andy this kind of a life suits me down to the heels  the boys were almost ready to leave the lodge when they heard the jingle of sleigh bells and to their surprise saw a large sled approaching filled with the bundledup figures of men  hello it must be those secret service agents cried gif now maybe there will be something doing  all watched the approach of the big sleigh and were then surprised to see that the turnout contained the four germans they had met before and likewise tony duval and a sixth man who was a stranger to them  are you at home called out the largest of the germans the man named bauermann  looks as if we were doesnt it answered jack as he stood in the doorway with the others peering over his shoulders  we would like to have a talk with you young man went on emil bauermann with a frown on his face we came over here on purpose to see you  if you young men have been trying to make trouble for me you shall suffer for it came in a growl from tony duval  who said we were trying to make trouble for you duval demanded gif  bah you cannot fool me garrison said the hunter wrathfully evidently he was greatly excited  duval let me handle this matter remonstrated emil bauermann we want to have a serious talk with you young men he added to the boys  all of the occupants of the big sleigh sprang out in the snow and without waiting for an invitation to do so stalked into the lodge  the germans were evidently in a bad humor and they glowered at the cadets in a way that made them feel far from comfortable  what is it you want demanded gif not liking the manner of their intrusion  we want to come to an understanding growled one of the germans  you cannot play tricks behind our backs without taking the consequences grumbled another  maybe you think youre smart but youll find that we are smarter added a third many a man has been so smart that he has stuck his head into the noose  let me handle this matter broke in emil bauermann and then uttered some words in german an animated discussion in that tongue followed the cadets understanding next to nothing of what was said  i do not like the looks of this at all whispered randy to jack i believe they came here to do us harm  thats the way it looks to me too whispered fred they must have got wind in some way of our being up around their place  the germans had turned to the strange man who was with them and when they pointed to the cadets this stranger nodded evidently he was identifying the boys  it is as i thought said emil bauermann sternly as he glared at the young hunters this man saw you spying around our place and around the duval place what do you mean by such conduct explain yourselves or take my word for it it will go hard with you and he shook a menacing fist in their faces     chapter xxx  the exposureconclusion   it must be confessed that the six cadets did not like the menacing attitude of the five germans and tony duval evidently one of the menthe strangerhad been spying on them and he had carried his information to the others  thats right bauermann make them explain themselves growled tony duval and dont be too easy on em either  see here you have no right to come in here without being invited said gif angrily  poof what are you but a pack of silly schoolboys growled the german perhaps you thought you were doing a wonderful thing spying around our house and our barn you didnt know we had someone watching you all the time  yes and watching you also when you spied on duval broke in another of the men  well what do you want questioned randy after a brief and ominous pause  we want you to tell us just what you have discovered and what you propose to do about it answered emil bauermann and remember i want the plain truth no beating about the bush and he shook a warning finger at the cadets  while the man was speaking jack had stepped to the rear of the crowd now he made a movement to pick up his gun but at this one of the germans rushed forward pulling a pistol from his pocket as he did so  stop that dont you dare to touch that gun the man roared threateningly  you cant order us around in our own house declared gif if you are going to talk like that you can get out  well stay as long as we please and if you boys dont behave yourselves so much the worse for you answered emil bauermann we are going to get to the bottom of your tricks and do it now  suppose we have nothing to say said andy  but you will say something stormed another of the germans if you dontwell you will take the consequences thats all  after this the germans did their best to make the cadets give all the particulars regarding their visit to tony duvals shack and also to the house and barn on the parkingham place they were anxious to ascertain just how much the boys knew and also how much they suspected  but the cadets were on their guard and refused to answer many of the questions put to them this infuriated both the germans and duval and for the time being it looked as if a fight was coming and the cadets might get the worst of it all of the men were armed and they did not permit any of the young hunters to touch their weapons instead one of the men was ordered by bauermann to confiscate the guns and this he did placing them in a heap outside of the lodge  seeing they could get very little out of the cadets and suspecting that the lads were getting ready to notify the authorities the germans held another consultation in their own tongue and then called duval to one side  just as i expected well have to make prisoners of them for the time being said emil bauermann to duval we can take them up in the mountains to that log cabin you spoke about  but we cant take them in the sleigh answered duval  then you and two of my men will have to march them up there on foot we can come up later and bring you supplies  do you think its as bad as all that questioned tony duval nervously  i do they have learned too much and if word of this got to the authorities it might go hard with all of us  thereupon the six cadets were ordered to get their belongings together and prepare to leave the lodge all demurred but the germans and duval showed their weapons and acted so threateningly that there was nothing left to do but to obey  this is the worst yet groaned fred where in the world do they intend to take us  dont ask me replied randy dismally  if only we could get at our guns whispered gif  lets make a dash for them suggested jack  yes and get shot down on the spot returned spouter  with their belongings over their shoulders the six cadets had just been marched out of the lodge when there came an unexpected interruption glancing toward the river jack saw a body of men approaching they were at least eight or ten in number and the man in the lead was william pollock  look look whispered the oldest rover boy to the others there is that secret service agent and he has an armed posse with him  grab the guns and make for the lodge suggested randy  a shout came from the woods as pollock approached this surprised the germans and duval and noting the number of men coming on they were bewildered and did not know what to do it was just such a diversion as the boys were hoping for and in a trice they had rushed for their guns and secured their weapons then jack sent up a shout  mr pollock mr pollock this way here are those germans now and tony duval is with them  the things that happened next came so rapidly that it is almost impossible to describe them at first the germans and duval sought to make resistance and several shots were fired by them the boys and some of the secret service posse fired in return and duval was struck in the arm and one of the germans got a bullet through his leg then the germans and duval made a rush for the sleigh in an endeavor to escape  but william pollock and his men had handled such desperate characters before two of them leaped in front of the moving horses and stopped them while the others surrounded the men in the sleigh and pointed their guns at the fellows  hands up all of you ordered pollock sternly quick now if you dont want us to fire  at heart the germans were cowards and even though they still held their pistols when they saw the uplifted guns of not alone the posse but also the cadets pointed at them they raised their hands without further protest and tony duval did the same and thus the brief but sharp encounter came to a termination  you are making a terrible mistake said emil bauermann lamely we have done no wrong  you can tell your story in court answered william pollock briefly and thereafter he made the germans and duval give up all their weapons then he had some of his men search the evildoers and take from them whatever papers and documents they carried when he had a list of their names he looked well satisfied  bauermann we have been trying to round you up for the past six months said he sternly you know you are wanted for that little affair in philadelphia and at this the german looked much disturbed  the cadets were exceedingly thankful for the opportune arrival of the secret service man and his posse  well i told you i would come said he i was delayed a little though you know in these war times matters do not always move as swiftly as one would want a good deal of the credit for this haul goes to you boys he added with a smile  much to the surprise of the cadets in the crowd of newcomers was herman crouse the germanamerican farmer seemed well satisfied with what had taken place  mr pollock knows that i am trueblue said he that bauermann and the rest of his gang thought they could use me but i have fooled them nicely there is but one country for old herman crouse and that is the good old united states of america and his face beamed as he spoke  thats the right way to talk cried jack you dont know how pleased i am to know the man we hauled out of that train wreck is trueblue  if we had thought you were a traitorous german we might have left you to shift for yourself added randy although maybe i wouldnt have had the heart to do that either he added on second thought  after the germans and duval had been made prisoners they were left at the lodge in charge of two of the secret service men and the cadets then william pollock and the other men took the sleigh and lost no time in making their way to the old parkingham house they had some trouble with the old german housekeeper but wasted no words with her and finally compelled her to tell all she knew the old house was ransacked from top to bottom for evidence against the germans after which the posse turned its attention to the contents of the barn  the results were as william pollock had anticipated these germans aided by a number of others and also by duval were getting ready to erect a fairsized radio station in the woods behind the old house duval had carried many messages for them and also done some trucking he was handinglove with them willing to make money at any cost he told later that both his mother and his grandmother had been germans  as herman crouse had said he had been used to do some trucking for the germans and had likewise been asked to perform a number of errands but gradually he had become suspicious of the men and was thinking seriously of notifying the authorities when the cadets appeared on the scene  and what about bill glutts and gabe werner questioned jack of william pollock later on when the secret service men were getting ready to take the germans and duval away  i cant tell you all the particulars about those two young fellows answered the secret service man the germans evidently used them but whether glutts and werner knew the truth of what the germans were doing remains to be found out  it may be added here that glutts and werner were very much scared over the position in which they found themselves and when the germans and duval came up for a hearing the parents of the two young fellows had all they could do to convince the authorities that gabe and bill were really patriotic  well im mighty glad we are clear of those germans and of tony duval too said gif after the evildoers had been taken away now maybe we can finish our outing in peace  and this they did jed wallop came over to see them and went out with the young hunters a number of times no larger game appeared but they brought down a number of rabbits and squirrels as well as partridges and some smaller birds and with this they had to be content  during those days the boys received several letters from the girls and also a letter from mrs tom rover enclosing one from her husband in france this latter epistle stated that the writer and his brother sam had recovered from the shell wounds received and that dick rover was no longer suffering from the effects of the gas attack he had experienced  gee this is the best news yet cried jack with satisfaction  youve said it came from the twins and freds face also showed his satisfaction  well weve certainly had a wonderful outing declared randy  and how many queer things have happened added his twin i dont believe well ever have as much excitement as this again  but in this surmise andy was mistaken there were many happenings still in store for the boys and what some of them were will be related in our next volume to be entitled the rover boys in the land of luck or stirring adventures in the oil fields  well well be going back to colby hall before long said gif that evening  but first youll have to testify against those germans and tony duval answered spouter  good old colby hall cried jack i dont know but what ill be glad enough to get back there after all and see all the other fellows  and see the girls of clearwater hall too put in andy slyly  well certainly have some stories to tellhow we brought down all that game came from fred his eyes glistening  then in the best of good humor the boys started singing one of their favorite school songs and here we will leave them and say goodbye  the end     other books published by grosset  dunlap new york   this isnt all  would you like to know what became of the good friends you have made in this
