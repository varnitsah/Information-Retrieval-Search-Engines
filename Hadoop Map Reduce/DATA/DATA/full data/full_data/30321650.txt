return i earnestly desired to add to my acquaintance with the natural history of the temperate zones more knowledge of that of the tropics than i bad hitherto had the opportunity of acquiring my choice lay between india and the andes and i decided upon the former being principally influenced by dr falconer who promised me every assistance which his position as superintendent of the heic botanic garden at calcutta would enable hum to give he also drew my attention to the fact that we were ignorant even of the geography of the central and eastern parts of these mountains while all to the north was involved in a mystery equally attractive to the traveller and the naturalist  on hearing of the kind interest taken by baron humboldt in my proposed travels and at the request of my father sir william hooker the earl of carlisle then chief commissioner of woods and forests undertook to represent to her majestys government the expediency of securing my collections for the royal gardens at kew and owing to the generous exertions of that nobleman and of the late earl of auckland then first lord of the admiralty my journey assumed the character of a government mission £400 per annum being granted by the treasury for two years  i did not contemplate proceeding beyond the himalaya and tibet when lord auckland desired that i should afterwards visit borneo for the purpose of reporting on the capabilities of labuan with reference to the cultivation of cotton tobacco sugar indigo spices guttapercha etc to this end a commission in the navy to which service i was already attached was given me such instructions were drawn up as might facilitate my movements in the east and a suitable sum of money was placed at my disposal  soon after leaving england my plans became from various causes altered the earl of auckland it is with a melancholy satisfaction that i here record the intentions of that enlightened nobleman the idea of turning to public account what was intended as a scientific voyage occurred to his lordship when considering my application for official leave to proceed to india and from the hour of my accepting the borneo commission with which he honoured me he displayed the most active zeal in promoting its fulfilment he communicated to me his views as to the direction in which i should pursue my researches furnished me with official and other information and provided me with introductions of the most essential use was dead the interest in borneo had in a great measure subsided hms maeander to which i had been attached for service in labuan had left the archipelago reports of the unhealthy nature of the coast had excited alarm and the results of my researches in the himalaya had proved of more interest and advantage than had been anticipated it was hence thought expedient to cancel the borneo appointment and to prolong my services for a third year in india for which purpose a grant of £300 originally intended for defraying the expense of collecting only in borneo was transferred as salary for the additional year to be spent in the himalaya  the portion of the himalaya best worth exploring was selected for me both by lord auckland and dr falconer who independently recommended sikkim as being ground untrodden by traveller or naturalist its ruler was moreover all but a dependant of the british government and it was supposed would therefore be glad to facilitate my researches  no part of the snowy himalaya eastward of the northwest extremity of the british possessions had been visited since turners embassy to tibet in 1789 and hence it was highly important to explore scientifically a part of the chain which from its central position might be presumed to be typical of the whole range the possibility of visiting tibet and of ascertaining particulars respecting the great mountain chumulari my earliest recollections in reading are of turners travels in tibet and of cooks voyages the account of lama worship and of chumulari in the one and of kerguelens land in the other always took a strong hold on my fancy it is therefore singular that kerguelens land should have been the first strange country i ever visited now fourteen years ago and that in the first kings ship which has touched there since cooks voyage and whilst following the track of that illustrious navigator in south polar discovery at a later period i have been nearly the first european who has approached chumulari since turners embassy which was only known from turners account were additional inducements to a student of physical geography but it was not then known that kinchinjunga the loftiest known mountain on the globe was situated on my route and formed a principal feature in the physical geography of sikkim  my passage to egypt was provided by the admiralty in hm steamvessel sidon destined to convey the marquis of dalhousie governorgeneral of india thus far on his way on his arrival in egypt his lordship did me the honour of desiring me to consider myself in the position of one of his suite for the remainder of the voyage which was performed in the moozuffer a steam frigate belonging to the indian navy my obligations to this nobleman had commenced before leaving england by his promising me every facility he could command and he thus took the earliest opportunity of affording it by giving me such a position near himself as ensured me the best reception everywhere no other introduction being needed his lordship procured my admission into sikkim and honoured me throughout my travels with the kindest encouragement  during the passage out some days were spent in egypt at aden ceylon and madras i have not thought it necessary to give here the observations made in those wellknown countries they are detailed in a series of letters published in the london journal of botany as written for my private friends arriving at calcutta in january i passed the remainder of the cold season in making myself acquainted with the vegetation of the plains and hills of western bengal south of the ganges by a journey across the mountains of birbhoom and behar to the soane valley and thence over the vindhya range to the ganges at mirzapore whence i descended that stream to bhaugulpore and leaving my boat struck north to the sikkim himalaya this excursion is detailed in the london journal of botany and the asiatic society of bengal honoured me by printing the meteorological observations made during its progress  during the two years residence in sikkim which succeeded i was laid under obligations of no ordinary nature to brian h hodgson esq bcs for many years resident at the nepal court whose guest i became for several months mr hodgsons high position as a man of science requires no mention here but the difficulties he overcame and the sacrifices he made in attaining that position are known to few he entered the wilds of nepal when very young and in indifferent health and finding time to spare cast about for the best method of employing it he had no one to recommend or direct a pursuit no example to follow no rival to equal or surpass he had never been acquainted with a scientific man and knew nothing of science except the name the natural history of men and animals in its most comprehensive sense attracted his attention he sent to europe for books and commenced the study of ethnology and zoology his labours have now extended over upwards of twentyfive years residence in the himalaya during this period he has seldom had a staff of less than from ten to twenty persons often many more of various tongues and races employed as translators and collectors artists shooters and stuffers by unceasing exertions and a princely liberality mr hodgson has unveiled the mysteries of the boodhist religion chronicled the affinities languages customs and faiths of the himalayan tribes and completed a natural history of the animals and birds of these regions his collections of specimens are immense and are illustrated by drawings and descriptions taken from life with remarks on the anatomy in this department he availed himself of the services of dr campbell who was also attached to the residency at nepal as surgeon and assistant political agent habits and localities of the animals themselves twenty volumes of the journals and the museum of the asiatic society of bengal teem with the proofs of his indefatigable zeal and throughout the cabinets of the bird and quadruped departments of our national museum mr hodgsons name stands preeminent a seat in the institute of france and the cross of the legion of honour prove the estimation in which his boodhist studies are held on the continent of europe to be welcomed to the himalaya by such a person and to be allowed the most unreserved intercourse and the advantage of all his information and library exercised a material influence on the progress i made in my studies and on my travels when i add that many of the subjects treated of in these volumes were discussed between us it will be evident that it is impossible for me to divest much of the information thus insensibly obtained of the appearance of being the fruits of my own research  dr campbell the superintendent of dorjiling is likewise the governorgenerals agent or medium of communication between the british government and the sikkim rajah and as such invested with many discretionary powers in the course of this narrative i shall give a sketch of the rise progress and prospects of the sanatarium or healthstation of dorjiling and of the anomalous position held by the sikkim rajah the latter circumstance led indirectly to the detention of dr campbell who joined me in one of my journeys and myself by a faction of the sikkim court for the purpose of obtaining from the indian government a more favourable treaty than that then existing this mode of enforcing a request by idouce violencei and detention is common with the turbulent tribes east of nepal but was in this instance aggravated by violence towards my fellowprisoner through the ill will of the persons who executed the orders of their superiors and who had been punished by dr campbell for crimes committed against both the british and nepalese governments the circumstances of this outrage were misunderstood at the time its instigators were supposed to be chinese its perpetrators tibetans and we the offenders were assumed to have thrust ourselves into the country without authority from our own government and contrary to the will of the sikkim rajah who was imagined to be a tributary of china and protected by that nation and to be under no obligation to the east indian government  with regard to the obligations i owe to dr campbell i confine myself to saying that his whole aim was to promote my comfort and to secure my success in all possible ways every object i had in view was as sedulously cared for by him as by myself i am indebted to his influence with jung bahadoor it was in nepal that dr campbell gained the friendship of jung bahadoor the most remarkable proof of which is the acceding to his request and granting me leave to visit the eastern parts of his dominions no european that i am aware of having been allowed either before or since to travel anywhere except to and from the plains of india and valley of katmandu in which the capital city and british residency are situated for the permission to traverse his dominions and to visit the tibetan passes of nepal his prudence and patience in negotiating with the sikkim court enabled me to pursue my investigations in that country my journal is largely indebted to his varied and extensive knowledge of the people and productions of these regions  in all numerical calculations connected with my observations i received most essential aid from john muller esq accountant of the calcutta mint and from his brother charles muller esq of patna both ardent amateurs in scientific pursuits and who employed themselves in making meteorological observations at dorjiling where they were recruiting constitutions impaired by the performance of arduous duties in the climate of the plains i cannot sufficiently thank these gentlemen for the handsome manner in which they volunteered me their assistance in these laborious operations mr j muller resided at dorjiling during eighteen months of my stay in sikkim over the whole of which period his generous zeal in my service never relaxed he assisted me in the reduction of many hundreds of my observations for latitude time and elevation besides adjusting and rating my instruments and i can recall no more pleasant days than those thus spent with these hospitable friends  thanks to dr falconers indefatigable exertions such of my collections as reached calcutta were forwarded to england in excellent order and they were temporarily deposited in kew gardens until their destination should be determined on my return home my scientific friends interested themselves in procuring from the government such aid as might enable me to devote the necessary time to the arrangement naming and distributing of my collections the publication of my manuscripts etc i am in this most deeply indebted to the disinterested and generous exertions of mr l horner sir charles lyell dr lindley professor e forbes and many others and most especially to the presidents of the royal society the earl of rosse of the linnean mr r brown and geological mr hopkins who in their official capacities memorialized in person the chief commissioner of woods and forests on this subject sir william hooker at the same time bringing it under the notice of the first lord of the treasury the result was a grant of £400 annually for three years  dr t thomson joined me in dorjiling in the end of 1849 after the completion of his arduous journeys in the northwest himalaya and tibet and we spent the year 1850 in travelling and collecting returning to england together in 1851 having obtained permission from the indian government to distribute his botanical collections which equal my own in extent and value we were advised by all our botanical friends to incorporate and thus to distribute them the whole constitute an herbarium of from 6000 to 7000 species of indian plants including an immense number of duplicates and it is now in process of being arranged and named by dr thomson and myself preparatory to its distribution amongst sixty of the principal public and private herbaria in europe india and the united states of america  for the information of future travellers i may state that the total expense of my indian journey including outfit three years and a half travelling and the sending of my collections to calcutta was under £2000 of which £1200 were defrayed by government but would have come to much more had i not enjoyed the great advantages i have detailed this sum does not include the purchase of books and instruments with which i supplied myself and which cost about £200 nor the freight of the collections to england which was paid by government owing to the kind services of mr j c melvill secretary of the india house many small parcels of seeds etc were conveyed to england free of cost and i have to record my great obligations and sincere thanks to the peninsular and oriental steam navigation company for conveying without charge all small parcels of books instruments and specimens addressed to or by myself  it remains to say something of the illustrations of this work the maps are from surveys of my own made chiefly with my own instruments but partly with some valuable ones for the use of which i am indebted to my friend captain h thuillier deputy surveyorgeneral of india who placed at my disposal the resources of the magnificent establishment under his control and to whose innumerable good offices i am very greatly beholden  the landscapes etc have been prepared chiefly from my own drawings and will i hope be found to be tolerably faithful representations of the scenes i have always endeavoured to overcome that tendency to exaggerate heights and increase the angle of slopes which is i believe the besetting sin not of amateurs only but of our most accomplished artists as however i did not use instruments in projecting the outlines i do not pretend to have wholly avoided this snare nor i regret to say has the lithographer in all cases been content to abide by his copy my drawings will be considered tame compared with most mountain landscapes though the subjects comprise some of the grandest scenes in nature considering how conventional the treatment of such subjects is and how unanimous artists seem to be as to the propriety of exaggerating those features which should predominate in the landscape it may fairly be doubted whether the total effect of steepness and elevation especially in a mountain view can on a small scale be conveyed by a strict adherence to truth i need hardly add that if such is attainable it is only by those who have a power of colouring that few pretend to in the list of plates and woodcuts i have mentioned the obligations i am under to several friends for the use of drawings etc  with regard to the spelling of native names after much anxious discussion i have adopted that which assimilates most to the english pronunciation for great assistance in this for a careful revision of the sheets as they passed through the press and for numerous valuable suggestions throughout i am indebted to my

england on the 11th of november 1847 and performed the voyage to india under circumstances which have been detailed in the introduction on the 12th of january 1848 the moozuffer was steaming amongst the low swampy islands of the sunderbunds these exhibit no tropical luxuriance and are in this respect exceedingly disappointing a low vegetation covers them chiefly made up of a dwarf palm phoenix paludosa and small mangroves with a few scattered trees on the higher bank that runs along the waters edge consisting of fanpalm toddypalm and terminalia every now and then the paddles of the steamer tossed up the large fruits of nipa fruticans a low stemless palm that grows in the tidal waters of the indian ocean and bears a large head of nuts it is a plant of no interest to the common observer but of much to the geologist from the nuts of a similar plant abounding in the tertiary formations at the mouth of the thames and having floated about there in as great profusion as here till buried

entered and large trees with villages and cultivation replace the sandy spits and marshy jungles of the great gangetic delta a few miles below calcutta the scenery becomes beautiful beginning with the botanic garden once the residence of roxburgh and wallich and now of falconerclassical ground to the naturalist opposite are the gardens of sir lawrence peel unrivalled in india for their beauty and cultivation and fairly entitled to be called the chatsworth of bengal a little higher up calcutta opened out with the batteries of fort william in the foreground thundering forth a salute and in a few minutes more all other thoughts were absorbed in watching the splendour of the arrangements made for the reception of the governorgeneral of india  during my short stay in calcutta i was principally occupied in preparing for an excursion with mr williams of the geological survey who was about to move his camp from the damooda valley coalfields near burdwan to beejaghur on the banks of the soane where coal was reported to exist in the immediate vicinity of watercarriage the great desideratum of the burdwan fields  my time was spent partly at governmenthouse and partly at sir lawrence peels residence the former i was kindly invited to consider as my indian home an honour which i appreciate the more highly as the invitation was accompanied with the assurance that i should have entire freedom to follow my own pursuits and the advantages which such a position afforded me were i need not say of no ordinary kind  at the botanic gardens i received every assistance from dr mclelland dr falconers locum tenens then in temporary charge of the establishment who was very busy superintending the publication of the botanical papers and drawings of his friend the late dr griffith for which native artists were preparing copies on lithographic paper  of the gardens themselves it is exceedingly difficult to speak the changes had been so very great and from a state with which i had no acquaintance there had been a great want of judgment in the alterations made since dr wallichs time when they were celebrated as the most beautiful gardens in the east and were the great object of attraction to strangers and townspeople i found instead an unsightly wilderness without shade the first requirement of every tropical garden or other beauties than some isolated grand trees which had survived the indiscriminate destruction of the useful and ornamental which had attended the wellmeant but illjudged attempt to render a garden a botanical classbook it is impossible to praise too highly dr griffiths abilities and acquirements as a botanist his perseverance and success as a traveller or his matchless industry in the field and in the closet and it is not wonderful that with so many and varied talents he should have wanted the eye of a landscapegardener or the education of a horticulturist i should however be wanting in my duty to his predecessor and to his no less illustrious successor were these remarks withheld proceeding as they do from an unbiassed observer who had the honour of standing in an equally friendly relation to all parties before leaving india i saw great improvements but many years must elapse before the gardens can resume their once proud preeminence  i was surprised to find the botanical gardens looked upon by many of the indian public and even by some of the better informed official men as rather an extravagant establishment more ornamental than useful these persons seemed astonished to learn that its name was renowned throughout europe and that during the first twenty years especially of dr wallichs superintendence it had contributed more useful and ornamental tropical plants to the public and private gardens of the world than any other establishment before or since as an illustration of this i may refer to a report presented to the government of bengal from which it appears that between january 1836 and december 1840 189932 plants were distributed gratis to nearly 2000 different gardens i speak from a personal knowledge of the contents of our english gardens and our colonial ones at the cape and in australia and from an inspection of the ponderous volumes of distribution lists to which dr falconer is daily adding the botanical public of europe and india is no less indebted than the horticultural to the liberality of the hon east india company and to the energy of the several eminent men who have carried their views into execution i here allude to the great indian herbarium chiefly formed by the staff of the botanic gardens under the direction of dr wallich and distributed in 1829 to the principal museums of europe this is the most valuable contribution of the kind ever made to science and it is a lasting memorial of the princely liberality of the enlightened men who ruled the counsels of india in those days no botanical work of importance has been published since 1829 without recording its sense of the obligation and i was once commissioned by a foreign government to purchase for its national museum at whatever cost one set of these collections which was brought to the hammer on the death of its possessor i have heard it remarked that the expense attending the distribution was enormous and i have reason to know that this erroneous impression has had an unfavourable influence upon the destination of scarcely less valuable collections which have for years been lying untouched in the cellars of the india house i may add that officers who have exposed their lives and impaired their health in forming similar ones at the orders and expense of the indian government are at home and thrown upon their own resources or the assistance of their scientific brethren for the means of publishing and distributing the fruits of their labours the indian government itself has already profited largely by these gardens directly and indirectly and might have done so still more had its efforts been better seconded either by the european or native population of the country amongst its greatest triumphs may be considered the introduction of the teaplant from china a fact i allude to as many of my english readers may not be aware that the establishment of the teatrade in the himalaya and assam is almost entirely the work of the superintendents of the gardens of calcutta and seharunpore  from no one did i receive more kindness than from sir james colvile president of the asiatic society who not only took care that i should be provided with every comfort but presented me with a completely equipped palkee which for strength and excellence of construction was everything that a traveller could desire often en route did i mentally thank him when i saw other palkees breaking down and travellers bewailing the loss of those forgotten necessaries with which his kind attention had furnished me  i left calcutta to join mr williams camp on the 28th of january driving to hoogly on the river of that name and thence following the grand trunkroad westward towards burdwan the novelty of palkeetravelling at first renders it pleasant the neatness with which every thing is packed the goodhumour of the bearers their merry pace and the many more comforts enjoyed than could be expected in a conveyance horsed by men the warmth when the sliding doors are shut and the breeze when they are open are all fully appreciated on first starting but soon the novelty wears off and the discomforts are so numerous that it is pronounced at best a barbarous conveyance the greedy cry and gestures of the bearers when on changing they break a fitful sleep by poking a torch in your face and vociferating bucksheesh sahib their discontent at the most liberal largesse and the sluggishness of the next set who want bribes put the traveller out of patience with the natives the dust when the slides are open and the stifling heat when shut during a shower are conclusive against the vehicle and on getting out with aching bones and giddy head at the journeys end i shook the dust from my person and wished never to see a palkee again  on the following morning i was passing through the straggling villages close to burdwan consisting of native hovels by the road side with mangos and figs planted near them and palms waving over their roofs crossing the nearly dry bed of the damooda i was set down at mr mintoshs the magistrate of the district and never more thoroughly enjoyed a hearty welcome and a breakfast  in the evening we visited the rajah of burdwans palace and pleasuregrounds where i had the first glimpse of oriental gardening the roads were generally raised running through rice fields now dry and hard and bordered with trees of jack bamboo melia casuarina etc tanks were the prominent features chains of them full of indian waterlilies being fringed with rows of the fanpalm and occasionally the indian date close to the house was a rather good menagerie where i saw amongst other animals a pair of kangaroos in high health and condition the female with young in her pouch before dark i was again in my palkee and hurrying onwards the night was cool and clear very different from the damp and foggy atmosphere i had left at calcutta on the following morning i was travelling over a flat and apparently rising country along an excellent road with groves of bamboos and stunted trees on either hand few villages or palms a sterile soil with stunted grass and but little cultivation altogether a country as unlike what i had expected to find in india as well might be all around was a dead flat or tableland out of which a few conical hills rose in the west about 1000 feet high covered with a low forest of dusky green or yellow from the prevalence of bamboo the lark was singing merrily at sunrise and the accessories of a fresh air and dewy grass more reminded me of some moorland in the north of england than of the torrid regions of the east  at 10 pm i arrived at mr williams camp at taldangah a dawk station near the western limit of the coal basin of the damooda valley his operations being finished he was prepared to start having kindly waited a couple of days for my arrival  early on the morning of the last day of january a motley group of natives were busy striking the tents and loading the bullocks bullockcarts and elephants these proceeded on the march occupying in straggling groups nearly three miles of road whilst we remained to breakfast with mr f watkins superintendent of the east india coal and coke company who were working the seams  the coal crops out at the surface but the shafts worked are sunk through thick beds of alluvium the age of these coalfields is quite unknown and i regret to say that my examination of their fossil plants throws no material light on the subject upwards of thirty species of fossil plants have been procured from them and of these the majority are referred by dr mclelland reports of the geological survey of india calcutta 1850 to the inferior oolite epoch of england from the prevalence of species of zamia glossopteris and taeniopteris some of these genera together with vertebraria a very remarkable indian fossil are also recognised in the coalfields of sind and of australia i cannot however think that botanical evidence of such a nature is sufficient to warrant a satisfactory reference of these indian coalfields to the same epoch as those of england or of australia in the first place the outlines of the fronds of ferns and their nervation are frail characters if employed alone for the determination of existing genera and much more so of fossil fragments in the second place recent ferns are so widely distributed that an inspection of the majority affords little clue to the region or locality they come from and in the third place considering the wide difference in latitude and longitude of yorkshire india and australia the natural conclusion is that they could not have supported a similar vegetation at the same epoch in fact finding similar fossil plants at places widely different in latitude and hence in climate is in the present state of our knowledge rather an argument against than for their having existed cotemporaneously the cycadeae especially whose fossil remains afford so much ground for geological speculations are far from yielding such precise data as is supposed species of the order are found in mexico south africa australia and india some inhabiting the hottest and dampest and others the driest climates on the surface of the globe and it appears to me rash to argue much from the presence of the order in the coal of yorkshire and india when we reflect that the geologist of some future epoch may find as good reasons for referring the present cape australian or mexican flora to the same period as that of the lias and oolites when the cycadeae now living in the former countries shall be fossilised  specific identity of their contained fossils may be considered as fair evidence of the cotemporaneous origin of beds but amongst the many collections of fossil plants that i have examined there is hardly a specimen belonging to any epoch sufficiently perfect to warrant the assumption that the species to which it belonged can be again recognised the botanical evidences which geologists too often accept as proofs of specific identity are such as no botanist would attach any importance to in the investigation of existing plants the faintest traces assumed to be of vegetable origin are habitually made into genera and species by naturalists ignorant of the structure affinities and distribution of living plants and of such materials the bulk of socalled systems of fossil plants is composed  a number of women were here employed in making gunpowder grinding the usual materials on a stone with the addition of water from the hookah a custom for which they have an obstinate prejudice the charcoal here used is made from an acacia the seiks i believe employ justicia adhatoda which is also in use all over india at aden the arabs prefer the calotropis probably because it is most easily procured the grain of all these plants is open whereas in england closergrained and more woody trees especially willows are preferred  the jungle i found to consist chiefly of thorny bushes jujube of two species an acacia and butea frondosa the twigs of the latter often covered with lurid red tears of lac which is here collected in abundance as it occurs on the plants and is collected by the natives it is called sticklac but after preparation shelllac in mirzapore a species of celtis yields it and the peepul very commonly in various parts of india the elaboration of this dye whether by the same species of insect or by many from plants so widely different in habit and characters is a very curious fact since none have red juice but some have milky and others limpid  after breakfast mr williams and i started on an elephant following the camp to gyra twelve miles distant the docility of these animals is an old story but it loses so much in the telling that their gentleness obedience and sagacity seemed as strange to me as if i had never heard or read of these attributes the swinging motion under a hot sun is very oppressive but compensated for by being so high above the dust the mahout or driver guides by poking his great toes under either ear enforcing obedience with an iron goad with which he hammers the animals head with quite as much force as would break a cocoanut or drives it through his thick skin down to the quick a most disagreeable sight it is to see the blood and yellow fat oozing out in the broiling sun from these great punctures our elephant was an excellent one when he did not take obstinate fits and so docile as to pick up pieces of stone when desired and with a jerk of the trunk throw them over his head for the rider to catch thus saving the trouble of dismounting to geologise  of sights on the road unfrequented though this noble line is there were plenty for a stranger chiefly pilgrims to juggernath most on foot and a few in carts or pony gigs of rude construction the vehicles from the upper country are distinguished by a far superior build their horses are caparisoned with jingling bells and the wheels and other parts are bound with brass the kindness of the people towards animals and in some cases towards their suffering relations is very remarkable and may in part have given origin to the prevalent idea that they are less cruel and stern than the majority of mankind but that the mild hindoo however gentle on occasion is cruel and vindictive to his brother man and to animals when his indolent temper is roused or his avarice stimulated no one can doubt who reads the accounts of thuggee dacoitee and poisoning and witnesses the cruelty with which beasts of burthen are treated a child carrying a bird kid or lamb is not an uncommon sight and a woman with a dog in her arms is still more frequently seen occasionally too a group will bear an old man to see juggernath before he dies or a poor creature with elephantiasis who hopes to be allowed to hurry himself to his paradise in preference to lingering in helpless inactivity and at last crawling up to the second heaven only the costumes are as various as the religious castes and the many countries to which the travellers belong next in wealth to the merchants the most thrivinglooking wanderer is the bearer of ganges holy water who drives a profitable trade his gains increasing as his load lightens for the further he wanders from the sacred stream the more he gets for the contents of his jar  of merchandise we passed very little the ganges being still the high road between northwest india and bengal occasionally a string of camels was seen but owing to the damp climate these are rare and unknown east of the meridian of calcutta a little cotton clumsily packed in ragged bags dirty and deteriorating every day even at this dry season proves in how bad a state it must arrive at the market during the rains when the low wagons are dragged through the streams  the roads here are all mended with a curious stone called kunker which is a nodular concretionary deposit of limestone abundantly imbedded in the alluvial soil of a great part of india often occurring in strata like flints it resembles a coarse gravel each pebble being often as large as a walnut and tuberculated on the surface it binds admirably and forms excellent roads but pulverises into a most disagreeable impalpable dust  a few miles beyond taldangah we passed from the sandstone in which the coal lies to a very barren country of gneiss and granite rocks upon which the former rests the country still rising more hills appear and towering far above all is parasnath the culminant point and a mountain whose botany i was most anxious to explore  the vegetation of this part of the country is very poor no goodsized trees are to be seen all is a low stunted jungle the grasses were few and dried up except in the beds of the rivulets on the low jungly hills the same plants appear with a few figs bamboo in great abundance several handsome acanthaceae a few asclepiadeae climbing up the bushes and the cowage plant now with overripe pods by shaking which in passing there often falls such a shower of its irritating microscopic hairs as to make the skin tingle for an hour  on the 1st of february we moved on to gyra another insignificant village the air was cool and the atmosphere clear the temperature at three in the morning was 65 degrees with no dew the grass only 61 degrees as the sun rose parasnath appeared against the clear grey sky in the form of a beautiful broad cone with a rugged peak of a deeper grey than the sky it is a remarkably handsome mountain sufficiently lofty to be imposing rising out of an elevated country the slope of which upward to the base of the mountain though imperceptible is really considerable and it is surrounded by lesser hills of just sufficient elevation to set it off the atmosphere too of these regions is peculiarly favourable for views it is very dry at this season but still the hills are clearly defined without the harsh outlines so characteristic of a moist air the skies are bright the sun powerful and there is an almost imperceptible haze that seems to soften the landscape and keep every object in true perspective  our route led towards the picturesque hills and values in front the rocks were all hornblende and micaceous schist cut through by trapdykes while great crumbling masses or bosses of quartz protruded through the soil the stratified rocks were often exposed pitched up at various inclinations they were frequently white with effloresced salts which entering largely into the composition tended to hasten their decomposition and being obnoxious to vegetation rendered the sterile soil more hungry still there was little cultivation and that little of the most wretched kind even ricefields were few and scattered there was no corn or gram ervum lens no castoroil no poppy cotton safflower or other crops of the richer soils that flank the ganges and hoogly a very little sugarcane dhal cajana mustard linseed and rape the latter three cultivated for their oil hardly a palm was to be seen and it was seldom that the cottages could boast of a banana tamarind orange cocoanut or date the mahowa bassia latifolia and mango were the commonest trees there being no kunker in the soil here the roads were mended with angular quartz much to the elephants annoyance  we dismounted where some very micaceous stratified rock cropped out powdered with a saline efflorescence an impure carbonate of soda this earth is thrown into clay vessels with water which after dissolving the soda is allowed to evaporate when the remainder is collected and found to contain so much silica as to be capable of being fused into glass dr boyle mentions this curious fact essay on the arts and manufactures of india read before the society of arts february 18 1852 in illustration of the probably early epoch at which the natives of british india were acquainted with the art of making glass more complicated processes are employed and have been from a very early period in other parts of the continent jujubes zizyphus prevailed with the carissa carandas in fruit a shrub belonging to the usually poisonous family of dogbanes apocyneae its berries make good tarts and the plant itself forms tolerable hedges  the country around fitcoree is rather pretty the hills covered with bamboo and brushwood and as usual rising rather suddenly from the elevated plains the jungle affords shelter to a few bears and tigers jackals in abundance and occasionally foxes the birds seen are chiefly pigeons insects are very scarce those of the locust tribe being most prevalent indicative of a dry climate  the temperature at 3 am was 65 degrees at 3 pm 82 degrees and at 10 pm 68 degrees from which there was no great variation during the whole time we spent at these elevations the clouds were rare and always light and high except a little fleecy spot of vapour condensed close to the summit of parasnath though the nights were clear and starlight no dew was deposited owing to the great dryness of the air on one occasion this drought was so great during the passage of a hot wind that at night i observed the wetbulb thermometer to stand 205 degrees below the temperature of the air which was 66 degrees this indicated a dewpoint of 115 degrees or 545 degrees below the air and a saturationpoint of 0146 there being only 0102 grains of vapour per cubic foot of air which latter was loaded with dust the little moisture suspended in the atmosphere is often seen to be condensed in a thin belt of vapour at a considerable distance above the dry surface of the earth thus intercepting the radiation of heat from the latter to the clear sky above such strata may be observed crossing the hills in ribbonlike masses though not so clearly on this elevated region as on the plains bounding the lower course of the soane where the vapour is more dense the hills more scattered and the whole atmosphere more humid during the ten days i spent amongst the hills i saw but one cloudy sunrise whereas below whether at calcutta or on the banks of the soane the sun always rose behind a dense fogbank  at 930 am the blackbulb thermometer rose in the sun to 130 degrees the morning observation before 10 or 11 am always gives a higher result than at noon though the suns declination is so considerably less and in the hottest part of the day it is lower still 330 pm 109 degrees an effect no doubt due to the vapours raised by the sun and which equally interfere with the photometer observations the nw winds invariably rise at about 9 am and blow with increasing strength till sunset they are due to the rarefaction of the air over the heated ground and being loaded with dust the temperature of the atmosphere is hence raised by the heated particles the increased temperature of the afternoon is therefore not so much due to the accumulation of caloric from the suns rays as to the passage of a heated current of air derived from the much hotter regions to the westward it would be interesting to know how far this nw diurnal tide extends also the rate at which it gathers moisture in its progress over the damp regions of the sunderbunds its excessive dryness in nw india approaches that of the african and australian deserts and i shall give an abstract of my own observations both in the vallies of the soane and ganges and on the elevated plateaus of behar and of mirzapore see appendix a  on the 2nd of february we proceeded to tofechoney the hills increasing in height to nearly 1000 feet and the country becoming more picturesque we passed some tanks covered with villarsia and frequented by flocks of white egrets the existence of artificial tanks so near a lofty mountain from whose sides innumerable watercourses descend indicates the great natural dryness of the country during one season of the year the hills and vallies were richer than i expected though far from luxuriant a fine nauclea is a common shady tree and bignonia indica now leafless but with immense pods hanging from the branches acanthaceae is the prevalent natural order consisting of gayflowered eranthemums ruellias barlerias and such hothouse favourites other plants gathered here and very typical of the flora of this dry region were linum trigynum feronia elephantum aegle marmelos helicteres asoca abrus precatorius flemingia various desmodia rhynchosiae glycine and grislea tomentosa very abundant conocarpus latifoliusa loranthus longiflorus and another species phyllanthus emblica various convolvuli cuscuta and several herbaceous compositae  this being the most convenient station whence to ascend parasnath we started at 6 am for the village of maddaobund at the north base of the mountain or opposite side from that on which the grand trunkroad runs after following the latter for a few miles to the west we took a path through beautifully wooded plains with scattered trees of the mahowa bassia latifolia resembling good oaks the natives distil a kind of arrack from its fleshy flowers which are also eaten raw the seeds too yield a concrete oil by expression which is used for lamps and occasionally for frying  some villages at the west base of the mountain occupy a better soil and are surrounded with richer cultivation palms mangos and the tamarind the first and last rare features in this part of bengal appeared to be common with fields of rice and broad acres of flax and rape through the latter of which the blue orobanche indica swarmed the short route to maddaobund through narrow rocky vallies was impracticable for the elephants and we had to make a very considerable detour only reaching that village at 2 pm all the hill people we observed were a finelooking athletic race they disclaimed the tiger being a neighbour which every palkeebearer along the road declares to carry off the torchbearers torch and all bears they said were scarce and all other wild animals but a natural jealousy of europeans often leads the natives to deny the existence of what they know to be an attraction to the proverbially sporting englishman  illustrationold tamarind trees  the site of maddaobund elevated 1230 feet in a clearance of the forest and the appearance of the snowwhite domes and bannerets of its temples through the fine trees by which it is surrounded are very beautiful though several hundred feet above any point we had hitherto reached the situation is so sheltered that the tamarind peepul and banyan trees are superb a fine specimen of the latter stands at the entrance to the village not a broadheaded tree as is usual in the prime of its existence but a mass of trunks irregularly throwing out immense branches in a most picturesque manner the original trunk is apparently gone and the principal mass of root stems is fenced in this with two magnificent tamarinds forms a grand clump the ascent of the mountain is immediately from the village up a pathway worn by the feet of many a pilgrim from the most remote parts of india  parasnath is a mountain of peculiar sanctity to which circumstance is to be attributed the flourishing state of maddaobund the name is that of the twentythird incarnation of jinna sanscrit conqueror who was born at benares lived one hundred years and was buried on this mountain which is the eastern metropolis of jain worship as mount aboo is the western where are their libraries and most splendid temples the origin of the jain sect is obscure though its rise appears to correspond with the wreck of boodhism throughout india in the eleventh century the jains form in some sort a transitionsect between boodhists and hindoos differing from the former in acknowledging castes and from both in their worship of parasnaths foot instead of that of munjagosha of the boodhs or vishnoos of the hindoos as a sect of boodhists their religion is considered pure and free from the obscenities so conspicuous in hindoo worship whilst in fact perhaps the reverse is the case but the symbols are fewer and indeed almost confined to the feet of parasnath and the priests jealously conceal their esoteric doctrines  the temples though small are well built and carefully kept no persuasion could induce the brahmins to allow us to proceed beyond the vestibule without taking off our shoes to which we were not inclined to consent the bazaar was for so small a village large and crowded to excess with natives of all castes colours and provinces of india very many from the extreme w and nw rajpootana the madras presidency and central india numbers had come in good cars well attended and appeared men of wealth and consequence while the quantities of conveyances of all sorts standing about rather reminded me of an election than of anything i had seen in india  the natives of the place were a more negrolooking race than the bengalees to whom i had previously been accustomed and the curiosity and astonishment they displayed at seeing probably many of them for the first time a party of englishmen were sufficiently amusing our coolies with provisions not having come up and it being two oclock in the afternoon i having had no breakfast and being ignorant of the exclusively jain population of the village sent my servant to the bazaar for some fowls and eggs but he was mobbed for asking for these articles and parched rice beaten flat with some coarse sugar was all i could obtain together with sweetmeats so odiously flavoured with various herbs and sullied with such impurities that we quickly made them over to the elephants  not being able to ascend the mountain and return in one day mr williams and his party went back to the road leaving mr haddon and myself who took up our quarters under a tamarindtree  in the evening a very gaudy poojah was performed the car filled with idols was covered with gilding and silk and drawn by noble bulls festooned and garlanded a procession was formed in front and it opened into an avenue up and down which gaily dressed dancingboys paced or danced shaking castanets the attendant worshippers singing in discordant voices beating tomtoms cymbals etc images of boodh apparently abounded on the car in front of which a child was placed the throng of natives was very great and perfectly orderly indeed sufficiently apathetic they were remarkably civil in explaining what they understood of their own worship  at 2 pm the thermometer was only 65 degrees though the day was fine a strong haze obstructing the suns rays at 6 pm 58 degrees at 9 pm 56 degrees and the grass cooled to 49 degrees still there was no dew though the night was starlight  having provided doolies or little bamboo chairs slung on four mens shoulders in which i put my papers and boxes we next morning commenced the ascent at first through woods of the common trees with large clumps of bamboo over slaty rocks of gneiss much inclined and sloping away from the mountain the view from a ridge 500 feet high was superb of the village and its white domes half buried in the forest below the latter of which continued in sight for many miles to the northward descending to a valley some ferns were met with and a more luxuriant vegetation especially of urticeae wild bananas formed a beautiful and to me novel feature in the woods  the conical hills of the white ants were very abundant the structure appears to me not an independent one but the debris of clumps of bamboos or of the trunks of large trees which these insects have destroyed as they work up a tree from the ground they coat the bark with particles of sand glued together carrying up this artificial sheath or covered way as they ascend a clump of bamboos is thus speedily killed when the dead stems fall away leaving the mass of stumps coated with sand which the action of the weather soon fashions into a cone of earthy matter  ascending again the path strikes up the hill through a thick forest of sal vateria robusta and other trees spanned with cables of scandent bauhinia stems at about 3000 feet above the sea the vegetation becomes more luxuriant and by a little stream i collected five species of ferns and some mossesall in a dry state however still higher clematis thalictrum and an increased number of grasses are seen with bushes of verbenaceae and compositae the white ant apparently does not enter this cooler region at 3500 feet the vegetation again changes the trees all become gnarled and scattered and as the dampness also increases more mosses and ferns appear we emerged from the forest at the foot of the great ridge of rocky peaks stretching e and w three or four miles abundance of a species of berberry and an osbeckia marked the change in the vegetation most decidedly and were frequent over the whole summit with coarse grasses and various bushes  at noon we reached the saddle of the crest alt 4230 feet where was a small temple one of five or six which occupy various prominences of the ridge the wind nw was cold the temp 56 degrees the view was beautiful but the atmosphere too hazy to the north were ranges of low wooded hills and the course of the barakah and adji rivers to the south lay a flatter country with lower ranges and the damooda river its all but waterless bed snowywhite from the exposed granite blocks with which its course is strewn east and west the several sharp ridges of the mountain itself are seen the western considerably the highest immediately below the mountain flanks appear clothed with impenetrable forest here and there interrupted by rocky eminences while to the north the grand trunk road shoots across the plains like a white thread as straight as an arrow spanning here and there the beds of the mountain torrents  on the south side the vegetation was more luxuriant than on the north though from the heat of the sun the reverse might have been expected this is owing partly to the curve taken by the ridge being open to the south and partly to the winds from that quarter being the moist ones accordingly trees which i had left 3000 feet below in the north ascent here ascended to near the summit such as figs and bananas a shortstemmed palm phoenix was tolerably abundant and a small tree pterospermum on which a species of grass grew epiphytically forming a curious feature in the landscape  the situation of the principal temple is very fine below the saddle in a hollow facing the south surrounded by jungles of plantain and banyan it is small and contains little worthy of notice but the sculptured feet of parasnath and some marble boodh idols crosslegged figures with crisp hair and the brahminical cord these a leper covered with ashes in the vestibule and an officiating priest were all we saw pilgrims were seen on various parts of the mountain in very considerable numbers passing from one temple to another and generally leaving a few grains of dry rice at each the rich and lame were carried in chairs the poorer walked  the culminant rocks are very dry but in the rains may possess many curious plants a fine kalanchoe was common with the berberry a beautiful indigofera and various other shrubs a bolbophyllum grew on the rocks with a small begonia and some ferns there were no birds and very few insects a beautiful small pontia being the only butterfly the striped squirrel was very busy amongst the rocks and i saw a few mice and the traces of bears  at 3 pm the temperature was 54 degrees and the air deliciously cool and pleasant i tried to reach the western peak perhaps 300 feet above the saddle by keeping along the ridge but was cut off by precipices and ere i could retrace my steps it was time to descend this i was glad to do in a doolie and i was carried to the bottom with only one short rest in an hour and three quarters the descent was very steep the whole way partly down steps of sharp rock where one of the men cut his foot severely the pathway at the bottom was lined for nearly a quarter of a mile with sick halt maimed lame and blind beggars awaiting our descent it was truly a fearful sight especially the lepers and numerous unhappy victims to elephantiasis  though the botany of parasnath proved interesting its elevation was not accompanied by such a change from the flora of its base as i had expected this is no doubt due to its dry climate and sterile soil characters which it shares with the extensive elevated area of which it forms a part and upon which i could not detect above 300 species of plants during my journey yet that the atmosphere at the summit is more damp as well as cooler than at the base is proved as well by the observations as by the vegetation of plants eminently typical of a moister atmosphere i may mention the genera bolbophyllum begonia aeginetia disporum roxburghia panax eugenia myrsine shorea millettia ferns mosses and foliaceous lichens which appeared in strange association with such dryclimate genera as kalanchoe pterospermum and the dwarfpalm phoenix add to this list the berberis asiatica clematis nutans thalictrum glyphocarpum 27 grasses cardamine etc and the mountain top presents a mixture of the plants of a damp hot a dry hot and of a temperate climate in fairly balanced proportions the prime elements of a tropical flora were however wholly wanting on parasnath where are neither peppers pothos arum tall or climbing palms treeferns guttiferae vines or laurels and in some respects as the increased proportion of ferns additional epiphytal orchideous plants begonias and other species showed its top supported a more tropical flora than its base    chapter ii  doomreevegetation of

trunk road following it to the dawk bungalow of doomree on the way i found the caesalpinia paniculuta a magnificent climber festooning the trues with its dark glossy foliage and gorgeous racemes of orange blossoms receding from the mountain the country again became barren at doomree the hills were of crystalline rocks chiefly quartz and gneiss no palms or large trees of any kind appeared the speargrass abounded and a detestable nuisance it was its long awns and husked seed working through trowsers and stockings  balanites was not uncommon forming a low thorny bush with aegle marmelos and feronia elephantum having rested the tired elephant we pushed on in the evening to the next stage baghoda arriving there at 3 am and after a few hours rest i walked to the bungalow of lieutenant beadle the surveyor of roads sixteen miles further  the country around baghoda is still very barren but improves considerably in going westward the ground becoming hilly and the road winding through prettily wooded vallies and rising gradually to 1446 feet nauclea cordifolia a tree resembling a young sycamore is very common with the semul bombax a very striking tree from its buttressed trunk and gaudy scarlet flowers swarming with birds which feed from its honeyed blossoms  at 10 am the sun became uncomfortably hot the thermometer being 77 degrees and the blackbulb thermometer 137 degrees i had lost my hat and possessed no substitute but a silken nightcap so i had to tie a handkerchief over my head to the astonishment of the passersby holding my head down i had little source of amusement but reading the footmarks on the road and these were strangely diversified to an english eye those of the elephant camel buffalo and bullock horse ass pony dog goat sheep and kid lizard wildcat and pigeon with men women and childrens feet naked and shod were all recognisable  it was noon ere i arrived at lieutenant beadles at belcuppee alt 1219 feet glad enough of the hearty welcome i received being very hot dusty and hungry the country about his bungalow is very pretty from the number of wooded hills and large trees especially of banyan and peepul noble oaklike mahowa bassia nauclea mango and ficus infectoria these are all scattered however and do not form forest such as in a stunted form clothes the hills consisting of diospyros terminalia gmelina nauclea parvifolia buchanania etc the rocks are still hornblendeschist and granite with a covering of alluvium full of quartz pebbles insects and birds are numerous the latter consisting of jays crows doves sparrows and maina pastor also the phoenicophaus tristis mahoka of the natives with a note like that of the english cuckoo as heard late in the season  i remained two days with lieutenant beadle enjoying in his society several excursions to the hot springs etc these springs called soorujkoond are situated close to the road near the mouth of a valley in a remarkably pretty spot they are of course objects of worship and a ruined temple stands close behind them with three very conspicuous treesa peepul a banyan and a white thickstemmed leafless sterculia whose branches bore dense clusters of greenish foetid flowers the hot springs are four in number and rise in as many ruined brick tanks about two yards across another tank fed by a cold spring about twice that size flows between two of the hot only two or three paces distant from one of the latter on either hand all burst through the gneiss rocks meet in one stream after a few yards and are conducted by bricked canals to a pool of cold water about eighty yards off  the temperatures of the hot springs were respectively 169 degrees 170 degrees 173 degrees and 190 degrees of the cold 84 degrees at 4 pm and 75 degrees at 7 am the following morning the hottest is the middle of the five the water of the cold spring is sweet but not good and emits gaseous bubbles it was covered with a green floating conferva of the four hot springs the most copious is about three feet deep bubbles constantly boils eggs and though brilliantly clear has an exceedingly nauseous taste this and the other warm ones cover the bricks and surrounding rocks with a thick incrustation of salts  confervae abound in the warm stream from the springs and two species one ochreous brown and the other green occur on the margins of the tanks themselves and in the hottest water the brown is the best salamander and forms a belt in deeper water than the green both appear in broad luxuriant strata wherever the temp is cooled down to 168 degrees and as low as 90 degrees of flowering plants three showed in an eminent degree a constitution capable of resisting the heat if not a predilection for it these were all cyperaceae a cyperus and an eleocharis having their roots in water of 100 degrees and where they are probably exposed to greater heat and a fimbristylis at 98 degrees all were very luxuriant from the edges of the four hot springs i gathered sixteen species of flowering plants and from the cold tank five which did not grow in the hot a waterbeetle colymbetes and notonecta abounded in water at 112 degrees with quantities of dead shells frogs were very lively with live shells at 90 degrees and with various other water beetles having no means of detecting the salts of this water i bottled some for future analysis for an account of the confervae and of the mineral constituents of the waters etc see appendix b  on the following day i botanized in the neighbourhood with but poor success an obliqueleaved fig climbs the other trees and generally strangles them two epiphytal orchideae also occur on the latter vanda roxburghii and an oberonia dodders cuscuta of two species and cassytha swarm over and conceal the bushes with their yellow threadlike stems  i left belcuppee on the 8th of february following mr williams camp the morning was clear and cold the temperature only 56 degrees we crossed the nearly dry broad bed of the burkutta river a noble stream during the rains carrying along huge boulders of granite and gneiss near this i passed the choleratree a famous peepul by the road side so called from a detachment of infantry having been attacked and decimated at the spot by that fell disease it is covered with inscriptions and votive tokens in the shape of rags etc we continued to ascend to 1360 feet where i came upon a small forest of the indian olibanum boswellia thurifera conspicuous from its pale bark and spreading curved branches leafy at their tips its general appearance is a good deal like that of the mountain ash the gum celebrated throughout the east was flowing abundantly from the trunk very fragrant and transparent the ground was dry sterile and rocky kunker the curious formation mentioned at chapter 1 appears in the alluvium which i had not elsewhere seen at this elevation  descending to the village of burshoot we lost sight of the boswellia and came upon a magnificent tope of mango banyan and peepul so far superior to anything hitherto met with that we were glad to choose such a pleasant haltingplace for breakfast there are a few lofty fanpalms here too great rarities in this soil and elevation one about eighty feet high towered above some wretched hovels displaying the curious proportions of this tribe of palms first a short cone tapering to onethird the height of the stem the trunk then swelling to twothirds and again tapering to the crown beyond this the country again ascends to burree alt 1169 feet another dawk bungalow a barren place which we left on the following morning  so little was there to observe that i again amused myself by watching footsteps the precision of which in the sandy soil was curious looking down from the elephant i was interested by seeing them all in relief instead of depressed the slanting rays of the sun in front producing this kind of mirage before us rose no more of those wooded hills that had been our companions for the last 120 miles the absence of which was a sign of the nearly approaching termination of the great hilly plateau we had been traversing for that distance  chorparun at the top of the dunwah pass is situated on an extended barren flat 1320 feet above the sea and from it the descent from the tableland to the level of the soane valley a little above that of the ganges at patna is very sudden the road is carried zizgag down a rugged hill of gneiss with a descent of nearly 1000 feet in six miles of which 600 are exceedingly steep the pass is well wooded with abundance of bamboo bombax cassia acacia and butea with calotropis the purple mudar a very handsome roadside plant which i had not seen before but which with the argemone mexicana was to be a companion for hundreds of miles farther all the views in the pass are very picturesque though wanting in good foliage such as ficus would afford of which i did not see one tree indeed the rarity of the genus except f infectoria in the native woods of these hills is very remarkable the banyan and peepul always appear to be planted as do the tamarind and mango  dunwah at the foot of the pass is 620 feet above the sea and nearly 1000 below the mean level of the highland i had been traversing every thing bears here a better aspect the woods at the foot of the hills afforded many plants the bamboo b stricta is green instead of yellow and white a little castoroil is cultivated and the indian date low and stunted appears about the cottages  in the woods i heard and saw the wild peacock for the first time its voice is not to be distinguished from that of the tame bird in england a curious instance of the perpetuation of character under widely different circumstances for the crow of the wild junglefowl does not rival that of the farmyard cock  in the evening we left dunwah for barah alt 480 feet passing over very barren soil covered with low jungle the original woods having apparently been cut for fuel our elephant a timid animal came on a drove of camels in the dark by the roadside and in his alarm insisted on doing battle tearing through the thorny jungle regardless of the mahout and still more of me the uproar raised by the cameldrivers was ridiculous and the danger to my barometer imminent  we proceeded on the 11th of february to sheergotty where mr williams and his camp were awaiting our arrival wherever cultivation appeared the crops were tolerably luxuriant but a great deal of the country yielded scarcely halfadozen kinds of plants to any ten square yards of ground the most prevalent were carissa carandas olax scandens two zizyphi and the everpresent acacia catechu the climate is however warmer and much moister for i here observed dew to be formed which i afterwards found to be usual on the low grounds that its presence is due to the increased amount of vapour in the atmosphere i shall prove the amount of radiation as shown by the cooling of the earth and vegetation being the same in the elevated plain and lower levels see appendix c  the good soil was very richly cultivated with poppy which i had not seen before sugarcane wheat barley mustard rape and flax at a distance a field of poppies looks like a green lake studded with white waterlilies the houses too are better and have tiled roofs while in such situations the road is lined with trees  a retrospect of the ground passed over is unsatisfactory as far as botany is concerned except as showing how potent are the effects of a dry soil and climate during one season of the year upon a vegetation which has no desert types during the rains probably many more species would be obtained for of annuals i scarcely found twenty at that season however the jungles of behar and birbhoom though far from tropically luxuriant are singularly unhealthy  in a geographical point of view the range of hills between burdwan and the soave is interesting as being the northeast continuation of a chain which crosses the broadest part of the peninsula of india from the gulf of cambay to the junction of the ganges and hoogly at rajmahal this range runs south of the soane and kymore which it meets i believe at omerkuntuk a lofty mountain said to be 70008000 feet high the granite of this and the sandstone of the other being there both overlaid with trap further west again the ranges separate the southern still betraying a nucleus of granite forming the satpur range which divides the valley of the taptee from that of the nerbudda the parasnath range is though the most difficult of definition the longer of the two parallel ranges the vindhya continued as the kymore terminating abruptly at the fort of chunar on the ganges the general and geological features of the two especially along their eastern course are very different this consists of metamorphic gneiss in various highly inclined beds through which granite hills protrude the loftiest of which is parasnath the northeast vindhya called kymore on the other hand consists of nearly horizontal beds of sandstone overlying inclined beds of nonfossiliferous limestone between the latter and the parasnath gneiss come in order of superposition shivered and undulating strata of metamorphic quartz hornstone hornstone porphyry jaspers etc these are thrown up by greenstone i believe along the north and northwest boundary of the gneiss range and are to be recognised as forming the rocks of colgong of sultangunj and of monghyr on the ganges as also various detached hills near gyah and along the upper course of the soane from these are derived the beautiful agates and cornelians so famous under the name of soane pebbles and they are equally common on the curruckpore range as on the south bank of the soane so much so in the former position as to have been used in the decoration of the walls of the now ruined palaces near bhagulpore  in the route i had taken i had crossed the eastern extremity alone of the range commencing with a very gradual ascent over the alluvial plains of the west bank of the hoogly then over laterite succeeded by sandstone of the indian coal era which is succeeded by the granite tableland properly so called a little beyond the coal fields the tableland reaches an average height of 1130 feet which is continued for upwards of 100 miles to the dunwah pass here the descent is sudden to plains which continuous with those of the ganges run up the soane till beyond rotasghur except for the occasional ridges of metamorphic rocks mentioned above and some hills of intruded greenstone the lower plain is stoneless its subjacent rocks being covered with a thicker stratum of the same alluvium which is thinly spread over the higher tableland above this range is of great interest from its being the source of many important rivers the chief rivers from this the great watershed of western bengal flow northwest and southeast a few comparatively insignificant streams running north to the ganges amongst the former are the rheru the kunner and the coyle which contribute to the soane amongst the latter the dammooda adji and barakah flow into the hoogly and the subunrika braminee and mahanuddee into the bay of bengal and of all those which water the country between the soane hoogly and ganges as well as from its deflecting the course of the latter river which washes its base at rajmahal and forcing it to take a sinuous course to the sea in its climate and botany it differs equally from the gangetic plains to the north and from the hot damp and exuberant forests of orissa to the south nor are its geological features less different or its concomitant and in part resultant characters of agriculture and native population still further west the great rivers of the peninsula have their origin the nerbudda and taptee flowing west to the gulf of cambay the cane to the jumna the soane to the ganges and the northern feeders of the godavery to the bay of bengal  on the 12th of february we left sheergotty alt 463 feet crossing some small streams which like all else seen since leaving the dunwah pass flow n to the ganges between sheergotty and the soane occur many of the isolated hills of greenstone mentioned above better known to the traveller from having been telegraphic stations some are much impregnated with iron and whether for their colour the curious outlines of many or their position form quaint and in some cases picturesque features in the otherwise tame landscape  the road being highly cultivated and the datepalm becoming more abundant we encamped in a grove of these trees all were curiously distorted the trunks growing zigzag from the practice of yearly tapping the alternate sides for toddy the incision is just below the crown and slopes upwards and inwards a vessel is hung below the wound and the juice conducted into it by a little piece of bamboo this operation spoils the fruit which though eaten is small and much inferior to the african date  at mudunpore alt 440 feet a thermometer sunk 3 feet 4 inches in the soil maintained a constant temperature of 715 degrees that of the air varying from 775 degrees at 3 pm to 62 at daylight the following morning when we moved on to nourunga alt 340 feet where i bored to 3 feet 8 inches with a heavy iron jumper through an alluvium of such excessive tenacity that eight natives were employed for four hours in the operation in both this and another hole 4 feet 8 inches the temperature was 72 degrees at 10 pm and on the following morning 715 degrees in the deepest hole and 70 degrees in the shallower that of the external air varied from 71 degrees at 3 pm to 57 degrees at daylight on the following morning at the latter time i took the temperature of the earth near the surface which showed surface 53 degrees 1 inch 57 degrees 2 inches 58 degrees 4 inches 62 degrees 7 inches 64 degrees  the following day we marched to baroon alt 345 feet on the alluvial banks of the soane crossing a deep stream by a pretty suspension bridge of which the piers were visible two miles off so level is the road the soane is here three miles wide its nearly dry bed being a desert of sand resembling a vast arm of the sea when the tide is out the banks are very barren with no trees near and but very few in the distance the houses were scarcely visible on the opposite side behind which the kymore mountains rise the soane is a classical river being now satisfactorily identified with the eranoboas of the ancients the etymology of eranoboas is undoubtedly hierrinia vahu sanskrit the goldenarmed sons is also the sanskrit for gold the stream is celebrated for its agates soane pebbles which are common but gold is not now obtained from it  the alluvium is here cut into a cliff ten or twelve feet above the bed of the river and against it the sand is blown in naked dunes at 2 pm the surfacesand was heated to 110 degrees where sheltered from the wind and 104 degrees in the open bed of the river to compare the rapidity and depth to which the heat is communicated by pure sand and by the tough alluvium i took the temperature at some inches depth in both that the alluvium absorbs the heat better and retains it longer would appear from the following the only observations i could make owing to the tenacity of the soil  2 pm surface           104 degrees 225 inches        93 degrees 5 inches           88 degrees sand at this depth 78 degrees 5 am surface            51 degrees 28 inches          68 degrees  finding the fresh milky juice of calotropis to be only 72 degrees i was curious to ascertain at what depth this temperature was to be obtained in the sand of the riverbed where the plant grew  surface    1045 degrees 1 inch     102 degrees 2 inches    94 degrees 25 inches  90 degrees 35 inches  85 degrees compact 8 inches    73 degrees wet 15 inches   72 degrees wet  the power this plant exercises of maintaining a low temperature of 72 degrees though the main portion which is subterraneous is surrounded by a soil heated to between 90 degrees and 104 degrees is very remarkable and no doubt proximately due to the rapidity of evaporation from the foliage and consequent activity in the circulation its exposed leaves maintained a temperature of 80 degrees nearly 25 degrees cooler than the similarly exposed sand and alluvium on the same night the leaves were cooled down to 54 degrees when the sand had cooled to 51 degrees before daylight the following morning the sand had cooled to 43 degrees and the leaves of the calotropis to 455 degrees i omitted to observe the temperature of the sap at the latter time but the sand at the same depth 15 inches as that at which its temperature and that of the plant agreed at midday was 68 degrees and assuming this to be the heat of the plant we find that the leaves are heated by solar radiation during the day 8 degrees and cooled by nocturnal radiation 225 degrees  mr theobald my companion in this and many other rambles pulled a lizard from a hole in the bank its throat was mottled with scales of brown and yellow three ticks had fastened on it each of a size covering three or four scales the first was yellow corresponding with the yellow colour of the animals belly where it lodged the second brown from the lizards head but the third which was clinging to the particoloured scales of the neck had its body particoloured the hues corresponding with the individual scales which they covered the adaptation of the two first specimens in colour to the parts to which they adhered is sufficiently remarkable but the third case was most extraordinary  during the night of the 14th of february i observed a beautiful display apparently of the aurora borealis an account of which will be found in the appendix  february 15our passage through the soane sands was very tedious though accomplished in excellent style the elephants pushing forward the heavy waggons of mining tools with their foreheads the wheels were sometimes buried to the axles in sand and the draught bullocks were rather in the way than otherwise  the body of water over which we ferried was not above 80 yards wide in the rains when the whole space of three miles is one rapid flood 10 or 12 feet deep charged with yellow sand this river must present an imposing spectacle i walked across the dry portion observing the sandwaves all ranged in one direction perpendicular to that of the prevailing wind accurately representing the undulations of the ocean as seen from a masthead or high cliff as the sand was finer or coarser so did the surface resemble a gentle ripple or an oceanswell the progressive motion of the waves was curious and caused by the lighter particles being blown over the ridges and filling up the hollows to leeward there were a few islets in the sand a kind of oases of mud and clay in laminae no thicker than paper and these were at once denizened by various weeds some large spots were green with wheat and barleycrops both suffering from smut  we encamped close to the western shore at the village of dearee alt 330 feet it marks the termination of the kymore hills along whose se bases our course now lay as we here quitted the grand trunk road for a rarely visited country  on the 16th we marched south up the river to tilotho alt 395 feet through a rich and highly cultivated country covered with indigo cotton sugarcane safflower castoroil poppy and various grains dodders cuscuta covered even tall trees with a golden web and the capparis acuminata was in full flower along the road side tilotho a beautiful village is situated in a superb grove of mango banyan peepul tamarind and bassia the date or toddypalm and fanpalm are very abundant and tall each had a pot hung under the crown the natives climb these trunks with a hoop or cord round the body and both ancles and a bottlegourd or other vessel hanging round the neck to receive the juice from the stockbottle in this aerial winecellar these palms were so lofty that the climbers as they paused in their ascent to gaze with wonder at our large retinue resembled monkeys rather than men both trees yield a toddy but in this district they stated that that from the phoenix date alone ferments and is distilled while in other parts of india the borassus fanpalm is chiefly employed i walked to the hills over a level cultivated country interspersed with occasional belts of low wood in which the pensile nests of the weaverbird were abundant but generally hanging out of reach in prickly acacias  the hills here present a straight precipitous wall of horizontally stratified sandstone very like the rocks at the cape of good hope with occasionally a shallow valley and a slope of debris at the base densely clothed with dry jungle the cliffs are about 1000 feet high and the plants similar to those at the foot of parasnath but stunted i climbed to the top the latter part by steps or ledges of sandstone the summit was clothed with long grass trees of diospyros and terminalia and here and there the boswellia on the precipitous rocks the curious whitebarked sterculia foetida flung its arms abroad leafless and looking as if blasted by lightning  a hole was sunk here again for the thermometers and as usual with great labour the temperatures obtained were air 9 pm    645 degrees 530 am 585 degrees 4 feet 6 inches under good shade of trees 9 pm    77 degrees 11 pm   76 degrees 530 am 76 degrees  this is a very great rise of 4 degrees above any of those previously obtained and certainly indicates a much higher mean temperature of the locality i can only suppose it due to the radiation of heat from the long range of sandstone cliff exposed to the south which overlooks the flat whereon we were encamped and which though four or five miles off forms a very important feature the differences of temperature in the shade taken on this and the other side of the river are 275 degrees higher on this side  on the 17th we marched to akbarpore alt 400 feet a village overhung by the rocky precipice of rotasghur a spur of the kymore standing abruptly forward  the range in proceeding up the soane valley gradually approaches the river and beds of nonfossiliferous limestone are seen protruding below the sandstone and occasionally rising into rounded hills the paths upon which appear as white as do those through the chalk districts of england the overlying beds of sandstone are nearly horizontal or with a dip to the nw the subjacent ones of limestone dip at a greater angle passing between the river and a detached conical hill of limestone capped with a flat mass of sandstone the spur of rotas broke suddenly on the view and very grand it was quite realising my anticipations of the position of these eyrielike hillforts of india to the left of the spur winds the valley of the soane with lowwooded hills on its opposite bank and a higher range connected with that of behar in the distance to the right the hills sweep round forming an immense and beautifully wooded amphitheatre about four miles deep bounded with a continuation of the escarpment at the foot of the crowned spur is the village of akbarpore where we encamped in a mango tope on the 24th of june 1848 the soane rose to an unprecedented height and laid this grove of mangos three feet under water it occupies some pretty undulating limestone hills amongst which several streams flow from the amphitheatre to the soane  during our two days stay here i had the advantage of the society of mr c e davis who was our guide during some rambles in the neighbourhood and to whose experience founded on the best habits of observation i am indebted for much information at noon we started to ascend to the palace on the top of the spur on the way we passed a beautiful well sixty feet deep and with a fine flight of steps to the bottom now neglected and overgrown with flowering weeds and creepers it afforded me many of the plants i had only previously obtained in a withered state it was curious to observe there some of the species of the hilltops whose seeds doubtless are scattered abundantly over the surrounding plains and only vegetate where they find a coolness and moisture resembling that of the altitude they elsewhere affect a fine figtree growing out of the stonework spread its leafy green branches over the well mouth which was about twelve feet square its roots assumed a singular form enveloping two sides of the walls with a beautiful network which at highwater mark rainy season abruptly divides into thousands of little brushes dipping into the water which they fringe it was a pretty cool place to descend to from a temperature of 80 degrees above to 74 degrees at the bottom where the water was 60 degrees and most refreshing to look either up the shaft to the green fig shadowing the deep profound or along the sloping steps through a vista of flowering herbs and climbing plants to the blue heaven of a burning sky  the ascent to rotas is over the dry hills of limestone covered with a scrubby brushwood to a crest where are the first rude and ruined defences the limestone is succeeded by the sandstone cliff cut into steps which led from ledge to ledge and gap to gap well guarded with walls and an archway of solid masonry through this we passed on to the flat summit of the kymore hills covered with grass and forest intersected by paths in all directions the ascent is about 1200 feeta long pull in the blazing sun of february the turf consists chiefly of speargrass and andropogon muricatus the kuskus which yields a favourite fragrant oil used as a medicine in india the trees are of the kinds mentioned before a pretty octagonal summerhouse with its roof supported by pillars occupies one of the highest points of the plateau and commands a superb view of the scenery before described from this a walk of three miles leads through the woods to the palace the buildings are very extensive and though now ruinous bear evidence of great beauty in the architecture light galleries supported by slender columns long cool arcades screened squares and terraced walks are the principal features the rooms open out upon flat roofs commanding views of the long endless tableland to the west and a sheer precipice of 1000 feet on the other side with the soane the amphitheatre of hills and the village of akbarpore below  this and beejaghur higher up the soane were amongst the most recently reduced forts and this was further the last of those wrested from baber in 1542 some of the rooms are still habitable but the greater part are ruinous and covered with climbers both of wild flowers and of the naturalised garden plants of the adjoining shrubbery the arbortristis with hibiscus abutilon etc and above all the little yellowflowered linaria ramosissima crawling over every ruined wall as we see the walls of our old english castles clothed with its congener l cymbalaria  in the old dark stables i observed the soil to be covered with a copious evanescent efflorescence of nitrate of lime like soapsuds scattered about  i made rotas palace 1490 feet above the sea so that this tableland is here only fifty feet higher than that i had crossed on the grand trunk road before descending at the dunwah pass its mean temperature is of course considerably 4 degrees below that of the valley but though so cool agues prevail after the rains the extremes of temperature are less marked than in the valley which becomes excessively heated and where hot winds sometimes last for a week blowing in furious gusts  the climate of the whole neighbourhood has of late changed materially and the fall of rain has much diminished consequent on felling the forests even within six years the hailstorms have been far less frequent and violent the air on the hills is highly electrical owing no doubt to the dryness of the atmosphere and to this the frequent recurrence of hailstorms may be due  the zoology of these regions is tolerably copious but little is known of the natural history of a great part of the plateau a native tribe prone to human sacrifices is talked of tigers are common and bears are numerous they have besides the leopard panther viverine cat and civet and of the dog tribe the pariah jackal fox and wild dog called koa deer are very numerous of six or seven kinds a small alligator inhabits the hill streams said to be a very different animal from either of the soane species  during our descent we examined several instances of ripplemark fossil waves footsteps in the sandstone they resembled the fluting of the sigillaria stems in the coalmeasures and occurring as they did here in sandstone a little above great beds of limestone had been taken for such and as indications of coal  on the following day we visited rajghat a steep ghat or pass leading up the cliff to rotas palace a little higher up the river we took the elephants to the mouth of the glen where we dismounted and whence we followed a stream abounding in small fish and aquatic insects dytisci and gyrini through a close jungle to the foot of the cliffs where there are indications of coal the woods were full of monkeys and amongst other plants i observed murraya exotica but it was scarce though the jungle was so dense the woods were very dry containing no palm adroideae peppers orchideae or ferns here at the foot of the red cliffs which towered imposingly above as seen through the tree tops are several small seams of coaly matter in the sandstone with abundance of pyrites sulphur and copious efflorescences of salts of iron but no coal the springs from the cliffs above are charged with lime of which enormous tuff beds are deposited on the sandstone full of impressions of the leaves and stems of the surrounding trees which however i found it very difficult to recognize and could not help contrasting this circumstance with the fact that geologists unskilled in botany see no difficulty in referring equally imperfect remains of extinct vegetables to existing genera in some parts of their course the streams take up quantities of the efflorescence which they scatter over the sandstones in a singular manner  at akbarpore i had sunk two thermometers one 4 feet 6 inches the other 5 feet 6 inches both invariably indicated 76 degrees the air varying from 56 degrees to 795 degrees dew had formed every night since leaving dunwah the grass being here cooled 12 degrees below the air  on the 19th of february we marched up the soane to tura passing some low hills of limestone between the cliffs of the kymore and the river on the shaded riverbanks grew abundance of english genera cynoglossum veronica potentilla ranunculus sceleratus rumex several herbaceous compositae and labiatae tamarix formed a small bush in rocky hillocks in the bed of the river and in pools were several aquatic plants zannichellia chara a pretty little vallisneria and potamogeton the brahminee goose was common here and we usually saw in the morning immense flocks of wild geese overhead migrating northward  here i tried again the effect of solar and nocturnal radiation on the sand at different depths not being able to do so on the alluvium  noon temperature of air 87 degrees surface      110 degrees 1 inch       102 degrees 2 inches      935 degrees 4 inches      84 degrees 8 inches      77 degrees sand wet 16 inches     76 degrees sand wet daylight of following morning surface       52 degrees 1 inch        55 degrees 2 inches      58 degrees 4 inches      67 degrees 8 inches      73 degrees sand wet 16 inches     74 degrees sand wet  from tura our little army again crossed the soane the scarped cliffs of the kymore approaching close to the river on the west side the bed is very sandy and about one mile and a half across  the elephants were employed again as at baroon to push the cart one of them had a bump in consequence as large as a childs head just above the trunk and bleeding much but the brave beast disregarded this when the word of command was given by his driver  the stream was very narrow but deep and rapid obstructed with beds of coarse agate jasper cornelian and chalcedony pebbles a clumsy boat took us across to the village of soanepore a wretched collection of hovels the crops were thin and poor and i saw no palms or good trees squirrels however abounded and were busy laying up their stores descending from the trees they scoured across a road to a field of tares mounted the hedge took an observation foraged and returned up the tree with their booty quickly descended and repeated the operation of reconnoitering and plundering  the bed of the river is here considerably above that at dearee where the mean of the observations with those of baroon made it about 300 feet the mean of those taken here and on the opposite side at tura gives about 400 feet indicating a fall of 100 feet in only 40 miles  near this the sandy banks of the soane were full of martins nests each one containing a pair of eggs the deserted ones were literally crammed full of longlegged spiders opilio which could be raked out with a stick when they came pouring down the cliff like corn from a sack the quantities are quite inconceivable i did not observe the martin feed on them  the entomology here resembled that of europe more than i had expected in a tropical country where predaceous beetles at least carabideae and staphylinideae are generally considered rare the latter tribes swarmed under the clods of many species but all small and so singularly active that i could not give the time to collect many in the banks again the round egglike earthy chrysalis of the sphynx atropos  and the manycelled nidus of the leafcutter bee were very common  a large columnar euphorbia e ligulata is common all along the soane and i observed it to be used everywhere for fencing i had not remarked the e neriifolia and the e tereticaulis had been very rarely seen since leaving calcutta the cactus is nowhere found it is abundant in many parts of bengal but certainly not indigenous  illustrationcrossing the soane with the kymore hills in the distance  from this place onwards up the soane there was no road of any kind and we were compelled to be our own road engineers the sameness of the vegetation and lateness of the season made me regret this the less for i was disappointed in my anticipations of finding luxuriance and novelty in these wilds before us the valley narrowed considerably the forest became denser the country on the south side was broken with rounded hills and on the north the noble cliffs of the kymore dipped down to the river the villages were smaller more scattered and povertystricken with the mahowa and mango as the usual trees the banyan peepul and tamarind being rare the native are of an aboriginal jungle race and are tall athletic erect much less indolent and more spirited than the listless natives of the plains  february 21started at daylight but so slow and difficult was our progress through fields and woods and across deep gorges from the hills that we only advanced five miles in the day the elephants head too was aching too badly to let him push and the cattle would not proceed when the draught was not equal what was worse it was impossible to get them to pull together up the inclined planes we cut except by placing a man at the head of each of the six eight or ten in a team and simultaneously screwing round their tails when one tortured animal sometimes capsizes the vehicle the small carts got on better though it was most nervous to see them rushing down the steeps especially those with our fragile instruments etc  kosdera where we halted is a pretty place elevated 440 feet with a broad stream front the hills flowing past it these hills are of limestone and rounded resting upon others of hornstone and jasper following up the stream i came to some rapids where the stream is crossed by large beds of hornstone and porphyry rocks excessively hard and pitched up at right angles or with a bold dip to the north the number of strata was very great and only a few inches or even lines thick they presented all varieties of jasper hornstone and quartz of numerous colours with occasional seams of porphyry or breccia the racks were elegantly fringed with a fern i had not hitherto seen polypodium proliferum which is the only species the soane valley presents at this season  returning over the hills i found hardwickia binata a most elegant leguminous tree tall erect with an elongated coma and the branches pendulous these trees grew in a shallow bed of alluvium enclosing abundance of agate pebbles and kunker the former derived from the quartzy strata above noticed  on the 23rd and 24th we continued to follow up the soane first to panchadurma alt 490 feet and thence to pepura alt 587 feet the country becoming densely wooded very wild and picturesque the woods being full of monkeys parrots peacocks hornbills and wild animals strychnos potatorum whose berries are used to purify water forms a dense foliaged tree 30 to 60 feet high some individuals pale yellow others deep green both in apparent health feronia elephantum and aegle marmelos the bhel fruit lately introduced into english medical practice as an astringent of great effect in cases of diarrhoea and dysentery were very abundant with sterculia and the dwarf datepalm  one of my carts was here hopelessly broken down advancing on the spokes instead of the tire of the wheels by the banks of a deep gully here the rocks are well exposed they consist of soft clay shales resting on the limestone which is nearly horizontal and this again unconformably on the quartz and hornstone rocks which are confused and tilted up at all angles  a spur of the kymore like that of rotas here projects to the bed of the river and was blazing at night with the beaconlike fires of the natives lighted to scare the tigers and bears from the spots where they cut wood and bamboo they afforded a splendid spectacle the flames in some places leaping zigzag from hill to hill in front of us and looking as if a gigantic letter w were written in fire  the night was bright and clear with much lightning the latter attracted to the spur and darting down as it were to mingle its fire with that of the forest so many flashes appeared to strike on the flames that it is probable the heated air in their neighbourhood attracted them we were awakened between 3 and 4 am by a violent duststorm which threatened to carry away the tents our position at the mouth of the gulley formed by the opposite hills no doubt accounted for it the gusts were so furious that it was impossible to observe the barometer which i returned to its case on ascertaining that any indications of a rise or fall in the column must have been quite trifling the night had been oppressively hot with many insects flying about amongst which i noticed earwigs a genus erroneously supposed rarely to take to the wing in britain  at 830 am it suddenly fell calm and we proceeded to chanchee alt 500 feet the native carts breaking down in their passage over the projecting beds of flinty rocks or as they burned down the inclined planes we cut through the precipitous clay banks of the streams near chanchee we passed an alligator just killed by two men a foul beast about nine feet long of the mugger kind more absorbing than its natural history was the circumstance of its having swallowed a child that was playing in the water as its mother was washing her utensils in the river the brute was hardly dead much distended by the prey and the mother was standing beside it a very touching group was this the parent with her hands clasped in agony unable to withdraw her eyes from the cursed reptile which still clung to life with that tenacity for which its tribe are so conspicuous beside these the two athletes leaned on the bloody bamboo staffs with which they had all but despatched the animal  this poor woman earned a scanty maintenance by making catechu inhabiting a little cottage and having no property but two cattle to bring wood from the hills and a very few household chattels and how few of these they only know who have seen the meagre furniture of danga hovels her husband cut the trees in the forest and dragged them to the hut but at this time he was sick and her only boy her future stay it was whom the beast had devoured  this province is famous for the quantity of catechu its dry forests yield the plant acacia is a little thorny tree erect and bearing a rounded head of well remembered prickly branches its wood is yellow with a dark brickred heart most profitable in january and useless in june for yielding the extract  illustrationsoane valley and kymore hills cochlospermum gossypium and butea frondosa in flower  the butea frondosa was abundantly in flower here and a gorgeous sight in mass the inflorescence resembles sheets of flame and individually the flowers are eminently beautiful the bright orangered petals contrasting brilliantly against the jetblack velvety calyx the nest of the megachile leafcutter bee was in thousands in the cliffs with mayflies caddisworms spiders and many predaceous beetles lamellicorn beetles were very rare even aphodius and of cetoniae i did not see one  we marched on the 28th to kota at the junction of the river of that name with the soane over hills of flinty rock which projected everywhere to the utter ruin of the elephants feet and then over undulating hills of limestone on the latter i found trees of cochlospermum whose curious thick branches spread out somewhat awkwardly each tipped with a cluster of golden yellow flowers as large as the palm of the hand and very beautiful it is a tropical gumcistus in the appearance and texture of the petals and their frail nature the bark abounds in a transparent gum of which the white ants seem fond for they had killed many trees of the leaves the curious rude leafbellows are made with which the natives of these hills smelt iron scorpions appeared very common here of a small kind 15 inch long several were captured and one of our party was stung on the finger the smart was burning for an hour or two and then ceased  at kota we were nearly opposite the cliffs at beejaghur where coal is reported to exist and here we again crossed the soane and for the last time the ford is three miles up the river and we marched to it through deep sand the bed of the river is here 500 feet above the sea and about threequarters of a mile broad the rapid stream being 50 or 60 yards wide and breast deep the sand is firm and siliceous with no mica nodules of coal are said to be washed down thus far from the coalbeds of burdee a good deal higher up but we saw none  the cliffs come close to the river on the opposite side their bases clothed with woods which teemed with birds the soil is richer and individual trees especially of bombax terminalia and mahowa very fine one tree of the hardwickia about 120 feet high was as handsome a monarch of the forest as i ever saw and it is not often that one sees trees in the tropics which for a combination of beauty in outline harmony of colour and arrangement of branches and foliage would form so striking an addition to an english park  there is a large break in the kymore hills here beyond the village of kunch through which our route lay to beejaghur and the ganges at mirzapore the cliffs leaving the river and trending to the north in a continuous escarpment flanked with low ranges of rounded hills and terminating in an abrupt spur mungeesa peak whose summit was covered with a ragged forest at kunch we saw four alligators sleeping in the river looking at a distance like logs of wood all of the shortnosed or mugger kind dreaded by man and beast i saw none of the sharpshouted or garial so common on the ganges where their long bills with a garniture of teeth and prominent eyes peeping out of the water remind one of geological lectures and visions of ichthyosauri tortoises were frequent in the river basking on the rocks and popping into the water when approached  on the 1st of march we left the soane and struck inland over a rough hilly country covered with forest fully 1000 feet below the top of the kymore tableland which here recedes from the river and surrounds an undulating plain some ten miles either way facing the south the roads or rather pathways were very bad and quite impassable for the carts without much engineering cutting through forest smoothing down the banks of the watercourses to be crossed and clearing away the rocks as we best might we traversed the empty bed of a mountain torrent with perpendicular banks of alluvium 30 feet high and thence plunged into a dense forest our course was directed towards mungeesa peak the remarkable projecting spur between which and a conical hill the path led whether on the elephants or on foot the thorny jujubes acacias etc were most troublesome and all our previous scratchings were nothing to this peacocks and junglefowl were very frequent the squabbling of the former and the hooting of the monkeys constantly grating on the ear there were innumerable pigeons and a few floricans a kind of bustardconsidered the best eating gamebird in india from the defile we emerged on an open flat halting at sulkun a scattered village alt 684 feet peopled by a boldlooking race coles the coles like the danghas of the rajmahal and behar hills and the natives of the mountains of the peninsula form one of the aboriginal tribes of british india and are widely different people from either the hindoos or mussulmen who habitually carry the spear and shield we had here the pleasure of meeting mr felle an english gentleman employed in the revenue department this being one of the roads along which the natives transport their salt sugar etc from one province to another  in the afternoon i examined the conical hill which like that near rotas is of stratified beds of limestone capped with sandstone a stream runs round its base cutting through the alluvium to the subjacent rock which is exposed and contains flattened spheres of limestone these spheres are from the size of a fist to a childs head or even much larger they are excessively hard and neither laminated nor formed of concentric layers at the top of the hill the sandstone cap was perpendicular on all sides and its dry top covered with small trees especially of cochlospermum a few larger trees of fici clung to the edge of the rocks and by forcing their roots into the interstices detached enormous masses affording good dens for bears and other wild animals from the top the view of rock river forest and plain was very fine the eye ranging over a broad flat girt by precipitous hillswest the kymore or vindhya range rose again in rugged elevations south flowed the soane backed by ranges of wooded hills smoking like volcanos with the fires of the nativesbelow lay the bed of the stream we had left at the foot of the hills cutting its way through the alluvium and following a deep gorge to the soane which was there hidden by the rugged heights we had crossed on which the greater part of our camp might be seen still straggling onwardseast and close above us the bold spur of mungeesa shot up terminating a continuous stretch of red precipices clothed with forest along their bases and over their horizontal tops  from sulkun the view of the famed fort and palace of beejaghur is very singular planted on the summit of an isolated hill of sandstone about ten miles off a large tree by the palace marks its site for at this distance the buildings are themselves undistinguishable  there are many tigers on these hills and as one was close by and had killed several cattle mr felle kindly offered us a chance of slaying him bullocks are tethered out overnight in the places likely to be visited by the brute he kills one of them and is from the spot tracked to his haunt by natives who visit the stations early in the morning and report the whereabouts of his lair the sportsman then goes to the attack mounted on an elephant or having a roost fixed in a tree on the trail of the tiger and he employs some hundred natives to drive the animal past the lurkingplace  on the present occasion the locale of the tiger was doubtful but it was thought that by beating over several miles of country he or at any rate some other game might be driven past a certain spot thither accordingly the natives were sent who built machans stages in the trees high out of dangers reach mr theobald and myself occupied one of these perches in a hardwickia tree and mr felle another close by both on the slope of a steep hill surrounded by jungly valleys we were also well thatched in with leafy boughs to prevent the wary beast from espying the ambush and had a whole stand of shall arms ready for his reception  when roosted aloft and duly charged to keep profound silence which i obeyed to the letter by falling sound asleep the word was passed to the beaters who surrounded our post on the plainside extending some miles in line and full two or three distant from us they entered the jungle beating tomtoms singing and shouting as they advanced and converging towards our position in the noonday solitude of these vast forests our situation was romantic enough there was not a breath of wind an insect or bird stirring and the wild cries of the men and the hollow sound of the drums broke upon the ear from a great distance gradually swelling and falling as the natives ascended the heights or crossed the valleys after about an hour and a half the beaters emerged from the jungle under our retreat one by one two by two but preceded by no single living thing either mouse bird deer or bear and much less tiger the beaters received about a penny apiece for the days work a rich guerdon for these poor wretches whom necessity sometimes drives to feed on rats and offal  we were detained three days at sulkun from inability to get on with the carts and as the pass over the kymore to the north on the way to mirzapore was to be still worse i took advantage of mr felles kind offer of camels and elephants to make the best of my way forward accompanying that gentleman en route to his residence at shahgunj on the tableland  both the climate and natural history of this flat on which sulkun stands are similar to those of the banks of the soane the crops are wretched at this season the dryness of the atmosphere is excessive our nails cracked and skins peeled whilst all articles of wood tortoiseshell etc broke on the slightest blow the air too was always highly electrical and the dewpoint was frequently 40 degrees below the temperature of the air  the natives are far from honest they robbed one of the tents placed between two others wherein a light was burning one gentleman in it was awake and on turning saw five men at his bedside who escaped with a bag of booty in the shape of clothes and a tempting strong brassbound box containing private letters the clothes they dropped outside but the box of letters was carried off there were about a hundred people asleep outside the tents between whose many fires the rogues must have passed eluding also the guard who were or ought to have been awake    chapter iii  ekpowa ghatsandstonesshahgunjtableland elevation etc gumarabicmangofairaquatic plantsrujubbund stormfalse sunset and sunrisebind

mandencoles and native tribesbhaugulpore rangershorticultural gardens  on the 3rd of march i bade farewell to mr williams and his kind party and rode over a plain to the village of markunda at the foot of the ghat there the country becomes very rocky and wooded and a stream is crossed which runs over a flat bed of limestone cracked into the appearance of a tesselated pavement for many miles there is no pass over the kymore range except this significantly called ekpowaghat onefoot ghat it is evidently a fault or shifting of the rocks producing so broken a cliff as to admit of a path winding over the shattered crags on either side the precipices are extremely steep of horizontally stratified rocks continued in an unbroken line and the views across the plain and soane valley over which the sun was now setting were superb at the summit we entered on a dead flat plain or tableland with no hills except along the brim of the broad valley we had left where are some curious broad pyramids formed of slabs of sandstone arranged in steps by dark we reached the village of roump alt 1090 feet beyond the top of the pass  on the next day i proceeded on a small fast and wofully hightrotting elephant to shahgunj where i enjoyed mr felles hospitality for a few days the country here though elevated is from the nature of the soil and formation much more fertile than what i had left water is abundant both in tanks and wells and ricefields broad and productive cover the ground while groves of tamarinds and mangos now loaded with blossoms occur at every village  it is very singular that the elevation of this tableland 1100 feet at shahgunj should coincide with that of the granite range of upper bengal where crossed by the grand trunk road though they have no feature but the presence of alluvium in common scarce a hillock varies the surface here and the agricultural produce of the two is widely different here the flat ledges of sandstone retain the moisture and give rise to none of those impetuous torrents which sweep it off the inclined beds of gneiss or splintered quartz nor is there here any of the effloresced salts so forbidding to vegetation where they occur wherever the alluvium is deep on these hills neither catechu olibanum butea terminalia diospyros dwarfpalm or any of those plants are to be met with which abound wherever the rock is superficial and irrespectively of its mineral characters  the gumarabic acacia is abundant here though not seen below and very rare to the eastward of this meridian for i saw but little of it in behar it is a plant partial to a dry climate and rather prefers a good soil in its distribution it in some degree follows the range of the camel which is its constant companion over thousands of leagues in the valley of the ganges i was told that neither the animal nor plant flourish east of the soane where i experienced a marked change in the humidity of the atmosphere on my passage down the ganges it was a circumstance i was interested in having first met with the camel at teneriffe and the cape verd islands the westernmost limit of its distribution imported thither however as it now is into australia where though there is no acacia arabica four hundred other species of the genus are known  the mango which is certainly the fruit of india as the pineapple is of the eastern islands and the orange of the west was now blossoming and a superb sight the young leaves are purplishgreen and form a curious contrast to the deep lurid hue of the older foliage especially when the tree is which often occurs dimidiate one half the green and the other the red shades of colours when in full blossom all forms a mass of yellow diffusing a fragrance rather too strong and peculiar to be pleasant  we passed a village where a large fair was being held and singularly familiar its arrangements were to my early associations the women and children are the prime customers for the latter whirlyougorounds toys and sweetmeats were destined to tempt the former little booths of gay ornaments patches for the forehead earrings of quaint shapes bugles and beads here as at home i remarked that the vendors of these superfluities occupy the approaches to this vanityfair as throughout the east the trades are congregated into particular quarters of the cities so here the itinerants grouped themselves into little bazaars for each class of commodity whilst i was engaged in purchasing a few articles of native workmanship my elephant made an attack on a sweetmeat stall demolishing a magnificent erection of barleysugar before his proceedings could be put a stop to  mr felles bungalow whose garden smiled with roses in this wilderness was surrounded by a moat fed by a spring which was full of aquatic plants nymphaea damasonium villarsia cristata aponogeton three species of potamogeton two of naias chara and zannichellia the two latter indifferently and often together used in the refinement of sugar in a large tank hard by wholly fed by rain water i observed only the villarsia indica no aponogeton nymphaea or dammonium nor did these occur in any of the other tanks i examined which were otherwise well peopled with plants this may not be owing to the quality of the water so much as to its varying quantity in the tank  all around here as at roump is a dead flat except towards the crest of the ghats which overhang the valley of the soane and there the sandstone rock rises by steps into low hills during a ride to a natural tank amongst these rocky elevations i passed from the alluvium to the sandstone and at once met with all the prevailing plants of the granite gneiss limestone and hornstone rocks previously examined and which i have enumerated too often to require recapitulation a convincing proof that the mechanical properties and not the chemical constitution of the rocks regulate the distribution of these plants  rujubbund the pleasant spot is a small tarn or more properly the expanded bed of a stream art having aided nature in its formation it is edged by rocks and cliffs fringed with the usual trees of the neighbourhood it is a wild and pretty spot not unlike some birchbordered pool in the mountains of wales or scotland sequestered and picturesque it was dark before i got back with heavy clouds and vivid lightning approaching from the southwest the day had been very hot 3 pm 90 degrees and the evening the same but the barometer did not foretell the coming tempest which broke with fury at 7 pm blowing open the doors and accompanied with vivid lightning and heavy thunder close by and all round though no rain fell  in the clear dry mornings of these regions a curious optical phenomena may be observed of a sunrise in the west and sunset in the east in either case bright and welldefined beams rise to the zenith often crossing to the opposite horizon it is a beautiful feature in the firmament and equally visible whether the horizon be cloudy or clear the white beams being projected indifferently against a dark vapour or the blue serene the zodiacal light shines from an hour or two after sunset till midnight with singular brightness almost equalling the milky way  march 7left shahgunj for mirzapore following the road to goorawal over a dead alluvial flat without a feature to remark turning north from that village the country undulates exposing the rocky nucleus and presenting the usual concomitant vegetation occasionally parklike views occurred which where diversified by the rocky valleys resemble much the noble scenery of the forest of dean on the borders of wales the mahowa especially representing the oak with its spreading and often gnarled branches many of the exposed slabs of sandstone are beautifully waved on the surface with the ripplemark impression  amowee where i arrived at 9 pm is on an open grassy flat about fifteen miles from the ganges which is seen from the neighbourhood flowing among trees with the white houses domes and temples of mirzapore scattered around and high above which the dustclouds were coursing along the horizon  mr money the magistrate of mirzapore kindly sent a mounted messenger to meet me here who had vast trouble in getting bearers for my palkee in it i proceeded the next day to mirzapore descending a steep ghat of the bind hills by an excellent road to the level plains of the ganges unlike the dunwah pass this is wholly barren at the foot the sun was intensely hot the roads alternately rocky and dusty the villages thronged with a widely different looking race from those of the hills and the whole air of the outskirts on a sultry afternoon far from agreeable  mirzapore is a straggling town said to contain 100000 inhabitants it flanks the river and is built on an undulating alluvial bank full of kunker elevated 360 feet above the sea and from 50 to 80 above the present level of the river the vicinity of the ganges and its green bank and the numbers of fine trees around render it a pleasing though not a fine town it presents the usual asiatic contrast of squalor and gaudiness consisting of large squares and broad streets interspersed with acres of low huts and groves of trees it is celebrated for its manufactory of carpets which are admirable in appearance and save in durability equal to the english indigo seed from bundelkund is also a most extensive article of commerce the best coming from the doab for cotton lac sugar and saltpetre it is one of the greatest marts in india the articles of native manufacture are brass washing and cooking utensils and stone deities worked out of the sandstone  there is little native vegetation the country being covered with cultivation and extensive groves of mango and occasionally of guava english vegetables are abundant and excellent and the strawberries which ripen in march rival the european fruit in size but hardly in flavour  during the few days spent at mirzapore with my kind friend mr c hamilton i was surprised to find the temperature of the day cooler by nearly 4 degrees than that of the hills above or of the upper part of the soane valley while on the other hand the nights were decidedly warmer the dewpoint again was even lower in proportion 75 degrees and the climate consequently drier the atmosphere was extremely dry and electrical the hair constantly crackling when combed further west where the climate becomes still drier the electricity of the air is even greater mr griffith mentions in his journal that in filling barometer tubes in affghanistan he constantly experienced a shock  here i had the pleasure of meeting lieutenant ward one of the suppressors of thuggee thuggee in hindostan signifies a deceiver fraud not open force being employed this gentleman kindly showed me the approvers or kings evidence of his establishment belonging to those three classes of human scourges the thug dakoit and poisoner of these the first was the thug a mildlooking man who had been born and bred to the profession he had committed many murders saw no harm in them and felt neither shame nor remorse his organs of observation and destructiveness were large and the cerebellum small he explained to me how the gang waylay the unwary traveller enter into conversation with him and have him suddenly seized when the superior throws his own linen girdle round the victims neck and strangles him pressing the knuckles against the spine taking off his own he passed it round my arm and showed me the turn as coolly as a sailor once taught me the hangmans knot the thug is of any caste and from any part of india the profession have particular stations which they generally select for murder throwing the body of their victim into a well  the dakoit dakhee a robber belongs to a class who rob in gangs but never commit murderarson and housebreaking also forming part of their profession these are all highclass rajpoots originally from guzerat who on being conquered vowed vengeance on mankind they speak both hindostanee and the otherwise extinct guzerat language this is guttural in the extreme and very singular in sound they are a very remarkable people found throughout india and called by various names their women dress peculiarly and are utterly devoid of modesty the man i examined was a short square but far from powerful nepalese with high arched eyebrows and no organs of observation these people are great cowards  the poisoners all belong to one caste of pasie or dealers in toddy they go singly or in gangs haunting the travellers restingplaces where they drop half a rupee weight of pounded or whole datura seeds into his food producing a twentyhours intoxication during which he is robbed and left to recover or sink under the stupifying effects of the narcotic he told me that the datura seed is gathered without ceremony and at any time place or age of the plant he was a dirty illconditioned looking fellow with no bumps behind his ears or prominence of eyebrow region but a remarkable cerebellum  though now all but extinct except in cuttack through ten or fifteen years of unceasing vigilance on the part of government and incredible activity and acuteness in the officers employed the thugs were formerly a wonderfully numerous body who abstained from their vocation solely in the immediate neighbourhood of their own villages which however were not exempt from the visits of other thugs so that as major sleeman saysthe annually returning tide of murder swept unsparingly over the whole face of india from the sutlej to the seacoast and from the himalaya to cape comorin one narrow district alone was free the concan beyond the ghats whither they never penetrated in bengal river thugs replace the travelling practitioner candeish and rohilkund alone harboured no thugs as residents but they were nevertheless haunted by the gangs  their origin is uncertain but supposed to be very ancient soon after the mahommedan conquest they now claim a divine original and are supposed to have supernatural powers and to be the emissaries of the divinity like the wolf the tiger and the bear it is only lately that they have swarmed so prodigiouslyseven original gangs having migrated from delhi to the gangetic provinces about 200 years ago and from these all the rest have sprung many belong to the most amiable intelligent and respectable classes of the lower and even middle ranks they love their profession regard murder as sport and are never haunted with dreams or troubled with pangs of conscience during hours of solitude or in the last moments of life the victim is an acceptable sacrifice to the goddess davee who by some classes is supposed to eat the lifeless body and thus save her votaries the necessity of concealing it  they are extremely superstitious always consulting omens such as the direction in which a hare or jackall crosses the road and even far more trivial circumstances will determine the fate of a dozen of people and perhaps of an immense treasure all worship the pickaxe which is symbolical of their profession and an oath sworn on it binds closer than on the koran the consecration of this weapon is a most elaborate ceremony and takes place only under certain trees they rise through various grades the lowest are scouts the second sextons the third are holders of the victims hands the highest stranglers  though all agree in never practising cruelty or robbing previous to murder never allowing any but infants to escape and these are trained to thuggeeand never leaving a trace of such goods as may be identifiedthere are several variations in their mode of conducting operations some tribes spare certain castes others none murder of woman is against all rules but the practice crept into certain gangs and this it is which led to their discountenance by the goddess davee and the consequent downfall of the system davee they say allowed the british to punish them because a certain gang had murdered the mothers to obtain their daughters to be sold to prostitution  major sleeman has constructed a map demonstrating the number of bails or regular stations for committing murder in the kingdom of oude alone which is 170 miles long by 100 broad and in which are 274 which are regarded by the thug with as much satisfaction and interest as a game preserve is in england nor are these bails less numerous in other parts of india of twenty assassins who were examined one frankly confessed to having been engaged in 931 murders and the least guilty of the number to 24 sometimes 150 persons collected into one gang and their profits have often been immense the murder of six persons on one occasion yielding 82000 rupees upwards of 8000 pounds  of the various facilities for keeping up the system the most prominent are the practice amongst the natives of travelling before dawn of travellers mixing freely together and taking their meals by the wayside instead of in villages in the very bails in fact to which they are inveigled by the thug in the shape of a fellowtraveller money remittances are also usually made by disguised travellers whose treasure is exposed at the customhouses and worst of all the bankers will never own to the losses they sustain which as a visitation of god would if avenged lead they think to future and perhaps heavier punishment had the thugs destroyed englishmen they would quickly have been put down but the system being invariably practised on a class of people acknowledging the finger of the deity in its execution its glaring enormities were long in rousing the attention of the indian government  a few examples of the activity exercised by the suppressors may be interesting they act wholly through the information given by approvers who are simply kings evidences of 600 thugs engaged in the murder of 64 people and the plunder of nearly 20000 pounds all except seventy were captured in ten years though separated into six gangs and their operations continued from 1826 to 1830 the last party was taken in 1836 and again between the years 1826 and 1835 1562 thugs were seized of whom 382 were hanged and 909 transported so that now it is but seldom these wretches are ever heard of  to show the extent of their operations i shall quote an anecdote from sleemans reports to which i am indebted for most of the above information he states that he was for three years in charge of a district on the nerbudda and considered himself acquainted with every circumstance that occurred in the neighbourhood yet during that time 100 people were murdered and buried within less than a quarter of a mile of his own residence  two hundred and fifty boats full of river thugs in crews of fifteen infested the ganges between benares and calcutta during five months of every year under pretence of conveying pilgrims travellers along the banks were tracked and offered a passage which if refused in the first boat was probably accepted in some other at a given signal the crews rushed in doubled up the decoyed victim broke his back and threw him into the river where floating corpses are too numerous to elicit even an exclamation  at mirzapore i engaged a boat to carry me down the river to bhagulpore whence i was to proceed to the sikkimhimalaya the vessel which though slow and very shabby had the advantage of being cooler and more commodious than the handsomer craft its appearance was not unlike that of a floating haystack or thatched cottage its length was forty feet and breadth fifteen and it drew a foot and a half of water the deck on which a kind of house neatly framed of matting was erected was but a little above the waters edge my portion of this floating residence was lined with a kind of reedwork formed of long culms of saccharum the crew and captain consisted of six naked hindoos one of whom steered by the huge rudder sitting on a bamboostage astern the others pulled four oars in the very bows opposite my door or tracked the boat along the riverbank  in my room for cabin i cannot call it stood my palkee fitted as a bed with mosquito curtains a chair and table on one side were placed all my papers and plants under arrangement to go home on the other my provisions rice sugar currypowder a preserved ham and cheese etc around hung telescope botanical box dark lantern barometer and thermometer etc etc our position was often ashore and hindoolike on the leeshore going bump bump bump so that i could hardly write i considered myself fortunate in having to take this slow conveyance down it enabling me to write and arrange all day long  i left on the 15th of march and in the afternoon of the same day passed chunar the first station at which henry martyn laboured in india this is a tabular mass of sandstone projecting into the river and the eastern termination of the kymore range there is not a rock between this and the himalaya and barely a stone all the way down the ganges till the granite and gneiss rocks of the behar range are again met with the current of the ganges is here very strong and its breadth much lessened the river runs between high banks of alluvium containing much kunker at benares it expands into a broad stream with a current which during the rains is said to flow eight miles an hour when the waters rise 43 feet the fall hence is 300 feet to its junction with the hooghly viz one foot to every mile my observations made that from mirzapore to benares considerably greater  benares is the athens of india the variety of buildings along the bank is incredible there are temples of every shape in all stages of completion and dilapidation and at all angles of inclination for the banks give way so much that many of these edifices are fearfully out of the perpendicular  the famed mosque built by aurungzebe on the site of a hindoo temple is remarkable for its two octagonal minarets 232 feet above the ganges the view from it over the town especially of the european residents quarter is fine but the building itself is deficient in beauty or ornament it commands the muddy river with its thousands of boats its waters peopled with swimmers and bathers who spring in from the many temples waterterraces and ghats on the city side opposite is a great sandy plain the town below looks a mass of poor square flatroofed houses of which 12000 are brick and 16000 mud and thatch through the crowd of which and of small temples the eye wanders in vain for some attractive feature or evidence of the wealth the devotion the science or the grandeur of a city celebrated throughout the east for all these attributes green parrots and pigeons people the air  the general appearance of an oriental town is always more or less ruinous and here the eye is fatigued with bricks and crumbling edifices and the ear with prayerbells the bright meadows and green trees which adorn the european residents dwelling some four miles back from the river alone relieve the monotony of the scene the streets are so narrow that it is difficult to ride a horse through them and the houses are often six stories high with galleries crossing above from house to house these tall gaunt edifices sometimes give place to clumps of cottages and a mass of dusty ruins the unsavoury retreats of vermin and filth where the calotropis arborea generally spreads its white branches and glaucous leavesa dusty plant here too enormous spiders webs hang from the crumbling walls choked also with dust and resembling curtains of coarse muslin being often some yards across and not arranged in radii and arcs but spun like weavers woofs paintings remarkable only for their hideous proportions and want of perspective are daubed in vermilion ochre and indigo the elephant camel and porpoise of the ganges dog shepherd peacock and horse are especially frequent and so is a running pattern of a hand spread open with a bloodred spot on the palm a still less elegant but frequent object is the fuel which is composed of the manure collected on the roads of the city moulded into flat cakes and stuck by the women on the walls to dry retaining the signmanual of the artist in the impressed form of her outspread hand the cognizance of the rajah two fish chained together appears over the gates of public buildings  the hundreds of temples and shrines throughout the city are its most remarkable feature sacred bulls and lingams of all sizes strewed with flowers and grains of rice meet the eye at every turn and the citys boast is the possession of one million idols which of one kind and another i can well believe the great hindoo festival of the holi was now celebrating and the city more than ordinarily crowded throwing red powder lac and flour with rosewater is the great diversion at a festival more childish by far than a carnival  through the kindness of mr reade the commissioner i obtained admission to the bishisharkumardil the holiest of holies it was a small low stone building daubed with red inside and swarming with stone images of brahminee bulls and various disgusting emblems a fat old brahmin naked to the waist took me in but allowed no followers and what with my ignorance of his phraseology the clang of bells and din of voices i gained but little information some fine bells from nepal were evidently the lion of the temple i emerged adorned with a chaplet of magnolia flowers and with my hands full of calotropis and nyctanthes blossoms it was a horrid place for noise smell and sights thence i went to a holy well rendered sacred because siva when stepping from the himalaya to ceylon accidentally let a medicine chest fall into it the natives frequent it with little basins or baskets

hungry the observatory is nominally supported by the rajah of jeypore who doles out a too scanty pittance to his scientific corps  in the afternoon mr reade drove me to the sarnath a singular boodhist temple a cylindrical mass of brickwork faced with stone the scrolls on which were very beautiful and as sharp as if freshly cut it is surmounted by a tall dome and is altogether about seventy or a hundred feet high of the boodh figures only one remains the others having been used by a recent magistrate of benares in repairing a bridge over the goomtee from this place the boodhist monuments hindoo temple mussulman mosque and english church were all embraced in one coup doeil on our return we drove past many enormous mounds of earth and brickwork the vestiges of old benares but whether once continued to the present city or not is unknown remains are abundant eighteen feet below the site of the present city  benares is the mecca of the hindoos and the number of pilgrims who visit it is incalculable casi its ancient name signifying splendid is alleged to be no part of this world which rests on eternity whereas benares is perched on a prong of sivas trident and is hence beyond the reach of earthquakes probably an allusion to the infrequency of these phenomena in this meridian they being common both in eastern bengal and in western india beyond the ganges originally built of gold the sins of the inhabitants were punished by its transmutation into stone and latterly into mud and thatch whoever enters it and especially visits its principal idol siva fossilised is secure of heaven  on the 18th i left benares for ghazepore a pretty town situated on the north bank of the river celebrated for its manufacture of rosewater the tomb of lord cornwallis and a site of the companys stud the rose gardens surround the town they are fields with low bushes of the plant grown in rows red with blossoms in the morning all of which are however plucked long before midday the petals are put into clay stills with twice their weight of water and the produce exposed to the fresh air for a night in open vessels the unskimmed water affords the best and it is often twice and even oftener distilled but the fluid deteriorates by too much distillation the attar is skimmed from the exposed pans and sells at 10 pounds the rupee weight to make which 20000 flowers are required it is frequently adulterated with sandalwood oil  lord cornwallis mausoleum is a handsome building modelled by flaxman after the sybils temple the allegorical designs of hindoos and sorrowing soldiers with reversed arms which decorate two sides of the enclosed tomb though perhaps as good as can be are under any treatment unclassical and uncouth the simple laurel and oakleaf chaplets on the alternating faces are far more suitable and suggestive  march 21i left ghazepore and dropped down the ganges the general features of which are soon described a strong current four or five miles broad of muddy water flows between a precipitous bank of alluvium or sand on one side and a flat shelving one of sand or more rarely mud on the other sandbanks are frequent in the river especially where the great affluents debouche and there generally are formed vast expanses of sand small saharas studded with stalking pillars of sand raised seventy or eighty feet high by gusts of wind erect stately gravelooking columns all shaft with neither basement nor capital the genii of the arabian nights the river is always dotted with boats of all shapes mine being perhaps of the most common description the great square yankeelike steamers towing their accommodationboats as the passengers floating hotels are called are the rarest trees are few on the banks except near villages and there is hardly a palm to be seen above patna towns are unfrequent such as there are being mere collections of huts with the ghat and boats at the bottom of the bank and at a respectful distance from the bazaar stand the neat bungalows of the european residents with their smiling gardens hedgings and fencings and loitering servants at the door a rotting charpoy or bedstead on the banks is a common sight the sola reliquia of some poor hindoo who departs this life by the side of the stream to which his body is afterwards committed  shoals of small goggledeyed fish are seen that spring clear out of the water and are preyed upon by terns and other birds a few insects skim the surface turtle and porpoises tumble along all forming a very busy contrast to the lazy alligator sunning his green and scaly back near the shore with his ichthyosaurian snout raised high above the water birds are numerous especially early and late in the day along the silent shore the hungry pariah dog may be seen tearing his meal from some stranded corpse whilst the adjutantbird with his head sunk on his body and one leg tucked up patiently awaits his turn at night the beautiful brahminee geese alight one by one and seek total solitude ever since having disturbed a god in his slumbers these birds are fated to pass the night in single blessedness the gulls and terns again roost in flocks as do the wild geese and pelicansthe latter however not till after making a hearty and very noisy supper these birds congregate by the sides of pools and beat the water with violence so as to scare the fish which thus become an easy prey a fact which was i believe first indicated by pallas during his residence on the banks of the caspian sea shells are scarce and consist of a few small bivalves their comparative absence is probably due to the paucity of limestone in the mountains whence the many feeders flow the sand is pure white and smallgrained with fragments of hornblende and mica the latter varying in abundance as a feeder is near or far away pink sand i have seen the same garnet sand covering the bottom of the himalayan torrents where it is the produce of disintegrated gneiss and whence it is transported to the ganges of garnets is very common and deposited in layers interstratified with the white quartz sand wormmarks ripplemarks and the footsteps of alligators birds and beasts abound in the wet sand the vegetation of the banks consists of annuals which find no permanent restingplace along the sandy shores the everpresent plants are mostly english as dock a nasturtium ranunculus sceleratus fumitory juncus bufonius common vervain gnaphalium luteoalbum and very frequently veronica anagallise on the alluvium grow the same mixed with tamarisk acacia arabica and a few other bushes  withered grass abounds and wheat dhal cajanus and gram cicer arietinum carthamus vetches and rice are the staple products of the country bushes are few except the universally prevalent adhatoda and calotropis trees also are rare and of stunted growth figs the artocarpus and some leguminosa prevail most i saw but two kinds of palm the fanpalm and phoenix the latter is characteristic of the driest locality then for the animal creation men women and children abound both on the banks and plying up and down the ganges the humped cow of which the ox is used for draught is common camels i occasionally observed and more rarely the elephant poneys goats and dogs muster strong porpoises and alligators infest the river even above benares flies and mosquitos are terrible pests and so are the odious flyingbugs large hemipterous insects of the genus derecteryx which insinuate themselves between ones skin and clothes diffusing a dreadful odour which is increased by any attempt to touch or remove them in the evening it was impossible to keep insects out of the boat or to hinder their putting the lights out and of these the most intolerable was the abovementioned flyingbug saucy crickets too swarm and spring up at ones face whilst mosquitos maintain a constant guerilla warfare trying to the patience no less than to the nerves thick webs of the gossamer spider float across the river during the heat of the day as coarse as fine thread and being inhaled keep tickling the nose and lips  on the 18th the morning commenced with a duststorm the horizon was about 20 yards off and ashy white with clouds of sand the trees were scarcely visible and everything in my boat was covered with a fine coat of impalpable powder collected from the boundless alluvial plains through which the ganges flows trees were scarcely discernible and so dry was the wind that drops of water vanished like magic neither ferns mosses nor lichens grow along the banks of the ganges they cannot survive the transition from parching like this to the three months floods at midsummer when the country is for miles under water  march 23passed the mouth of the soane a vast expanse of sand dotted with droves of camels and soon after the widespread spits of sand along the north bank announced the mouth of the gogra one of the vastest of the many himalayan affluents of the ganges  on the 25th of march i reached dinapore a large military station sufficiently insalubrious particularly for european troops the barracks being so misplaced that the inmates are suffocated the buildings run east and west instead of north and south and therefore lose all the breeze in the hottest weather from this place i sent the boat down to patna and proceeded thither by land to the house of dr irvine an old acquaintance and botanist from whom i received a most kind welcome on the road bengal forms of vegetation to which i had been for three months a stranger reappeared likewise groves of fan and toddy palms which are both very rare higher up the river clumps of large bamboo orange acacia sissoo melia guatteria longifolia spondias mangifera odina euphorbia pentagona neriifolia and trigona were common roadside plants in the gardens papaw croton jatropha buddleia cookia loquat litchi longan all kinds of the orange tribe and the cocoanut some from their presence and many from their profusion indicated a decided change of climate a receding from the desert northwest of india and its dry winds and an approach to the damper regions of the manymouthed ganges  my main object at patna being to see the opium godowns stores i waited on dr corbett the assistantagent who kindly explained everything to me and to whose obliging attentions i am much indebted  the ei company grant licences for the cultivation of the poppy and contract for all the produce at certain rates varying with the quality no opium can be grown without this licence and an advance equal to about twothirds of the value of the produce is made to the grower this produce is made over to district collectors who approximately fix the worth of the contents of each jar and forward it to patna where rewards are given for the best samples and the worst are condemned without payment but all is turned to some account in the reduction of the drug to a state fit for market  the poppy flowers in the end of january and beginning of february and the capsules are sliced in february and march with a little instrument like a saw made of three iron plates with jagged edges tied together the cultivation is very carefully conducted nor are there any very apparent means of improving this branch of commerce and revenue during the nw or dry winds the best opium is procured the worst during the moist or e and ne when the drug imbibes moisture and a watery bad solution of opium collects in cavities of its substance and is called passewa according to the absence of which the opium is generally prized  at the end of march the opium jars arrive at the stores by water and by land and continue accumulating for some weeks every jar is labelled and stowed in a proper place separately tested with extreme accuracy and valued when the whole quantity has been received the contents of all the jars are thrown into great vats occupying a very large building whence the mass is distributed to be made up into balls for the markets this operation is carried on in a long paved room where every man is ticketed and many overseers are stationed to see that the work is properly conducted each workman sits on a stool with a double stage and a tray before him on the top stage is a tin basin containing opium sufficient for three balls in the lower another basin holding water in the tray stands a brass hemispherical cup in which the ball is worked to the mans right hand is another tray with two compartments one containing thin pancakes of poppy petals pressed together the other a cupful of sticky opiumwater made from refuse opium the man takes the brass cup and places a pancake at the bottom smears it with opiumwater and with many plies of the pancakes makes a coat for the opium of this he takes about onethird of the mass before him puts it inside the petals and agglutinates many other coats over it the balls are then again weighed and reduced or increased to a certain weight if necessary at the days end each man takes his work to a rack with numbered compartments and deposits it in that which answers to his own number thence the balls each being put in a clay cup are carried to an enormous dryingroom where they are exposed in tiers and constantly examined and turned to prevent their being attacked by weevils which are very prevalent during moist winds little boys creeping along the racks all day long for this purpose when dry the balls are packed in two layers of six each in chests with the stalks dried leaves and capsules of the plant and sent down to calcutta a little opium is prepared of very fine quality for the government hospitals and some for general sale in india but the proportion is trifling and such is made up into square cakes a good workman will prepare from thirty to fifty balls a day the total produce being 10000 to 12000 a day during one working season 1353000 balls are manufactured for the chinese market alone  the poppypetal pancakes each about a foot radius are made in the fields by women by the simple operation of pressing the fresh petals together they are brought in large baskets and purchased at the commencement of the season the liquor with which the pancakes are agglutinated together by the ballmaker and worked into the ball is merely inspissated opiumwater the opium for which is derived from the condemned opium passewa the washing of the utensils and of the workmen every one of whom is nightly laved before he leaves the establishment and the water is inspissated thus not a particle of opium is lost to encourage the farmers the refuse stalks leaves and heads are bought up to pack the balls with but this is far from an economical plan for it is difficult to keep the refuse from damp and insects  a powerful smell of opium pervaded these vast buildings which dr corbett i am greatly indebted to mr oldfield the opium agent and to dr corbett for a complete set of specimens implements and drawings illustrating the cultivation and manufacture of opium they are exhibited in the kew museum of economic botany assured me did not affect himself or the assistants the men work ten hours a day becoming sleepy in the afternoon but this is only natural in the hot season they are rather liable to eruptive diseases possibly engendered by the nature of their occupation  even the best east indian opium is inferior to the turkish and owing to peculiarities of climate will probably always be so it never yields more than five per cent of morphia whence its inferiority but is as good in other respects and even richer in narcotine  the care and attention devoted to every department of collecting testing manipulating and packing is quite extraordinary and the result has been an impulse to the trade beyond what was anticipated the natives have been quick at apprehending and supplying the wants of the market and now there are more demands for licences to grow opium than can be granted all the opium eaten in india is given out with a permit to licensed dealers and the drug is so adulterated before it reaches the retailers in the bazaars that it does not contain onethirtieth part of the intoxicating power that it did when pure  patna is the stronghold of mahommedanism and from its central position its command of the ganges and its proximity to nepal which latter has been aptly compared to a drawn dagger pointed at the heart of india it is an important place for this reason there are always a european and several native regiments stationed there in the neighbourbood there is little to be seen and the highly cultivated flat country is unfavourable to native vegetation  the mudar plant calotropis was abundant here but i found that its properties and nomenclature were far from settled points on the banks of the ganges the larger whiteflowered subarboreous species prevailed in the interior and along my whole previous route the smaller purpleflowered kind only was seen mr davis of rotas was in the habit of using the medicine copiously and vouched for the cure of eighty cases chiefly of leprosy by the white mudar gathered on the ganges whilst the purple of rotas and the neighbourhood was quite inert dr irvine again used the purple only and found the white inert the european and native doctors who knew the two plants all gave the preference to the white except dr irvine whose experience over various parts of india is entitled to great weight  march 29dropped down the river experiencing a succession of east and northeast winds during the whole remainder of the voyage these winds are very prevalent throughout the month of march and they rendered the passage in my sluggish boat sufficiently tedious in other respects i had but little bad weather to complain of only one shower of rain occurred and but few storms of thunder and lightning the stream is very strong and its action on the sandbanks conspicuous all night i used to hear the falling cliffs precipitated with a dull heavy splash into the watera pretty spectacle in the daytime when the whirling current is seen to carry a cloud of white dust like smoke along its course  the curruckpore hills the northern boundary of the gneiss and granite range of parasnath are seen first in the distance and then throwing out low loosely timbered spurs towards the river but no rock or hill comes close to the banks till near monghyr where two islets of rock rise out of the bed of the river they are of stratified quartz dipping at a high angle to the southeast and as far as i could observe quite barren each crowned with a little temple the swarm of boats from below patna to this place was quite incredible  april larrived at monghyr by far the prettiest town i had seen on the river backed by a long range of wooded hillsdetached outliers of which rise in the very town the banks are steep and they appear more so owing to the fortifications which are extensive a number of large white twostoried houses some very imposing and perched on rounded or conical hills give a european aspect to the place  monghyr is celebrated for its iron manufactures especially of muskets in which respect it is the birmingham of bengal generally speaking these weapons are poor though stamped with the first english names a native workman will however if time and sufficient reward be given turn out a first rate fowlingpiece the inhabitants are reported to be sad drunkards and the abundance of toddypalms was quite remarkable the latter here the phoenix sylvestris i never saw wild but it is considered to be so in nw india it is still a doubtful point whether it is the same as the african species in the morning of the following day i went to the hot springs of seetakoond wells of seeta a few miles south of the town  illustrationmonghyr on the ganges with the currockpore hills in the distance  the hills are hornstone and quartz stratified and dipping southerly with a very high angle they are very barren and evidently identical with those on the south bank of the soane skirting in both cases the granite and gneiss range of parasnath the alluvium on the banks of the ganges is obviously an aqueous deposit subsequent to the elevation of these hills and is perfectly plane up to their bases the river has its course through the alluvium like the soane the depth of the former is in many places upwards of 100 feet and the kunker pebbles it contains are often disposed in parallel undulating bands it nowhere contains sand pebbles or fossils concretions of lime kunker alone interrupting its uniform consistence it attains its greatest thickness in the valleys of the ganges and the soane gradually sloping up to the himalaya and curruckpore hills on either flank it is however well developed on the kymore and parasnath hills 1200 to 1500 feet above the ganges valley and i have no doubt was deposited in very deep water when the relative positions of these mountains to the ganges and soane valleys were the same that they are now like every other part of the surface of india it has suffered much from denudation especially on the abovenamed mountains and around their bases where various rocks protrude through it along the ganges again its surface is an unbroken level between chunar and the rocks of monghyr the origin of its component mineral matter must be sought in the denudation of the himalayas within a very recent geological period the contrast between the fertility of the alluvium and the sterility of the protruded quartzy rocks is very striking cultivation running up to these fields of stones and suddenly stopping  unlike the soorujkoond hotsprings those of seetakoond rise in a plain and were once covered by a handsome temple all the water is collected in a tank some yards square with steps leading down to it the water which is clear and tasteless temp 104 degrees is so pure as to be exported copiously and the monghyr manufactory of sodawater presents the anomaly of owing its purity to seetas ablutions  on my passage down the river i passed the picturesque rocks of sultangunj they are similar to those of monghyr but very much larger and loftier one a roundheaded mass stands on the bank capped with a tripledomed mahommedan tomb palms and figs the other which is far more striking rises isolated in the bed of the river and is crowned with a hindoo temple its pyramidal cone surmounted with a curious pile of weathercocks and two little banners the current of the ganges is here very strong and runs in deep black eddies between the rocks  though now perhaps eighty or a hundred yards from the shore the islet must have been recently a peninsula for it retains a portion of the once connecting bank of alluvium in the form of a short flattopped cliff about thirty feet above the water some curious looking sculptures on the rocks are said to represent naragur or vishnu suree and sirooj but to me they were quite unintelligible the temple is dedicated to naragur and inhabited by fakirs it is the most holy on the ganges  april 5i arrived at bhagulpore and took up my quarters with my friend dr grant till he should arrange my dawk for sikkim  the town has been supposed to be the muchsought palibothra and a dirty stream hard by the chundum the eranoboas but mr ravenshaw has now brought all existing proofs to bear on patna and the soane it is like most hilly places in india s of the himalaya the seat of much jain worship and the temples on mount manden for the following information about bhagulpore and its neighbourhood i am indebted chiefly to col francklins essay in the asiatic researches and the late major napleton and mr pontet a few miles off are said to have been 540 in number at the assumed summerpalaces of the kings of palibothra the ground is covered with agates brought from the neighbouring hills which were in a rough state let into the walls of the buildings these agates perfectly resemble the soane pebbles and they assist in the identification of these flanking hills with those of the latter river  again near the hills the features of interest are very numerous the neighbouring mountains of curruckpore which are a portion of the rajmahal and parasnath range are peopled by tribes representing the earliest races of india prior to the invasion of young rama prince of oude who according to the legend spread brahminism with his conquests and won the hand of king jannuks daughter seeta by bending her fathers bow these people are called coles a middlesized strong very dark and blackhaired race with thick lips they have no vocation but collecting iron from the soil which occurs abundantly in nodules they eat flesh whether that of animals killed by themselves or of those which have died a natural death and mix with hindoos but not with mussulmen there are other tribes vestiges of the tamulian race differing somewhat in their rites from these and approaching in their habits more to hindoos but all are timorous and retiring  the hillrangers or bhagulporerangers are all natives of the rajmahal hills and form a local corps maintained by the company for the protection of the district for many years these people were engaged in predatory excursions which owing to the nature of the country were checked with great difficulty the plan was therefore conceived by an active magistrate in the district of embodying a portion into a military force for the protection of the country from invasions of their own tribes and this scheme has answered perfectly  to me the most interesting object in bhagulpore was the horticultural gardens whose origin and flourishing condition are due to the activity and enterprise of the late major napleton commander of the hillrangers the site is good consisting of fifteen acres that were four years ago an indigo field but form now a smiling garden about fifty men are employed and the number of seeds and vegetables annually distributed is very great of trees the most conspicuous are the tamarind tecoma jasminoides erythrina adansonia bombax teak banyan peepul sissoo casuarina terminalia melia bauhinia of introduced species english and chinese flat peaches pruned to the centre to let the sun in mangos of various sorts eugenia jambos various anonas litchi loquat and longan oranges sapodilla apple pear both succeeding tolerably various cabool and persian varieties of fruittrees figs grapes guava apricots and jujube the grapes looked extremely well but they require great skill and care in the management they form a long covered walk with a row of plantains on the w side to diminish the effects of the hot winds but even with this screen the fruit on that side are inferior to that on the opposite trellis easterly winds again being moist blight these and other plants by favouring the abundant increase of insects and causing the leaves to curl and fall off and against this evil there is no remedy with a clear sky the mischief is not great under a cloudy one the prevalence of such winds is fatal to the crop the white ant sometimes attacks the stems and is best checked by washing the roots with limewater yellow arsenic or tobaccowater numerous cerealia and the varieties of cotton sugarcane etc all thrive extremely well so do many of our english vegetables cabbages peas and beans are much injured by the caterpillars of a pontia like our english white raspberries currants and gooseberries will not grow at all  the seeds were all deposited in bottles and hung round the walls of a large airy apartment and for cleanliness and excellence of kind they would bear comparison with the best seedsmans collection in london of english garden vegetables and varieties of the indian cerealia and leguminous plants indian corn millets rice etc the collections for distribution were extensive  the manufacture of economic products is not neglected excellent coffee is grown and arrowroot equal to the best west indian is prepared at 18s 6d per bottle of twentyfour ounces about a fourth of the price of that article in calcutta  in most respects the establishment is a model of what such institutions ought to be in india not only of real practical value in affording a good and cheap supply of the best culinary and other vegetables that the climate can produce but as showing to what departments efforts are best directed such gardens diffuse a taste for the most healthy employments and offer an elegant resource for the many unoccupied hours which the englishman in india finds upon his hands they are also schools of gardening and a simple inspection of what has been done at bhagulpore is a valuable lesson to any person about to establish a private garden of his own  i often heard complaints made of the seeds distributed from these gardens not vegetating freely in other parts of india and it is not to be expected that they should retain their vitality unimpaired through an indian rainy season but on the other hand i almost invariably found that the planting and tending had been left to the uncontrolled management of native gardeners who with a certain amount of skill in handicraft are from habits and prejudices singularly unfit for the superintendence of a garden     chapter iv  leave bhagulporekunkercolgonghimalaya distant view of cosi mouth ofdifficult navigationsand storms

saturday april the 8th my dawk being laid on that day from caragolaghat about thirty miles down the river for the foot of the himalaya range and dorjiling  passing the pretty villalike houses of the english residents the riverbanks reassumed their wonted features the hills receded from the shore and steep clay cliffs twenty to fifty feet high on one side opposed long sandy shelves on the other kunker was still most abundant especially in the lower bed of the banks close to the now very low water the strata containing it were much undulated but not uniformly so horizontal layers over or underlying the disturbed ones at colgong conical hills appear and two remarkable sisterrocks start out of the river the same in structure with those of sultangunj a boisterous current swirls round them strong even at this season and very dangerous in the rains when the swollen river is from twentyeight to forty feet deeper than now we landed opposite the rocks and proceeded to the residence of mr g barnes prettily situated on one of the conical elevations characteristic of the geology of the district the village we passed through had been recently destroyed by fire and nothing but the clay outer walls and curiouslooking partition walls remained often whitewashed and daubed with figures in red of the palm of the hand elephant peacock and tigera sort of rude frescopainting we did not arrive till past midday and the boat with my palkee and servant not having been able to face the gale i was detained till the middle of the following day mr barnes and his brother proved most agreeable companionsvery luckily for me for it requires no ordinary philosophy to bear being stormstayed on a voyage with the prospect of paying a heavy demurrage for detaining the dawk and the worse one of finding the bearers given to another traveller when you arrive at the rendezvous the view from mr barnes house is very fine it commands the river and its rocks the rajmahal hills to the east and south broad acres of indigo and other crops below long lines of palmtrees and groves of mango banana tamarind and other tropical trees scattered close around and in the distance in the rainy season and immediately after the snowy himalaya are distinctly seen on the horizon fully 170 miles off nearly opposite the cosi river enters the ganges bearing considering its short course an enormous volume of water comprising the drainage of the whole himalaya between the two giant peaks of kinchinjunga in sikkim and gossainthan in nepal even at this season looking from mr barnes eyrie over the bed of the ganges the enormous expanses of sand the numerous shifting islets and the long spits of mud betray the proximity of some very restless and resistless power during the rains the scene must indeed be extraordinary when the cosi lays many miles of land under water and pours so vast a quantity of detritus into the bed of the ganges that long islets are heaped up and swept away in a few hours and the latter river becomes all but unnavigable boats are caught in whirlpools formed without a moments warning and sunk ere they have spun round thrice in the eddies and no part of the inland navigation of india is so dreaded or dangerous as the ganges at its junction with the cosi  rain generally falls in partial showers at this season and they are essential to the wellbeing of the spring crops of indigo the stormy appearance of the sky though it proved fallacious was hailed by my hosts as predicting a fall which was much wanted the wind however seemed but to aggravate the drought by the great body of sand it lifted and swept up the valleys obscuring the near horizon and especially concealing the whole delta of the cosi where the clouds were so vast and dense and ascended so high as to resemble another element  all night the gale blew on accompanied with much thunder and lightning and it was not till noon of the 9th that i descried my palkeeboat toiling down the stream then i again embarked taking the lagging boat in tow of my own passing the mouths of the cosi the gale and currents were so adverse that we had to bring up on the sand when the quantity which drifted into the boat rendered the delay as disagreeable as it was tedious the particles penetrated everywhere up my nose and down my back drying my eyelids and gritting between my teeth the craft kept bumping on the banks and being both crazy and leaky the little comfortless cabin became the refuge of scared rats and cockroaches in the evening i shared a meal with these creatures on some provisions my kind friends had put into the boat but the food was so sandy that i had to bolt my supper  at night the storm lulled a little and i proceeded to caragola ghat and took up my dawk which had been twentyeight hours expecting me and was waiting in despair of my arrival for another traveller on the opposite bank who however could not cross the river  having accomplished thirty miles i halted at 9 am on the following morning at purnea quitting it at noon for kishengunj the whole country wore a greener garb than i had seen anywhere south of the ganges the climate was evidently more humid and had been gradually becoming so from mirzapore the first decided change was a few miles below the soane mouth at dinapore and patna and the few hygrometrical observations i took at bhagulpore confirmed the increase of moisture the proximity to the sea and great delta of the ganges sufficiently accounts for this as does the approach to the hills for the still greater dampness and brighter verdure of purnea i was glad to feel myself within the influence of the longlookedfor himalaya and i narrowly watched every change in the character of the vegetation a fern growing by the roadside was the first and most tangible evidence of this together with the rarity or total absence of butea boswellia catechu grislea carissa and all the companions of my former excursion  purnea is a large station and considered very unhealthy during and after the rains from it the road passed through some pretty lanes with groves of planted guava and a rattan palm calamus the first i had seen though no hills are nearer than the himalaya from the constant alteration of the riverbeds the road undulates remarkably for this part of india and a jungly vegetation ensues consisting of the above plants with the yellowflowered cactus replacing the euphorbias which were previously much more common though still 100 miles distant from the hills mosses appeared on the banks and more ferns were just sprouting above ground  the bamboo was a very different species from any i had hitherto met with forming groves of straight trees fifteen to twenty feet high thin of foliage and not unlike poplars  thirtysix miles from purnea brought me to kishengunj when i found that no arrangements whatever had been made for my dawk and i was fairly stranded luckily a thoughtful friend had provided me with letters to the scattered residents along the road and i proceeded with one to mr perry the assistant magistrate of the districta gentleman well known for his urbanity and the many aids he affords to travellers on this neglected line of road owing to this being some festival or holiday it was impossible to get palkeebearers the natives were busy catching fish in all the muddy pools around some of mr perrys own family also were about to proceed to dorjiling so that i had only to take patience and be thankful for having to exercise it in such pleasant quarters the mahanuddee a large stream from the hills flows near this place strewing the surrounding neighbourhood with sand and from the frequent alterations in its course causing endless disputes amongst the landholders a kind of lark called an ortolan was abundant this is not however the european delicacy of that name though a migratory bird the flocks are large and the birds so fat that they make excellent table game at this time they were rapidly disappearing to return from the north in september  i had just got into bed at night when the bearers arrived so bidding a hurried adieu to my kind host i proceeded onwards  april 12i awoke at 4 am and found my palkee on the ground and the bearers coolly smoking their hookahs under a tree it was raining hard they had carried me the length of their stage twelve miles and there were no others to take me on i had paid twentyfour pounds for my dawk from caragola to the hills to which i had been obliged to add a handsome douceur so i lost all patience after waiting and entreating during several hours i found the headman of a neighbouring village and by a further disbursement induced six out of the twelve bearers to carry the empty palkee whilst i should walk to the next stage or till we should meet some others they agreed and cutting the thick and spongy sheaths of the banana used them for shoulderpads they also wrapped them round the palkeepoles to ease their aching clavicles walking along i picked up a few plants and fourteen miles further on came again to the banks of the mahanuddee whose bed was strewn with pebbles and small boulders brought thus far from the mountains about thirty miles distant here again i had to apply to the headman of a village and pay for bearers to take me to titalya the next stage fourteen miles some curious long low sheds puzzled me very much and on examining them they proved to be for the growth of pawn or betelpepper another indication of the moisture of the climate these sheds are twenty to fifty yards long eight or twelve or so broad and scarcely five high they are made of bamboo wattled all round and over the top slender rods are placed a few feet apart inside up which the pepper vines climb and quickly fill the place with their deep green glossy foliage the native enters every morning by a little door and carefully cleans the plants constant heat damp and moisture shelter from solar beams from scorching heat and from nocturnal radiation are thus all procured for the plant which would certainly not live twentyfour hours if exposed to the climate of this treeless district great attention is paid to the cultivation which is very profitable snakes frequently take up their quarters in these hothouses and cause fatal accidents  titalya was once a military station of some importance and from its proximity to the hills has been selected by dr campbell the superintendent of dorjiling as the site for an annual fair to which the mountain tribes resort as well as the people of the plains the calcutta road to dorjiling by dinajpore meets near here that by which i had come and i found no difficulty in procuring bearers to proceed to siligoree where i arrived at 6 am on the 13th hitherto i bad not seen the mountains so uniformly had they been shrouded by dense wreaths of vapour here however when within eight miles of their base i caught a first glimpse of the outer rangesombre masses of far from picturesque outline clothed everywhere with a dusky forest  siligoree stands on the verge of the terai that low malarious belt which skirts the base of the himalaya from the sutlej to brahmakoond in upper assam every feature botanical geological and zoological is new on entering this district the change is sudden and immediate sea and shore are hardly more conspicuously different nor from the edge of the terai to the limit of perpetual snow is any botanical region more clearly marked than this which is the commencement of himalayan vegetation a sudden descent leads to the mahanuddee river flowing in a shallow valley over a pebbly bottom it is a rapid river even at this season its banks are fringed with bushes and it is as clear and sparkling as a trout stream in scotland beyond it the road winds through a thick brushwood choked with long grasses and with but few trees chiefly of acacia dalbergia sissoo and a scarlet fruited sterculia the soil is a red friable clay and gravel at this season only a few spring plants were in flower amongst which a very sweetscented crinum asphodel and a small curcuma were in the greatest profusion leaves of terrestrial orchids appeared with ferns and weeds of hot damp regions i crossed the beds of many small streams some were dry and all very tortuous their banks were richly clothed with brushwood and climbers of convolvulus vines hiraea leea menispermeae cucurbitaceae and bignoniaceae their pentup waters percolating the gravel beds and partly carried off by evaporation through the stratum of everincreasing vegetable mould must be one main agent in the production of the malarious vapours of this pestilential region add to this the detention of the same amongst the jungly herbage the amount of vapour in the humid atmosphere above checking the upward passage of that from the soil the sheltered nature of the locality at the immediate base of lofty mountains and there appear to me to be here all necessary elements which combined will produce stagnation and deterioration in an atmosphere loaded with vapour fatal as this district is and especially to europeans a race inhabit it with impunity who if not numerous do not owe their paucity to any climatic causes these are the mechis often described as a squalid unhealthy people typical of the region they frequent but who are in reality more robust than the europeans in india and whose disagreeably sallow complexion is deceptive as indicating a sickly constitution they are a mild inoffensive people industrious for orientals living by annually burning the terai jungle and cultivating the cleared spots and though so sequestered and isolated they rather court than avoid intercourse with those whites whom they know to be kindly disposed  after proceeding some six miles along the gradually ascending path i came to a considerable stream cutting its way through stratified gravel with cliffs on each side fifteen to twenty feet high here and there covered with ferns the little oxalis sensitiva and other herbs the road here suddenly ascends a steep gravelly hill and opens out on a short flat or spur from which the himalaya rise abruptly clothed with forest from the base the little bungalow of punkabaree my immediate destination nestled in the woods crowning a lateral knoll above which to east and west as far as the eye could reach were range after range of wooded mountains 6000 to 8000 feet high i here met with the indiarubber tree ficus elastica it abounds in assam but this is its western limit  from this steppe the ascent to punkabaree is sudden and steep and accompanied with a change in soil and vegetation the mica slate and clay slate protrude everywhere the former full of garnets a giant forest replaces the stunted and bushy timber of the terai proper of which the duabanga and terminalias form the prevailing trees with cedrela and the gordonia wallichii smaller timber and shrubs are innumerable a succulent character pervades the bushes and herbs occasioned by the prevalence of urticeae large bamboos rather crest the hills than court the deeper shade and of the latter there is abundance for the torrents cut a straight deep and steep course down the hill flanks the galleys they traverse are choked with vegetation and bridged by fallen trees whose trunks are richly clothed with dendrobium pierardi and other epiphytical orchids with pendulous lycopodia and many ferns hoya scitamineae and similar types of the hottest and dampest climates  the bungalow at punkabaree was goodwhich was well as my luggagebearers were not come up and there were no signs of them along the terai road which i saw winding below me my scanty stock of paper being full of plants i was reduced to the strait of botanising and throwing away my specimens the forest was truly magnificent along the steep mountain sides the apparently large proportion of deciduous trees was far more considerable than i had expected partly probably due to the abundance of the dillenia cassia and sterculia whose copious fruit was all the more conspicuous from the leafless condition of the plant the white or lilac blossoms of the convolvuluslike thunbergia and other acanthaceae were the predominant features of the shrubby vegetation and very handsome  all around the hills rise steeply five or six thousand feet clothed in a dense deepgreen dripping forest torrents rush down the slopes their position indicated by the dipping of the forest into their beds or the occasional cloud of spray rising above some more boisterous part of their course from the road at and a little above punkabaree the view is really superb and very instructive behind or north the himalaya rise in steep confused masses below the hill on which i stood and the ranges as far as the eye can reach east and west throw spurs on to the plains of india these are very thickly wooded and enclose broad deadflat hot and damp valleys apparently covered with a dense forest secondary spurs of clay and gravel like that immediately below punkabaree rest on the bases of the mountains and seem to form an intermediate neutral ground between flat and mountainous india the terai district forms a very irregular belt scantily clothed and intersected by innumerable rivulets from the hills which unite and divide again on the flat till emerging from the region of many trees they enter the plains following devious courses which glisten like silver threads the whole horizon is bounded by the sealike expanse of the plains which stretch away into the region of sunshine and fine weather in one boundless flat  in the distance the courses of the teesta and cosi the great drainers of the snowy himalayas and the recipients of innumerable smaller rills are with difficulty traced at this the dry season the oceanlike appearance of this southern view is even more conspicuous in the heavens than on the land the clouds arranging themselves after a singularly seascape fashion endless strata run in parallel ribbons over the extreme horizon above these scattered cumuli also in horizontal lines are dotted against a clear grey sky which gradually as the eye is lifted passes into a deep cloudless blue vault continuously clear to the zenith there the cumuli in white fleecy masses again appear till in the northern celestial hemisphere they thicken and assume the leaden hue of nimbi discharging their moisture on the dark forestclad hills around the breezes are southeasterly bringing that vapour from the indian ocean which is rarefied and suspended aloft over the heated plains but condensed into a drizzle when it strikes the cooler flanks of the hills and into heavy rain when it meets their still colder summits upon what a gigantic scale does nature here operate vapours raised from an ocean whose nearest shore is more than 400 miles distant are safely transported without the loss of one drop of water to support the rank luxuriance of this far distant region this and other offices fulfilled the waste waters are returned by the cosi and teesta to the ocean and again exhaled exported expended recollected and returned  illustrationpunkabaree bungalow and base of the himalaya  the soil and bushes everywhere swarmed with large and troublesome ants and enormous earthworms in the evening the noise of the great cicadae in the trees was almost deafening they burst suddenly into full chorus with a voice so harshly croaking so dissonant and so unearthly that in these solitary forests i could not help being startled in general character the note was very similar to that of other cicadae they ceased as suddenly as they commenced on the following morning my baggage arrived and leaving my palkee i mounted a pony kindly sent for me by mr hodgson and commenced a very steep ascent of about 3000 feet winding along the face of a steep richlywooded valley the road zigzags extraordinarily in and out of the innumerable lateral ravines each with its water course dense jungle and legion of leeches the bite of these bloodsuckers gives no pain but is followed by considerable effusion of blood they puncture through thick worsted stockings and even trousers and when full roll in the form of a little soft ball into the bottom of the shoe where their presence is hardly felt in walking  not only are the roadsides rich in plants but native paths cutting off all the zigzags run in straight lines up the steepest hillfaces and thus double the available means for botanising and it is all but impossible to leave the paths of one kind or other except for a yard or two up the rocky ravines elephants tigers and occasionally the rhinoceros inhabit the foot of these hills with wild boars leopards etc but none are numerous the elephants path is an excellent specimen of engineeringthe opposite of the native track for it winds judiciously  at about 1000 feet above punkabaree the vegetation is very rich and appears all the more so from the many turnings of the road affording glorious prospects of the foreshortened tropical forests the prevalent timber is gigantic and scaled by climbing leguminosae as bauhinias and robinias which sometimes sheath the trunks or span the forest with huge cables joining tree to tree their trunks are also clothed with parasitical orchids and still more beautifully with pothos scindapsus peppers gnetum vines convolvulus and bignoniae the beauty of the drapery of the pothosleaves is preeminent whether for the graceful folds the foliage assumes or for the liveliness of its colour of the more conspicuous smaller trees the wild banana is the most abundant its crown of very beautiful foliage contrasting with the smallerleaved plants amongst which it nestles next comes a screwpine pandanus with a straight stem and a tuft of leaves each eight or ten feet long waving on all sides araliaceae with smooth or armed slender trunks and mappalike euphorbiaceae spread their long petioles horizontally forth each terminated with an ample leaf some feet in diameter bamboo abounds everywhere its dense tufts of culms 100 feet and upwards high are as thick as a mans thigh at the base twenty or thirty species of ferns including a treefern were luxuriant and handsome foliaceous lichens and a few mosses appeared at 2000 feet such is the vegetation of the roads through the tropical forests of the outerhimalaya  at about 4000 feet the road crossed a saddle and ran along the narrow crest of a hill the top of that facing the plains of india and over which is the way to the interior ranges amongst which dorjiling is placed still twentyfive miles off a little below this a great change had taken place in the vegetation marked first by the appearance of a very englishlooking bramble which however by way of proving its foreign origin bore a very good yellow fruit called here the yellow raspberry scattered oaks of a noble species with large lamellated cups and magnificent foliage succeeded and along the ridge of the mountain to kursiong a dawk bungalow at about 4800 feet the change in the flora was complete  the spring of this region and elevation most vividly recalled that of england the oak flowering the birch bursting into leaf the violet chrysosplenium stellaria and arum vaccinium wild strawberry maple geranium bramble a colder wind blew here mosses and lichens carpeted the banks and roadsides the birds and insects were very different from those below and everything proclaimed the marked change in elevation and not only in this but in season for i had left the winter of the tropics and here encountered the spring of the temperate zone  the flowers i have mentioned are so notoriously the harbingers of a european spring that their presence carries one home at once but as species they differ from their european prototypes and are accompanied at this elevation and for 2000 feet higher up with treefern pothos bananas palms figs pepper numbers of epiphytal orchids and similar genuine tropical genera the uniform temperature and humidity of the region here favour the extension of tropical plants into a temperate region exactly as the same conditions cause similar forms to reach higher latitudes in the southern hemisphere as in new zealand tasmania south chili etc than they do in the northern  along this ridge i met with the first treefern this species seldom reaches the height of forty feet the black trunk is but three or four in girth and the feathery crown is ragged in comparison with the species of many other countries it is the alsophila gigantea and ascends nearly to 7000 feet elevation  kursiong bungalow where i stopped for a few hours is superbly placed on a narrow mountain ridge the west window looks down the valley of the balasun river the east into that of the mahanuddee both of these rise from the outer range and flow in broad deep and steep valleys about 4000 feet deep which give them their respective names and are richly wooded from the terai to their tops till reaching this spur i had wound upwards along the western slope of the mahanuddee valley the ascent from the spur at kursiong to the top of the mountain on the northern face of which dorjiling is situated is along the eastern slope of the balasun  from kursiong a very steep zigzag leads up the mountain through a magnificent forest of chesnut walnut oaks and laurels it is difficult to conceive a grander mass of vegetation the straight shafts of the timbertrees shooting aloft some naked and clean with grey pale or brown bark others literally clothed for yards with a continuous garment of epiphytes one mass of blossoms especially the white orchids caelogynes which bloom in a profuse manner whitening their trunks like snow more bulky trunks were masses of interlacing climbers araliaceae leguminosae vines and menispermeae hydrangea and peppers enclosing a hollow once filled by the now strangled supporting tree which had long ago decayed away from the sides and summit of these supple branches hung forth either leafy or naked the latter resembling cables flung from one tree to another swinging in the breeze their rocking motion increased by the weight of great bunches of ferns or orchids which were perched aloft in the loops perpetual moisture nourishes this dripping forest and pendulous mosses and lichens are met with in profusion  two thousand feet higher up near mahaldiram whence the last view of the plains is gained european plants appearberberry paris etc but here night gathered round and i had still ten miles to go to the nearest bungalow that of pacheem the road still led along the eastern slope of the balasun valley which was exceedingly steep and so cut up by ravines that it winds in and out of gulleys almost narrow enough to be jumped across  it was very late before i arrived at pacheem bungalow the most sinisterlooking resthouse i ever saw stuck on a little cleared spur of the mountain surrounded by dark forests overhanging a profound valley and enveloped in mists and rain and hideous in architecture being a miserable attempt to unite the swiss cottage with the suburban gothic it combined a maximum of discomfort with a minimum of good looks or good cheer i was some time in finding the dirty housekeeper in an outhouse hard by and then in waking him as he led me up the crazy verandah and into a broad ghostly room without glass in the windows or fire or any one comfort my mind recurred to the stories told of the horrors of the hartz forest and of the benighted travellers situation therein cold sluggish beetles hung to the damp wallsand these i immediately secured after due exertions and perseverance with the damp wood a fire smoked lustily and by cajoling the gnome of a housekeeper i procured the usual roast fowl and potatos with the accustomed sauce of a strong smoky and singed flavour since writing the above a comfortable house has been erected at senadah the name now given to what was called pacheem bungalow  pacheem stands at an elevation of nearly 7300 feet and as i walked out on the following morning i met with english looking plants in abundance but was too early in the season to get aught but the foliage of most chryosplenium violet lobelia a small geranium strawberry five or six kinds of bramble arum paris convallaria stellaria rubia vaccinium and various gnaphalia of small bushes cornels honeysuckles and the ivy tribe predominated with symplocos and skimmia eurya bushy brambles having simple or compound green or beautifully silky foliage hypericum berberry hydrangea wormwood adamia cyanea viburnum elder dwarf bamboo etc  the climbing plants were still panax or aralia kadsura saurauja hydrangea vines smilax ampelopsis polygona and most beautiful of all stauntonia with pendulous racemes of lilac blossoms epiphytes were rarer still i found white and purple caeloynes and other orchids and a most noble white rhododendron whose truly enormous and delicious lemonscented blossoms strewed the ground the trees were one half oaks one quarter magnolias and nearly another quarter laurels amongst which grew himalayan kinds of birch alder maple holly birdcherry common cherry and apple the absence of leguminosae was most remarkable and the most prominent botanical feature in the vegetation of this region it is too high for the tropical tribes of the warmer elevations too low for the alpines and probably too moist for those of temperate regions cool equable humid climates being generally unfavourable to that order clematis was rare and other ranunculaceae still more so cruciferae were absent and what was still more remarkable i found very few native species of grasses both poa annua and white dutch clover flourished where accidentally disseminated but only in artificially cleared spots of ferns i collected about sixty species chiefly of temperate genera the supremacy of this temperate region consists in the infinite number of forest trees in the absence in the usual proportion at any rate of such common orders as compositae leguminosae cruciferae and ranunculaceae and of grasses amongst monocotyledons and in the predominance of the rarer and more local families as those of rhododendron camellia magnolia ivy cornel honeysuckle hydrangea begonia and epiphytic orchids  from pacheem the road runs in a northerly direction to dorjiling still along the balasun valley till the saddle of the great mountain sinchul is crossed this is narrow stretching east and west and from it a spur projects northwards for five or six miles amongst the many mountains still intervening between it and the snows this saddle alt 7400 feet crossed one is fairly amongst the mountains the plains behind are cut off by it and in front the snows may be seen when the weather is propitious the valleys on this side of the mountain run northwards and discharge their streams into great rivers which coming from the snow wind amongst the hills and debouche into the teesta to the east where it divides sikkim from bhotan  dorjiling station occupies a narrow ridge which divides into two spurs descending steeply to the bed of the great rungeet river up whose course the eye is carried to the base of the great snowy mountains the ridge itself is very narrow at the top along which most of the houses are perched while others occupy positions on its flanks where narrow locations on the east and broader ones on the west are cleared from wood the valleys on either side are at least 6000 feet deep forestclad to the bottom with very few and small level spots and no absolute precipice from their flanks project innumerable little spurs occupied by native clearings  my route lay along the east flank overhanging the valley of the rungmo river looking east the amphitheatre of hills from the ridge i had crossed was very fine enclosing an area some four miles across and 4000 feet deep clothed throughout with an impenetrable dark forest there was not one clear patch except near the very bottom where were some scattered hamlets of two or three huts each the rock is everywhere near the surface and the road has been formed by blasting at very many places a wooded slope descends suddenly from the edge of the road while on the other hand a bank rises abruptly to the top of the ridge alternately mossy rocky and clayey and presenting a good geological section all the way along of the nucleus of dorjiling spur exposing broken masses of gneiss as i descended i came upon the upper limit of the chesnut a tree second in abundance to the oak gigantic tall and straight in the trunk  i arrived at dorjiling on the 16th of april a showery cold month at this elevation i was so fortunate as to find mr charles barnes brother of my friend at colgong the sole tenant of a long cottagelike building divided off into pairs of apartments which are hired by visitors it is usual for europeans to bring a full establishment of servants with bedding etc to such stations but i had not done so having been told that there was a furnished hotel in dorjiling and i was therefore not a little indebted to mr barnes for his kind invitation to join his mess as he was an active mountaineer we enjoyed many excursions together in the two months and a half during which we were companions  dr campbell procured me several active native lepcha lads as collectors at wages varying from eight to twenty shillings a month these either accompanied me on my excursions or went by themselves into the jungles to collect plants which i occupied myself in drawing dissecting and ticketing while the preserving of them fell to the lepchas who after a little training became with constant superintendence good plantdriers even at this season four weeks before the setting in of the rains the weather was very uncertain so that the papers had generally to be dried by the fire  the hillstation or sanatarium of dorjiling owes its origin like simla mussooree etc to the necessity that exists in india of providing places where the health of europeans may be recruited by a more temperate climate sikkim proved an eligible position for such an establishment owing to its proximity to calcutta which lies but 370 miles to the southward whereas the northwest stations mentioned above are upwards of a thousand miles from that city dorjiling ridge varies in height from 6500 to 7500 feet above the level of the sea 8000 feet being the elevation at which the mean temperature most nearly coincides with that of london viz 50 degrees  sikkim was further the only available spot for a sanatarium throughout the whole range of the himalaya east of the extreme western frontier of nepal being a protected state and owing no allegiance except to the british government which after the rajah had been driven from the country by the ghorkas in 1817 replaced him on his throne and guaranteed him the sovereignty our main object in doing this was to retain sikkim as a fender between nepal and bhotan and but for this policy the aggressive nepalese would long ere this have possessed themselves of sikkim bhotan and the whole himalaya eastwards to the borders of burmah of such being their wish the nepalese have never made any secret and they are said to have asked permission from the british to march an army across sikkim for the purpose of conquering bhotan offering to become more peaceable neighbours to us than the bhotanese are such they would doubtless have proved but the nepal frontier is considered broad enough already  from 1817 to 1828 no notice was taken of sikkim till a frontier dispute occurred between the lepchas and nepalese which was referred according to the terms of the treaty to the british government during the arrangement of this dorjiling was visited by a gentleman of high scientific attainments mr j w grant who pointed out its eligibility as a site for a sanatarium to lord william bentinck then governorgeneral dwelling especially upon its climate proximity to calcutta and accessibility on its central position between tibet bhotan nepal and british india and on the good example a peaceablyconducted and wellgoverned station would be to our turbulent neighbours in that quarter the suggestion was cordially received and major herbert the late eminent surveyorgeneral of india and mr grant were employed to report further on the subject  the next step taken was that of requesting the rajah to cede a tract of country which should include dorjiling for an equivalent in money or land his first demand was unreasonable but on further consideration he surrendered dorjiling unconditionally and a sum of 300 pounds per annum was granted to him as an equivalent for what was then a worthless uninhabited mountain in 1840 dr campbell was removed from nepal as superintendent of the new station and was entrusted with the charge of the political relations between the british and sikkim government  once established dorjiling rapidly increased allotments of land were purchased by europeans for building dwellinghouses barracks and a bazaar were formed with accommodation for invalid european soldiers a few official residents civil and military formed the nucleus of a community which was increased by retired officers and their families and by temporary visitors in search of health or the luxury of a cool climate and active exercise  for the first few years matters went on smoothly with the rajah whose minister or dewan was upright and intelligent but the latter on his death was succeeded by the present dewan a tibetan and a relative of the ranee or rajahs wife a man unsurpassed for insolence and avarice whose aim was to monopolise the trade of the country and to enrich himself at its expense every obstacle was thrown by him in the way of a good understanding between sikkim and the british government british subjects were rigorously excluded from sikkim every liberal offer for free trade and intercourse was rejected generally with insolence merchandise was taxed and notorious offenders refugees from the british territories were harboured despatches were detained and the vakeels or rajahs representatives were chosen for their insolence and incapacity the conduct of the dewan throughout was indochinese assuming insolent aggressive never perpetrating open violence but by petty insults effectually preventing all good understanding he was met by neglect or forbearance on the part of the calcutta government and by patience and passive resistance at dorjiling our inaction and longsuffering were taken for weakness and our concessions for timidity such has been our policy in china siam and burmah and in each instance the result has been the same had it been insisted that the terms of the treaty should be strictly kept and had the first act of insolence been noticed we should have maintained the best relations with sikkim whose people and rulers with the exception of the dewan and his faction have proved themselves friendly throughout and most anxious for unrestricted communication  these political matters have not however prevented the rapid increase of dorjiling the progress of which during the two years i spent in sikkim resembled that of an australian colony not only in amount of building but in the accession of native families from the surrounding countries there were not a hundred inhabitants under british protection when the ground was transferred there are now four thousand at the former period there was no trade whatever there is now a very considerable one in musk salt golddust borax soda woollen cloths and especially in poneys of which the dewan in one year brought on his own account upwards of 50 into dorjiling the tibetan pony though born and bred 10000 to 14000 feet above the sea is one of the most active and useful animals in the plains of bengal powerful and hardy and when well trained early docile although by nature vicious and obstinate the trade has been greatly increased by the annual fair which dr campbell has established at the foot of the hills to which many thousands of natives flock from all quarters and which exercises a most beneficial influence throughout the neighbouring territories at this prizes in medals money and kind are given for agricultural implements and produce stock etc by the originator and a few friends a measure attended with eminent success  in estimating in a sanitary point of view the value of any healthstation little reliance can be placed on the general impressions of invalids or even of residents the opinion of each varies with the nature and state of his complaint if ill or with his idiosyncracy and disposition if well i have seen prejudiced invalids rapidly recovering in spite of themselves and all the while complaining in unmeasured terms of the climate of dorjiling and abusing it as killing them others are known who languish under the heat of the plains at one season and the damp at another and who though sickening and dying under its influence yet consistently praise a tropical climate to the last the opinions of those who resort to dorjiling in health differ equally those of active minds invariably thoroughly enjoy it while the mere lounger or sportsman mopes the statistical tables afford conclusive proofs of the value of the climate to europeans suffering from acute diseases and they are corroborated by the returns of the medical officer in charge of the station with respect to its suitability to the european constitution i feel satisfied and that much saving of life health and money would be effected were european troops drafted thither on their arrival in bengal instead of being stationed in calcutta exposed to disease and temptation to those vices which prove fatal to so many hundreds this i have been given to understand was the view originally taken by the court of directors but it has never been carried out  i believe that childrens faces afford as good an index as any to the healthfulness of a climate and in no part of the world is there a more active rosy and bright young community than at dorjiling it is incredible what a few weeks of that mountain air does for the indiaborn children of european parents they are taken there sickly pallid or yellow soft and flabby to become transformed into models of rude health and activity  there are however disorders to which the climate in common with all damp ones is not at all suited such are especially dysentery bowel complaints and liver complaints of long standing which are not benefited by a residence on these hills though how much worse they might have become in the plains is not shown i cannot hear that the climate aggravates but it certainly does not remove them whoever is suffering from the debilitating effects of any of the multifarious acute maladies of the plains finds instant relief and acquires a stock of health that enables him to resist fresh attacks under circumstances similar to those which before engendered them  natives of the low country and especially bengalees are far from enjoying the climate as europeans do being liable to sharp attacks of fever and ague from which the poorly clad natives are not exempt it is however difficult to estimate the effects of exposure upon the bengalees who sleep on the bare and often damp ground and adhere with characteristic prejudice to the attire of a torrid climate and to a vegetable diet under skies to which these are least of all adapted  it must not be supposed that europeans who have resided in the plains can on their first arrival expose themselves with impunity to the cold of these elevations this was shown in the winter of 1848 and 1849 when troops brought up to dorjiling were cantoned in newlybuilt dwellings on a high exposed ridge 8000 feet above the sea and lay insufficiently protected on a floor of loosely laid planks exposed to the cold wind when the ground without was covered with snow rheumatisms sharp febrile attacks and dysenteries ensued which were attributed in the public prints to the unhealthy nature of the climate of dorjiling  the following summary of hospital admissions affords the best test of the healthiness of the climate embracing as the period does the three most fatal months to european troops in india out of a detachment 105 strong of hm 80th regiment stationed at dorjiling in the seven months from january to july inclusive there were sixtyfour admissions to the hospital or on the average 413 per cent per month and only two deaths both of dysentery many of these men had suffered frequently in the plains from acute dysentery and hepatic affections and many others had aggravated these complaints by excessive drinking and two were cases of delirium tremens during the same period the number of entries at calcutta or dinapore would probably have more than trebled this   chapter v  view from mr hodgsons of range of snowy mountainstheir

forming collections and in taking meteorological observations i resided at mr hodgsons for the greater part of the time in consequence of his having given me a hospitable invitation to consider his house my home the view from his windows is one quite unparalleled for the scenery it embraces commanding confessedly the grandest known landscape of snowy mountains in the himalaya and hence in the world for an account of the geography of these regions and the relation of the sikkim himalaya to tibet etc see appendix kinchinjunga fortyfive miles distant is the prominent object rising 21000 feet above the level of the observer out of a sea of intervening wooded hills whilst on a line with its snows the eye descends below the horizon to a narrow gulf 7000 feet deep in the mountains where the great rungeet white with foam threads a tropical forest with a silver line  to the northwest towards nepal the snowy peaks of kubra and junnoo respectively 24005 feet and 25312 feet rise over the shoulder of singalelah whilst eastward the snowy mountains appear to form an unbroken range trending northeast to the great mass of donkia 23176 feet and thence southeast by the fingered peaks of tunkola and the silver cone of chola 17320 feet gradually sinking into the bhotan mountains at gipmoochi 14509 feet  the most eloquent descriptions i have read fail to convey to my minds eye the forms and colours of snowy mountains or to my imagination the sensations and impressions that rivet my attention to these sublime phenomena when they are present in reality and i shall not therefore obtrude any attempt of the kind upon my reader the latter has probably seen the swiss alps which though barely possessing half the sublimity extent or height of the himalaya are yet far more beautiful in either case he is struck with the precision and sharpness of their outlines and still more with the wonderful play of colours on their snowy flanks from the glowing hues reflected in orange gold and ruby from clouds illumined by the sinking or rising sun to the ghastly pallor that succeeds with twilight when the red seems to give place to its complementary colour green such dissolvingviews elude all attempts at description they are far too aerial to be chained to the memory and fade from it so fast as to be gazed upon day after day with undiminished admiration and pleasure long after the mountains themselves have lost their sublimity and apparent height  the actual extent of the snowy range seen from mr hodgsons windows is comprised within an arc of 80 degrees from north 30 degrees west to north 50 degrees east or nearly a quarter of the horizon along which the perpetual snow forms an unbroken girdle or crest of frosted silver and in winter when the mountains are covered down to 8000 feet this white ridge stretches uninterruptedly for more than 160 degrees no known view is to be compared with this in extent when the proximity and height of the mountains are considered for within the 80 degrees above mentioned more than twelve peaks rise above 20000 feet and there are none below 15000 feet while kinchin is 28178 and seven others above 22000 the nearest perpetual snow is on nursing a beautifully sharp conical peak 19139 feet high and thirtytwo miles distant the most remote mountain seen is donkia 23176 feet high and seventythree miles distant whilst kinchin which forms the principal mass both for height and bulk is exactly fortyfive miles distant  on first viewing this glorious panorama the impression produced on the imagination by their prodigious elevation is that the peaks tower in the air and pierce the clouds and such are the terms generally used in descriptions of similar alpine scenery but the observer if he look again will find that even the most stupendous occupy a very low position on the horizon the top of kinchin itself measuring only 4 degrees 31 minutes above the level of the observer donkia again which is 23176 feet above the sea or about 15700 above mr hodgsons rises only 1 degrees 55 minutes above the horizon an angle which is quite inappreciable to the eye when unaided by instruments these are the apparent angles which i took from mr hodgsons house alt 7300 feet with an excellent theodolite no deduction being made for refraction  this view may be extended a little by ascending sinchul which rises a thousand feet above the elevation of mr hodgsons house and is a few miles southeast of dorjiling from its summit chumulari 23929 feet is seen to the northeast at eightyfour miles distance rearing its head as a great rounded mass over the snowy chola range out of which it appears to rise although in reality lying forty miles beyondso deceptive is the perspective of snowymountains to the northwest again at upwards of 100 miles distance a beautiful group of snowy mountains rises above the black singalelah range the chief being perhaps as high as kinchinjunga from which it is fully eighty miles distant to the westward and between them no mountain of considerable altitude intervenes the nepalese himalaya in that direction sinking remarkably towards the arun river which there enters nepal from tibet  the top of sinchul is a favourite excursion from dorjiling being very easy of access and the path abounding in rare and beautiful plants and passing through magnificent forests of oak magnolia and rhododendron while the summit besides embracing this splendid view of the snowy range over the dorjiling spur in the foreground commands also the plains of india with the courses of the teesta mahanuddee balasun and mechi rivers in the months of april and may when the magnolias and rhododendrons are in blossom the gorgeous vegetation is in some respects not to be surpassed by anything in the tropics but the effect is much marred by the prevailing gloom of the weather the whiteflowered magnolia m excelsa wall forms a predominant tree at 7000 to 8000 feet and in 1848 it blossomed so profusely that the forests on the broad flanks of sinchul and other mountains of that elevation appeared as if sprinkled with snow the purpleflowered kind again m campbellii hardly occurs below 8000 feet and forms an immense but very ugly blackbarked sparingly branched tree leafless in winter and also during the flowering season when it puts forth from the ends of its branches great rosepurple cupshaped flowers whose fleshy petals strew the ground on its branches and on those of oaks and laurels rhododendron dalhousiae grows epiphytically a slender shrub bearing from three to six white lemonscented bells four and a half inches long and as many broad at the end of each branch in the same woods the scarlet rhododendron r arboreum is very scarce and is outvied by the great r argenteum which grows as a tree forty feet high with magnificent leaves twelve to fifteen inches long deep green wrinkled above and silvery below while the flowers are as large as those of r dalhousiae and grow more in a cluster i know nothing of the kind that exceeds in beauty the flowering branch of r argenteum with its wide spreading foliage and glorious mass of flowers  oaks laurels maples birch chesnut hydrangea a species of fig which is found on the very summit and three chinese and japanese genera are the principal features of the forest the common bushes being aucuba skimmia and the curious helwingia which bears little clusters of flowers on the centre of the leaf like butchersbroom in spring immense broadleaved arums spring up with green or purplestriped hoods that end in taillike threads eighteen inches long which lie along the ground and there are various kinds of convallaria paris begonia and other beautiful flowering herbs nearly thirty ferns may be gathered on this excursion including many of great beauty and rarity but the treefern does not ascend so high grasses are very rare in these woods excepting the dwarf bamboo now cultivated in the open air in england  before proceeding to narrate my different expeditions into sikkim and nepal from dorjiling i shall give a sketch of the different peoples and races composing the heterogeneous population of sikkim and the neighbouring mountains  the lepcha is the aboriginal inhabitant of sikkim and the prominent character in dorjiling where he undertakes all sorts of outdoor employment the race to which he belongs is a very singular one markedly mongolian in features and a good deal too by imitation in habit still he differs from his tibetan prototype though not so decidedly as from the nepalese and bhotanese between whom he is hemmed into a narrow tract of mountain country barely 60 miles in breadth the lepchas possess a tradition of the flood during which a couple escaped to the top of a mountain tendong near dorjiling the earliest traditions which they have of their history date no further back than some three hundred years when they describe themselves as having been longhaired halfclad savages at about that period they were visited by tibetans who introduced boodh worship the platting of their hair into pigtails and very many of their own customs their physiognomy is however so tibetan in its character that it cannot be supposed that this was their earliest intercourse with the transnivean races whether they may have wandered from beyond the snows before the spread of boodhism and its civilisation or whether they are a cross between the tamulian of india and the tibetan has not been decided their language though radically identical with tibetan differs from it in many important particulars they or at least some of their tribes call themselves rong and arratt and their country dijong they once possessed a great part of east nepal as far west as the tambur river and at a still earlier period they penetrated as far west as the arun river  an attentive examination of the lepcha in one respect entirely contradicts our preconceived notions of a mountaineer as he is timid peaceful and no brawler qualities which are all the more remarkable from contrasting so strongly with those of his neighbours to the east and west of whom the ghorkas are brave and warlike to a proverb and the bhotanese quarrelsome cowardly and cruel a group of lepchas is exceedingly picturesque they are of short staturefour feet eight inches to five feetrather broad in the chest and with muscular arms but small hands and slender wrists i have seldom been able to insert my own wrist which is smaller than the average into the wooden guard which the lepcha wears on his left as a protection against the bowstring it is a curved ring of wood with an opening at one side through which by a little stretching the wrist is inserted the face is broad flat and of eminently tartar character flatnosed and obliqueeyed with no beard and little moustache the complexion is sallow or often a clear olive the hair is collected into an immense tail plaited flat or round the lower limbs are powerfully developed befitting genuine mountaineers the feet are small though never really handsome and very womanish in the cast of countenance they have invariably a mild frank and even engaging expression which i have in vain sought to analyse and which is perhaps due more to the absence of anything unpleasing than to the presence of direct grace or beauty in like manner the girls are often very engaging to look upon though without one good feature they are all smiles and goodnature and the children are frank lively laughing urchins the old women are thorough hags indolence when left to themselves is their besetting sin they detest any fixed employment and their foulness of person and garments renders them disagreeable inmates in this rainy climate they are supportable out of doors though fond of bathing when they come to a stream in hot weather and expert even admirable swimmers these people never take to the water for the purpose of ablution in disposition they  illustrationlepcha girl and bhoodist lama  are amiable and obliging frank humorous and polite without the servility of the hindoos and their address is free and unrestrained their intercourse with one another and with europeans is scrupulously honest a present is divided equally amongst many without a syllable of discontent or grudging look or word each on receiving his share coming up and giving the donor a brusque bow and thanks they have learnt to overcharge already and use extortion in dealing as is the custom with the people of the plains but it is clumsily done and never accompanied with the grasping air and insufferable whine of the latter they are constantly armed with a long heavy straight knife it is called ban and serves equally for plough toothpick tableknife hatchet hammer and sword but never draw it on one another family and political feuds are alike unheard of amongst them  the lepcha is in morals far superior to his tibet and bhotan neighbours polyandry being unknown and polygamy rare this is no doubt greatly due to the conventual system not being carried to such an excess as in bhotan where the ties of relationship even are disregarded  like the new zealander tasmanian fuegian and natives of other climates which though cold are moist and equable the lepchas dress is very scanty and when we are wearing woollen undergarments and hose he is content with one cotton vesture which is loosely thrown round the body leaving one or both arms free it reaches to the knee and is gathered round the waist its fabric is close the ground colour white ornamented with longitudinal blue stripes two or three fingers broad prettily worked with red and white when new and clean this garb is remarkably handsome and gay but not showy in cold weather an upper garment with loose sleeves is added a long knife with a common wooden handle hangs by the side stuck in a sheath he has often also a quiver of poisoned arrows and a bamboo the bamboo of which the quiver is made is thin and light it is brought from assam and called tulda or dulwa by the bengalees bow across his back on his right wrist is a curious wooden guard for the bowstring and a little pouch containing aconite poison and a few common implements is suspended to his girdle a hat he seldom wears and when he does it is often extravagantly broad and flatbrimmed with a small hemispherical crown it is made of leaves of scitamineae between two thin plates of bamboowork clumsy and heavy this is generally used in the rainy weather while in the dry a conical one is worn also of platted slips of bamboo with broad flakes of talc between the layers and a peacocks feather at the side the umbrella consists of a large hood much like the ancient boat called a coracle which being placed over the head reaches to the thighs behind it is made of platted bamboo enclosing broad leaves of phrynium a group of lepchas with these on running along in the pelting rain are very droll figures they look like snails with their shells on their backs all the lepchas are fond of ornaments wearing silver hoops in their ears necklaces made of cornelian amber and turquoise brought from tibet and pearls and corals from the south with curious silver and golden charmboxes or amulets attached to their necks or arms these are of tibetan workmanship and often of great value they contain little idols charms and written prayers or the bones hair or nailparings of a lama some are of great beauty and highly ornamented in these decorations and in their hair they take some pride the ladies frequently dressing the latter for the gentlemen thus one may often see the last thing at night a damsel of discreet port demurely go behind a young man unplait his pigtail teaze the hair thin it of some of its lively inmates braid it up for him and retire the women always wear two braided pigtails and it is by this they are most readily distinguished from their effeminatelooking partners who wear only one ermann travels in siberia ii p 204 mentions the buraet women as wearing two tails and fillets with jewels and the men as having one queue only when in full dress the womans costume is extremely ornamental and picturesque besides the shirt and petticoat she wears a small sleeveless woollen cloak of gay pattern usually covered with crosses and fastened in front by a girdle of silver chains her neck is loaded with silver chains amber necklaces etc and her head adorned with a coronet of scarlet cloth studded with seedpearls jewels glass beads etc the common dress is a long robe of indi a cloth of coarse silk spun from the cocoon of a large caterpillar that is found wild at the foot of the hills and is also cultivated it feeds on many different leaves sal shorea castoroil etc  in diet they are gross feeders dr campbells definition of the lepchas flora cibaria is that he eats or must have eaten everything soft enough to chew for as he knows whatever is poisonous he must have tried all his knowledge being wholly empirical rice however forming their chief sustenance it is grown without irrigation and produces a large flat coarse grain which becomes gelatinous and often pink when cooked pork is a staple dish and they also eat elephant and all kinds of animal food when travelling they live on whatever they can find whether animal or vegetable ferntops roots of scitamineae and their flowerbuds various leaves it is difficult to say what not and fungi are chopped up fried with a little oil and eaten their cooking is coarse and dirty salt is costly but prized pawn betel pepper is never eaten tobacco they are too poor to buy and too indolent to grow and cure spices oil etc are relished  they drink out of little wooden cups turned from knots of maple or other woods these are very curious on several accounts they are very pretty often polished and mounted with silver some are supposed to be antidotes against poison and hence fetch an enormous price they are of a peculiar wood rarer and palercoloured i have paid a guinea for one such hardly different from the common sort which cost but 4d or 6d mm huc and gabet graphically allude to this circumstance when wishing to purchase cups at lhassa where their price is higher as they are all imported from the himalaya the knots from which they are formed are produced on the roots of oaks maples and other mountain forest trees by a parasitical plant known to botanists as balanophora  their intoxicating drink which seems more to excite than to debauch the mind is partially fermented murwa grain eleusine coracana spirits are rather too strong to be relished raw and when a glass of wine is given to one of a party he sips it and hands it round to all the rest a long bamboo flute with four or six burnt holes far below the monthhole is the only musical instrument i have seen in use among them when travelling and the fatigues of the day are over the lepchas will sit for hours chatting telling stories singing in a monotonous tone or blowing this flute i have often listened with real pleasure to the simple music of this rude instrument its low and sweet tones are singularly aeolian as are the airs usually played which fall by octaves it seems to harmonize with the solitude of their primaeval forests and he must have a dull ear who cannot draw from it the indication of a contented mind whether he may relish its soft musical notes or not though always equipped for the chase i fancy the lepcha is no great sportsman there is little to be pursued in this region and he is not driven by necessity to follow what there is  their marriages are contracted in childhood and the wife purchased by money or by service rendered to the future fatherinlaw the parties being often united before the woman leaves her parents roof in cases where the payment is not forthcoming and the bridegroom prefers giving his and his wifes labour to the father for a stated period in lieu on the time of service expiring or the money being paid up the marriage is publicly celebrated by feasting and riot the females are generally chaste and the marriagetie is strictly kept its violation being heavily punished by divorce beating slavery etc in cases of intermarriage with foreigners the children belong to the fathers country all the labours of the house the field and march devolve on the women and children or slaves if they have them  smallpox is dreaded and infected persons often cruelly shunned a suspicion of this or of cholera frequently emptying a village or town in a night vaccination has been introduced by dr pearson and it is much practised by dr campbell it being eagerly sought cholera is scarcely known at dorjiling and when it has been imported thither has never spread disease is very rare amongst the lepchas and ophthalmic elephantiasis and leprosy the scourges of hot climates are rarely known goitre prevails may not the use of the head instead of the shoulderstrap in carrying loads be a predisposing cause of goitre by inducing congestion of the laryngeal vessels the lepcha is certainly far more free from this disease than any of the tribes of e nepal i have mixed with and he is both more idle and less addicted to the headstrap as a porter i have seen it to be almost universal in some villages of bhoteeas where the headstrap alone is used in carrying in both summer and winter crops as also amongst the salttraders or rather those families who carry the salt from the passes to the nepalese villages and who very frequently have no shoulderstraps but invariably headbands i am far from attributing all goitre even in the mountains to this practice but i think it is proved that the disease is most prevalent in the mountainous regions of both the old and new world and that in these the practice of supporting enormous loads by the cervical muscles is frequent it is also found in the himalayan sheep and goats which accompany the salttraders and whose loads are supported in ascending by a band passing under the throat though not so conspicuously as amongst bhoteeas bhotanese and others rheumatism is frequent and intermittent fevers with ague also violent and often fatal remittents almost invariably induced by sleeping in the hot valleys especially at the beginning and end of the rains the european complaints of liver and bowel disease are all but unknown death is regarded with horror the dead are burnt or buried sometimes both much depending on custom and position omens are sought in the entrails of fowls etc and other vestiges of their savage origin are still preserved though now gradually disappearing  the lepchas profess no religion though acknowledging the existence of good and bad spirits to the good they pay no heed why should we they say the good spirits do us no harm the evil spirits who dwell in every rock grove and mountain are constantly at mischief and to them we must pray for they hurt us every tribe has a priestdoctor he neither knows nor attempts to practise the healing art but is a pure exorcist all bodily ailments being deemed the operations of devils who are cast out by prayers and invocations still they acknowledge the lamas to be very holy men and were the latter only moderately active they would soon convert all the lepchas their priests are called bijooas they profess mendicancy and seem intermediate between the begging friars of tibet whose dress and attributes they assume and the exorcists of the aboriginal lepchas they sing dance masked and draped like harlequins beg bless curse and are merry mountebanks those that affect more of the lama boodhist carry the mani or revolving praying machine and wear rosaries and amulets others again are all tatters and rags they are often employed to carry messages and to transact little knaveries the natives stand in some awe of them and being besides of a generous disposition keep the wallet of the bijooa always full  such are some of the prominent features of this people who inhabit the subhimalayas between the nepalese and bhotan frontiers at elevations of 3000 to 6000 feet in their relations with us they are conspicuous for their honesty their power as carriers and mountaineers and their skill as woodsmen for they build a waterproof house with a thatch of banana leaves in the lower or of bamboo in the elevated regions and equip it with a table and bedsteads for three persons in an hour using no implement but their heavy knife kindness and good humour soon attach them to your person and service a gloomytempered or morose master they avoid an unkind one they flee if they serve a good hillsman like themselves they will follow him with alacrity sleep on the cold bleak mountain exposed to the pitiless rain without a murmur lay down the heavy burden to carry their master over a stream or give him a helping hand up a rock or precipicedo anything in short but encounter a foe for i believe the lepcha to be a veritable coward yet during the ghorka war they displayed many instances of courage when so hard pressed however that there was little choice of evils it is well perhaps he is so for if a race numerically so weak were to embroil itself by resenting the injuries of the warlike ghorkas or dark bhotanese the folly would soon lead to destruction  before leaving the lepchas it may be worth mentioning that the northern parts of the country towards the tibet frontier are inhabited by sikkim bhoteeas bhote is the general name for tibet not bhotan and kumpa is a large province or district in that country the bhotanese natives of bhotan or of the dhurma country are called dhurma people in allusion to their spiritual chief the dhurma rajah they are a darker and more powerful race rude turbulent and tibetan in language and religion with the worst features of those people exaggerated the various races of nepal are too numerous to be alluded to here they are all described in various papers by mr hodgson in the journal of the asiatic society of bengal the dhurma people are numerous at dorjiling they are often runaways but invariably prove more industrious settlers than the lepchas in the himalaya the name bhotan is unknown amongst the tibetans it signifies literally according to mr hodgson the end of bhote or tibet being the eastern extreme of that country the lepchas designate bhotan as ayeu or aieu as do often the bhotanese themselves sikkim again is called lhop or lho by the lepchas and bhotanese or kumpas a mixed race calling themselves kumpa rong or kumpa lepchas but they are emigrants from tibet having come with the first rajah of sikkim these people are more turbulent and bolder than the lepchas and retain much of their tibetan character and even of that of the very province from which they came which is northeast of lhassa and inhabited by robbers all the accounts i have received of it agree with those given by mm huc and gabet  next to the lepchas the most numerous tribe in sikkim is that of the limboos called chung by the lepchas they abound also in east nepal which they once ruled inhabiting elevations from 2000 feet to 5000 feet they are boodhists and though not divided into castes belong to several tribes all consider themselves as the earliest inhabitants of the tambur valley though they have a tradition of having originally emigrated from tibet which their tartar countenance confirms they are more slender and sinewy than the lepchas and neither plait their hair nor wear ornaments instead of the ban they use the nepal curved knife called cookree while for the striped kirtle of the lepcha are substituted loose cotton trousers and a tight jacket a sash is worn round the middle and on the head a small cotton cap when they ruled over east nepal their system was feudal and on their uniting against the nepalese they were with difficulty dislodged from their strongholds they are said to be equally brave and cruel in battle putting the old and weak to the sword carrying the younger to slavery and killing on the march such captives as are unable to proceed many enlist at dorjiling which the lepchas never do and the rajah of nepal employs them in his army where however they seldom obtain promotion this being reserved for soldiers of hindoo tribes latterly jung bahadur levied a force of 6000 of them who were cantoned at katmandoo where the cholera breaking out carried off some hundreds causing many families who dreaded conscription to flock to dorjiling their habits are so similar to those of the lepchas that they constantly intermarry they mourn burn and bury their dead raising a mound over the corpse erecting a headstone and surrounding the grave with a little paling of sticks they then scatter eggs and pebbles over the ground in these offices the bijooa of the lepchas is employed but the limboo has also priests of his own called phedangbos who belong to rather a higher order than the bijooas they officiate at marriages when a cock is put into the bridegrooms hands and a hen into those of the bride the phedangbo then cuts off the birds heads when the blood is caught on a plantain leaf and runs into pools from which omens are drawn at death guns are fired to announce to the gods the departure of the spirit of these there are many having one supreme head and to them offerings and sacrifices are made they do not believe in metempsychosis  the limboo language is totally different from the lepcha with less of the z in it and more labials and palatals hence more pleasing its affinities i do not know it has no peculiar written character the lepcha or nagri being used dr campbell from whom i have derived most of my information respecting these people was informed see dorjiling guide p 89 calcutta 1845 on good authority that they had once a written language now lost and that it was compounded from many others by a sage of antiquity the same authority stated that their lepcha name chung is a corruption of that of their place of residence possibly the tsang province of tibet  the moormis are the only other native tribe remaining in any numbers in sikkim except the tibetans of the loftier mountains whom i shall mention at a future period and the mechis of the pestilential terai the forests of which they never leave the moormis are a scattered people respecting whom i have no information except from the authority quoted above they are of tibetan origin and called nishung from being composed of two branches respectively from the districts of nimo and shung both on the road between sikkim and lhassa they are now most frequent in central and eastern nepal and are a pastoral and agricultural people inhabiting elevations of 4000 to 6000 feet and living in stone houses thatched with grass they are a large powerful and active race grave very plain in features with little hair on the face both their language and religion are purely tibetan  the magras a tribe now confined to nepal west of the arun are aborigines of sikkim whence they were driven by the lepchas westward into the country of the limboos and by these latter further west still they are said to have been savages and not of tibetan origin and are now converted to hindooism a somewhat mythical account of a wild people still inhabiting the sikkim mountains will be alluded to elsewhere  it is curious to observe that these mountains do not appear to have afforded refuge to the tamulian the tamulians are the coles dangas etc of the mountains of central india and the peninsula who retired to mountain fastnesses on the invasion of their country by the indogermanic conquerors who are now represented by the hindoos aborigines of india proper all the himalayan tribes of sikkim being markedly mongolian in origin it does not however follow that they are all of tibetan extraction perhaps indeed none but the moormis are so the mechi of the terai is decidedly indochinese and of the same stock as the savage races of assam the northeast and east frontier of bengal arracan burmah etc both lepchas and limboos had before the introduction of lama boodhism from tibet many features in common with the natives of arracan especially in their creed sacrifices faith in omens worship of many spirits absence of idols and of the doctrine of metempsychosis some of their customs too are the same the form of their houses and of some of their implements their striped garments their constant and dexterous use of the bamboo for all utensils their practice of nightattacks in war of using poisoned arrows only in the chase and that of planting crowfeet of sharp bamboo stakes along the paths an enemy is expected to follow such are but a few out of many points of resemblance most of which struck me when reading lieutenant phayres account of arracan journal of the asiatic society of bengal and when travelling in the districts of khasia and cachar  the laws affecting the distribution of plants and the lower animals materially influence the migrations of man also and as the botany zoology and climate of the malayan and siamese peninsula advance far westwards into india along the foot of the himalaya so do also the varieties of the human race these features are most conspicuously displayed in the natives of assam on both sides of the burrampooter as far as the great bend of that river beyond which they gradually disappear and none of the himalayan tribes east of that point practise the bloody and brutal rites in war that prevail amongst the cookies khasias garrows and other indochinese tribes of the mountain forests of assam eastern bengal and the malay peninsula  i have not alluded to that evidence of the extraction of the sikkim races which is to be derived from their languages and from which we may hope for a clue to their origin the subject is at present under discussion and involved in much obscurity  that six or seven different tribes without any feudal system or coercive head with different languages and customs should dwell in close proximity and in peace and unity within the confined territory of sikkim even for a limited period is an anomaly the more especially when it is considered that except for a tincture of the boodhist religion among some few of the people they are all but savages as low in the scale of intellect as the new zealander or the tahitian and beneath those races in ingenuity and skill as craftsmen wars have been waged amongst them but they were neither sanguinary nor destructive and the fact remains no less remarkable that at the period of our occupying dorjiling friendship and unanimity existed amongst all these tribes from the tibetan at 14000 feet to the mechi of the plains under a sovereign whose temporal power was wholly unsupported by even the semblance of arms and whose spiritual supremacy was acknowledged by very few    chapter vi  excursion from dorjiling to great rungeetzones of vegetation treefernspalms upper

other calami range between 1000 and 6000 feet on the outer hills some of them being found forty miles distant from the plains of india the other palms of sikkim are simong caryota urens it is rare and ascends to nearly 5000 feet phoenix probably p acaulis buch a small stemless species which grows on the driest soil in the deep valleys it is the schaap of the lepchas who eat the young seeds and use the feathery fronds as screens in hunting wallichia oblongifolia the ooh of the lepchas who make no use of it dr campbell and myself however found that it is an admirable fodder for horses who prefer it to any other green food to be had in these mountains areca gracilis and licuala peltata are the only other palms in sikkim but cycas pectinata with the indiarubber fig occurs in the deepest and hottest valleysthe western limit of both these interesting plants of pandanus there is a graceful species at elevations of 1000 to 4000 feet borr lepcha the fourth striking feature is a wild plantain which ascends to nearly the same elevation lukhlo lepcha this is replaced by another and rather larger species at lower elevations both ripen austere and small fruits which are full of seeds and quite uneatable that commonly grown in sikkim is an introduced stock nor have the wild species ever been cultivated it is very large but poor in flavour and does not bear seeds the zones of these conspicuous plants are very clearly defined and especially if the traveller standing on one of the innumerable spurs which project from the dorjiling ridge cast his eyes up the gorges of green on either hand  at 1000 feet below dorjiling a fine wooded spur projects called leebong this beautiful spot is fully ten degrees warmer than mr hodgsons house and enjoys considerably more sunshine peaches and english fruittrees flourish extremely well but do not ripen fruit the teaplant succeeds here admirably and might be cultivated to great profit and be of advantage in furthering a trade with tibet it has been tried on a large scale by dr campbell at his residence alt 7000 feet but the frosts and snow of that height injure it as do the hailstorms in spring  below leebong is the village of ging surrounded by steeps cultivated with maize rice and millet it is rendered very picturesque by a long row of tall poles each bearing a narrow vertically elongated banner covered with boodhist inscriptions and surmounted by coronetlike ornaments or spearheads rudely cut out of wood or formed of basketwork and adorned with cotton fringe ging is peopled by bhotan emigrants and when one dies if his relations can afford to pay for them two additional poles and flags are set up by the lamas in honour of his memory and that of sunga the third member of the boodhist trinity  below this the gordonia commences with cedrela toona and various tropical genera such as abound near punkabaree the heat and hardness of the rocks cause the streams to dry up on these abrupt hills especially on the eastern slope and the water is therefore conveyed along the sides of the path in conduits ingeniously made of bamboo either split in half or what is better whole except at the septum which is removed through a lateral hole the oak and chesnut of this level 3000 feet are both different from those which grow above as are the brambles the arums are replaced by caladiums treeferns cease below 4000 feet and the large bamboo abounds  at about 2000 feet and ten miles distant from dorjiling we arrived at a low long spur dipping down to the bed of the rungeet at its junction with the rungmo this is close to the boundary of the british ground and there is a guardhouse and a sepoy or two at it here we halted it took the lepchas about twenty minutes to construct a table and two bedsteads within our tent each was made of four forked sticks stuck in the ground supporting as many sidepieces across which were laid flat split pieces of bamboo bound tightly together by strips of rattan palmstem the beds were afterwards softened by many layers of bambooleaf and if not very downy they were dry and as firm as if put together with screws and joints  this spur rises out of a deep valley quite surrounded by lofty mountains it is narrow and covered with red clay which the natives chew as a cure for goitre north it looks down into a gully at the bottom of which the rungeets foamy stream winds through a dense forest in the opposite direction the rungmo comes tearing down from the top of sinchul 7000 feet above and though its roar is heard and its course is visible throughout its length the stream itself is nowhere seen so deep does it cut its channel except on this and a few similarly hard rocky hills around the vegetation is a mass of wood and jungle at this spot it is rather scanty and dry with abundance of the pinus longifolia and sal the dwarf datepalm phoenix acaulis also was very abundant  the descent to the river was exceedingly steep the banks presenting an impenetrable jungle the pines on the arid crests of the hills around formed a remarkable feature they grow like the scotch fir the tall red trunks springing from the steep and dry slopes but little resin exudes from the stem which like that of most pines is singularly free from lichens and mosses its wood is excellent and the charcoal of the burnt leaves is used as a pigment being confined to dry soil this pine is local in sikkim and the elevation it attains here is not above 3000 feet in bhotan where there is more dry country its range is about the same and in the northwest himalaya from 2500 to 7000 feet  the lepcha never inhabits one spot for more than three successive years after which an increased rent is demanded by the rajah he therefore squats in any place which he can render profitable for that period and then moves to another his first operation after selecting a site is to burn the jungle then he clears away the trees and cultivates between the stumps at this season firing the jungle is a frequent practice and the effect by night is exceedingly fine a forest so dry and full of bamboo and extending over such steep hills affording grand blazing spectacles heavy clouds canopy the mountains above and stretching across the valleys shut out the firmament the air is a dead calm as usual in these deep gorges and the fires invisible by day are seen raging all around appearing to an inexperienced eye in all but dangerous proximity the voices of birds and insects being hushed nothing is audible but the harsh roar of the rivers and occasionally rising far above it that of the forest fires at night we were literally surrounded by them some smouldering like the shaleheaps at a colliery others fitfully bursting forth whilst others again stalked along with a steadily increasing and enlarging flame shooting out great tongues of fire which spared nothing as they advanced with irresistible might their triumph is in reaching a great bamboo clump when the noise of the flames drowns that of the torrents and as the great stemjoints burst from the expansion of the confined air the report is as that of a salvo from a park of artillery at dorjiling the blaze is visible and the deadened reports of the bamboos bursting is heard throughout the night but in the valley and within a mile of the scene of destruction the effect is the most grand being heightened by the glare reflected from the masses of mist which hover above  on the following morning we pursued a path to the bed of the river passing a rude booddhist monument a pile of slaterocks with an attempt at the mystical hemisphere at top a few flags or banners and slabs of slate were inscribed with om mani padmi om placed on a jutting angle of the spur backed with the pineclad hills and flanked by a torrent on either hand the spot was wild and picturesque and i could not but gaze with a feeling of deep interest on these emblems of a religion which perhaps numbers more votaries than any other on the face of the globe booddhism in some form is the predominating creed from siberia and kamschatka to ceylon from the caspian steppes to japan throughout china burmah ava and a part of the malayan archipelago its associations enter into every book of travels over these vast regions with booddha dhurma sunga jos fo and prayingwheels the mind is arrested by the names the imagination captivated by the symbols and though i could not worship in the grove it was impossible to deny to the inscribed stones such a tribute as is commanded by the first glimpse of objects which have long been familiar to our minds but not previously offered to our senses my head lepcha went further to a due observance of demonworship he united a deep reverence for the lamas and he venerated their symbols rather as theirs than as those of their religion he walked round the pile of stones three times from left to right repeating his om mani etc then stood before it with his head hung down and his long queue streaming behind and concluded by a votive offering of three pinecones when done he looked round at me nodded smirked elevated the angles of his little turnedup eyes and seemed to think we were safe from all perils in the valleys yet to be explored  illustrationpines pinus longifolia rungeet valley  in the gorge of the rungeet the heat was intolerable though the thermometer did not rise above 95 degrees the mountains leave but a narrow gorge between them here and there bordered by a belt of strong soil supporting a towering crop of long canelike grasses and tall trees the troubled river about eighty yards across rages along over a gravelly bed crossing the rungmo where it falls into the rungeet we came upon a group of natives drinking fermented murwa liquor under a rock i had a good deal of difficulty in getting my people past and more in inducing one of the topers to take the place of a ghorka nepalese of our party who was ill with fever soon afterwards at a most wild and beautiful spot i saw for the first time one of the most characteristic of himalayan objects of art a cane bridge all the spurs round the bases of which the river flowed were steep and rocky their flanks clothed with the richest tropical forest their crests tipped with pines on the rivers edge the banana pandanus and bauhinia were frequent and figs prevailed one of the latter of an exceedingly beautiful species projected over the stream growing out of a mass of rock its roots interlaced and grasping at every available support while its branches loaded with deep glossy foliage hung over the water this tree formed one pier for the canes that on the opposite bank was constructed of strong piles propped with large stones and between them swung the  illustrationcane bridge  bridge a sketch of one of these bridges will be found in vol ii about eighty yards long ever rocking over the torrent forty feet below the lightness and extreme simplicity of its structure were very remarkable two parallel canes on the same horizontal plane were stretched across the stream from them others hung in loops and along the loops were laid one or two bamboo stems for flooring cross pieces below this flooring hung from the two upper canes which they thus served to keep apart the traveller grasps one of the canes in either hand and walks along the loose bamboos laid on the swinging loops the motion is great and the rattling of the loose dry bamboos is neither a musical sound nor one calculated to inspire confidence the whole structure seeming as if about to break down with shoes it is not easy to walk and even with bare feet it is often difficult there being frequently but one bamboo which if the fastening is loose tilts up leaving the pedestrian suspended over the torrent by the slender canes when properly and strongly made with good fastenings and a floor of bamboos laid transversely these bridges are easy to cross the canes are procured from a species of calamus they are as thick as the finger and twenty or thirty yards long knotted together and the other pieces are fastened to them by strips of the same plant a lepcha carrying one hundred and forty pounds on his back crosses without hesitation slowly but steadily and with perfect confidence  a deep broad pool below the bridge was made available for a ferry the boat was a triangular raft of bamboo stems with a stage on the top and it was secured on the opposite side of the stream having a cane reaching across to that on which we were a stout lepcha leapt into the boiling flood and boldly swam across holding on by the cane without which he would have been carried away he unfastened the raft and we drew it over by the cane and seated on the stage up to our knees in water we were pulled across the raft bobbing up and down over the rippling stream  we were beyond british ground on the opposite bank where any one guiding europeans is threatened with punishment we had expected a guide to follow us but his nonappearance caused us to delay for some hours four roads or rather forest paths meeting here all of which were difficult to find after a while part of a marriageprocession came up headed by the bridegroom a handsome young lepcha leading a cow for the marriage feast and after talking to him a little he volunteered to show us the path on the flats by the stream grew the sago palm cycas pectinata with a stem ten feet high and a beautiful crown of foliage the contrast between this and the scotchlooking pine both growing with oaks and palms was curious much of the forest had been burnt and we traversed large blackened patches where the heat was intense and increased by the burning trunks of prostrate trees which smoulder for months and leave a heap of white ashes the larger timber being hollow in the centre a current of air is produced which causes the interior to burn rapidly till the sides fall in and all is consumed i was often startled when walking in the forest by the hot blast proceeding from such which i had approached without a suspicion of their being other than cold dead trunks  leaving the forest the path led along the river bank and over the great masses of rock which strewed its course the beautiful indiarubber fig was common as was bassia butyracea the yel pote of the lepchas from the seeds of which they express a concrete oil which is received and hardens in bamboo vessels on the forestskirts hoya parasitical orchideae and ferns abounded the chaulmoogra whose fruit is used to intoxicate fish was very common as was an immense mulberry tree that yields a milky juice and produces a long green sweet fruit large fish chiefly cyprinoid were abundant in the beautifully clear water of the river but by far the most striking feature consisted in the amazing quantity of superb butterflies large tropical swallowtails black with scarlet or yellow eyes on their wings they were seen everywhere sailing majestically through the still hot air or fluttering from one scorching rock to another and especially loving to settle on the damp sand of the riveredge where they sat by thousands with erect wings balancing themselves with a rocking motion as their heavy sails inclined them to one side or the other resembling a crowded fleet of yachts on a calm day such an entomological display cannot be surpassed cicindelae were very numerous and incredibly active as were grylli and the great cicadeae were everywhere lighting on the ground when they uttered a short sharp creaking sound and anon disappeared as if by magic beautiful whipsnakes were gleaming in the sun they hold on by a few coils of the tail round a twig the greater part of their body stretched out horizontally occasionally retracting and darting an unerring aim at some insect the narrowness of the gorge and the excessive steepness of the bounding hills prevented any view except of the opposite mountain face which was one dense forest in which the wild banana was conspicuous  towards evening we arrived at another canebridge still more dilapidated than the former but similar in structure for a few hundred yards before reaching it we lost the path and followed the precipitous face of slaterocks overhanging the stream which dashed with great violence below though we could not walk comfortably even with our shoes off the lepchas bearing their enormous loads proceeded with perfect indifference  anxious to avoid sleeping at the bottom of the valley we crawled very much fatigued through burnt dry forest up a very sharp ridge so narrow that the tent sat astride on it the ropes being fastened to the tops of small trees on either slope the ground swarmed with black ants which got into our tea sugar etc while it was so covered with charcoal that we were soon begrimed our lepchas preferred remaining on the riverbank whence they had to bring up water to us in great bamboo chungis as they are called the great dryness of this face is owing to its southern exposure the opposite mountains equally high and steep being clothed in a rich green forest  at nine the next morning the temperature was 78 degrees but a fine cool easterly wind blew descending to the bed of the river the temperature was 84 degrees the difference in humidity of the two stations with about 300 feet difference in height was more remarkable at the upper the wet bulb thermometer was 675 degrees and consequently the saturation point 0713 at the lower the wet bulb was 68 degrees and saturation 0599 the temperature of the river was at all hours of the preceding day and this morning 675 degrees at this hour the probable temperature at dorjiling 6000 feet above this would be 56 degrees with a temperature of wet bulb 55 degrees and the atmosphere loaded with vapour at calcutta again the temperature was at the observatory 983 degrees wet bulb 818 degrees and saturation0737 the dryness of the air in the damperlooking and luxuriant riverbed was owing to the heated rocks of its channel while the humidity of the atmosphere over the drierlooking hill where we encamped was due to the moisture of the wind then blowing  our course down the river was by so rugged a path that giddy and footsore with leaping from rock to rock we at last attempted the jungle but it proved utterly impervious on turning a bend of the stream the mountains of bhotan suddenly presented themselves with the teesta flowing at their base and we emerged at the angle formed by the junction of the rungeet which we had followed from the west of the teesta coming from the north and of their united streams flowing south  we were not long before enjoying the water when i was surprised to find that of the teesta singularly cold its temperature being 7 degrees below that of the rungeet this is no doubt due partly to the teesta flowing south and thus having less of the sun and partly to its draining snowy mountains throughout a much longer portion of its course the temperature of the one was 675 degrees and that of the other 605 degrees at the salient angle a rocky peninsula of their junction we could almost place one foot in the cold stream and the other in the warmer there is a no less marked difference in the colour of the two rivers the teesta being seagreen and muddy the great rungeet dark green and very clear and the waters like those of the arve and rhone at geneva preserve their colours for some hundred yards the line separating the two being most distinctly drawn the teesta or main stream is much the broadest about 80 or 100 yards wide at this season the most rapid and deep the rocks which skirt its bank were covered with a silt or mud deposit which i nowhere observed along the great rungeet and which as well as its colour and coldness was owing to the vast number of then melting glaciers drained by this river the rungeet on the other hand though it rises amongst the glaciers of kinchinjunga and its sister peaks is chiefly supplied by the rainfall of the outer ranges of sinchul and singalelah and hence its waters are clear except during the height of the rains  from this place we returned to dorjiling arriving on the afternoon of the following day  the most interesting trip to be made from dorjiling is that to the summit of tonglo a mountain on the singalelah range 10079 feet high due west of the station and twelve miles in a straight line but fully thirty by the path a full account of the botanical features noticed on this excursion which i made in may 1848 with mr barnes has appeared in the london journal of botany and the horticultural societys journal and i shall therefore recapitulate its leading incidents only  leaving the station by a native path the latter plunges at once into a forest and descends very rapidly occasionally emerging on cleared spurs where are fine crops of various millets with much maize and rice of the latter grain as many as eight or ten varieties are cultivated but seldom irrigated which owing to the dampness of the climate is not necessary the produce is often eightyfold but the grain is large coarse reddish and rather gelatinous when boiled after burning the timber the top soil is very fertile for several seasons abounding in humus below which is a stratum of stiff clay often of great thickness produced by the disintegration of the rocks an analysis of the soil will be found in the appendix the clay makes excellent bricks and often contains nearly 30 per cent of alumina  at about 4000 feet the great bamboo pao lepcha abounds it flowers every year which is not the case with all others of this genus most of which flower profusely over large tracts of country once in a great many years and then die away their place being supplied by seedlings which grow with immense rapidity this wellknown fact is not due as some suppose to the life of the species being of such a duration but to favourable circumstances in the season the pao attains a height of 40 to 60 feet and the culms average in thickness the human thigh it is used for large watervessels and its leaves form admirable thatch in universal use for european houses at dorjiling besides this the lepchas are acquainted with nearly a dozen kinds of bamboo these occur at various elevations below 12000 feet forming even in the pinewoods and above their zone in the skirts of the rhododendron scrub a small and sometimes almost impervious jungle in an economical point of view they maybe classed as those which split readily and those which do not the young shoots of several are eaten and the seeds of one are made into a fermented drink and into bread in times of scarcity but it would take many pages to describe the numerous purposes to which the various species are put  illusrationlepcha watercarrier with a bamboo chungi   gordonia is their most common tree g wallichii much prized for ploughshares and other purposes requiring a hard wood it is the singbrangkun of the lepchas and ascends to 4000 feet oaks at this elevation occur as solitary trees of species different from those of dorjiling there are three or four with a cupshaped involucre and three with spinous involucres enclosing an eatable sweet nut these generally grow on a dry clayey soil  some low steep spurs were well cultivated though the angle of the field was upwards of 25 degrees the crops chiefly maize were just sprouting this plant is occasionally hermaphrodite in sikkim the flowers forming a large drooping panicle and ripening small grains it is however a rare occurrence and the specimens are highly valued by the people  the general prevalence of figs one species of this very tropical genus ascends almost to 9000 feet on the outer ranges of sikkim and their allies the nettles of two of these cloth is made and of a third cordage the tops of two are eaten as are several species of procris the poa belongs to this order yielding that kind of grass cloth fibre now abundantly imported into england from the malay islands and used extensively for shirting is a remarkable feature in the botany of the sikkim himalaya up to nearly 10000 feet of the former there were here five species some bearing eatable and very palatable fruit of enormous size others with the fruit small and borne on prostrate leafless branches which spring from the root and creep along the ground  a troublesome dipterous insect the peepsa a species of siamulium swarms on the banks of the streams it is very small and black floating like a speck before the eye its bite leaves a spot of extravasated blood under the cuticle very irritating if not opened  crossing the little rungeet river we camped on the base of tonglo the night was calm and clear with faint cirrus but no dew a thermometer sunk two feet in rich vegetable mould stood at 78 degrees two hours after it was lowered and the same on the following morning this probably indicates the mean temperature of the month at that spot where however the dark colour of the exposed loose soil must raise the temperature considerably  may 20ththe temperature at sunrise was 67 degrees the morning bright and clear over head but the mountains looked threatening dorjiling perched on a ridge 5000 feet above us had a singular appearance we ascended the simonbong spur of tonglo so called from a small village and lama temple of that name on its summit where we arrived at noon and passing some chaits the chait of sikkim borrowed from tibet is a square pedestal surmounted with a hemisphere the convex end downwards and on it is placed a cone with a crescent on the top these are erected as tombs to lamas and as monuments to illustrious persons and are venerated accordingly the people always passing them from left to right often repeating the invocation ora mani padmi om gained the lamas residence  two species of bamboo the payong and praong of the lepchas here replace the pao of the lower regions the former was flowering abundantly the whole of the culms which were 20 feet high being a diffuse panicle of inflorescence the praong bears a round head of flowers at the ends of the leafy branches wild strawberry violet geranium etc announced our approach to the temperate zone around the temple were potato crops and peachtrees rice millet yam brinjal eggapple fennel hemp for smoking its narcotic leaves and cummin etc the potato thrives extremely well as a summer crop at 7000 feet in sikkim though i think the root from the dorjiling stock cultivated as a winter crop in the plains is superior both in size and flavour peaches never ripen in this part of sikkim apparently from the want of sun the tree grows well at from 3000 to 7000 feet elevation and flowers abundantly the fruit making the nearest approach to maturity according to the elevation from july to october at dorjiling it follows the english seasons flowering in march and fruiting in september when the scarce reddened and still hard fruit falls from the tree in the plains of india both this and the plum ripen in may but the fruits are very acid  it is curious that throughout this temperate region there is hardly an eatable fruit except the native walnut and some brambles of which the yellow and ground raspberry are the best some insipid figs and a very austere crabapple the european apple will scarcely ripen this fruit and several others ripen at katmandoo in nepal alt 4000 feet which place enjoys more sunshine than sikkim i have however received very different accounts of the produce which on the whole appears to be inferior and the pear not at all currants and gooseberries show no disposition to thrive and strawberries are the only fruits that ripen at all which they do in the greatest abundance vines figs pomegranates plums apricots etc will not succeed even as trees european vegetables again grow and thrive remarkably well throughout the summer of dorjiling and the produce is very fair sweet and good but inferior in flavour to the english  of tropical fruits cultivated below 4000 feet oranges and indifferent bananas alone are frequent with lemons of various kinds the season for these is however very short though that of the plantain might with care be prolonged oranges abound in winter and are excellent but neither so large nor free of white pulp as those of the khasia hills the west indies or the west coast of africa mangos are brought from the plains for though wild in sikkim the cultivated kinds do not thrive i have seen the pineapple plant but i never met with good fruit on it  a singular and almost total absence of the light and of the direct rays of the sun in the ripening season is the cause of this dearth of fruit both the farmer and orchard gardener in england know full well the value of a bright sky as well as of a warm autumnal atmosphere without this corn does not ripen and fruittrees are blighted the winter of the plains of india being more analogous in its distribution of moisture and heat to a european summer such fruits as the peach vine and even plum fig strawberry etc may be brought to bear well in march april and may if they are only carefully tended through the previous hot and damp season which is in respect to the functions of flowering and fruiting their winter  hence it appears that though some english fruits will turn the winter solstice of bengal november to may into summer and then flower and fruit neither these nor others will thrive in the summer of 7000 feet on the sikkim himalaya though its temperature so nearly approaches that of england on account of its rain and fogs further they are often exposed to a winters cold equal to the average of that of london the snow lying for a week on the ground and the thermometer descending to 25 degrees it is true that in no case is the extreme of cold so great here as in england but it is sufficient to check vegetation and to prevent fruittrees from flowering till they are fruiting in the plains there is in this respect a great difference between the climate of the central and eastern and western himalaya at equal elevations in the western kumaon etc the winters are colder than in sikkimthe summers warmer and less humid the rainy season is shorter and the sun shines so much more frequently between the heavy showers that the apple and other fruits are brought to a much better state it is true that the raingauge may show as great a fall there but this is no measure of the humidity of the atmosphere and still less so of the amount of the suns direct light and heat intercepted by aqueous vapour for it takes no account of the quantity of moisture suspended in the air nor of the depositions from fogs which are far more fatal to the perfecting of fruits than the heaviest brief showers  the indian climate which is marked by one season of excessive humidity and the other of excessive drought can never be favourable to the production either of good european or tropical fruits hence there is not one of the latter peculiar to the country and perhaps but one which arrives at full perfection namely the mango tile plantains oranges and pineapples are less abundant of inferior kinds and remain a shorter season in perfection than they do in south america the west indies or western africa  illustrationlepcha amulet     chapter vii  continue the ascent of tonglotreeslepcha construction of hut

simonbong the path up tonglo is little frequented it is one of the many routes between nepal and sikkim which cross the singalelah spur of kinchinjunga at various elevations between 7000 and 15000 feet as usual the track runs along ridges wherever these are to be found very steep and narrow at the top through deep humid forests of oaks and magnolias many laurels both tetranthera and cinnamomum one species of the latter ascending to 8500 feet and one of tetranthera to 9000 chesnut and walnut here appeared with some leguminous trees which however did not ascend to 6000 feet scarlet flowers of vaccinium serpens an epiphytical species were strewed about and the great blossoms of rhododendron dalhousiae and of a magnolia talaunaa hodgsoni lay together on the ground the latter forms a large tree with very dense foliage and deep shining green leaves a foot to eighteen inches long most of its flowers drop unexpanded from the tree and diffuse a very aromatic smell they are nearly as large as the fist the outer petals purple the inner pure white  heavy rain came on at 3 pm obliging us to take insufficient shelter under the trees and finally to seek the nearest campingground for this purpose we ascended to a spring called simsibong at an elevation of 6000 feet the narrowness of the ridge prevented our pitching the tent small as it was but the lepchas rapidly constructed a house and thatched it with bamboo and the broad leaves of the wild plantain a table was then raised in the middle of four posts and as many cross pieces of wood lashed with strips of bamboo across these pieces of bamboo were laid ingeniously flattened by selecting cylinders crimping them all round and then slitting each down one side so that it opens into a flat slab similar but longer and lower erections one on each side the table formed bed or chair and in one hour half a dozen men with only long knives and active hands had provided us with a tolerably watertight furnished house a thick flooring of bamboo leaves kept the feet dry and a screen of that and other foliage all round rendered the habitation tolerably warm  at this elevation we found great scandent trees twisting around the trunks of others and strangling them the latter gradually decay leaving the sheath of climbers as one of the most remarkable vegetable phenomena of these mountains these climbers belong to several orders and may be roughly classified in two groups 1 those whose sterns merely twine and by constricting certain parts of their support induce death2 those which form a network round the trunk by the coalescence of their lateral branches and aerial roots etc these wholly envelop and often conceal the tree they enclose whose branches appear rising far above those of  illustrationclasping roots of wightia  its destroyer to the first of these groups belong many natural orders of which the most prominent areleguminosae ivies hydrangea vines pothos etc the inosculating ones are almost all figs and wightia the latter is the most remarkable and i add a cut of its grasping roots sketched at our encampment  except for the occasional hooting of an owl the night was profoundly still during several hours after darkthe cicadas at this season not ascending so high on the mountain a dense mist shrouded every thing and the rain pattered on the leaves of our hut at midnight a treefrog simook lepcha broke the silence with his curious metallic clack and others quickly joined the chorus keeping up their strange music till morning like many batrachians this has a voice singularly unlike that of any other organised creature the cries of beasts birds and insects are all explicable to our senses and we can recognise most of them as belonging to such or such an order of animal but the voices of many frogs are like nothing else and allied species utter totally dissimilar noises in some as this the sound is like the concussion of metals in others of the vibration of wires or cords anything but the natural effects of lungs larynx and muscles a very common tasmanian species utters a sound that appears to ring in an underground vaulted chamber beneath the feet  may 21early this morning we proceeded upwards our prospect more gloomy than ever the path which still lay up steep ridges was very slippery owing to the rain upon the clayey soil and was only passable from the hold afforded by interlacing roots of trees at 8000 feet some enormous detached masses of micaceous gneiss rose abruptly from the ridge they were covered with mosses and ferns and from their summit 7000 feet a good view of the surrounding vegetation is obtained the mast of the forest is formed of 1 three species of oak of which q annulata  with immense lamellated acorns and leaves sixteen inches long is the tallest and the most abundant2 chesnut3 laurineae of several species all beautiful foresttrees straightholed and umbrageous above4 magnolias other trees were pyrus saurauja both an erect and climbing species olea cherry birch alder several maples hydrangea one species of fig holly and several araliaceous trees many species of magnoliaceae including the genera magnolia michelia and talauma are found in sikkim magnolia campbellii of 10000 feet is the most superb species known in books on botanical geography the magnolias are considered as most abounding in north america east of the rocky mountains but this is a great mistake the indian mountains and islands being the centre of this natural order5 arborescent rhododendrons which commence here with the r arboreum at 8000 and 9000 feet a considerable change is found in the vegetation the gigantic purple magnolia campbellii replacing the white chesnut disappears and several laurels other kinds of maple are seen with rhododendron argenteum and stauntonia a handsome climber which has beautiful pendent clusters of lilac blossoms  at 9000 feet we arrived on a long flat covered with lofty trees chiefly purple magnolias with a few oaks great pyri and two rhododendrons thirty to forty feet high r barbatum and r arboreum var roseum skimmia and symplocos were the common shrubs a beautiful orchid with purple flowers caelogyne wallichii grew on the trunks of all the great trees attaining a higher elevation than most other epiphytical species for i have seen it at 10000 feet  a large tick infests the small bamboo and a more hateful insect i never encountered the traveller cannot avoid these insects coming on his person sometimes in great numbers as he brushes through the forest they get inside his dress and insert the proboscis deeply without pain buried head and shoulders and retained by a barbed lancet the tick is only to be extracted by force which is very painful i have devised many tortures mechanical and chemical to induce these disgusting intruders to withdraw the proboscis but in vain leeches i cannot but think that the extraordinary abundance of these anelides in sikkim may cause the death of many animals some marked murrains have followed very wet seasons when the leeches appear in incredible numbers and the disease in the cattle described to me by the lepchas as in the stomach in no way differs from what leeches would produce it is a wellknown fact that these creatures have lived for days in the fauces nares and stomachs of the human subject causing dreadful sufferings and death i have seen the cattle feeding in places where the leeches so abounded that fifty or sixty were frequently together on my ankles and ponies are almost maddened by their biting the fetlocks also swarm below 7000 feet a small black species above 3000 feet and a large yellowbrown solitary one below that elevation  our ascent to the summit was by the bed of a watercourse now a roaring torrent from the heavy and incessant rain a small anagallis like tenella and a beautiful purple primrose grew by its bank the top of the mountain is another flat ridge with depressions and broad pools the number of additional species of plants found here was great and all betokened a rapid approach to the alpine region of the himalaya in order of prevalence the trees werethe scarlet rhododendron arboreum and barbatum as large bushy trees both loaded with beautiful flowers and luxuriant foliage r falconeri in point of foliage the most superb of all the himalayan species with trunks thirty feet high and branches bearing at their ends only leaves eighteen inches long these are deep green above and covered beneath with a rich brown down next in abundance to these were shrubs of skimmia laureola this plant has been lately introduced into english gardens from the northwest himalaya and is greatly admired for its aromatic evergreen foliage and clusters of scarlet berries it is a curious fact that this plant never bears scarlet berries in sikkim apparently owing to the want of sun the fruit ripens but is of a greenishred or purplish colour symplocos and hydrangea and there were still a few purple magnolias very large pyri like mountain ash and the common english yew eighteen feet in circumference the red bark of which is used as a dye and for staining the foreheads of brahmins in nepal an erect whiteflowered rose r sericea the only species occurring in southern sikkim was very abundant its numerous inodorous flowers are pendent apparent as a protection from the rain and it is remarkable as being the only species having four petals instead of five  a currant was common always growing epiphytically on the trunks of large trees two or three species of berberry a cherry andromeda daphne and maple nearly complete i think the list of woody plants amongst the herbs were many of great interest as a rhubarb and aconitum palmatum which yields one of the celebrated bikh poisons bikh is yielded by various aconita all the sikkim kinds are called gniong by lepchas and bhoteeas who do not distinguish them the a napellus is abundant in the northwest himalaya and is perhaps as virulent a bikh as any species of european genera i found thalictrum anemone fumaria violets stellaria hypericum two geraniums balsams epilobium potentilla paris and convallariae one of the latter has verticillate leaves and its root also called bikh is considered a very virulent poison  still the absence or rarity at this elevation of several very large natural families ranunculaceae fumariae cruciferae alsineae geranicae leguminosae potentilla epilobium crassulaceae saxifrageae umbelliferae lonicera valerianeae dipsaceae various genera of compositae campanulaceae lobeliaceae gentianeae boragineae scrophularineae primulaceae gramineae which have numerous representatives at and much below the same level in the inner ranges and on the outer of the western himalaya indicate a certain peculiarity in sikkim on the other hand certain tropical genera are more abundant in the temperate zone of the sikkim mountains and ascend much higher there than in the western himalaya of this fact i have cited conspicuous examples in the palms plantains and treeferns this ascent and prevalence of tropical species is due to the humidity and equability of the climate in this temperate zone and is perhaps the direct consequence of these conditions an application of the same laws accounts for the extension of similar features far beyond the tropical limit in the southern ocean where various natural orders which do not cross the 30th and 40th parallels of n latitude are extended to the 55th of s latitude and found in tasmania new zealand the socalled antarctic islands south of that group and at cape horn itself  the rarity of pines is perhaps the most curious feature in the botany of tonglo and on the outer ranges of sikkim for between the level of 2500 feet the upper limit of p longifolia and 10000 feet that of the taxus there is no coniferous tree whatever in southern sikkim  we encamped amongst rhododendrons on a spongy soil of black vegetable matter so oozy that it was difficult to keep the feet dry the rain poured in torrents all the evening and with the calm and the wetness of the wood prevented our enjoying a fire except a transient view into nepal a few miles west of us nothing was to be seen the whole mountain being wrapped in dense masses of vapour gusts of wind not felt in the forest whistled through the gnarled and naked treetops and though the temperature was 50 degrees this wind produced cold to the feelings our poor lepchas were miserably off but always happy under four posts and a bambooleaf thatch with no covering but a single thin cotton garment they crouched on the sodden turf joking with the hindoos of our party who though supplied with good clothing and shelter were doleful companions  i made a shed for my instruments under a tree mr barnes ever active and ready floored the tent with logs of wood and i laid a corduroy road of the same to my little observatory  during the night the rain did not abate and the tentroof leaked in such torrents that we had to throw pieces of waxcloth over our shoulders as we lay in bed there was no improvement whatever in the weather on the following morning two of the hindoos had crawled into the tent during the night attacked with fever and ague it is a remarkable fact that both the natives of the plains under many circumstances and the lepchas when suffering from protracted cold and wet take fever and ague in sharp attacks the disease is wholly unknown amongst europeans residing above 4000 feet similar exposure in whom brings on rheumatism and cold the tent being too sodden to be carried we had to remain where we were and with abundance of novelty in the botany around i found no difficulty in getting through the day observing the track of sheep we sent two lepchas to follow them who returned at night from some miles west in nepal bringing two the shepherds were geroongs of nepal who were grazing their flocks on a grassy mountain top from which the woods had been cleared probably by fire the mutton was a great boon to the lepchas but the hindoos would not touch it and several more sickening during the day we had the tent most uncomfortably full  during the whole of the 22nd from 7 am to 11 pm the thermometer never varied 65 degrees ranging from 475 in the morning to 54 degrees its maximum at 1 pm and 5075 at night at seven the following morning it was the same one sunk two feet six inches in mould and clay stood constantly at 5075 the dewpoint was always below the temperature at which i was surprised for more drenching weather could not well be the mean dewpoint was 5025 and consequent humidity 0973  these observations and those of the barometer were taken 60 feet below the summit to which i moved the instruments on the morning of the 23rd at a much more exposed spot the results would no doubt have been different for a thermometer there sunk to the same depth as that below stood at 4975 or one degree colder than 60 feet lower down my barometrical observations taken simultaneously with those of calcutta give the height of tonglo 100783 feet colonel waughs by trigonometry 100794 feeta remarkable and unusual coincidence  may 23we spent a few hours of alternate fog and sunshine on the top of the mountain vainly hoping for the most modest view our inability to obtain it was extremely disappointing for the mountain commands a superb prospect which i enjoyed fully in the following november from a spot a few miles further west the air which was always foggy was alternately cooled and heated as it blew over the trees or the open space we occupied sometimes varying 5 degrees and 6 degrees in a quarter of an hour  having partially dried the tent in the wind we commenced the descent which owing to the late torrents of rain was most fatiguing and slippery it again commenced to drizzle at noon nor was it till we had descended to 6000 feet that we emerged from the region of clouds by dark we arrived at simonbong having descended 5000 feet at the rate of 1000 feet an hour and were kindly received by the lama who gave us his temple for the accommodation of the whole party we were surprised at this both because the sikkim authorities had represented the lamas as very averse to europeans and because he might well have hesitated before admitting a promiscuous horde of thirty people into a sacred building where the little valuables on the altar etc were quite at our disposal a better tribute could not well have been paid to the honesty of my lepcha followers our host only begged us not to disturb his people nor to allow the hindoos of our party to smoke inside  illustrationsimonbong temple  simonbong is one of the smallest and poorest gumpas or temples in sikkim unlike the better class it is built of wood only it consisted of one large room with small sliding shutter windows raised on a stone foundation and roofed with shingles of wood opposite the door a wooden altar was placed rudely chequered with black white and red to the right and left were shelves with a few tibetan books wrapped in silk a model of symbonath temple in nepal a prayingcylinder it consisted of a leathern cylinder placed upright in a frame a projecting piece of iron strikes a little bell at each revolution the revolution being caused by an elbowed axle and string within the cylinder are deposited written prayers and whoever pulls the string properly is considered to have repeated his prayers as often as the bell rings representations of these implements will be found in other parts of these volumes and some implements for common purposes bags of juniper english winebottles and glasses with tufts of abies webbiana rhododendron flowers and peacocks feathers besides various trifles clay ornaments and offerings and little hindoo idols on the altar were ranged seven little brass cups full of water a large conch shell carved with the sacred lotus a brass jug from lhassa of beautiful design and a human thighbone hollow and perforated through both condyles to these are often added a doubleheaded rattle or small drum formed of two crowns of human skulls cemented back to back each face is then covered with parchment and encloses some pebbles sometimes this instrument is provided with a handle  illustrationtrumpet made of a human thighbone   facing the altar was a bench and a chair and on one side a huge tambourine with two curved iron drumsticks the bench was covered with bells handsomely carved with idols and censers with juniperashes and on it lay the dorge or doubleheaded thunderbolt which the lama holds in his hand during service of all these articles the human thighbone is by much the most curious it is very often that of a lama and is valuable in proportion to its length it is reported at dorjiling that one of the first europeans buried at this station being a tall man was disinterred by the resurrectionist bhoteeas for his trumpetbones as however the sikkim lamas are burned the relics are generally procured from tibet where the  corpses are cut in pieces and thrown to the kites or into the water  two boys usually reside in the temple and their beds were given up to us which being only rough planks laid on the floor proved clean in one sense but contrasted badly with the springy couch of bamboo the lepcha makes which renders carrying a mattress or aught but blankets superfluous  may 24we were awakened at daylight by the discordant orisons of the lama these commenced by the boys beating the great tambourine then blowing the conchshells and finally the trumpets and thighbone shortly the lama entered clad in scarlet shorn and barefooted wearing a small red silk mitre a loose gown girt round the middle and an undergarment of questionable colour possibly once purple he walked along slowly muttering his prayers to the end of the apartment whence he took a brass bell and dorge and sitting down crosslegged commenced matins counting his beads or ringing the bell and uttering most dismal prayers after various disposals of the cups a larger bell was violently rung for some minutes himself snapping his fingers and uttering most unearthly sounds finally incense was brought of charcoal with junipersprigs it was swung about and concluded the morning service to our great relief for the noises were quite intolerable fervid as the devotions appeared to judge by their intonation i fear the lama felt more curious about us than was proper under the circumstances and when i tried to sketch him his excitement knew no bounds he fairly turned round on the settee and continuing his prayers and bellaccompaniment appeared to be exorcising me or some spirit within me  after breakfast the lama came to visit us bringing rice a few vegetables and a large bamboowork bowl thickly varnished with indiarubber and waterproof containing halffermented millet this mixture called murwa is invariably offered to the traveller either in the state of fermented grain or more commonly in a bamboo jug filled quite up with warm water when the fluid sucked through a reed affords a refreshing drink he gratefully accepted a few rupees and trifles which we had to spare  leaving simonbong we descended to the little rungeet where the heat of the valley was very great 80 degrees at noon and that of the stream 69 degrees the latter was an agreeable temperature for the coolies who plunged teeming with perspiration into the water catching fish with their hands we reached dorjiling late in the evening again drenched with rain our people hindoo and lepcha imprudently remaining for the night in the valley owing probably as much to the great exposure they had lately gone through as to the sudden transition from a mean temperature of 50 degrees in a bracing wind to a hot close jungly valley at 75 degrees no less than seven were laid up with fever and ague  few excursions can afford a better idea of the general features and rich luxuriance of the sikkim himalaya than that to tonglo it is always interesting to roam with an aboriginal and especially a mountain people through their thinly inhabited valleys over their grand mountains and to dwell alone with them in their gloomy and forbidding forests and no thinking man can do so without learning much however slender be the means at his command for communion a more interesting and attractive companion than the lepcha i never lived with cheerful kind and patient with a master to whom he is attached rude but not savage ignorant and yet intelligent with the simple resource of a plain knife he makes his house and furnishes yours with a speed alacrity and ingenuity that wile away that wellknown long hour when the weary pilgrim frets for his couch in all my dealings with these people they proved scrupulously honest except for drunkenness and carelessness i never had to complain of any of the merry troop some of whom bareheaded and barelegged possessing little or nothing save a cotton garment and a long knife followed me for many months on subsequent occasions from the scorching plains to the everlasting snows ever foremost in the forest or on the bleak mountain and ever ready to help to carry to encamp collect or cook they cheer on the traveller by their unostentatious zeal in his service and are spurs to his progress  illustrationtibetan

authorities to which i have elsewhere alluded my endeavours to procure leave to penetrate further beyond the dorjiling territory than tonglo were attended with some trouble and delay  in the autumn of 1848 the governorgeneral communicated with the rajah desiring him to grant me honourable and safe escort through his dominions but this was at once met by a decided refusal apparently admitting of no compromise pending further negotiations which dr campbell felt sure would terminate satisfactorily though perhaps too late for my purpose he applied to the nepal rajah for permission for me to visit the tibetan passes west of kinchinjunga proposing in the meanwhile to arrange for my return through sikkim through the kindness of col thoresby the resident at that court and the influence of jung bahadoor this request was promptly acceded to and a guard of six nepalese soldiers and two officers was sent to dorjiling to conduct me to any part of the eastern districts of nepal which i might select i decided upon following up the tambur a branch of the arun river and exploring the two easternmost of the nepalese passes into tibet wallanchoon and kanglachem which would bring me as near to the central mass and loftiest part of the eastern flank of kinchinjunga as possible  for this expedition which occupied three months all the arrangements were undertaken for me by dr campbell who afforded me every facility which in his government position he could command besides personally superintending the equipment and provisioning of my party taking horses or loaded animals of any kind was not expedient the whole journey was to be performed on foot and everything carried on mens backs as we were to march through wholly unexplored countries where food was only procurable at uncertain intervals it was necessary to engage a large body of porters some of whom should carry bags of rice for the coolies and themselves too the difficulty of selecting these carriers of whom thirty were required was very great the lepchas the best and most tractable and over whom dr campbell had the most direct influence disliked employment out of sikkim especially in so warlike a country as nepal and they were besides thought unfit for the snowy regions the nepalese of whom there were many residing as british subjects in dorjiling were mostly runaways from their own country and afraid of being claimed should they return to it by the lords of the soil to employ limboos moormis hindoos or other natives of low elevations was out of the question and no course appeared advisable but to engage some of the bhotan runaways domiciled in dorjiling who are accustomed to travel at all elevations and fear nothing but a return to the country which they have abandoned as slaves or as culprits they are immensely powerful and though intractable to the last degree are generally glad to work and behave well for money the choice as will hereafter be seen was unfortunate though at the time unanimously approved  my party mustered fiftysix persons these consisted of myself and one personal servant a portuguese halfcaste who undertook all offices and spared me the usual train of hindoo and mahometan servants my tent and equipments for which i was greatly indebted to mr hodgson instruments bed box of clothes books and papers required a man for each seven more carried my papers for drying plants and other scientific stores the nepalese guard had two coolies of their own my interpreter the coolie sirdar or headman and my chief plant collector a lepcha had a man each mr hodgsons bird and animal shooter collector and stuffer with their ammunition and indispensables had four more there were besides three lepcha lads to climb trees and change the plantpapers who had long been in my service in that capacity and the party was completed by fourteen bhotan coolies laden with food consisting chiefly of rice with ghee oil capsicums salt and flour  i carried myself a small barometer a large knife and digger for plants notebook telescope compass and other instruments whilst two or three lepcha lads who accompanied me as satellites carried a botanising box thermometers sextant and artificial horizon measuringtape azimuth compass and stand geological hammer bottles and boxes for insects sketchbook etc arranged in compartments of strong canvass bags the nepal officer of the rank of serjeant i believe always kept near me with one of his men rendering innumerable little services other sepoys were distributed amongst the remainder of the party one went ahead to prepare campingground and one brought up the rear  the course generally pursued by himalayan travellers is to march early in the morning and arrive at the campingground before or by noon breakfasting before starting or en route i never followed this plan because it sacrificed the mornings which were otherwise profitably spent in collecting about camp whereas if i set off early i was generally too tired with the days march to employ in any active pursuit the rest of the daylight which in november only lasted till 6 pm the men breakfasted early in the morning i somewhat later and all had started by 10 am arriving between 4 and 6 pm at the next campingground my tent was formed of blankets spread over cross pieces of wood and a ridgepole enclosing an area of 6 to 8 feet by 4 to 6 feet the bedstead table and chair were always made by my lepchas as described in the tonglo excursion the evenings i employed in writing up notes and journals plotting maps and ticketing the plants collected during the days march  i left dorjiling at noon on the 27th october accompanied by dr campbell who saw me fairly off the coolies having preceded me our direct route would have been over tonglo but the threats of the sikkim authorities rendered it advisable to make for nepal at once we therefore kept west along the goong ridge a western prolongation of sinchul  on overtaking the coolies i proceeded for six or seven miles along a zigzag road at about 7500 feet elevation through dense forests and halted at a little hut within sight of dorjiling rain and mist came on at nightfall and though several parties of my servants arrived none of the bhotan coolies made their appearance and i spent the night without food or bed the weather being much too foggy and dark to send back to meet the missing men they joined me late on the following day complaining unreasonably of their loads and without their sirdar who after starting his crew had returned to take leave of his wife and family on the following day he appeared and after due admonishment we started but four miles further on were again obliged to halt for the bhotan coolies who were equally deaf to threats and entreaties as they did not come up till dusk we were obliged to encamp here alt 7400 feet at the common source of the balasun which flows to the plains and the little rungeet whose course is north  the contrast between the conduct of the bhotan men and that of the lepchas and nepalese was so marked that i seriously debated in my own mind the propriety of sending the former back to dorjiling but yielded to the remonstrances of their sirdar and the nepal guard who represented the great difficulty we should have in replacing them and above all the loss of time at this season a matter of great importance we accordingly started again the following morning and still keeping in a western direction crossed the posts in the forest dividing sikkim from nepal and descended into the myong valley of the latter country through which flows the river of that name a tributary of the tambur the myong valley is remarkably fine it runs southwest from tonglo and its open character and general fertility contrast strongly with the bareness of the lower mountain spurs which flank it and with the dense gloomy steep and forestclad gorges of sikkim at its lower end about twenty miles from the frontier is the military fort of ilam a celebrated stockaded post and cantonment of the ghorkas its position is marked by a conspicuous conical hill the inhabitants are chiefly brahmins but there are also some moormis and a few lepchas who escaped from sikkim during the general massacre in 1825 among these is a man who had formerly much influence in sikkim he still retains his title of kazee this mahometan title by which the officers of state are known in sikkim is there generally pronounced kajee and has had large lands assigned to him by the nepalese government he sent the usual present of a kid fowls and eggs and begged me to express to dr campbell his desire to return to his native country and settle at dorjiling  the scenery of this valley is the most beautiful i know of in the lower himalaya and the cheer pine p longifolia is abundant cresting the hills which are loosely clothed with clumps of oaks and other trees bamboos and bracken pteris the slopes are covered with red clay and separate little ravines luxuriantly clothed with tropical vegetation amongst which flow pebbly streams of transparent cool water the villages which are merely scattered collections of huts are surrounded with fields of rice buckwheat and indian corn which latter the natives were now storing in little granaries mounted on four posts men women and children being all equally busy the quantity of gigantic nettles urtica heterophylla on the skirts of these maize fields is quite wonderful their long white stings look most formidable but though they sting virulently the pain only lasts half an hour or so these however with leeches mosquitos peepsas and ticks sometimes keep the traveller in a constant state of irritation  however civilised the hindoo may be in comparison with the lepcha he presents a far less attractive picture to the casual observer he comes to your campingground sits down and stares with all his might but offers no assistance if he bring a present at all he expects a return on the spot and goes on begging till satisfied i was amused by the cool way in which my ghorka guard treated the village lads when they wanted help in my service taking them by the shoulder pulling out their knives for them placing them in their bands and setting them to cut down a tree or to chop firewood which they seldom refused to do when a little such douce violence was applied  my object being to reach the tambur north of the great east and west mountain ridge of sakkiazung without crossing the innumerable feeders of the myong and their dividing spurs we ascended the north flank of the valley to a long spur from tonglo intending to follow winding ridges of that mountain to the sources of the pemmi at the phulloot mountains and thence descend  on the 3rd november i encamped on the flank of tonglo called nanki in nepal at 9300 feet about 700 feet below the western summit which is rocky and connected by a long flat ridge with that which i had visited in the previous may the bhotan coolies behaved worse than ever their conduct being in all respects typical of the turbulent mulish race to which they belong they had been plundering my provisions as they went along and neither their sirdar nor the ghorka soldiers had the smallest authority over them i had hired some ghorka coolies to assist and eventually to replace them and had made up my mind to send back the worst from the more populous banks of the tambur when i was relieved by their making off of their own accord the dilemma was however awkward as it was impossible to procure men on the top of a mountain 10000 feet high or to proceed towards phulloot no course remained but to send to dorjiling for others or to return to the myong valley and take a more circuitous route over the west end of sakkiazung which led through villages from which i could procure coolies day by day i preferred the latter plan and sent one of the soldiers to the nearest village for assistance to bring the loads down halting a day for that purpose  from the summit of tonglo i enjoyed the view i had so long desired of the snowy himalaya from northeast to northwest sikkim being on the right nepal on the left and the plains of india to the southward and i procured a set of compass bearings of the greatest use in mapping the country in the early morning the transparency of the atmosphere renders this view one of astonishing grandeur kinchinjunga bore nearly due north a dazzling mass of snowy peaks intersected by blue glaciers which gleamed in the slanting rays of the rising sun like aquamarines set in frosted silver from this the sweep of snowed mountains to the eastward was almost continuous as far as chola bearing eastnortheast following a curve of 150 miles and enclosing the whole of the northern part of sikkim which appeared a billowy mass of forestclad mountains on the northeast horizon rose the donkia mountain 23176 feet and chumulari 23929 though both were much more distant than the snowy ranges being respectively eighty and ninety miles off they raised their gigantic heads above seeming what they really were by far the loftiest peaks next to kinchinjunga and the perspective of snow is so deceptive that though 40 to 60 miles beyond they appeared as though almost in the same line with the ridges they overtopped of these mountains chumulari presents many attractions to the geographer from its long disputed position its sacred character and the interest attached to it since turners mission to tibet in 1783 it was seen and recognised by dr campbell and measured by colonel waugh from sinchul and also from tonglo and was a conspicuous object in my subsequent journey to tibet beyond junnoo one of the western peaks of kinchinjunga there was no continuous snowy chain the himalaya seemed suddenly to decline into black and rugged peaks till in the far northwest it rose again in a white mountain mass of stupendous elevation at 80 miles distance called by my nepal people tsungau this is probably the easternmost and loftiest peak seen from katmandoo distant 78 miles and estimated elevation 20117 feet by col crawfords observations see hamiltons nepal p 346 and plate 1 from the bearings i took of it from several positions it is in about lat 27 degrees 49 minutes and long 86 degrees 24 minutes and is probably on the west flank of the arun valley and river which latter in its course from tibet to the plains of india receives the waters from the west flank of kinchinjunga and from the east flank of the mountain in question it is perhaps one which has been seen and measured from the tirhoot district by some of colonel waughs party and which has been reported to be upwards of 28000 feet in elevation and it is the only mountain of the first class in magnitude between gosainthan northeast of katmandoo and kinchinjunga  to the west the black ridge of sakkiazung bristling with pines abies webbiana cut off the view of nepal but southwest the myong valley could be traced to its junction with the tambur about thirty miles off beyond which to the southwest and south low hills belonging to the outer ranges of nepal rose on the distant horizon seventy or eighty miles off and of these the most conspicuous were the mahavarati which skirt the nepal terai south and southeast sinchul and the goong range of sikkim intercepted the view of the plains of india of which i had a distant peep to the southwest only  the west top of tonglo is very open and grassy with occasional masses of gneiss of enormous size but probably not in situ the whole of this flank and for 1000 feet down the spur to the southwest had been cleared by fire for pasturage and flocks of blackfaced sheep were grazing during my stay on the mountain except in the early morning the weather was bleak gloomy and very cold with a high southwest wind the mean temperature was 41 degrees extremes 53226 degrees the nights were very clear with sharp hoarfrost the radiating thermometer sank to 21 degrees the temperature at 35 feet depth was 515 degrees  a few of the bhotan coolies having voluntarily returned i left tonglo on the 5th and descended its west flank to the mai a feeder of the myong the descent was as abrupt as that on the east face but through less dense forest the sikkim side that facing the east being much the dampest i encamped at dark by a small village jummanoo at 4360 feet having descended 5000 feet in five hours hence we marched eastward to the village of sakkiazung which we reached on the third day crossing en route several spurs 4000 to 6000 feet high from the same ridge and as many rivers which all fall into the myong and whose beds are elevated from 2500 to 3000 feet  though rich and fertile the country is scantily populated and coolies were procured with difficulty i therefore sent back to dorjiling all but absolute indispensables and on the 9th of november started up the ridge in a northerly direction taking the road from ilam to wallanchoon the ascent was gradual through a fine forest full of hornbills buceros a bird resembling the toucan dhunass lepcha at 7000 feet an oak quercus semecarpifolia khasrou of the nepalese commences a tree which is common as far west as kashmir but which i never found in sikkim though it appears again in bhotan this oak ascends in the nw himalaya to the highest limit of forest 12000 feet no oak in sikkim attains a greater elevation than 10000 it forms a broadheaded tree and has a very handsome appearance its favourite locality is on grassy open shoulders of the mountains it was accompanied by an astragalus geranium and several other plants of the drier interior parts of sikkim water is very scarce along the ridge we walked fully eight miles without finding any and were at length obliged to encamp at 8350 feet by the only spring that we should be able to reach with respect to drought this ridge differs materially from sikkim where water abounds at all elevations and the cause is obviously its position to the westward of the great ridge of singalelah including tonglo by which the sw currents are drained of their moisture here again the east flank was much the dampest and most luxuriantly wooded  while my men encamped on a very narrow ridge i ascended a rocky summit composed of great blocks of gneiss from which i obtained a superb view to the westward immediately below a fearfully sudden descent ran the daomy river bounded on the opposite side by another parallel ridge of sakkiazung enclosing with that on which i stood a gulf from 6000 to 7000 feet deep of wooded ridges which as it were radiated outwards as they ascended upwards in rocky spurs to the pineclad peaks around to the southwest in the extreme distance were the boundless plains of india upwards of 100 miles off with the cosi meandering through them like a silver thread  the firmament appeared of a pale steel blue and a broad low arch spanned the horizon bounded by a line of little fleecy clouds moutons below this the sky was of a golden yellow while in successively deeper strata many belts or ribbons of vapour appeared to press upon the plains the lowest of which was of a dark leaden hue the upper more purple and vanishing into the pale yellow above though well defined there was no abrupt division between the belts and the lowest mingled imperceptibly with the hazy horizon gradually the golden lines grew dim and the blues and purples gained depth of colour till the sun set behind the darkblue peaked mountains in a flood of crimson and purple sending broad beams of grey shade and purple light up to the zenith and all around as evening advanced a sudden chill succeeded and mists rapidly formed immediately below me in little isolated clouds which coalesced and spread out like a heaving and rolling sea leaving nothing above their surface but the ridges and spurs of the adjacent mountains these rose like capes promontories and islands of the darkest leaden hue bristling with pines and advancing boldly into the snowy white ocean or starting from its bed in the strongest relief as darkness came on and the stars arose a light fog gathered round me and i quitted with reluctance one of the most impressive and magic scenes i ever beheld  returning to my tent i was interested in observing how well my followers had accommodated themselves to their narrow circumstances their fires gleamed everywhere amongst the trees and the people broken up into groups of five presented an interesting picture of native savage and halfcivilised life i wandered amongst them in the darkness and watched unseen their operations some were cooking with their rude bronzed faces lighted up by the ruddy glow as they peered into the pot stirring the boiling rice with one hand while with the other they held back their long tangled hair others were bringing water from the spring below some gathering sprigs of fragrant artemisia and other shrubs to form couchessome lopping branches of larger trees to screen them from nocturnal radiation their only protection from the dew being such branches stuck in the ground and slanting over their procumbent forms the bhotanese were rude and boisterous in their pursuits constantly complaining to the sirdars and wrangling over their meals the ghorkas were sprightly combing their raven hair telling interminably long stories of which money was the burthen or singing hindoo songs through their noses in chorus and being neater and better dressed and having a servant to cook their food they seemed quite the gentlemen of the party still the lepcha was the most attractive the least restrained and the most natural in all his actions the simplest in his wants and appliances with a bamboo as his waterjug an earthenpot as his kettle and all manner of herbs collected during the days march to flavour his food  my tent was made of a blanket thrown over the limb of a tree to this others were attached and the whole was supported on a frame like a house one half was occupied by my bedstead beneath which was stowed my box of clothes while my books and writing materials were placed under the table the barometer hung in the most outoftheway corner and my other instruments all around a small candle was burning in a glass shade to keep the draught and insects from the light and i had the comfort of seeing the knife fork and spoon laid on a white napkin as i entered my snug little house and flung myself on the elastic couch to ruminate on the proceedings of the day and speculate on those of the morrow while waiting for my meal which usually consisted of stewed meat and rice with biscuits and tea my thermometers wet and dry bulb and minimum hung under a temporary canopy made of thickly plaited bamboo and leaves close to the tent and the cooking was performed by my servant under a tree  after dinner my occupations were to ticket and put away the plants collected during the day write up journals plot maps and take observations till 10 pm as soon as i was in bed one of the nepal soldiers was accustomed to enter spread his blanket on the ground and sleep there as my guard in the morning the collectors were set to change the plantpapers while i explored the neighbourhood and having taken observations and breakfasted we were ready to start at 10 am  following the same ridge after a few miles of ascent over much broken gneiss rock the ghorkas led me aside to the top of a knoll 9300 feet high covered with stunted bushes and commanding a splendid view to the west of the broad low well cultivated valley of the tambur and the extensive town of dunkotah on its banks about twentyfive miles off the capital of this part of nepal and famous for its manufactory of paper from the bark of the daphne hence too i gained a fine view of the plains of india including the course of the cosi river which receiving the arun and tambur debouches into the ganges opposite colgongl see chapter iv  a little further on we crossed the main ridge of sakkiazung a long flexuous chain stretching for miles to the westward from phulloot on singalelah and forming the most elevated and conspicuous transverse range in this part of nepal its streams flow south to the myong and north to feeders of the tambur silver firs abies webbiana are found on all the summits but to my regret none occurred in our path which led just below their limit 10000 feet on the southern himalayan ranges there were however a few yews exactly like the english the view that opened on cresting this range was again magnificent of kinchinjunga the western snows of nepal and the valley of the tambur winding amongst wooded and cultivated hills to a long line of blackpeaked rugged mountains sparingly snowed which intervene between kinchinjunga and the great nepal mountain before mentioned the extremely varied colouring on the infinite number of hillslopes that everywhere intersected the tambur valley was very pleasing for fully forty miles to the northward there were no lofty forestclad mountains nor any apparently above 4000 to 5000 feet villages and hamlets appeared everywhere with crops of golden mustard and purple buckwheat in full flower yellow rice and maize green hemp pulse radishes and barley and brown millet here and there deep groves of oranges the broadleafed banana and sugarcane skirted the bottoms of the valleys through which the streams were occasionally seen rushing in white foam over their rocky beds it was a goodly sight to one who had for his only standard of comparison the view from sinchul of the gloomy forestclad ranges of 6000 to 10000 feet that intervene between that mountain and the snowy girdle of sikkim though i question whether a traveller from more favoured climes would see more in this than a thinly inhabited country with irregular patches of poor cultivation a vast amount of ragged forest on low hills of rather uniform height and contour relieved by a dismal background of frowning black mountains sprinkled with snow kinchinjunga was again the most prominent object to the northeast with its sister peaks of kubra 24005 feet and junnoo 25312 feet all these presented bare cliffs for several thousand feet below their summits composed of white rock with a faint pink tinton the other hand the lofty nepal mountain in the far west presented cliffs of black rocks from the summit two routes to the tambur presented themselves one the main road led west and south along the ridge and then turned north descending to the river the other was shorter leading abruptly down to the pemmi river and thence along its banks west to the tambur i chose the latter  the descent was very abrupt on the first day from 9500 feet to 5000 feet and on that following to the bed of the pemmi at 2000 feet and the road was infamously bad generally consisting of a narrow winding rocky path among tangled shrubs and large boulders brambles nettles and thorny bushes often in the bed of the torrent or crossing spurs covered with forest round whose bases it flowed a little cultivation was occasionally met with on the narrow flat pebbly terraces which fringed the stream usually of rice and sometimes of the smallleaved variety of hemp cannabis grown as a narcotic  the rocks above 5000 feet were gneiss below this cliffs of very micaceous schist were met with having a northwest strike and being often vertical the boulders again were always of gneiss the streams seemed rather to occupy faults than to have eroded courses for themselves their beds were invariably rocky or pebbly and the waters white and muddy from the quantity of alumina in one little rocky dell the water gushed through a hole in a soft stratum in the gneiss a trifling circumstance which was not lost upon the crafty brahmins who had cut a series of regular holes for the water ornamented the rocks with red paint and a row of little iron tridents of siva and dedicated the whole to mahadeo  in some spots the vegetation was exceedingly fine and several large trees occurred i measured a toon cedrela thirty feet in girth at five feet above the ground the skirts of the forest were adorned with numerous jungle flowers rice crops blue acanthaceae and pavetta wild cherrytrees covered with scarlet blossoms and trees of the purple and lilac bauhinia while thunbergia convolvulus and other climbers hung in graceful festoons from the boughs and on the dry micaceous rocks the luculia gratissima one of our common hothouse ornaments grew in profusion its gorgeous heads of blossoms scenting the air  at the junction of the pemmi and khawa rivers there are high rocks of micaslate and broad riverterraces of stratified sand and pebbles apparently alternating with deposits of shingle on this hot open expanse elevated 2250 feet appeared many trees and plants of the terai and plains as pomegranate peepul and sal with extensive fields of cotton indigo and irrigated rice  we followed the north bank of the khawa which runs westerly through a gorge between high cliffs of chlorite containing thick beds of stratified quartz at the angles of the river broad terraces are formed fifteen to thirty feet above its bed similar to those just mentioned and planted with rows of acacia serissa or laid out in rice fields or sugar plantations  i reached the east bank of the tambur on the 13th of november at its junction with the khawa in a deep gorge it formed a grand stream larger than the teesta of a pale seagreen muddy colour and flowed rapidly with a strong ripple but no foam it rises six feet in the rains but ice never descends nearly so low its breadth was sixty to eighty yards its temperature 55 degrees to 58 degrees the breadth of the foaming khawa was twelve to fifteen yards and its temperature 565 degrees the surrounding vegetation was entirely tropical consisting of scrubby sal trees acacia grislea emblica hibiscus etc the elevation being but 1300 feet though the spot was twentyfive miles in a straight line from the plains i camped at the fork of the rivers on a fine terrace fifty feet above the water about seventy yards long and one hundred broad quite flattopped and composed of shingle gravel etc with enormous boulders of gneiss quartz and hornstone much waterworn it was girt by another broken terrace twelve feet or so above the water and covered with long grass and bushes  the main road from ilam to wallanchoon which i quitted on sakkiazung descends steeply on the opposite bank of the river which i crossed in a canoe formed of a hollow trunk of toon thirty feet long there is considerable traffic along this road and i was visited by numbers of natives all hindoos who coolly squatted before my tentdoor and stared with their large black vacant lustrous eyes they appear singularly indolent and great beggars  the land seems highly favoured by nature and the population though so scattered is in reality considerable the varied elevation giving a large surface but the natives care for no more than will satisfy their immediate wants the river swarms with fish but they are too lazy to catch them and they have seldom anything better to give or sell than sticks of sugarcane which when peeled form a refreshing morsel in these scorching marches they have few and poor oranges citrons and lemons very bad plantains and but little elseeggs fowls and milk are all scarce horned cattle are of course never killed by hindoos and it was but seldom that i could replenish my larder with a kid potatos are unknown but my sepoys often brought me large coarse radishes and legumes  from the junction of the rivers the road led up the tambur to mywa guola about sixteen miles by the river but fully thirtyfive as we wound ascended and descended during three days marches we were ferried across the stream in a canoe much ruder than that of the new zealander i watched my party crossing by boatloads of fifteen each the bhotan men hung little scraps of rags on the bushes before embarking the votive offerings of a booddhist throughout central asiathe lepcha less civilised scooped up a little water in the palm of his hand and scattered it about invoking the river god of his simple creed  we always encamped upon gravelly terraces a few feet above the river which flows in a deep gorge its banks are very steep for 600 feet above the stream though the mountains which flank it do not exceed 4000 to 5000 feet this is a constant phenomenon in the himalaya and the roads when low and within a few hundred feet of the river are in consequence excessively steep and difficult it would have been impossible to have taken ponies along that we followed which was often not a foot broad running along very steep cliffs at a dizzy height above the river and engineered with much trouble and ingenuity often the bank was abandoned altogether and we ascended several thousand feet to descend again owing to the steepness of these banks and the reflected heat the valley even at this season was excessively hot and close during the day even when the temperature was below 70 degrees and tempered by a brisk breeze which rushes upwards from sunrise to sunset the sun at this season does not in many places reach the bottom of these valleys until 10 am and is off again by 3 pm and the radiation to a clear sky is so powerful that dew frequently forms in the shade throughout the day and it is common at 10 am to find the thermometer sink from 70 degrees in a sheltered spot dried by the sun to 40 degrees in the shade close by where the sun has not yet penetrated snow never falls  the rocks throughout this part of the rivercourse are micaschists strike northwest dip southwest 70 degrees but very variable in inclination and direction they are dry and grassy and the vegetation wholly tropical as is the entomology which consists chiefly of large butterflies mantis and diptera snowy mountains are rarely seen and the beauty of the scenery is confined to the wooded banks of the main stream which flows at an average inclination of fifty feet to the mile otters are found in the stream and my party shot two but could not procure them  illustrationtambur river  valley east nepal from chintam elevation 5000 ft looking north  in one place the road ascended for 2000 feet above the river to the village of chingtam situated on a lofty spur of the west bank whence i obtained a grand view of the upper course of the river flowing in a tremendous chasm flanked by wellcultivated hills and emerging fifteen miles to the northward from black mountains of savage grandeur whose rugged precipitous faces were streaked with snow and the tops of the lower ones crowned with the tabularbranched silverfir contrasting strongly with the tropical luxuriance around chingtam is an extensive village covering an area of two miles and surrounded with abundant cultivation the houses which are built in clusters are of wood or wattle and mud with grass thatch the villagers though an indolent staring race are quiet and respectable the men are handsome the women though less so often goodlooking they have fine cattle and excellent crops  immediately above chingtam the tambur is joined by a large affluent from the west the mywa which is crossed by an excellent iron bridge formed of loops hanging from two parallel chains along which is laid a plank of sal timber passing through the village we camped on a broad terrace from sixty to seventy feet above the junction of the rivers whose beds are 2100 feet above the sea  mywa guola or bazaar is a large village and mart frequented by nepalese and tibetans who bring salt wool gold musk and blankets to exchange for rice coral and other commodities and a customhouse officer is stationed there with a few soldiers the houses are of wood and well built the public ones are large with verandahs and galleries of carved wood the workmanship is of chinese character and inferior to that of katmandoo but in the same style and quite unlike anything i had previously seen  the riverterrace is in all respects similar to that at the junction of the tambur and khawa but very extensive the stones it contained were of all sizes from a nut to huge boulders upwards of fifteen feet long of which many strewed the surface while others were in the bed of the river all were of gneiss quartz and granite and had doubtless been transported from great elevations as the rocks in situboth here and for several thousand feet higher up the riverwere micaceous schists dipping in various directions and at all angles with however a general strike to the northwest  i was here overtaken by a messenger with letters from dr campbell announcing that the sikkim rajah had disavowed the refusal to the governorgenerals letter and authorising me to return through any part of sikkim i thought proper the bearer was a lepcha attached to the court his dress was that of a superior person being a scarlet jacket over a white cotton dress the breadth of the blue stripes of which generally denotes wealth he was accompanied by a sort of attache who wore a magnificent pearl and gold earring and carried his masters bow as well as a basket on his back while an attendant coolie bore their utensils and food meepo or teshoo in tibetan mr meepo as he was usually called soon attached himself to me and proved an active useful and intelligent companion guide and often collector during many months afterwards  the vegetation round mywa guola is still thoroughly tropical the banyan is planted and thrives tolerably the heat being great during the day like the whole of the tambur valley below 4000 feet and especially on these flats the climate is very malarious before and after the rains and i was repeatedly applied to by natives suffering under attacks of fever during the two days i halted the mean temperature was 60 degrees extremes 8041 degrees that of the tambur 53 degrees and of the mywa 56 degrees each varying a few degrees the smaller stream the most between sunrise and 4 pm the sunk thermometer was 72 degrees  as we should not easily be able to procure food further on i laid in a full stock here and distributed blankets etc sufficient for temporary use for all the people dividing them into groups or messes    chapter ix  leave mywasuspension bridgelandslipsvegetationslope of

peak of junnoo alt 25312 feet forms a magnificent feature from this point seen up the narrow gorge of the river bearing nne about thirty miles i crossed the mewa an affluent from the north by another excellent suspension bridge in these bridges the principal chains are clamped to rocks on either shore and the suspended loops occur at intervals of eight to ten feet the single salplank laid on these loops swings terrifically and the handrails not being four feet high the sense of insecurity is very great  the wallanchoon road follows the west bank but the bridge above having been carried away we crossed by a plank and proceeded along very steep banks of decomposed chlorite schist much contorted and very soapy affording an insecure footing especially where great landslips had occurred which were numerous exposing acres of a reddish and white soil of felspathic clay sloping at an angle of 30 degrees where the angle was less than 15 degrees rice was cultivated and partially irrigated the lateral streams of a muddy opal green had cut beds 200 feet deep in the soft earth and were very troublesome to cross from the crumbling cliffs on either side and their broad swampy channels  five or six miles above mywa the valley contracts much and the tambur whose bed is elevated about 3000 feet becomes a turbulent river shooting along its course with immense velocity torn into foam as it lashes the spurs of rock that flank it and the enormous boulders with which its bed is strewn in some places torrents of stone were carried down by landslips obstructing the rivers when in the beds of streams they were often cemented by felspathic clay into a hard breccia of angular quartz gneiss and felspar nodules from this elevation to 9000 feet its sinuous track extends about thirty miles which gives the mean fall of 200 feet to the mile quadruple of what it is for the lower part of its course so long as its bed is below 5000 feet a tropical vegetation prevails in the gorge and along the terraces consisting of tall bamboo bauhinia acacia melastoma etc but the steep mountain sides above are either bare and grassy or cliffs with scattered shrubs and trees and their summits are of splintered slaty gneiss bristling with pines those faces exposed to the south and east are invariably the driest and most grassy while the opposite are well wooded rhododendron arboreum becomes plentiful at 5000 to 6000 feet forming a large tree on dry clayey slopes it is accompanied by indigofera andromeda spiraea shrubby compositae and very many plants absent at similar elevations on the wet outer dorjiling ranges  in the contracted parts of the valley the mountains often dip to the riverbed in precipices of gneiss under the ledges of which wild bees build pendulous nests looking like huge bats suspended by their wings they are two or three feet long and as broad at the top whence they taper downwards the honey is much sought for except in spring when it is said to be poisoned by rhododendron flowers just as that eaten by the soldiers in the retreat of the ten thousand was by the flowers of the r ponticum  above these gorges are enormous accumulations of rocks especially at the confluence of lateral valleys where they rest upon little flats like the riverterraces of mywa but wholly formed of angular shingle flanked with beds of riverformed gravel some of these boulders were thirty or forty yards across and split as if they had fallen from a height the path passing between the fragments the split fragments i was wholly unable to account for till my attention was directed by mr darwin to the observations of charpentier and agassiz who refer similar ones met with in the alps to rocks which have fallen through crevasses in glacierssee darwin on glaciers and transported boulders in north wales london phil mag xxi p 180 at first i imagined that they had been precipitated from the mountains around and i referred the shingle to landshoots which during the rains descend several thousand feet in devastating avalanches damming up the rivers and destroying houses cattle and cultivation but though i still refer the materials of many such terraces to this cause i consider those at the mouths of valleys to be due to ancient glacial action especially when laden with such enormous blocks as are probably icetransported  a change in the population accompanies that in the natural features of the country tibetans replacing the limboos and khasstribes of nepal who inhabit the lower region we daily passed parties of ten or a dozen tibetans on their way to mywa guola laden with salt several families of these wild black and uncouthlooking people generally travelling together the men are middlesized often tall very squarebuilt and muscular they have no beard moustache or whiskers the few hairs on their faces being carefully removed with tweezers they are dressed in loose blanket robes girt about the waist with a leather belt in which they place their iron or brass pipes and from which they suspend their long knives chopsticks tobaccopouch tweezers tinderbox etc the robe boots and cap are grey or striped with bright colours and they wear skullcaps and the hair plaited into a pigtail  the women are dressed in long flannel petticoats and spencer over which is thrown a sleeveless short striped cloak drawn round the waist by a girdle of broad brass or silver links to which hang their knives scissors needlecases etc and with which they often strap their children to their backs the hair is plaited in two tails and the neck loaded with strings of coral and glass beads and great lumps of amber glass and agate both sexes wear silver rings and earrings set with turquoises and square amulets upon their necks and arms which are boxes of gold or silver containing small idols or the nailparings teeth or other reliques of some sainted lama accompanied with musk written prayers and other charms all are goodhumoured and amiablelooking people very square and mongolian in countenance with broad mouths high cheekbones narrow upturned eyes broad flat noses and low foreheads white is their natural colour and rosy cheeks are common amongst the younger women and children but all are begrimed with filth and smoke added to which they become so weatherworn from exposure to the most rigorous climate in the world that their natural hues are rarely to be recognised their customary mode of saluting one another is to hold out the tongue grin nod and scratch their ear but this method entails so much ridicule in the low countries that they do not practise it to nepalese or strangers most of them when meeting me on the contrary raised their hands to their eyes threw themselves on the ground and kotowed most decorously bumping their foreheads three times on the ground even the women did this on several occasions on rising they begged for a bucksheesh which i gave in tobacco or snuff of which they are immoderately fond both men and women constantly spin wool as they travel  illustrationtibet mastiff  these motley groups of tibetans are singularly picturesque from the variety in their particoloured dresses and their odd appearance first comes a middleaged man or woman driving a little silky black yak grunting under his load of 260 lb of salt besides pots pans and kettles stools churn and bamboo vessels keeping up a constant rattle and perhaps buried amongst all a rosycheeked and lipped baby sucking a lump of cheesecurd the main body follow in due order and you are soon entangled amidst sheep and goats each with its two little bags of salt beside these stalks the huge grave bullheaded mastiff loaded like the rest his glorious bushy tail thrown over his back in a majestic sweep and a thick collar of scarlet wool round his neck and shoulders setting off his long silky coat to the best advantage he is decidedly the noblestlooking of the party especially if a fine and pure black one for they are often very ragged duncoloured sorry beasts he seems rather out of place neither guarding nor keeping the party together but he knows that neither yaks sheep nor goats require his attention all are perfectly tame so he takes his share of work as saltcarrier by day and watches by night as well the children bring up the rear laughing and chatting together they too have their loads even to the youngest that can walk alone  the last village of the limboos taptiatok is large and occupies a remarkable amphitheatre apparently a lakebed in the course of the tambur after proceeding some way through a narrow gorge along which the river foamed and roared the sudden opening out of this broad oval expanse more than a mile long was very striking the mountains rose bare and steep the west flank terminating in shivered masses of rock while that on the right was more undulating dry and grassy the surface was a flat gravelbed through which meandered the rippling stream fringed with alder it was a beautiful spot the clear cool murmuring river with its rapids and shallows forcibly reminding me of troutstreams in the highlands of scotland  beyond taptiatok we again crossed the river and ascended over dry grassy or rocky spurs to lelyp the first bhoteea village it stands on a hill fully 1000 feet above the river and commands a splendid view up the yalloong and kambachen valleys which open immediately to the east and appear as stupendous chasms in the mountains leading to the perpetual snows of kinchinjunga there were about fifty houses in the village of wood and thatch neatly fenced in with wattle the ground between being carefully cultivated with radishes buckwheat wheat and millet i was surprised to find in one enclosure a fine healthy plant of opuntia in flower at this latitude and elevation a lama who is the head man of the place came out to greet us with his family and a whole troop of villagers they were the same class of people as i have elsewhere described as cisnivean tibetans or bhoteeas none had ever before seen an englishman and i fear they formed no flattering opinion from the specimen now presented to them as they seemed infinitely amused at my appearance and one jolly dame clapped her hands to her sides and laughed at my spectacles till the hills echoed  elaeagnus was common here with edgeworthia gardneri a plant allied to daphne from whose bark the nepal paper is manufactured it was named after the eminent indian botanist brother of the late miss edgeworth a beautiful shrub with globes of waxy cowslipcoloured deliciously scented flowers also a wild apple which bears a small austere fruit like the siberian crab in the bed of the river rice was still cultivated by limboos and subtropical plants continued i saw too a chameleon and a porcupine indicating much warmth and seeming quite foreign to the heart of these stupendous mountains from 6000 to 7000 feet plants of the temperate regions blend with the tropical such as rhododendron oak ivy geranium berberry clematis and shrubby vaccinia which all made their appearance at loongtoong another bhoteea village here too i first saw a praying machine turned by water it was enclosed in a little wooden house and consisted of an upright cylinder containing a prayer and with the words om mani padmi om hail to him of the lotus and jewel painted on the circumference it was placed over a stream and made to rotate on its axis by a spindle which passed through the floor of the building into the water and was terminated by a wheel  above this the road followed the west bank of the river the latter was a furious torrent flowing through a gorge fringed with a sombre vegetation damp and dripping with moisture and covered with long usnea and pendulous mosses the road was very rocky and difficult sometimes leading along bluff faces of cliffs by wooden steps and single rotten planks at 8000 feet i met with pines whose trunks i had seen strewing the river for some miles lower down the first that occurred was abies brunoniana a beautiful species which forms a stately blunt pyramid with branches spreading like the cedar but not so stiff and drooping gracefully on all sides it is unknown on the outer ranges of sikkim and in the interior occupies a belt about 1000 feet lower than the silver fir a webbiana many subalpine plants occur here as lecesteria thalictrum rose thistles alder birch ferns berberry holly anemone strawberry raspberry gnaphalium the alpine bamboo and oaks the scenery is as grand as any pictured by salvator rosa a river roaring in sheets of foam sombre woods crags of gneiss and tier upon tier of lofty mountains flanked and crested with groves of black firs terminating in snowsprinkled rocky peaks  illustrationtambur river at the lower limit of pines  i now found the temperature getting rapidly cooler both that of the air which here at 8066 feet fell to 32 degrees in the night and that of the river which was always below 40 degrees it was in these narrow valleys only that i observed the return cold current rushing down the rivercourses during the nights which were usually brilliant and very cold with copious dew so powerful indeed was the radiation that the upper blanket of my bed became coated with moisture from the rapid abstraction of heat by the frozen tarpaulin of my tent  the rivers here are often fringed by flats of shingle on which grow magnificent yews and pines some of the latter were from 120 to 150 feet high and had been blown down owing to their scanty hold on the soil i measured one abies brunoniana twenty feet in girth many alpine rhododendrons occur at 9000 feet with astragalis and creeping tamarisk three miles below wallanchoon the river forks being met by the yangma from the northeast they are impetuous torrents of about equal volume the tambur especially here called the walloong is often broken into cascades and cuts a deep gorgelike channel  i arrived at the village of wallanchoon on the 23rd of november it is elevated 10385 feet and situated in a fine open part of the tambur valley differing from any part lower down in all its natural features being broad with a rapid but not turbulent stream very grassy and both the base and sides of the flanking mountains covered with luxuriant dense bushes of rhododendron rose berberry and juniper redlegged crows hawks wild pigeons and finches abounded there was but little snow on the mountains around which are bare and craggy above but sloping below bleak and forbidding as the situation of any himalayan village at 10000 feet elevation must be that of wallanchoon is rendered the more so from the comparatively few trees for though the silver fir and juniper are both abundant higher up the valley they have been felled here for building materials fuel and export to tibet from the naked limbs and tall gaunt black trunks of those that remain stringy masses of bleached lichen usnea many feet long stream in the wind both men and women seemed fond of decorating their hair with wreaths of this lichen which they dye yellow with leaves of symplocos  illustrationwallanchoon village  the village is very large and occupies a flat on the east bank of the river covered with huge boulders the ascent to it is extremely steep probably over an ancient moraine though i did not recognise it as such at the time cresting this the valley at once opens and i was almost startled with the sudden change from a gloomy gorge to a broad flat and a populous village of large and good painted wooden houses ornamented with hundreds of long poles and vertical flags looking like the fleet of some foreign port while a swarm of goodnatured intolerably dirty tibetans were kotowing to me as i advanced  the houses crept up the base of the mountain on the flank of which was a very large long convent twostoried and painted scarlet with a low black roof and backed by a grove of dark junipers while the hillsides around were thickly studded with bushes of deep green rhododendron scarlet berberry and withered yellow rose the village contained about one hundred houses irregularly crowded together from twenty to forty feet high and forty to eighty feet long each accommodating several families all were built of upright strong pineplanks the interstices of which were filled with yakdung and they sometimes rest on a low foundation wall the door was generally at the gable end it opened with a latch and string and turned on a wooden pivot the only window was a slit closed by a shutter and the roofs were very lowpitched covered with shingles kept down by stones the paths were narrow and filthy and the only public buildings besides the convents were manis and mendongs of these the former are squareroofed temples containing rows of praying cylinders placed close together from four to six feet high and gaudily painted some are turned by hand and others by water the latter are walls ornamented with slabs of clay and mica slate with om mani padmi om well carved on them in two characters and repeated ad infinitum  a tibetan household is very slovenly the family live higgledy piggledy in two or more apartments the largest of which has an open fire on the earth or on a stone if the floor be of wood the pots and teapot are earthen and copper and these with the bamboo churn for the brick tea some wooden and metal spoons bowls and platters comprise all the kitchen utensils  every one carries in the breast of his robe a little wooden cup for daily use neatly turned from the knotted roots of maple see chapter v the tibetan chiefly consumes barley wheat or buckwheat mealthe latter is confined to the poorer classeswith milk butter curd and parched wheat fowls eggs pork and yak flesh when he can afford it and radishes a few potatos legumes and turnips in their short season his drink is a sort of soup made from brick tea of which a handful of leaves is churned up with salt butter and soda then boiled and transferred to the teapot whence it is poured scalding hot into each cup which the good woman of the house keeps incessantly replenishing and urging you to drain sometimes but more rarely the tibetans make a drink by pouring boiling water over malt as the lepchas do over millet a pipe of yellow mild chinese tobacco generally follows the meal more often however their tobacco is brought from the plains of india when it is of a very inferior description the pipe carried in the girdle is of brass or iron often with an agate amber or bamboo mouthpiece  many herds of fine yaks were grazing about wallanchoon there were a few ponies sheep goats fowls and pigs but very little cultivation except turnips radishes and potatos the yak is a very tame domestic animal often handsome and a true bison in appearance it is invaluable to these mountaineers from its strength and hardiness accomplishing at a slow pace twenty miles a day bearing either two bags of salt or rice or four to six planks of pinewood slung in pairs along either flank their ears are generally pierced and ornamented with a tuft of scarlet worsted they have large and beautiful eyes spreading horns long silky black hair and grand bushy tails black is their prevailing colour but red dun particoloured and white are common in winter the flocks graze below 8000 feet on account of the great quantity of snow above that height in summer they find pasturage as high as 17000 feet consisting of grass and small tufted carices on which they browse with avidity  the zobo or cross between the yak and hill cow much resembling the english cow is but rarely seen in these mountains though common in the north west himalaya the yak is used as a beast of burden and much of the wealth of the people consists in its rich milk and curd eaten either fresh or dried or powdered into a kind of meal the hair is spun into ropes and woven into a covering for their tents which is quite pervious to wind and rain the latter is however of little consequence in the dry climate of tibet from the same material are made the gauze shades for the eyes used in crossing snowy passes the bushy tail forms the wellknown chowry or flyflapper of the plains of india the bones and dung serve for fuel the female drops one calf in april and the young yaks are very full of gambols tearing up and down the steep grassy and rocky slopes their flesh is delicious much richer and more juicy than common veal that of the old yak is sliced and dried in the sun forming jerked meat which is eaten raw the scanty proportion of fat preventing its becoming very rancid so that i found it palatable food it is called schattcheu dried meat i never observed the yak to be annoyed by any insects indeed at the elevation it inhabits there are no large diptera bots or gadflies to infest it it loves steep places delighting to scramble among rocks and to sun its black hide perched on the glacial boulders which strew the wallanchoon flat and on which these beasts always sleep their average value is from two to three pounds but the price varies with the season in autumn when her calf is killed for food the mother will yield no milk unless the herdsman gives it the calfs foot to lick or lays a stuffed skin before it to fondle which it does with eagerness expressing its satisfaction by short grunts exactly like those of a pig a sound which replaces the low uttered by ordinary cattle the yak though indifferent to ice and snow and to changes of temperature cannot endure hunger so long as the sheep nor pick its way so well upon stony ground neither can it bear damp heat for which reason it will not live in summer below 7000 feet where liver disease carries it off after a very few years nevertheless the yak seems to have survived the voyage to england i find in turners tibet p 189 that a bull sent by that traveller to mr hastings reached england alive and after suffering from languor so far recovered its health and vigour as to become the father of many calves turner does not state by what mother these calves were born an important omission as he adds that all these died but one cow which bore a calf by an indian bull a painting of the yak copied into turners book by stubbs the animal painter may be seen in the museum of the royal college of surgeons london the artist is probably a little indebted to description for the appearance of its hair in a native state for it is represented much too even in length and reaching to too uniform a depth from the flanks lastly the yak is ridden especially by the fat lamas who find its shaggy coat warm and its paces easy under these circumstances it is always led the wild yak or bison dhong of central asia the superb progenitor of this animal is the largest native animal of tibet in various parts of which country it is found and the tibetans say in reference to its size that the liver is a load for a tame yak the sikkim dewan gave dr campbell and myself an animated account of the chase of this animal which is hunted by large dogs and shot with a blunderbuss it is untameable and horridly fierce falling upon you with horns and chest and if he rasps you with his tongue it is so rough as to scrape the flesh from the bones the horn is used as a drinkingcup in marriage feasts and on other grand occasions my readers are probably familiar with messrs huc and gabets account of a herd of these animals being frozen fast in the headwaters of the yangtsekiang river there is a noble specimen in the british museum not yet set up and another is preparing for exhibition in the crystal palace at sydenham  the inhabitants of these frontier districts belong to two very different tribes but all are alike called bhoteeas from bhote the proper name of tibet and have for many centuries been located in what isin climate and natural featuresa neutral ground between dry tibet proper and the wet himalayan gorges they inhabit a climate too cold for either the lepcha or nepalese migrating between 6000 and 15000 feet with the seasons always accompanied by their herds in all respects of appearance religion manners customs and language they are tibetans and lama booddhists but they pay tax to the nepal and sikkim rajahs to whom they render immense service by keeping up and facilitating the trade in salt wool musk etc which could hardly be conducted without their cooperation they levy a small tax on all imports and trade a little on their own account but are generally poor and very indolent in their alpine summer quarters they grow scanty crops of wheat barley turnips and radishes and at their winter quarters as at loongtoong the better classes cultivate fine crops of buckwheat millet spinach etc though seldom enough for their support as in spring they are obliged to buy rice from the inhabitants of the lower regions equally dependent on nepal and tibet they very naturally hold themselves independent of both and i found that my roving commission from the nepal rajah was not respected and the guard of ghorkas held very cheap  on my arrival at wallanchoon i was conducted to two tents each about eight feet long of yaks hair striped blue and white which had been pitched close to the village for my accommodation though the best that could be provided and larger than my own they were wretched in the extreme being of so loose a texture that the wind blew through them each was formed of two cloths with a long slit between them that ran across the top giving egress to the smoke and ingress to the weather they were supported on two short poles kept to the ground by large stones and fastened by yaks hair ropes a fire was smoking vigorously in the centre of one and some planks were laid at the end for my bed a crowd of people soon came to stare and loll out their tongues at me my party and travelling equipage though very civil and only offensive in smell they were troublesome from their eager curiosity to see and handle everything so that i had to place a circle of stones round the tents whilst a soldier stood by on the alert to keep them off a more idle people are not to be found except with regard to spinning which is their constant occupation every man and woman carrying a bundle of wool in the breast of their garments which is spun by hand with a spindle and wound off on two crosspieces at its lower end spinning smoking and teadrinking are their chief pursuits and the women take all the active duties of the dairy and house they live very happily together fighting being almost unknown  soon after my arrival i was waited on by the guobah or headman a tall goodlooking person dressed in a purple woollen robe with good pearl and coral ear and fingerrings and a broad ivory ring over the left thumb a broad ring of this material agate or chalcedony is a mark of rank here as amongst the manchoos and throughout central asia as a guard when using the bow he wore a neat thick white felt cap with the border turned up and a silk tassel on the top this he removed with both hands and held before him bowing three times on entering he was followed by a crowd some of whom were his own people and brought a present of a kid fowls rice and eggs and some spikenard roots nardostachys jatamansi a species of valerian smelling strongly of patchouli which is a very favourite perfume after paying some compliments he showed me round the village during my walk i found that i had a good many objections to overrule before i could proceed to the wallanchoon pass nearly two days journey to the northward in the first place the guobah disputed the nepal rajahs authority to pass me through his dominions and besides the natural jealousy of these people when intruded upon they have very good reasons for concealing the amount of revenue they raise from their position and for keeping up the delusion that they alone can endure the excessive climate of these regions or undergo the hardships and toil of the salt trade my passport said nothing about the passes my people and especially the ghorkas detested the keen cold and cutting wind at mywa guola i had been persuaded by the havildar to put off providing snowboots and blankets on the assurance that i should easily get them at walloong which i now found all but impossible owing to there being no bazaar my provisions were running short and for the same reason i had no present hope of replenishing them all my party had i found reckoned with certainty that i should have had enough of this elevation and weather by the time i reached walloong some of them fell sick the guobah swore that the passes were full of snow and had been impracticable since october and the ghorka havildar respectfully deposed that he had no orders relative to the pass prompt measures were requisite so i told all my people that i should stop the next day at walloong and proceed on the following on a three days journey to the pass with or without the guobahs permission to the ghorka soldiers i said that the present they would receive and the character they would take to their commandant depended on their carrying out this point which had been fully explained before starting my servants i told that their pay and reward also depended on their implicit obedience i took the guobah aside and showed him troops of yaks tethered by halters and toggles to a long rope stretched between two rocks which had that morning arrived laden with salt from the north i told him it was vain to try and deceive me that my passport was ample and that i should expect a guide provisions and snowboots the next day and that every impediment and every facility should be reported to the rajah  during my two days stay at walloong the weather was bitterly cold as heretofore the nights and mornings were cloudless but by noon the whole sky became murky the highest temperature 50 degrees occurring at 10 am at this season the prospect from this elevation 10385 feet was dreary in the extreme and the quantity of snow on the mountains which was continually increasing held out a dismal promise for my chance of exploring lofty uninhabited regions all annual and deciduous vegetation had long past and the lofty himalayas are very poor in mosses and lichens as compared with the european alps and arctic regions in general the temperature fluctuated from 22 degrees at sunrise to 50 degrees at 10 am the mean being 35 degrees this gives 1 degrees fahr for every 309 feet of elevation using contemporaneous observations at calcutta and correcting for latitude etc one night it fell to 64 degrees throughout the day a south wind blew strong and cold up the valley and at sunset was replaced by a keen north blast searching every corner and piercing through tent and blankets though the suns rays were hot for an hour or two in the morning its genial influence was never felt in the wind the air was never very dry the wetbulb thermometer standing during the day 375 degrees below the dry thus giving a mean dewpoint of 3025 degrees a thermometer sunk two feet stood at 44 degrees fully 9 degrees above the mean temperature of the air one exposed to the clear sky stood during the day several degrees below the air in shade and at night from 9 degrees to 1475 degrees lower the blackbulb thermometer in the sun rose to 6575 degrees above the air indicating upwards of 90 degrees difference at nearly the warmest part of the day between contiguous shaded and sunny exposures the sky when cloudless was generally a cold blue or steelgrey colour but at night the stars were large and twinkled gloriously the blackglass photometer indicated 10521 inches on three mornings the maxima occurred at between 9 and 10 am they were nov 24th 10509 nov 25th 10521 on the 25th at tuquoroma i recorded 10510 the maximum effect observed at dorjiling 7340 feet was 10328 and on the plains of india 10350 the maximum i ever recorded was in yangma valley 15186 feet 10572 at 1 pm as the maximum intensity of sunlight the temperature of the river close by fell to 32 degrees during the night and rose to 37 degrees in the day in my tent the temperature fluctuated with the state of the fire from 26 degrees at night to 58 degrees when the sun beat on it but the only choice was between cold and suffocating smoke  after a good many conferences with the guobah some bullying douce violence persuasions and the prescribing of pills prayers and charms in the shape of warm water for the sick of the village whereby i gained some favour i was on the 25th nov grudgingly prepared for the trip to wallanchoon with a guide and some snowboots for those of my party whom i took with me  the path lay northwest up the valley which became thickly wooded with silverfir and juniper we gradually ascended crossing many streams from lateral gulleys and huge masses of boulders evergreen rhododendrons soon replaced the firs growing in inconceivable profusion especially on the slopes facing the south east and with no other shrubs or treevegetation but scattered bushes of rose spiraea dwarf juniper stunted birch willow honeysuckle berberry and a mountainash pyrus what surprised me more than the prevalence of rhododendron bushes was the number of species of this genus easily recognised by the shape of their capsules the form and woolly covering of the leaves none were in flower but i reaped a rich harvest of seed at 12000 feet the valley was wild open and broad with sloping mountains clothed for 1000 feet with darkgreen rhododendron bushes the river ran rapidly and was broken into falls here and there huge angular and detached masses of rock were scattered about and to the right and left snowy peaks towered over the surrounding mountains while amongst the latter narrow gulleys led up to blue patches of glacial ice with trickling streams and shoots of stones dwarf rhododendrons with stronglyscented leaves r anthopogon and setosum and abundance of a little andromeda exactly like ling with woody stems and tufted branches gave a heathery appearance to the hillsides the prevalence of lichens common to this country and to scotland especially l geographicus which coloured the rocks added an additional feature to the resemblance to scotch highland scenery along the narrow path i found the two commonest of all british weeds a grass poa annua and the shepherds purse they had evidently been imported by man and yaks and as they do not occur in india i could not but regard these little wanderers from the north with the deepest interest  such incidents as these give rise to trains of reflection in the mind of the naturalist traveller and the farther he may be from home and friends the more wild and desolate the country he is exploring the greater the difficulties and dangers under which he encounters these subjects of his earliest studies in science so much keener is the delight with which he recognises them and the more lasting is the impression which they leave at this moment these common weeds more vividly recall to me that wild scene than does all my journal and remind me how i went on my way taxing my memory for all it ever knew of the geographical distribution of the shepherds purse and musing on the probability of the plant having found its way thither over all central asia and the ages that may have been occupied in its march  on reaching 13000 feet the ground was everywhere hard and frozen and i experienced the first symptoms of lassitude headache and giddiness which however were but slight and only came on with severe exertion  we encountered a group of tibetans encamped to leeward of an immense boulder of gneiss against which they had raised a shelter with their saltbags removed from their herd of yaks which were grazing close by they looked miserably cold and haggard and their little upturned eyes much inflamed and bloodshot testified to the hardships they had endured in their march from the salt regions they were crouched round a small fire of juniper wood smoking iron pipes with agate mouthpieces a restinghouse was in sight across the streama loose stone hut to which we repaired i wondered why these tibetans had not taken possession of it not being aware of the value they attach to a rock on account of the great warmth which it imbibes from the suns rays during the day and retains at night this invaluable property of otherwise inhospitable gneiss and granite i had afterwards many opportunities of proving and when driven for a nights shelter to such as rude nature might afford on the bleak mountain i have had my blankets laid beneath the shadow of a great rock in a weary land  the name of dhamersala is applied in the mountains as in the plains of india to a house provided for the accommodation of travellers whether it be one of the beautiful caravanserais built to gratify the piety ostentation or benevolence of a rajah or such a miserable shieling of rough stone and plank as that of tuquoroma in which we took up our quarters at 13000 feet elevation a cheerful fire soon blazed on the earthen floor filling the room with the pungent odour of juniper which made our eyes smart and water the ghorkas withdrew to one corner and my lepchas to a second while one end was screened off for my couch unluckily the wall faced the northeast and in that direction there was a gulley in the snowy mountains down which the wind swept with violence penetrating to my bed i had calculated upon a good nights rest here which i much needed having been worried and unwell at wallanchoon owing to the guobahs obstinacy i had not then learnt how to treat such conduct and just before retiring to rest had further been informed by the havildar that the guobah declared we should find no food on our return to remain in these mountains without a supply was impossible and the delay of sending to mywa guola would not have answered so i long lay awake occupied in arranging measures the night was clear and very cold the thermometer falling to 19 degrees at 9 pm and to 12 degrees in the night and that by my bedside to 20 degrees  on the following morning nov 26th i started with a small party to visit the pass continuing up the broad grassy valley much snow lay on the ground at 13500 feet which had fallen the previous month and several glaciers were seen in lateral ravines at about the same elevation after a couple of miles we left the broad valley which continued northwest and struck northward up a narrow stony and steep gorge crossing an immense ancient moraine at its mouth this path which we followed for seven or eight miles led up to the pass winding considerably and keeping along the southeast exposures which being the most sunny are the freest from snow the morning was splendid the atmosphere over the dry rocks and earth at 14000 feet vibrating from the power of the suns rays whilst vast masses of blue glacier and fields of snow choked every galley and were spread over all shady places although owing to the steepness and narrowness of the gorge no view was obtained the scenery was wild and very grand just below where perpetual snow descends to the path an ugly carved head of a demon with bloodstained cheeks and goggleeyes was placed in a niche of rock and protected by a glass  at 15000 feet the snow closed in on the path from all sides whether perpetual glacial or only the october fall i could not tell the guide declared it to be perpetual henceforward though now deepened by the very heavy october fall the path was cut some three feet through it enormous boulders of gneiss cumbered the bottom of the gorge which gradually widened as we approached its summit and rugged masses of black and red gneiss and mica schist pierced the snow and stood out in dismal relief for four miles continuously we proceeded over snow which was much honeycombed on the surface and treacherous from the icy streams it covered into which we every now and then stumbled there was scarcely a trace of vegetation and the cold was excessive except in the sun  towards the summit of the pass the snow lay very deep and we followed the course of a small stream which cut through it the walls of snow being breasthigh on each side the path was still frequented by yaks of which we overtook a small party going to tibet laden with planks all the party appeared alike overcome by lassitude shortness and difficulty of breathing a sense of weight on the stomach giddiness and headache with tightness across the temples  just below the summit was a complete bay of snow girdled with two sharp peaks of red baked schists and gneiss strangely contorted and thrown up at all angles with no prevalent dip or strike and permeated with veins of granite the top itself or boundary between nepal and tibet is a low saddle between two rugged ridges of rock with a cairn built on it adorned with bits of stick and rag covered with tibetan inscriptions the view into tibet was not at all distant and was entirely of snowy mountains piled ridge over ridge three of these spurs must it is said be crossed before any descent can be made to the chomachoo river as the arun is called in tibet on which is the frontier fort of the tibetans and which is reached in two or three days there is no plain or level ground of any kind before reaching that river of which the valley is said to be wide and flat  starting at 10 am we did not reach the top till 330 pm we had halted nowhere but the last few miles had been most laborious and the three of us who gained the summit were utterly knocked up fortunately i carried my own barometer it indicated 16206 inches giving by comparative observations with calcutta 16764 feet and with dorjiling 16748 feet as the height of the pass the thermometer stood at 18 degrees and the sun being now hidden behind rocks the southeast wind was bitterly cold hitherto the sun had appeared as a clearly defined sparkling globe against a dark blue sky but the depth of the azure blue was not so striking as i had been led to suppose by the accounts of previous travellers in very lofty regions the plants gathered near the top of the pass were species of compositae grass and arenaria the most curious was saussurea gossypina which forms great clubs of the softest white wool six inches to a foot high its flowers and leaves seeming uniformly clothed with the warmest fur that nature can devise generally speaking the alpine plants of the himalaya are quite unprovided with any special protection of this kind it is the prevalence and conspicuous nature of the exceptions that mislead and induce the careless observer to generalise hastily from solitary instances for the prevailing alpine genera of the himalaya arenarias primroses saxifrages fumitories ranunculi gentians grasses sedges etc have almost uniformly naked foliage  we descended to the foot of the pass in about two hours darkness overtaking us by the way the twilight however being prolonged by the glare of the snow fearing the distance to tuquoroma might be too great to permit of our returning thither the same night i had had a few things brought hither during the day and finding they had arrived we encamped under the shelter of some enormous boulders at 13500 feet part of an ancient moraine which extended some distance along the bed of the narrow valley except an excruciating headache i felt no ill effects from my ascent and after a supper of tea and biscuit i slept soundly  on the following morning the temperature was 28 degrees at 630 am and rose to 30 degrees when the sun appeared over the mountains at 815 at which time the black bulb thermometer suddenly mounted to 112 degrees upwards of 80 degrees above the temperature of the air the sky was brilliantly clear with a very dry cold north wind blowing down the snowy valley of the pass    chapter x  return from wallanchoon passprocure a bazaar at villagedance of lamasblacking face tibetan

geological causes of phenomena in valleyscenery of valley on descent  i returned to the village of wallanchoon after collecting all the plants i could around my camp amongst them a commonlooking dock abounded in the spots which the yaks had frequented  the ground was covered as with heather with abundance of creeping dwarf juniper andromeda and dwarf rhododendron on arriving at the village i refused to receive the guobah unless he opened a bazaar at daylight on the following morning where my people might purchase food and threatened to bring charges against him before his rajah at the same time i arranged for sending the main body of my party down the tambur and so back to sikkim whilst i should with as few as possible visit the kanglachem tibetan pass in the adjacent valley to the eastward and then crossing the nango kambachen and kanglanamo passes reach jongri in sikkim on the south flank of kinchinjunga  strolling out in the afternoon i saw a dance of lamas they were disfigured with black paint i shall elsewhere have to refer to the tibetan custom of daubing the face with black pigment to protect the skin from the excessive cold and dryness of these lofty regions and to the ludicrous imposition that was passed on the credulity of mm huc and gabet and covered with rags feathers and scarlet cloth and they carried long poles with bells and banners attached thus equipped they marched through the village every now and then halting when they danced and gesticulated to the rude music of cymbals and horns the bystanders applauding with shouts crackers and alms  i walked up to the convents which were long ugly buildings several stories high built of wood and daubed with red and grey paint the priests were nowhere to be found and an old withered nun whom i disturbed husking millet in a large wooden mortar fled at my approach the temple stood close by the convent and had a broad low architrave the walls sloped inwards as did the lintels the doors were black and almost covered with a gigantic and disproportioned painting of a head with bloody cheeks and huge teeth it was surrounded by myriads of goggle eyes which seemed to follow one about everywhere and though in every respect rude the effect was somewhat imposing the similarly proportioned gloomy portals of egyptian fanes naturally invite comparison but the tibetan temples lack the sublimity of these and the uncomfortable creeping sensation produced by the many sleepless eyes of boodhs numerous incarnations is very different from the awe with which we contemplate the outspread wings of the egyptian symbol and feel as in the presence of the god who says i am osiris the great no man hath dared to lift my veil  i had ascended behind the village but returned down the via sacra a steep paved path flanked by mendongs or low stone dykes into which were let rows of stone slabs inscribed with the sacred om mani padmi omhail to him of the lotus and jewel an invocation of sakkya who is usually represented holding a lotus flower with a jewel in it  on the following morning a scanty supply of very dirty rice was produced at a very high price i had however so divided my party as not to require a great amount of food intending to send most of the people back by the tambur to dorjiling i kept nineteen persons in all selecting the most willing as it was evident the journey at this season would be one of great hardship we took seven days food which was as much as they could carry at noon i left wallanchoon and mustered my party at the junction of the tambur and yangma whence i dismissed the party for dorjiling with my collections of plants minerals etc and proceeded with the chosen ones to ascend the yangma river the scenery was wild and very grand our path lying through a narrow gorge choked with pine trees down which the river roared in a furious torrent while the mountains on each side were crested with castellated masses of rock and sprinkled with snow the road was very bad often up ladders and along planks lashed to the faces of precipices and overhanging the torrent which it crossed several times by plank bridges by dark we arrived at yangma guola a collection of empty wood huts buried in the rocky forestclad valley and took possession of a couple they were well built raised on posts with a stage and ladder at the gable end and consisted of one goodsized apartment around was abundance of dock together with three common english plants cardamine hirsuta limosella aquatica and juncus bufonius  the night was calm misty and warm max 415 degrees min 29 degrees for the elevation 9300 feet during the night i was startled out of my sleep by a blaze of light and jumping up found myself in presence of a party of most sinisterlooking black ragged tibetans armed with huge torches of pine that filled the room with flame and pitchy smoke i remembered their arriving just before dark and their weapons dispelled my fears for they came armed with bamboo jugs of murwa beer and were very drunk and very amiable they grinned nodded kotowed lolled out their tongues and scratched their ears in the most seductive manner then held out their jugs and besought me by words and gestures to drink and be happy too i awoke my servant always a work of difficulty and with some trouble ejected the visitors happily without setting the house on fire i heard them toppling head over heels down the stair which i afterwards had drawn up to prevent further intrusion and in spite of their drunken orgies was soon lulled to sleep again by the music of the roaring river  on the 29th november i continued my course north up the yangma valley which after five miles opened considerably the trees disappearing and the river flowing more tranquilly and through a broader valley when above 11000 feet elevation the guobah of wallanchoon overtook us on the road on his way he said to collect the revenues at yangma village but in reality to see what i was about he owns five considerable villages and is said to pay a tax of 6000 rupees 600 pounds to the rajah of nepal this is no doubt a great exaggeration but the revenues of such a position near a pass frequented almost throughout the year must be considerable every yak going and coming is said to pay ls and every horse 4s cattle sheep ponies land and wool are all taxed he exports also quantities of timber to tibet and various articles from the plains of india he joined my party and halted where i did had his little chinese rug spread and squatted crosslegged on it whilst his servant prepared his brick tea with salt butter and soda of which he partook snuffed smoked rose up had all his traps repacked and was off again  we encamped at a most remarkable place the valley was broad with little vegetation but stunted treejunipers rocky snowtopped mountains rose on either side bleak bare and rugged and in front close above my tent was a gigantic wall of rocks piledas if by the titanscompletely across the valley for about threequarters of a mile this striking phenomenon had excited all my curiosity on first obtaining a view of it the path i found led over it close under its west end and wound amongst the enormous detached fragments of which it was formed and which were often eighty feet square all were of gneiss and schist with abundance of granite in blocks and veins a superb view opened from the top revealing its nature to be a vast moraine far below the influence of any existing glaciers but which at some antecedent period had been thrown across by a glacier descending to 10000 feet from a lateral valley on the east flank standing on the top and looking south was the yangma valley up which i had come gradually contracting to a defile girdled by snowtipped mountains whose rocky flanks mingled with the black pine forest below eastward the moraine stretched south of the lateral valley above which towered the snowy peak of nango tinged rosy red and sparkling in the rays of the setting sun blue glaciers peeped from every gulley on its side but these were 2000 to 3000 feet above this moraine they were small too and their moraines were mere gravel compared with this many smaller consecutive moraines also were evident along the bottom of that lateral valley from this great one up to the existing glaciers looking up the yangma was a flat grassy plain hemmed in by mountains and covered with other stupendous moraines which rose ridge behind ridge and cut off the view of all but the mountain tops to the north the river meandered through the grassy plain which appeared a mile and a half broad at the utmost and perhaps as long and cut through the great moraine on its eastern side just below the junction of the stream from the glacial valley which at the lower part of its course flowed over a broad steep shingle bed  illustrationancient moraine thrown across the yangma valley east nepal elevn 11000 ft  i descended to my camp full of anxious anticipations for the morrow while the novelty of the scene and its striking character the complexity of the phenomena the lakebed the stupendous icedeposited moraine and its remoteness from any existing ice the broad valley and open character of the country were all marked out as so many problems suddenly conjured up for my unaided solution and kept me awake for many hours i had never seen a glacier or moraine on land before but being familiar with sea ice and berg transport from voyaging in the south polar regions i was strongly inclined to attribute the formation of this moraine to a period when a glacial ocean stood high on the himalaya made fiords of the valleys and floated bergs laden with blocks from the lateral gulleys which the winds and currents would deposit along certain lines on the following morning i carried a barometer to the top of the moraine which proved to be upwards of 700 feet above the floor of the valley and 400 above the dry lakebed which it bounded and to which we descended on our route up the valley the latter was grassy and pebbly perfectly level and quite barren except a very few pines at the bases of the encircling mountains and abundance of rhododendrons andromeda and juniper on the moraines isolated moraines occurred along both flanks of the valley some higher than that i have described and a very long one was thrown nearly across from the upper end of another lateral gulley on the east side also leading up to the glaciers of nango this second moraine commenced a mile and a half above the first and abutting on the east flank of the valley stretched nearly across and then curving round ran down it parallel to and near the west flank from which it was separated by the yangma river it was abruptly terminated by a conical hill of boulders round whose base the river flowed entering the dry lakebed from the west and crossing it in a southeasterly direction to the western extremity of the great moraine  the road on its ascent to the second moraine passed over an immense accumulation of glacial detritus at the mouth of the second lateral valley entirely formed of angular fragments of gneiss and granite loosely bound together by felspathic sand the whole was disposed in concentric ridges radiating from the mouth of the valley and descending to the flat these were moraines in petto formed by the action of winter snow and ice upon the loose debris a stream flowed over this debris dividing into branches before reaching the lakebed where its waters were collected and whence it meandered southward to fall into the yangma  from the top of the second moraine a very curious scene opened up the valley of another but more stony and desolate level lakebed through which the yangma here very rapid rushed cutting a channel about sixty feet deep the flanks of this second lakebed were cut most distinctly into two principal terraces which were again subdivided into others so that the general appearance was that of many raised beaches but each so broken up that with the exception of one on the banks of the river none were continuous for any distance we descended 200 feet and crossed the valley and river obliquely in a northwest direction to a small temple and convent which stood on a broad flat terrace under the black precipitous west flank this gave me a good opportunity of examining the structure of this part of the valley which was filled with an accumulation probably 200 feet thick at the deepest part of angular gravel and enormous boulders both imbedded in the gravel and strewed on the flat surfaces of the terraces the latter were always broadest opposite to the lateral valleys perfectly horizontal for the short  illustrationancient moraines in the yangma valley  distance that they were continuous and very barren there were no traces of fossils nor could i assure myself of stratification the accumulation was wholly glacial and probably a lake had supervened on the melting of the great glacier and its recedence which lake confined by a frozen moraine would periodically lose its waters by sudden accessions of heat melting the ice of the latter stratified silt no doubt once covered the lake bottom and the terraces have in succession been denuded of it by rain and snow these causes are now in operation amongst the stupendous glaciers of northeast sikkim where valleys dammed up by moraines exhibit lakes hemmed in between these the base of the glacier and the flanks of the valleys  yangma convents stood at the mouth of a gorge which opened upon the uppermost terrace and the surface of the latter here well covered with grass was furrowed into concentric radiating ridges which were very conspicuous from a distance the buildings consisted of a wretched collection of stone huts painted red enclosed by loose stone dykes two shockingly dirty lamas received me and conducted me to the temple which had very thick walls but was undistinguishable from the other buildings a small door opened upon an apartment piled full of old battered gongs drums scraps of silk hangings red cloth broken prayingmachinesrelics much resembling those in the lumberroom of a theatre a ladder led from this dismal hole to the upper story which was entered by a handsomely carved and gilded door within all was dark except from a little latticewindow covered with oilpaper on one side was the library a carved case with a hundred gilded pigeonholes each holding a real or sham book and each closed by a little square door on which hung a bag full  of amulets in the centre of the bookcase was a recess containing a genuine jos or fo graced with his chinese attribute of very long pendulous moustaches and beard and totally wanting that air of contemplative repose which the tibetan lamas give to their idols banners were suspended around with paintings of lhassa teshoo loombo and various incarnations of boodh the books were of the usual tibetan form oblong squares of separate blockprinted leaves of paper made in nepal or bhotan from the bark of a daphne bound together by silk cords and placed between ornamented wooden boards on our way up the valley we had passed some mendongs and chaits the latter very pretty stone structures consisting of a cube pyramid hemisphere and cone placed on the top of one another forming together the tasteful combination which appears on the cover of these volumes  beyond the convents the valley again contracted and on crossing a third but much lower moraine a lake opened to view surrounded by flat terraces and a broad gravelly shore part of the lake being dry to the west the cliffs were high black and steep to the east a large lateral valley filled at about 1500 feet up with blue glaciers led as did the other lateral valleys to the gleaming snows of nango the moraine too here abutted on the east flank of the yangma valley below the mouth of the lateral one much snow from the october fall lay on the ground and the cold was pinching in the shade still i could not help attempting to sketch this wonderfully grand scene especially as lakes in the himalaya are extremely rare the present one was about a mile long very shallow but broad and as smooth as glass it reminded me of the tarn in glencoe the reflected lofty peak of nango appeared as if frozen deep down in its glassy bed every snowy crest and ridge being rendered with perfect precision  illustrationlooking across yangma valley   nango is about 18000 feet high it is the next lofty mountain of the kinchinjunga group to the west of junnoo and i doubt if any equally high peak occurs again for some distance further west in nepal facing the yangma valley it presents a beautiful range of precipices of black rock capped with a thick crust of snow below the cliffs the snow again appears continuously and very steep for 2000 to 3000 feet downwards where it terminates in glaciers that descend to 14000 feet the steepest snowbeds appear cut into vertical ridges whence the whole snowy face isas it werecrimped in perpendicular closelyset zigzag lines doubtless caused by the melting process which furrows the surface of the snow into channels by which the water is carried off the effect is very beautiful but impossible to represent on paper from the extreme delicacy of the shadows and at the same time the perfect definition and precision of the outlines  towards the head of the lake its bed was quite dry and gravelly and the river formed a broad delta over it the terraces here were perhaps 100 feet above its level those at the lower end not nearly so much beyond the lake the river became again a violent torrent rushing in a deep chasm till we arrived at the fork of the valley where we once more met with numerous dry lakebeds with terraces high up on the mountain sides  in the afternoon we reached the village of yangma a miserable collection of 200 to 300 stone huts nestling under the steep southeast flank of a lofty flattopped terrace laden with gigantic glacial boulders and projecting southward from a snowy mountain which divides the valley we encamped on the flat under the village amongst some stone dykes enclosing cultivated fields one arm of the valley runs hence nne amongst snowy mountains and appeared quite full of moraines the other or continuation of the yangma runs wnw and leads to the kanglachem pass  near our camp of which the elevation was 13500 feet radishes barley wheat potatos and turnips were cultivated as summer crops and we even saw some on the top of the terrace 400 feet above our camp or nearly 14000 feet above the sea these were grown in small fields cleared of stones and protected by dykes  the scenery though dismal no juniper even attaining this elevation was full of interest and grandeur from the number and variety of snowy peaks and glaciers all around the elevated horizon the ancient lakebeds now green or brown with scanty vegetation the vast moraines the ridges of glacial debris the flat terraces marking as it were with parallel roads the bluff sides of the mountains the enormous boulders perched upon them and strewed everywhere around the little boodhist monuments of quaint picturesque shapes decorated with poles and banners the manycoloured dresses of the people the brilliant blue of the cloudless heaven by day the depth of its blackness by night heightened by the light of the stars that blaze and twinkle with a lustre unknown in less lofty regions all these were subjects for contemplation rendered more impressive by the stillness of the atmosphere and the silence that reigned around the village seemed buried in repose throughout the day the inhabitants had already hybernated their crops were stored the curd made and dried the passes closed the soil frozen the winters stock of fuel housed and the people had retired into the caverns of their half subterranean houses to sleep spin wool and think of boodh if of anything at all the dead long winter through the yaks alone can find anything to do so long as any vegetation remains they roam and eat it still yielding milk which the women take morning and evening when their shrill whistle and cries are heard for a few minutes as they call the grunting animals no other sounds save the harsh roar and hollow echo of the falling rock glacier or snowbed disturbed the perfect silence of the day or night snow covers the ground at yangma from december till april and the falls are said to be very heavy at times amounting to 12 feet in depth  i had taken three days food to yangma and stayed there as long as it lasted the rest of my provisions i had left below the first moraine where a lateral valley leads east over the nango pass to the kambachen valley which lay on the route back to sikkim  i was premature in complaining of my wallanchoon tents those provided for me at yangma being infinitely worse mere rags around which i piled sods as a defence from the insidious piercing nightwind that descended from the northern glaciers in calm but most keen breezes there was no food to be procured in the village except a little watery milk and a few small watery potatos the latter have only very recently been introduced amongst the tibetans from the english garden at the nepalese capital i believe and their culture has not spread in these regions further east than kinchinjunga but they will very soon penetrate into tibet from dorjiling or eastward from nepal my private stock of provisions consisting chiefly of preserved meats from my kind friend mr hodgsonhad fallen very low and i here found to my dismay that of four remaining twopound cases provided as meat three contained prunes and one dindon aux truffes never did luxuries come more inopportunely however the greasy french viand served for many a future meal as sauce to help me to bolt my rice and according to the theory of chemists to supply animal heat in these frigid regions as for my people they were not accustomed to much animal food two pounds of rice with ghee and chilis forming their common diet under cold and fatigue the poorer tibetans especially who undergo great privation and toil live almost wholly on barleymeal with tea and a very little butter and salt this is not only the case with those amongst whom i mixed so much but is also mentioned by mm huc and gabet as having been observed by them in other parts of tibet  on the 1st of december i visited the village and terrace and proceeded to the head of the yangma valley in order to ascend the kanglachem pass as far as practicable the houses are low built of stone of no particular shape and are clustered in groups against the steep face of the terrace filthy lanes wind amongst them so narrow that if you are not too tall you look into the slits of windows on either hand by turning your head and feel the noisome warm air in whiffs against your face glacial boulders lie scattered throughout the village around and beneath the clusters of houses from which it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the native rock i entered one house by a narrow low door through walls four feet thick and found myself in an apartment full of wool juniperwood and dried dung for fuel no one lived in the lower story which was quite dark and as i stood in it my head was in the upper to which i ascended by a notched pole like that in the picture of a kamschatk house in cooks voyage and went into a small low room the inmates looked half asleep they were intolerably indolent and filthy and were employed in spinning wool and smoking a hole in the wall of the upper apartment led me on to the stone roof of the neighbouring house from which i passed to the top of a glacial boulder descending thence by rude steps to the narrow alley wishing to see as much as i could i was led on a winding course through in and out and over the tops of the houses of the village which alternately reminded me of a stone quarry or gravel pit and gipsies living in old limekilns and of all sorts of odd places that are turned to account as human habitations  from the village i ascended to the top of the terrace which is a perfectly level sandy triangular plain pointing down the valley at the fork of the latter and abutting against the flank of a steep rocky snowtopped mountain  illustrationdiagram of the glacial terraces at the fork of the yanga valley  to the northward its length is probably half a mile from north to south but it runs for two miles westward up the valley gradually contracting the surface though level is very uneven being worn into hollows and presenting ridges and hillocks of blown sand and gravel with small black tufts of rhododendron enormous boulders of gneiss and granite were scattered over the surface one of the ordinary size which i measured was seventy feet in girth and fifteen feet above the ground into which it had partly sunk from the southern pointed end i took sketches of the opposite flanks of the valleys east and west the river was about 400 feet below me and flowed in a little flat lakebed other terraces skirted it cut out as it were from the side of that i was on on the opposite flank of the valley were several superimposed terraces of which the highest appeared to tally with the level i occupied and the lowest was raised very little above the river none were continuous for any distance but the upper one in particular could be most conspicuously traced up and down the main valley whilst on looking across to the eastern valley a much higher but less distinctly marked one appeared on it the road to the pass lay westnorthwest up the north bank of the yangma river on the great terrace for two miles it was nearly level along the gradually narrowing shelf at times dipping into the steep gulleys formed by lateral torrents from the mountains and as the terrace disappeared or melted as it were into the rising floor of the valley the path descended upon the lower and smaller shelf  we came suddenly upon a flock of gigantic wild sheep feeding on scanty tufts of dried sedge and grass there were twentyfive of these enormous animals of whose dimensions the term sheep gives no idea they are very longlegged stand as high as a calf and have immense horns so large that the fox is said to take up his abode in their hollows when detached and bleaching on the barren mountains of tibet though very wild i am sure i could easily have killed a couple had i had my gun but i had found it necessary to reduce my party so uncompromisingly that i could not afford a man both for my gun and instruments and had sent the former back to dorjiling with mr hodgsons birdstuffers who had broken one of theirs travelling without firearms sounds strange in india but in these regions animal life is very rare game is only procured with much hunting and trouble and to come within shot of a flock of wild sheep was a contingency i never contemplated considering how very short we were of any food and quite out of animal diet i could not but bitterly regret the want of a gun but consoled myself by reflecting that the instruments were still more urgently required to enable me to survey this extremely interesting valley as it was the great beasts trotted off and turned to tantalise me by grazing within an easy stalking distance we saw several other flocks of thirty to forty during the day but never either on this or any future occasion within shot the ovis ammon of pallas stands from four to five feet high and measures seven feet from nose to tail it is quite a tibetan animal and is seldom seen below 14000 feet except when driven lower by snow and i have seen it as high as 18000 feet the same animal i believe is found in siberia and is allied to the bighorn of north america  soon after descending to the bed of the valley which is broad and open we came on a second dry lakebed a mile long with shelving banks all round heavily snowed on the shaded side the river was divided into many arms and meandered over it and a fine glacierbound valley opened into it from the south there were no boulders on its surface which was pebbly with tufts of grass and creeping tamarisk on the banks i observed much granite with large mica crystals hornstone tourmaline and stratified quartz with granite veins parallel to the foliation or lamination  a rather steep ascent of a mile through a contracted part of the valley led to another and smaller lakebed a quarter of a mile long and 100 yards broad covered with patches of snow and having no lateral valley opening into it it faced the now stupendous masses of snow and ice which filled the upper part of the yangma valley this lakebed elevation 15186 feet was strewed with enormous boulders a rude stone hut stood near it where we halted for a few minutes at 1 pm when the temperature was 422 degrees while the dewpoint was only 207 degrees this indicates a very dry state of the air the saturationpoint being 0133 degrees whereas at the same hour at calcutta it was 0559 degrees at the same time the black bulb thermometer fully exposed on the snow rose 54 degrees above the air and the photometer gave 10572 though the suns power was so great there was however no appearance of the snow melting evaporation proceeding with too great rapidity  illustrationkanglachem pass  enormous piles of gravel and sand had descended upon the upper end of this lakebed forming shelves terraces and curving ridges apparently consolidated by ice and covered in many places with snow following the stream we soon came to an immense moraine which blocked up the valley formed of angular boulders some of which were fifty feet high respiration had been difficult for some time and the guide we had taken from the village said we were some hours from the top of the pass and could get but a little way further we however proceeded plunging through the snow till on cresting the moraine a stupendous scene presented itself a gulf of moraines and enormous ridges of debris lay at our feet girdled by an amphitheatre of towering snowclad peaks rising to 17000 and 18000 feet all around black scarped precipices rose on every side deep snowbeds and blue glaciers rolled down every gulley converging in the hollow below and from each transporting its own materials there ensued a complication of moraines that presented no order to the eye in spite of their mutual interference however each had raised a ridge of debris or moraine parallel to itself  we descended with great difficulty through the soft snow that covered the moraine to the bed of this gulf of snow and glaciers and halted by an enormous stone above the bed of a little lake which was snowed all over but surrounded by two superimposed level terraces with sharply defined edges the moraine formed a barrier to its now frozen waters and it appeared to receive the drainage of many glaciers which filtered through their gravelly ridges and moraines  we could make no further progress the pass lay at the distance of several hours march up a valley to the north down which the glacier must have rolled that had deposited this great moraine the pass had been closed since october it being very lofty and the head of this valley was far more snowy than that at wallanchoon we halted in the snow from 3 to 4 pm during which time i again took angles and observations the height of this spot called pabuk is 16038 feet whence the pass is probably considerably over 17000 feet for there was a steep ascent beyond our position the sun sank at 3 pm and the thermometer immediately fell from 35 degrees to 3075 degrees at 4 oclock to 295 degrees the average dewpoint was 163 degrees and dryness 055 weight of vapour in a cubic foot 133 grains  after fixing in my note and sketch books the principal features of this sublime scene we returned down the valley the distance to our camp being fully eight miles night overtook us before we got halfway but a two days old moon guided us perfectly a remarkable instance of the clearness of the atmosphere at these great elevations lassitude giddiness and headache came on as our exertions increased and took away the pleasure i should otherwise have felt in contemplating by moonlight the varied phenomena which seemed to crowd upon the restless imagination in the different forms of mountain glacier moraine lake boulder and terrace happily i had noted everything on my way up and left nothing intentionally to be done on returning in making such excursions as this it is above all things desirable to seize and book every object worth noticing on the way out i always carried my notebook and pencil tied to my jacket pocket and generally walked with them in my hand it is impossible to begin observing too soon or to observe too much if the excursion is long little is ever done on the way home the bodily powers being mechanically exerted the mind seeks repose and being fevered through overexertion it can endure no train of thought or be brought to bear on a subject  during my stay at yangma the thermometer never rose to 50 degrees it fell to 1475 degrees at night the ground was frozen for several inches below the surface but at two feet depth its temperature was 375 degrees the black bulb thermometer rose on one occasion 84 degrees above the surrounding air before leaving i measured by angles and a baseline the elevations of the great villageterrace above the river and that of a loftier one on the west flank of the main valley the former was about 400 and the latter 700 feet  considering this latter as the upper terrace and concluding that it marks a water level it is not very difficult to account for its origin there is every reason to suppose that the flanks of the valley were once covered to the elevation of the upper terrace with an enormous accumulation of debris though it does not follow that the whole valley was filled by iceaction to the same depth the effect of glaciers being to deposit moraines between themselves and the sides of the valley they fill as also to push forward similar accumulations glaciers from each valley meeting at the fork where their depth would be 700 feet of ice would both deposit the necessary accumulation along the flanks of the great valley and also throw a barrier across it the melting waters of such glaciers would accumulate in lakes confined by the frozen earth between the moraines and mountains such lakes though on a small scale are found at the terminations and sides of existing glaciers and are surrounded by terraces of shingle and debris these terraces being laid bare by the sudden drainage of the lakes during seasons of unusual warmth to explain the phenomena of the yangma valley it may be necessary to demand larger lakes and deeper accumulations of debris than are now familiar to us but the proofs of glaciers having once descended to from 8000 to 10000 feet in every sikkim and east nepal valley communicating with mountains above 16000 feet elevation are overwhelming and the glaciers must in some cases have been fully forty miles long and 500 feet in depth the absence of any remains of a moraine or of blocks of rock in the valley below the fork is i believe the only apparent objection to this theory but as i shall elsewhere have occasion to observe the magnitude of the moraines bears no fixed proportion to that of the glacier and at pabuk the steep ridges of debris which were heaped up 200 feet high were far more striking than the more usual form of moraine  on my way up to yangma i had rudely plotted the valley and selected prominent positions for improving my plan on my return these i now made use of taking bearings with the azimuth compass and angles by means of a pocket sextant the result of my runningsurvey of the whole valley from 10000 to 16000 feet i have given along with a sketchmap of my routes in india which accompanies this volume  illustrationskulls of ovis ammon    chapter xi

or nango pass over the south shoulder of the mountain of that name it is situated on a ridge dividing the yangma river from that of kambachen which latter falls into the tambur opposite lelyp  the road crosses the yangma which is about fifteen feet wide and immediately ascends steeply to the southeast over a rocky moraine clothed with a dense thicket of rhododendrons mountainash maples pine birch juniper etc the ground was covered with silvery flakes of birch bark and that of rhododendron hodgsoni which is as delicate as tissuepaper and of a pale fleshcolour i had never before met with this species and was astonished at the beauty of its foliage which was of a beautiful bright green with leaves sixteen inches long  beyond the region of trees and large shrubs the alpine rhododendrons filled the broken surface of the valley growing with potentilla honeysuckle polygonum and dwarf juniper the peak of nango seemed to tower over the gorge rising behind some black splintered rocky cliffs sprinkled with snow narrow defiles opened up through these cliffs to blue glaciers and their mouths were invariably closed by beds of shingly moraines curving outwards from either flank in concentric ridges  towards the base of the peak at about 14000 feet the scenery is very grand a great moraine rises suddenly to the northwest under the principal mass of snow and ice and barren slopes of gravel descend from it on either side are rugged precipices the ground is bare and stony with patches of brown grass and on looking back the valley appears very steep to the first shrubby vegetation of dark green rhododendrons bristling with ugly stunted pines  we followed a valley to the southeast so as to turn the flank of the peak the path lying over beds of october snow at 14000 feet and over plashy ground from its melting sometimes our way lay close to the black precipices on our right under which the snow was deep and we dragged ourselves along grasping every prominence of the rock with our numbed fingers granite appeared in large veins in the crumpled gneiss at a great elevation in its most beautiful and looselycrystallised form of pearly white prisms of felspar glassy quartz and milkwhite flat plates of mica with occasionally large crystals of tourmaline garnets were very frequent in the gneiss near the granite veins small rushes grasses and sedges formed the remaining vegetation amongst which were the withered stalks of gentians sedum arenaria silene and many composite plants  at a little below 15000 feet we reached enormous flat beds of snow which were said to be perpetual but covered deeply with the october fall they were continuous and like all the snow i saw at this season the surface was honeycombed into thin plates dipping north at a high angle the intervening fissures were about six inches deep a thick mist here overtook us and this with the great difficulty of picking our way rendered the ascent very fatiguing being sanguine about obtaining a good view i found it almost impossible to keep my temper under the aggravations of pain in the forehead lassitude oppression of breathing a dense drizzling fog a keen cold wind a slippery footing where i was stumbling at every few steps and icycold wet feet hands and eyelids the latter odd as it sounds i found a very disagreeable accompaniment of continued raw cold wind  after an hour and a halfs toilsome ascent during which we made but little progress we reached the crest crossing a broad shelf of snow between two rocky eminences the ridge was unsnowed a little way down the east flank this was in a great measure due to the eastern exposure being the more sunny to the prevalence of the warm and melting southeast winds that blow up the deep kambachen valley and to the fact that the great snowbeds on the west side are drifted accumulations such enormous beds of snow in depressions or on gentle slopes are generally adopted as indicating the lower limit of perpetual snow they are however winter accumulations due mainly to eddies of wind of far more snow than can be melted in the following summer being hence perennial in the ordinary sense of the word they pass into the state of glacier ice and obeying the laws that govern the motions of a viscous fluid so admirably elucidated by forbes travels in the alps they flow downwards a careful examination of those great beds of snow in the alps from whose position the mean lower level of perpetual snow in that latitude is deduced has convinced me that these are mainly due to accumulations of this kind and that the true limit of perpetual snow or that point where all that falls melts is much higher than it is usually supposed to be  the mist cleared off and i had a partial though limited view to the north the blue iceclad peak of nango was still 2000 feet above us its snowy mantle falling in great sweeps and curves into glacierbound valleys over which the ice streamed out of sight bounded by black aiguilles of gneiss the yangma valley was quite hidden but to the eastward the view across the stupendous gorge of the kambachen 5000 feet below to the waste of snow ice and rock piled in confusion along the top of the range of junnoo and choonjerma parallel to this but higher was very grand indeed this we were to cross in two days and its appearance was such that our guide doubted the possibility of our doing it a third and fourth mountain mass unseen lay beyond this between us and sikkim divided by valleys as deep as those of yangma and kambachen  having hung up my instruments i ascended a few hundred feet to some naked rocks to the northward they were of muchcrumpled and dislocated gneiss thrown up at a very high angle and striking northwest chlorite schist and quartz in thin beds alternated with the gneiss and veins of granite and quartz were injected through them  it fell calm when the distance to which the voice was carried was very remarkable i could distinctly hear every word spoken 300 to 400 yards off and did not raise my voice when i asked one of the men to bring me a hammer  the few plants about were generally small tufted arenarias and woolly compositae with a thickrooted umbellifer that spread its short fleshy leaves and branches flat on the ground the root was very aromatic but wedged close in the rock the temperature at 4 pm was 23 degrees and bitterly cold the elevation 15770 feet dewpoint 16 degrees the air was not very dry saturationpoint 0670 degrees whereas at calcutta it was 0498 degrees at the same hour  the descent was to a broad open valley into which the flank of nango dipped in tremendous precipices which reared their heads in splintered snowy peaks at their bases were shoots of debris fully 700 feet high sloping at a steep angle enormous masses of rock detached by the action of the frost and ice from the crags were scattered over the bottom of the valley they had been precipitated from above and gaining impetus in their descent bad been hurled to almost inconceivable distances from the parent cliff all were of a very white finegrained crystallised granite full of small veins of the same rock still more finely crystallised the weathered surface of each block was black and covered with moss and lichens the others beautifully white with clean sharpfractured edges the material of which they were composed was so hard that i found it difficult to detach a specimen  darkness had already come on and the coolies being far behind we encamped by the light of the moon shining through a thin fog where we first found dwarfjuniper for fuel at 13500 feet a little sleet fell during the night which was tolerably fine and not very cold the minimum thermometer indicating 145 degrees  having no tentpoles i had some difficulty in getting my blankets arranged as a shelter which was done by making them slant from the side of a boulder on the top of which one end was kept by heavy stones under this roof i laid my bed on a mass of rhododendron and junipertwigs the men did the same against other boulders and lighting a huge fire opposite the mouth of my groundnest i sat crosslegged on the bed to eat my supper my face scorching and my back freezing rice boiled with a few ounces of greasy dindon aux truffes was now my daily dinner with chilivinegar and tea and i used to relish it keenly this finished i smoked a cigar and wrote up my journal in short intervals between warming myself by the light of the fire took observations by means of a darklantern and when all this was accomplished i went to roost  december 5on looking out this morning it was with a feeling of awe that i gazed at the stupendous icecrowned precipices that shot up to the summit of nango their flanks spotted white at the places whence the gigantic masses with which i was surrounded had fallen thence my eye wandered down their black faces to the slope of debris at the bottom thus tracing the course which had probably been taken by that rock under whose shelter i had passed the previous night  meepo the lepcha sent by the rajah had snared a couple of beautiful pheasants one of which i skinned and ate for breakfast it is a small bird common above 12000 feet but very wild the male has two to five spurs on each of its legs according to its age the general colour is greenish with a broad scarlet patch surrounding the eye the nepalese name is khalidge the crop was distended with juniper berries of which the flesh tasted strongly and it was the very hardest toughest bird i ever did eat  we descended at first through rhododendron and juniper then through black silverfir abies webbiana and below that near the river we came to the himalayan larch a tree quite unknown except from a notice in the journals of mr griffith who found it in bhotan it is a small tree twenty to forty feet high perfectly similar in general characters to a european larch but with larger cones which are erect upon the very long pensile whiplike branches its leavesnow redwere falling and covering the rocky ground on which it grew scattered amongst other trees it is called saar by the lepchas and cishimalayan tibetans and boargasella by the nepalese who say it is found as far west as the heads of the cosi river it does not inhabit central or west nepal nor the northwest himalaya the distribution of the himalayan pines is very remarkable the deodar has not been seen east of nepal nor the pinus gerardiana cupressus torulosa or juniperus communis on the other hand podocarpus is confined to the east of katmandoo abies brunoniana does not occur west of the gogra nor the larch west of the cosi nor funereal cypress an introduced plant however west of the teesta in sikkim of the twelve juniper 3 yew abies webbiana brunoniana and smithiana larch pinus excelsa and longifolia and podocarpus neriifolia sikkim and bhotan coniferae including yew junipers and podocarpus eight are common to the northwest himalaya west of nepal and four larch cupressus funebris podocarpus neriifolia abies brunoniana are not of the thirteen natives of the northwest provinces again only five a juniper the european communis deodar possibly only a variety of the cedar of lebanon and of mount atlas pinus gerardiana p excelsa and crupressus torulosa are not found in sikkim and i have given their names below because they show how european the absent ones are either specifically or in affinity i have stated that the deodar is possibly a variety of the cedar of lebanon this is now a prevalent opinion which is strengthened by the fact that so many more himalayan plants are now ascertained to be european than had been supposed before they were compared with european specimens such are the yew juniperus communis berberis vulgaris quercus ballota populus alba and euphratica etc the cones of the deodar are identical with those of the cedar of lebanon the deodar has generally longer and more pale bluish leaves and weeping branches since writing the above i have seen in the magnificent pinetum at dropmore noble cedars with the length and hue of leaf and the pensile branches of the deodar and far more beautiful than that is and as unlike the common lebanon cedar as possible when it is considered from how very few wild trees and these said to be exactly alike the many dissimilar varieties of the c libani have been derived the probability of this the cedar of algiers and of the himalayas deodar being all forms of one species is greatly increased we cannot presume to judge from the few cedars which still remain what the habit and appearance of the tree may have been when it covered the slopes of libanus and seeing how very variable coniferae are in habit we may assume that its surviving specimens give us no information on this head should all three prove one it will materially enlarge our ideas of the distribution and variation of species the botanist will insist that the typical form of cedar is that which retains its characters best over the greatest area namely the deodar in which case the prejudice of the ignorant and the preconceived ideas of the naturalist must yield to the fact that the old familiar cedar of lebanon is an unusual variety of the himalayan deodar but these characters seem to be unusually developed in our gardens for several gentlemen well acquainted with the deodar at simla when asked to point it out in the kew gardens have indicated the cedar of lebanon and when shown the deodar declare that they never saw that plant in the himalaya  at the bottom of the valley we turned up the stream and passing the tassichooding convents these were built by the sikkim people when the eastern valleys of nepal belonged to the sikkim rajah and temple crossed the riverwhich was a furious torrent about twelve yards wideto the village of kambachen on a flat terrace a few feet above the stream there were about a dozen houses of wood plastered with mud and dung scattered over a grassy plain of a few acres fenced in as were also a few fields with stone dykes the only cultivation consists of radishes potatos and barley no wheat is grown the climate being said to be too cold for it by which is probably meant that it is foggythe elevation 11380 feet being 2000 feet less than that of yangma village and the temperature therefore 6 degrees to 7 degrees warmer but of all the mountain gorges i have ever visited this is by far the wildest grandest and most gloomy and that man should hybernate here is indeed extraordinary for there is no route up the valley and all communication with lelyp which i passed on the tambur on the 21st nov see chapter ix two marches down the river is cut off in winter when the houses are buried in snow and drifts fifteen feet deep are said to be common standing on the little flat of kambachen precipices with inaccessible patches of pine wood appeared to the west towering over head while across the narrow valley wilder and less wooded crags rose in broken ridges to the glaciers of nango up the valley the view was cut off by bluff cliffs whilst down it the scene was most remarkable enormous black roundbacked moraines rose tier above tier from a flat lakebed apparently hemming in the river between the lofty precipices on the east flank of the valley these had all been deposited at the mouth of a lateral valley opening just below the village and descending from junnoo a mountain of 25312 feet elevation and one of the grandest of the kinchinjunga group whose topthough only five miles distant in a straight linerises 13932 feet this is one of the most sudden slopes in this part of the himalaya the angle between the top of junnoo and kambachen being 2786 feet per mile or 1 in 18 the slope from the top of mont blanc to the chamouni valley is 2464 feet per mile or 1 in 21 that from monte rosa top to macugnaga greatly exceeds either above the village few facts show more decidedly the extraordinary steepness and depth of the kambachen valley near the village which though nearly 11400 feet above the sea lies between two mountains only eight miles apart the one 25312 feet high the other nango 19000 feet  the villagers received us very kindly and furnished us with a guide for the choonjerma pass leading to the yalloong valley the most easterly in nepal but he recommended our not attempting any part of the ascent till the morrow as it was past 1 pm and we should find no campingground for half the way up the villagers gave us the leg of a musk deer and some red potatos about as big as walnutsall they could spare from their winterstock with this scanty addition to our stores we started down the valley for a few miles alternately along flat lakebeds and over moraines till we crossed the stream from the lateral valley and ascending a little camped on its bank at 11400 feet elevation  in the afternoon i botanized amongst the moraines which were very numerous and had been thrown down at rightangles to the main valley which latter being here very narrow and bounded by lofty precipices must have stopped the parent glaciers and effected the heaping of some of these moraines to at least 1000 feet above the river the general features were modifications of those seen in the yangma valley but contracted into a much smaller space  the moraines were all accumulated in a sort of delta through which the lateral river debouched into the kambachen and were all deposited more or less parallel to the course of the lateral valley but curving outwards from its mouth the villageflat or terrace continued level to the first moraine which had been thrown down on the upper or north side of the lateral valley on whose and curving steep flanks it abutted and curving outwards seemed to encircle the villageflat on the south and west where it dipped into the river this was crossed at the height of about 100 feet by a stony path leading to the bed of the rapid torrent flowing through shingle and boulders beyond which was another moraine 250 feet high and parallel to it a third gigantic one  ascending the great moraine at a place where it overhung the main river i had a good coupaoeil of the whole the view southeast up the glacial valleyrepresented in the accompanying cutto the snowy peaks south of junnoo was particularly grand and most interesting from the precision with which one great distant existing glacier was marked by two waving parallel lines of lateral moraines which formed as it were a vast raised gutter or channel ascending from perhaps 16000 feet elevation till it was hidden behind a spur in the valley with a telescope i could descry many similar smaller glaciers with huge accumulations of shingle at their terminations but this great one was beautifully seen by the naked eye and formed a very curious feature in the landscape  illustrationancient moraines in the rambachen valley   between the moraines near my tent the soil was perfectly level and consisted of little lakebeds strewn with gigantic boulders and covered with hard turf of grass and sedge and little bushes of dwarf rhododendron and prostrate juniper as trim as if they had been clipped altogether these formed the most picturesque little nooks it was possible to conceive and they exhibited the withered remains of so many kinds of primrose gentian anemone potentilla orchis saxifrage parnassia campanula and pedicularis that in summer they must be perfect gardens of wild flowers around each plot of a few acres was the grand icetransported girdle of stupendous rocks many from 50 to 100 feet long crested with black tabularbranched silver firs conical deep green treejunipers and feathery larches whilst amongst the blocks grew a profusion of round masses of evergreen rhododendron bushes beyond were stupendous frowning cliffs beneath which the river roared like thunder and looking up the glacial valley the setting sun was bathing the expanse of snow in the most delicate changing tints pink amber and gold  the boulders forming the moraine were so enormous and angular that i had great difficulty in ascending it i saw some pheasants feeding on the black berries of the juniper but where the large rhododendrons grew amongst the rocks i found it impossible to penetrate the largest of the moraines is piled to upwards of 1000 feet against the south flank of the lateral valley and stretched far up it beyond my camp which was in a grove of silver firs a large flock of sheep and goats laden with salt overtook us here on their route from wallanchoon to yalloong the sheep i observed to feed on the rhododendron thomsoni and campylocarpum on the roots of one of the latter species a parasitical broomrape orobanche grew abundantly and about the moraines were more mosses lichens etc than i have elsewhere seen in the loftier himalaya encouraged no doubt by the dampness of this grand mountain gorge which is so hemmed in that the sun never reaches it until four or five hours after it has gilded the overhanging peaks  december 5the morning was bright and clear and we left early for the choonjerma pass i had hoped the route would be up the magnificent glaciergirdled valley in which we had encamped but it lay up another considerably south of it and to which we crossed ascending the rocky moraine in the clefts of which grew abundance of a common scotch fern cryptogramma crispa  the clouds early commenced gathering and it was curious to watch their rapid formation in coalescing streaks which became first cirrhi and then stratus being apparently continually added to from below by the moisturebringing southerly wind ascending a lofty spur 1000 feet above the valley against which the moraine was banked i found it to be a distinct anticlinal axis the pass bearing northwest and the valley we had descended on the previous day rose immediately over the curved strata of quartz topped by the glaciercrowned mountain of nango with four glaciers descending from its perpetual snows the stupendous cliffs on its flanks under which i had camped on the previous night were very grand but not more so than those which dipped into the chasm of the kambachen below looking up the valley of the latter was another wilderness of ice full of enormous moraines round the bases of which the river wound  ascending we reached an open grassy valley and overtook the tibetans who had preceded us and who had halted here to feed their sheep a goodlooking girl of the party came to ask me for medicine for her husbands eyes which had suffered from snowblindness she brought me a present of snuff and carried a little child stark naked yet warm from the powerful rays of the sun at nearly 14000 feet elevation in december i prescribed for the man and gave the mother a bright farthing to hang round the childs neck which delighted the party my watch was only wondered at but a little spring measuringtape that rolled itself up struck them dumb and when i threw it on the ground with the tape out the mother shrieked and ran away while the little savage howled after her  above the path up the ascent was blocked with snowbeds and for several miles we alternately scrambled among rocks and over slippery slopes to the top of the first ridge there being two to cross the first consisted of a ridge of rocks running east and west from a superb sweep of snowy mountains to the northwest which presented a chaotic scene of blue glacial ice and white snow through which splintered rocks and beetling crags thrust their black heads the view into the kambachen gorge was magnificent though it did not reveal the very bottom of the valley and its moraines the black precipices of its opposite flank seemed to rise to the glaciers of nango foreshortened into snowcapped precipices 5000 feet high amongst which lay the kambachen pass bearing northwest by north lower down the valley appeared a broad flat called jubla a haltingplace one stage below the village of kambachen on the road to lelyp on the tambur it must be a remarkable geological as well as natural feature for it appeared to jut abruptly and quite horizontally from the black cliffs of the valley  looking north the conical head of junnoo was just scattering the mists from its snowy shoulders and standing forth to view the most magnificent spectacle i ever beheld it was quite close to me bearing northeast by east and subtending an angle of 12 degrees 23 and is much the steepest and most conical of all the peaks of these regions from whichever side it is viewed it rises 9000 feet above the general mountain mass of 16000 feet elevation towering like a blunt cone with a short saddle on one side that dips in a steep cliff it appeared as if uniformly snowed from its rocks above 20000 feet like those of kinchinjunga being of white granite and not contrasting with the snow whether the top is stratified or not i cannot tell but waving parallel lines are very conspicuous near it as shown in the accompanying view the appearance of mont cervin from the riffelberg much reminded me of that of junnoo from the choonjerma pass the former bearing the same relation to monte rosa that the latter does to kinchinjunga junnoo though incomparably the more stupendous mass not only rising 10000 feat higher above the sea but towering 4000 feet higher above the ridge on which it is supported is not nearly so remarkable in outline so sharp or so peaked as is mount cervin it is a very much grander but far less picturesque object the whiteness of the sides of junnoo adds also greatly to its apparent altitude while the strong relief in which the black cliffs of mont cervin protrude through its snowy mantle greatly diminish both its apparent height and distance  illustrationjunnoo 24000 ft from choonjerma pass 16000 ft east nepal  looking south as evening drew on another wonderful spectacle presented itself similar to that which i described at sakkiazung but displayed here on an inconceivably grander scale with all the effects exaggerated i saw a sea of mist floating 3000 feet beneath me just below the upper level of the black pines the magnificent spurs of the snowy range which i had crossed rising out of it in rugged grandeur as promontories and peninsulas between which the misty ocean seemed to finger up like the fiords of norway or the saltwater lochs of the west of scotland whilst islets tailed off from the promontories rising here and there out of the deceptive elements i was so high above this mist that it had not the billowy appearance i saw before but was a calm unruffled ocean boundless to the south and west where the horizon overarched it a little to the north of west i discerned the most lofty group of mountains in nepal called tsungau by the bhoteeas junnoo is called kumbokurma by the hillmen of nepal mentioned at chapter viii beyond kinchinjurga which i believe are on the west flank of the great valley through which the arun river enters nepal from tibet they were very distant and subtended so small an angle that i could not measure them with the sextant and artificial horizon their height judging from the quantity of snow must be prodigious  from 4 to 5 pm the temperature was 24 degrees with a very cold wind the elevation by the barometer was 15260 feet and the dewpoint 105 degrees giving the humidity 0610 and the amount of vapour 109 grains in a cubic foot of air the same elements at calcutta at the same hour being thermometer 665 degrees dewpoint 605 degrees humidity 0840 and weight of vapour 59 grains  i waited for an hour examining the rocks about the pass till the coolies should come up but saw nothing worthy of remark the natural history and geology being identical with those of kambachen pass i then bade adieu to the sublime and majestic peak of junnoo thence we continued at nearly the same level for about four miles dipping into the broad head of a snowy valley and ascending to the second pass which lay to the southeast  on the left i passed a very curious isolated pillar of rock amongst the wild crags to the northeast whose bases we skirted it resembles the capuchin on the shoulder of mont blanc as seen from the jardin evening overtook us while still on the snow near the last ascent as the sun declined the snow at our feet reflected the most exquisitely delicate peachbloom hue and looking west from the top of the pass the scenery was gorgeous beyond description for the sun was just plunging into a sea of mist amongst some cirrhi and stratus all in a blaze of the ruddiest coppery hue as it sank the nepal peaks to the right assumed more definite darker and gigantic forms and floods of light shot across the misty ocean bathing the landscape around me in the most wonderful and indescribable changing tints as the luminary was vanishing the whole horizon glowed like copper run from a smelting furnace and when it had quite disappeared the little inequalities of the ragged edges of the mist were lighted up and shone like a row of volcanos in the far distance i have never before or since seen anything which for sublimity beauty and marvellous effects could compare with what i gazed on that evening from choonjerma pass in some of turners pictures i have recognized similar effects caught and fixed by a marvellous effort of genius such are the fleeting hues over the ice in his whalers and the ruddy fire in his wind steam and rain which one almost fears to touch dissolving views give some idea of the magic creation and dispersion of the effects but any combination of science and art can no more recall the scene than it can the feelings of awe that crept over me during the hour i spent in solitude amongst these stupendous mountains  the moon guided us on our descent which was to the south obliquely into the yalloong valley i was very uneasy about the coolies who were far behind and some of them had been frostbitten in crossing the kambachen pass still i thought the best thing was to push on and light large fires at the first juniper we should reach the change on passing from off the snow to the dark earth and rock was so bewildering that i had great difficulty in picking my way suddenly we came on a flat with a small tarn whose waters gleamed illusively in the pale moonlight the opposite flanks of the valley were so well reflected on its gloomy surface that we were at once brought to a standstill on its banks it looked like a chasm and whether to jump across it or go down it or along it was the question so deceptive was the spectral landscape its true nature was however soon discovered and we proceeded round it descending of course there was no path and after some perplexity amongst rocks and ravines we reached the upper limit of wood and halted by some bleached junipertrees which were soon converted into blazing fires  i wandered away from my party to listen for the voices of the men who had lingered behind about whom i was still more anxious from the very great difficulty they would encounter if as we did they should get off the path the moon was shining clearly in the black heavens and its bright light with the pale glare of the surrounding snow obscured the milky way and all the smaller stars whilst the planets appeared to glow with broader orbs than elsewhere and the great stars flashed steadily and periodically  deep black chasms seemed to yawn below and cliffs rose on all sides except down the valley where looking across the yalloong river a steep range of mountains rose seamed with torrents that were just visible like threads of silver coursing down broad landslips it was a dead calm and nothing broke the awful silence but the low hoarse murmur of many torrents whose mingled voices rose and fell as if with the pulsations of the atmosphere the undulations of which appeared thus to be marked by the ear alone sometimes it was the faintest possible murmur and then it rose swelling and filling the air with sound the effect was that of being raised from the earths surface and again lowered to it or that of waters advancing and retiring in such scenes and with such accompaniments the mind wanders from the real to the ideal the larger and brighter lamps of heaven lead us to imagine that we have risen from the surface of our globe and are floating through the regions of space and that the ceaseless murmur of the waters is the music of the spheres  contemplation amid such soothing sounds and impressive scenes is very seductive and withal very dangerous for the temperature was at freezingpoint my feet and legs were wet through and it was well that i was soon roused from my reveries by the monosyllabic exclamations of my coolies they were quite knocked up and came along grunting and halting every minute to rest by supporting their loads still hanging to their backs on their stout staves i had still one bottle of brandy left with which to splice the main brace it had been repeatedly begged for in vain and being no longer expected was received with unfeigned joy fortunately with these people a little spirits goes a long way and i kept half for future emergencies  we camped at 13290 feet the air was calm and mild to the feeling though the temperature fell to 2275 degrees on the following morning we saw two muskdeer there are two species of muskdeer in the himalaya besides the tibetan kind which appears identical with the siberian animal originally described by pallas called kosturah by the mountaineers the musk which hangs in a pouch near the navel of the male is the wellknown object of traffic with bengal this creature ranges between 8000 and 13000 feet on the himalaya often scenting the air for many hundred yards it is a pretty grey animal the size of a roebuck and something resembling it with coarse fur short horns and two projecting teeth from the upper jaw said to be used in rooting up the aromatic herbs from which the bhoteeas believe that it derives the odour of musk this i much doubt because the animal never frequents those very lofty regions where the herbs supposed to provide the scent are found nor have i ever seen signs of any having been so rooted up the delphinium glaciale smells strongly and disagreeably of musk but it is one of the most alpine plants in the world growing at an elevation of 17000 feet far above the limits of the kosturah the female and young male are very good eating much better than any indian venison i ever tasted being sweet and tender mr hodgson once kept a female alive but it was very wild and continued so as long as i knew it two of my lepchas gave chase to these animals and fired many arrows in vain after them these people are fond of carrying a bow but are very poor shots  we descended 3000 feet to the deep valley of the yalloong river which runs westbysouth to the tambur from between junnoo and kubra the path was very bad over quartz granite and gneiss which cut the shoes and feet severely the bottom of the valley which is elevated 10450 feet was filled with an immense accumulation of angular gravel and debris of the above rocks forming on both sides of the river a terrace 400 feet above the stream which flowed in a furious torrent the path led over this deposit for a good many miles and varied exceedingly in height in some places being evidently increased by landslips and at others apparently by moraines  illustrationtibetan charmbox    chapter xii  yalloong valleyfiud kanglanamo pass closedchange route for the southwardpicrorhizaview of

laden with salt they told us that the yalloong village which lay up the valley on the route to the kanglanamo pass leading over the south shoulder of kubra into sikkim was deserted the inhabitants having retired after the october fall of snow to yankutang two marches down also that the kanglanamo pass was impracticable being always blocked up by the october fall i was therefore reluctantly obliged to abandon the plan of pursuing that route to sikkim and to go south following the west flank of singalelah to the first of the many passes over it which i might find open  these people were very civil and gave me a handful of the root of one of the many bitter herbs called in bengal teeta and used as a febrifuge the present was that of picrorhiza a plant allied to speedwell which grows at from 12000 to 15000 feet elevation and is a powerful bitter called hoonling by the tibetans they had with them above 100 sheep of a tall longlegged romannosed breed each carried upwards of forty pounds of salt done up in two leather bags slung on either side and secured by a band going over the chest and another round the loins so that they cannot slip off when going up or down hill these sheep are very tame patient creatures travelling twelve miles a day with great ease and being indifferent to rocky or steep ground  looking east i had a splendid view of the broad snowy mass of kubra blocking up as it were the head of the valley with a white screen descending to about 10000 feet the abies brunoniana appeared with fine trees of rhododendron falconeri forty feet high and with leaves nineteen inches long while the upper part of the valley was full of abies webbiana  at the elevation of 9000 feet we crossed to the east bank and passed the junction of the gneiss and mica slate the latter crossed the river striking northwest and the stream cut a dark chasmlike channel through it foaming and dashing the spray over the splintered ridges and the broad waterworn hogbacked masses that projected from its bed immense veins of granite permeated the rocks which were crumpled in the strangest manner isolated angular blocks of schist had been taken up by the granite in a fluid state and remained imbedded in it  the road made great ascents to avoid landslips and to surmount the enormous piles of debris which encumber this valley more than any other we encamped at 10050 feet on a little flat 1000 feet above the bed of the  river and on its east flank a hydrangea was the common small wood but abies webbiana formed the forest with great rhododendrons the weather was foggy whence i judged that we were in the sea of mist i saw beneath me from the passes the temperature considering the elevation was mild 37 degrees and 38 degrees which was partly due to the evolution of heat that accompanies the condensation of these vapours the atmosphere being loaded with moisture the thermometer fell to 28 degrees during the night and in the morning the ground was thickly covered with hoarfrost  december 7we ascended the yalloong ridge to a saddle 11000 feet elevation whence the road dips south to the gloomy gorges of the eastern feeders of the tambur here we bade adieu to the grand alpine scenery and for several days our course lay in nepal in a southerly direction parallel to singalelah and crossing every spur and river sent off by that mighty range the latter flow towards the tambur and their beds for forty or fifty miles are elevated about 3000 or 4000 feet few of the spurs are ascended above 5000 feet but all of them rise to 12000 or 14000 feet to the westward where they join the singalelah range  i clambered to the top of a lofty hummock through a dense thicket of interwoven rhododendron bushes the clayey soil under which was slippery from the quantity of dead leaves i had hoped for a view of the top of kinchinjunga which bore northeast but it was enveloped in clouds as were all the snows in that direction to the northwest however i obtained bearings of the principal peaks etc of the yangma and kambachen valleys to the south and southeast lofty rugged and pineclad mountains rose in confused masses and white sheets of  mist came driving up clinging to the mountaintops and shrouding the landscape with extreme rapidity the remarkable mountain of sidingbah bore southsoutheast raising its rounded head above the clouds i could however procure no other good bearing  the descent from the yalloong ridge to the khabili feeders of the tambur was very steep and in some places almost precipitous first through dense woods of silver fir with rhod falconeri and hodgsoni then through abies brunoniana with yew now covered with red berries to the region of magnolias and rhod arboreum and barbatum one bush of the former was in flower making a gorgeous show here also appeared the great oak with lamellated acorns which i had not seen in the drier valleys to the westward with many other dorjiling trees and shrubs a heavy mist clung to the rank luxuriant foliage tantalizing from its obscuring all the view mica schist replaced the gneiss and a thick slippery stratum of clay rendered it very difficult to keep ones footing after so many days of bright sunshine and dry weather i found this quiet damp foggy atmosphere to have a most depressing effect there was little to interest in the meteorology the atmospheric fluctuations being far too small geographical discovery was at an end and we groped our way along devious paths in wooded valleys or ascended spurs and ridges always clouded before noon and clothed with heavy forest  at 6000 feet we emerged from the mist and found ourselves clambering down a deep gully hemmed in by frightful rocky steeps which exposed a fine and tolerably continuous section of schistose rocks striking northwest and dipping northeast at a very high angle  at the bottom three furious torrents met we descended  the course of one of them over slanting precipices or trees lashed to the rocks and after a most winding course our path conducted us to the village of tarbu high above a feeder of the khabili river which flows west joining the tambur three days march lower down having no food we had made a very long and difficult march to this place but finding none here proceeded on to tonghem village on the khabili descending through thickets of rhod arboreum to the elevation of 5560  this village or spur called tonghem by the limboos and yankutang by the bhoteeas is the winter resort of the inhabitants of the upper yalloong valley they received us very kindly sold us two fowls and rice enough to last for one or two days which was all they could spare and gave me a good deal of information i found that the kanglanamo pass had been disused since the nepal war that it was very lofty and always closed in october  the night was fine clear and warm but the radiation so powerful that the grass was coated with ice the following morning though the thermometer did not fall below 33 degrees the next day the sun rose with great power and the vegetation reeked and steamed with the heat crossing the river we first made a considerable descent and then ascended a ridge to 5750 feet through a thick jungle of camellia eurya and small oak from the top i obtained bearings of yalloong and choonjerma pass and had also glimpses of the kinchin range through a tantalizing jungle after which a very winding and fatiguing upanddown march southwards brought us to the village of khabang in the magnificent valley of the tawa about 800 feet above the river and 5500 feet above the sea  i halted here for a day to refresh the people and if possible to obtain some food i hoped too to find a pass  into sikkim east over singalelah but was disappointed if there had ever been one it had been closed since the nepal war and there was none for several marches further south which would conduct us to the iwa branch of the khabili  khabang is a village of geroongs or shepherds who pasture their flocks on the hills and higher valleys during summer and bring them down to this elevation in winter the ground was consequently infested with a tick equal in size to that so common in the bushes and quite as troublesome but of a different species  the temperature rose to 72 degrees and the blackbulb thermometer to 140 degrees magnolias and various almost tropical trees were common and the herbaceous vegetation was that of low elevations large sugarcane saccharum palm wallichia and wild plantains grew near the river and rhod arboreum was very common on dry slopes of micaslate rocks with the gorgeous and sweetscented luculia gratissima  up the valley of the tawa the view was very grand of a magnificent rocky mountain called sidingbah bearing southeast by south on a spur of the singalelah range that runs westerly and forms the south flank of the tawa and the north of the khabili valleys this mountain is fully 12000 feet high crested with rock and ragged black forest which on the north flank extends to its base to the eastward the bare ridges of singalelah were patched with snow below which they too were clothed with black pines  from the opposite side of the tawa to khabang alt 6020 feet i was during our march southwards most fortunate in obtaining a splendid view of kinchinjunga bearing northeast by north with its associates rising over the dark mass of singalelah its flanks showing like tier above tier of green glaciers its distance was fully  twentyfive miles and as only about 7000 feet or 8000 feet from its summit were visible and kubra was foreshortened against it its appearance was not grand added to which its top was round and hummocky not broken into peaks as when seen from the south and east villages and cultivation became more frequent as we proceeded southward and our daily marches were up ridges and down into deep valleys with feeders from the flanks of sidingbah to the tambur we passed through the village of tchonboong and camped at yangyading 4100 feet sighted yamroop a large village and military post to the west of our route crossed the pangwa river and reached the valley of the khabili during this part of the journey i did not once see the tambur river though i was day after day marching only seven to ten miles distant from it so uneven is the country the mountains around taptiatok mywa guola and chingtam were pointed out to me but they presented no recognizable feature  i often looked for some slope or strike of the slopes of the spurs in any one valley or that should prevail through several but could seldom trace any except on one or two occasions at low elevations looking here across the valleys there was a tendency in the gentle slopes of the spurs to have plane faces dipping northeast and to be bounded by a line of cliffs striking northwest and facing the southeast in such arrangements the upheaved cliffs may be supposed to represent parallel lines of faults dislocation or rupture but i could never trace any secondary valleys at right angles to these there is no such uniformity of strike as to give to the rivers a zigzag course of any regularity or one having any apparent dependence on a prevailing arrangement of the rocks for though the strike of the chlorite and clayslate at elevations below 6000 feet along its course is certainly northwest with a dip to northeast the flexures of the river as projected on the map deviate very widely from these directions  the valley of the khabili is very grand broad open and intersected by many streams and cultivated spurs the road from yamroop to sikkim once well frequented runs up its north flank and though it was long closed we determined to follow and clear it  on the 11th of december we camped near the village of sablakoo 4680 feet and procured five days food to last us as far as the first sikkim village thence we proceeded eastward up the valley but descending to the iwa an affluent of the khabili through a tropical vegetation of pinus longifolia phyllanthus emblica dwarf datepalm etc  gneiss was here the prevailing rock uniformly dipping northeast 20 degrees and striking northwest the same rock no doubt forms the mass sidingbah which reared its head 8000 feet above the iwa river by whose bed we camped at 3780 feet sandflies abounded and were most troublesome troops of large monkeys were skipping about and the whole scene was thoroughly tropical still the thermometer fell to 38 degrees in the night with heavy dew  though we passed numerous villages i found unusual difficulty in getting provision and received none of the presents so uniformly brought by the villagers to a stranger i was not long in discovering to my great mortification that these were appropriated by the ghorkha havildar who seemed to have profited by our many days of short allowance and diverted the current of hospitality from me to himself his coolies i saw groaning under heavy burdens when those of my people were light and the truth only came out when he had the impudence to attempt to impose a part of his coolies loads on mine to enable the former to  carry more food whilst he was pretending that he used every exertion to procure me a scanty supply of rice with my limited stock of money i had treated this man and his soldiers with the utmost kindness even nursing them and clothing them from my own stock of flannels when sick and shivering amongst the snows though a high caste hindoo and one who assumed brahmin rank he had i found no objection to eat forbidden things in secret and now that we were travelling amongst hindoos his caste obtained him everything while money alone availed me i took him roundly to task for his treachery which caused him secretly to throw away a leg of mutton he had concealed i also threatened to expose the humbug of his pretension to caste but it was then too late to procure more food having hitherto much liked this man and fully trusted him i was greatly pained by his conduct  we proceeded east for three days up the valley through gloomy forests of tropical trees below 5000 feet and ascended to oaks and magnolias at 6000 feet the path was soon obstructed and we had to tear and cut our way from 6000 to 10000 feet which took two days very hard work ticks swarmed in the small bamboo jungle and my body was covered with these loathsome insects which got into my bed and hair and even attached themselves to my eyelids during the night when the constant annoyance and irritation completely banished sleep in the daytime they penetrated my trousers piercing to my body in many places so that i repeatedly took off as many as twelve at one time it is indeed marvellous how so large an insect can painlessly insert a stout barbed proboscis which requires great force to extract it and causes severe smarting in the operation what the ticks feed upon in these humid forests is a perfect mystery to me for from  6000 to 9000 feet they literally swarmed where there was neither path nor animal life they were however more tolerable than a commoner species of parasite which i found it impossible to escape from all classes of mountaineers being infested with it  on the 14th after an arduous ascent through the pathless jungle we camped at 9300 feet on a narrow spur in a dense forest amongst immense loose blocks of gneiss the weather was foggy and rainy and the wind cold i ate the last supply of animal food a miserable starved pullet with rice and chili vinegar my tea sugar and all other superfluities having been long before exhausted  on the following morning we crossed the islumbo pass over singalelah into sikkim the elevation being 11000 feet above our camp the trees were few and stunted and we quickly emerged from the forest on a rocky and grassy ridge covered with withered saxifrages umbelliferae parnassia hypericum etc there were no pines on either side of the pass a very remarkable peculiarity of the damp mountains of sikkim which i have elsewhere had occasion to notice we had left pinus longifolia a far from common tree in these valleys at 3000 feet in the tawa three days before and ascended to 11000 feet without passing a coniferous tree of any kind except a few yews at 9000 feet covered with red berries  the top of the pass was broad grassy and bushy with dwarf bamboo rose and berberry in great abundance covered with mosses and lichens it had been raining hard all the morning and the vegetation was coated with ice a dense fog obscured everything and a violent southeast wind blew over the pass in our teeth i collected some very curious and beautiful mosses putting these frozen treasures into my box in the form of  exquisitely beautiful glass ornaments or mosses frosted with silver  a few stones marked the boundary between nepal and sikkim where i halted for half an hour and hung up my instruments the temperature was 32 degrees  we descended rapidly proceeding eastward down the broad valley of the kulhait river an affluent of the great rungeet and as it had begun to sleet and snow hard we continued until we reached 6400 feet before camping  on the following day we proceeded down the valley and reached habitations at 4000 feet passing many villages and much cultivation we crossed the river and ascended by 7 pm to the village of lingcham just below the convent of changachelling very tired and hungry bad weather had set in and it was pitch dark and raining hard when we arrived but the kajee or head man had sent out a party with torches to conduct us and he gave us a most hospitable reception honoured us with a salute of musketry and brought abundance of milk eggs fowls plantains and murwa beer plenty of news was awaiting me here and a messenger with letters was three marches further north at yoksun waiting my expected return over the kanglanamo pass dr campbell i was told had left dorjiling and was en route to meet the rajah at bhomsong on the teesta river where no european had ever yet been and as the sikkim authorities had for sixteen years steadily rejected every overture for a friendly interview and even refused to allow the agent of the governorgeneral to enter their dominions it was evident that grave doings were pending i knew that dr campbell had long used every exertion to bring the sikkim rajah to a friendly conference without having to force his way into the country for the purpose but in vain it will hardly  be believed that though this chiefs dominions were redeemed by us from the nepalese and given back to him though we had bound ourselves by a treaty to support him on his throne and to defend him against the nepalese on the west the bhutan people on the east and the tibetans on the north and though the terms of the treaty stipulated for free intercourse mutual protection and friendship the sikkim authorities had hitherto been allowed to obstruct all intercourse and in every way to treat the governorgenerals agent and the east india company with contempt an affectation of timidity mistrust and ignorance was assumed for the purpose of deception and as a cloak for every insult and resistance to the terms of our treaty and it was quoted by the government in answer to every remonstrance on the part of their resident agent at dorjiling  on the following morning the kajee waited on me with a magnificent present of a calf a kid fowls eggs rice oranges plantains eggapples indian corn yams onions tomatos parsley fennel turmeric rancid butter milk and lastly a coolieload of fermenting milletseeds wherewith to make the favourite murwa beer in the evening two lads arrived from dorjiling who had been sent a week beforehand by my kind and thoughtful friend mr hodgson with provisions and money  the valley of the kulhait is one o£ the finest in sikkim and it is accordingly the site of two of the oldest and richest conventual establishments its length is sixteen miles from the islumbo pass to the great rungeet for ten of which it is inhabited the villages being invariably on long meridional spurs that project north and south from either flank they are about 2000 feet above the river and from 4500 to 5000 feet above the sea except where these spurs project the flanks of the valley are very steep the mountains rising to 7000 or 8000 feet  looking from any spur up or down the valley five or six others might be seen on each side of the river at very nearly the same average level all presenting great uniformity of contour namely a gentle slope towards the centre of the valley and then an abrupt descent to the river they were about a quarter of a mile broad at the widest and often narrower and a mile or so long some parts of their surfaces and sides were quite flat and occasionally occupied by marshes or ponds cultivation is almost confined to these spurs and is carried on both on their summits and steep flanks between every two is a very steep gulley and watercourse the timber has long since been either wholly or partially cleared from the tops but to a great extent still clothes their flanks and the intervening gorges i have been particular in describing these spurs because it is impossible to survey them without ascribing their comparative uniformity of level to the action of water similar ones are characteristic features of the valleys of sikkim between 2000 and 8000 feet and are rendered conspicuous by being always sites for villages and cultivation the soil is a vegetable mould over a deep stratum of red clay  i am far from supposing that any geologically recent action of the sea has levelled these spurs but as the great chain of the himalaya has risen from the ocean and as every part of it has been subjected to seaaction it is quite conceivable that intervals of rest during the periods of elevation or submergence would effect their levelling in a mountain mass so tumbled as is that of sikkim any level surface or approach to it demands study and when as in the kulhait valley we find several similar spurs with comparatively flat tops to occupy about the same level it  is necessary to look for some levelling cause the action of denudation is still progressing with astonishing rapidity under an annual fall of from 100 to 150 inches of rain but its tendency is to obliterate all such phenomena and to give sharp rugged outlines to these spurs in spite of the conservative effects of vegetation  the weather at lingcham was gloomy cold and damp with much rain and fog and the mean temperature 4525 degrees was cold for the elevation 4860 feet 525 degrees was the highest temperature observed and 39 degrees the lowest  a letter from dr campbell reached me three days after my arrival begging me to cross the country to the teesta river and meet him at bhomsong on its west bank where he was awaiting my arrival i therefore left on the 20th of december accompanied by my friend the kajee who was going to pay his respects to the rajah he was constantly followed by a lad carrying a bamboo of murwa beer slung round his neck with which he kept himself always groggy his dress was thoroughly lepcha and highly picturesque consisting of a very broadbrimmed roundcrowned bambooplatted hat scarlet jacket and bluestriped cloth shirt bare feet long knife bow and quiver rings and earrings and a long pigtail he spoke no hindoostanee but was very communicative through my interpreters  leaving the lingcham spur we passed steep cliffs of mica and schist covered with brushwood and long grass about 1000 feet above which the changachelling convent is perched crossing a torrent we came to the next village on the spur of kurziuk where i was met by a deputation of women sent by the lamas of changachelling bearing enormous loads of oranges rice milk butter ghee and the everflowing murwa beer  the villagers had erected a shady bower for me to rest under of leaves and branches and had fitted up a little bamboo stage on which to squat crosslegged as they do or to hang my legs from if i preferred after conducting me to this the parties advanced and piled their cumbrous presents on the ground bowed and retired they were succeeded by the beercarrier who plunged a clean drinkingtube to the bottom of the steaming bamboo jug described in chapter vii and held it to my mouth then placing it by my side he bowed and withdrew nothing can be more fascinating than the simple manners of these kind people who really love hospitality for its own sake and make the stranger feel himself welcome just now too the durbar had ordered every attention to be paid me and i hardly passed a village however small without receiving a present or a cottage where beer was not offered this i found a most grateful beverage and of the occasional rests under leafy screens during a hot days march and sips at the bamboo jug i shall ever retain a grateful remembrance happily the liquor is very weak and except by swilling as my friend the kajee did it would be impossible to get fuddled by it  at kurziuk i was met by a most respectable lepcha who as a sort of compliment sent his son to escort us to the next village and spur of pemiongchi to reach which we crossed another gorge of which the situation and features were quite similar to those of kurziuk and lingcham  the pemiongchi and changachelling convents and temples stand a few miles apart on the ridge forming the north flank of the kulhait valley and as they will be described hereafter i now only allude to the village which is fully 1000 feet below the convent and large and populous  at pemiongchi a superior lama met me with another  overwhelming present he was a most jolly fat monk shaven and girdled and dressed in a scarlet gown my lepchas kotowed to him and he blessed them by the laying on of hands  illustrationpemiongchi goompa and chaits  there is a marsh on this spur full of the common english acorus calamus or sweetflag whose roots being very aromatic are used in griping disorders of men and cattle hence we descended suddenly to the great rungeet which we reached at its junction with the kulhait the path was very steep and slippery owing to micaceous rocks and led along the side of an enormous mendong this remarkable structure called the kaysing mendong is 200 yards long 10 feet high and 6 or 8 feet broad it is built of flat slaty stones and both faces are covered with inscribed slates of which there are upwards of 700 and the inscriptions chiefly om mani etc are in both the uchen and lencha ranja characters of tibet a tall stone nine feet high covered also with inscriptions terminates it at the lower end which ran  down the hill for several hundred yards and had a large chait at each end with several smaller ones at intervals throughout its length were innumerable inscriptions of om mani padmi om with well carved figures of boodh in his many incarnations besides lamas etc at the lower end was a great flat area on which are burnt the bodies of sikkim people of consequence the poorer people are buried the richer burned and their ashes scattered or interred but not in graves proper of which there are none nor are there any signs of lepcha interment throughout sikkim though chaits are erected to the memory of the departed they have no necessary connection with the remains and generally none at all corpses in sikkim are never cut to pieces and thrown into lakes or exposed on hills for the kites and crows to devour as is the case in tibet  we passed some curious masses of crumpled chlorite slate presenting deep canals or furrows along which a demon once drained all the water from the pemiongchi spur to the great annoyance of the villagers the lamas however on choosing this as a site for their temples easily confounded the machinations of the evil spirit who in the eyes of the simple lepchas was answerable for all the mischief  i crossed the great rungeet at 1840 feet above the sea where its bed was twenty yards in width a rude bridge composed of two culms of bamboo and a handrail conducted me to the other side where we camped on the east bank in a thick tropical jungle in the evening  i walked down the banks of the river which flowed in a deep gorge cumbered with enormous boulders of granite clayslate and micaslate the rocks in situ were all of the latter description highly inclined and much dislocated some of the boulders were fully ten feet in diameter permeated and altered very much by granite veins which had evidently been injected when molten and had taken up angular masses of the chlorite which remained as it were suspended in the veins  it is not so easy to account for the present position of these blocks of granite a rock not common at elevations below 10000 feet they have been transported from a considerable distance in the interior of the lofty valley to the north and have descended not less than 8000 feet and travelled fully fifteen miles in a straight line or perhaps forty along the river bed it may be supposed that moraines have transported them to 8000 feet the lowest limit of apparent moraines and the power of river water carried them further if so the rivers must have been of much greater volume formerly than they are now  our camp was on a gravel flat like those of the nepal valleys about sixty feet above the river its temperature was 52 degrees which felt cool when bathing  from the river we proceeded west following a steep and clayey ascent up the end of a very long spur from the lofty mountain range called mungbreu dividing the great rungeet from the teesta we ascended by a narrow path accomplishing 2500 feet in an hour and a quarter walking slowly but steadily without resting this i always found a heavy pull in a hot climate  at about 4000 feet above the sea the spur became more open and flat like those of the kulhait valley with alternate slopes and comparative flats from this elevation the  view north south and west was very fine below us flowed the river and a few miles up it was the conical wooded hill of tassiding rising abruptly from a fork of the deep river gorge crowned with its curious temples and mendongs and bristling with chaits on it is the oldest monastery in sikkim occupying a singularly picturesque and prominent position north of this spur and similar to it lay that of raklang with the temple and monastery of the same name at about this elevation in front looking west across the great rungeet were the monasteries of changachelling and pemiongchi perched aloft and south of these were the flattopped spurs of the kulhait valley with their villages and the great mendong which i had passed on the previous day running like a white line down the spur to the north beyond tassiding were two other monasteries doobdee and sunnook both apparently placed on the lower wooded flanks of kinchinjunga whilst close by was dholing the seventh religious establishment now in sight  we halted at a good wooden house to refresh ourselves with murwa beer where i saw a woman with cancer in the face an uncommon complaint in this country i here bought a little black puppy to be my future companion in sikkim he was of a breed between the famous tibet mastiff and the common sikkim huntingdog which is a variety of the sorry race called pariah in the plains being only a few weeks old he looked a mere bundle of black fur and i carried him off for he could not walk  we camped at the village of lingdam alt 5550 feet occupying a flat and surrounded by extensive pools of water for this country containing acorus potamogeton and duckweed such ponds i have often met with on these terraces and they are very remarkable not being dammed in by any conspicuous barrier but simply occupying depressions in the surface from which as i have repeatedly observed the land dips rapidly to the valleys below  this being the highroad from tumloong or sikkim durbar the capital and rajahs residence to the numerous monasteries which i had seen we passed many lamas and monks on their way home from tumloong where they had gone to be present at the marriage of the tupgain lama the eldest son of the rajah a dispensation having previously been procured from lhassa this marriage had been effected by the lamas in order to counteract the efforts of the dewan who sought to exercise an undue influence over the rajah and his family the tupgain lama having only spiritual authority and being bound to celibacy the temporal authority devolved on the second son who was heir apparent of sikkim he however having died an illegitimate son of the rajah was favoured by the dewan as heir apparent the bride was brought from tibet and the marriage party were feasted for eighteen days at the rajahs expense all the lamas whom i met were clad in red robes with girdles and were shaven with bare feet and heads or mitred they wore rosaries of onyx turquoise quartz lapis lazuli coral glass amber or wood especially yellow berberry and sandalwood some had staves and one a trident like an eelfork on a long staff an emblem of the hindoo trinity called trisool mahadeo which represents brahma siva and vishnu in hindoo and boodh dhurma and sunga in boodhist theology all were on foot indeed ponies are seldom used in this country the lamas however walked with becoming gravity and indifference to all around them  the kajee waited upon me in the evening full of importance having just received a letter from his rajah which he wished to communicate to me in private so i accompanied him to a house close by where he was a guest when the  secret came out that his highness was dreadfully alarmed at my coming with the two ghorka sepoys whom i accordingly dismissed  the house was of the usual bhoteea form of wood well built on posts onestoried containing a single apartment hung round with bows quivers shields baskets of rice and cornucopias of indian corn the handsomest and most generous looking of all the cerealia the whole party were deep in a carouse on murwa beer and i saw the operation of making it the milletseed is moistened and ferments for two days sufficient for a days allowance is then put into a vessel of wickerwork lined with indiarubber to make it watertight and boiling water is poured on it with a ladle of gourd from a huge iron cauldron that stands all day over the fire the fluid when quite fresh tastes like negus of cape sherry rather sour at this season the whole population are swilling whether at home or travelling and heaps of the redbrown husks are seen by the side of all the paths  illustrationsikkim lamas

pass which crosses the range dividing the waters of the teesta from those of the great rungeet the kajee still kept beside me and proved a lively companion seeing me continually plucking and noting plants he gave me much local information about them he told me the uses made of the fibres of the various nettles some being twisted for bowstrings others as a thread for sewing and weaving while many are eaten raw and in soups especially the numerous little succulent species the great yellowflowered begonia was abundant and he cut its juicy stalks to make sauce as we do applesauce for some pork which he expected to get at bhomsong the taste is acid and very pleasant the large succulent fern called botrychium botrychium virginicum linn this fern is eaten abundantly by the new zealanders its distribution is most remarkable being found very rarely indeed in europe and in norway only it abounds in many parts of the southern united states the andes of mexico etc in the himalaya mountains australia and new zealand grew here plentifully it is boiled and eaten both here and in new zealand ferns are more commonly used for food than is supposed in calcutta the hindoos boil young tops of a polypodium with their shrimp curries and both in sikkim and nepal the watery tubers of an aspidium are abundantly eaten so also the pulp of one treefern affords food but only in times of scarcity as does that of another species in new zealand cyathea medullaris the pith of all is composed of a coarse sago that is to say of cellular tissue with starch granules  a thick forest of dorjiling vegetation covers the summit which is only 6800 feet above the sea it is a saddle connecting the lofty mountain of mainom alt 11000 feet to the north with tendong alt 8663 feet to the south both these mountains are on a range which is continuous with kinchinjunga projecting from it down into the very heart of sikkim a considerable stand was made here by the lepchas during the nepal war in 1787 they defended the pass with their arrows for some hours and then retired towards the teesta making a second stand lower down at a place pointed out to me where rocks on either side gave them the same advantages the nepalese however advanced to the teesta and then retired with little loss  unfortunately a thick mist and heavy rain cut off all view of the teesta valley and the mountains of chola to the eastward which i much regretted  descending by a very steep slippery path we came to a fine mass of slaty gneiss thirty feet long and thirteen feet high not in situ but lying on the mountain side on its sloping face was carved in enormous characters om mani padmi om of which letters the topstrokes afford an uncertain footing to the enthusiast who is willing to purchase a good metempsychosis by walking along the slope with his heels or toes in their cavities a small inscription in one corner is said to imply that this was the work of a pious monk of raklang and the stone is called domani literally stone of prayer  illustrationdomani stone  the rocks and peaks of mainom are said to overhang the descent here with grandeur but the continued rain hid everything but a curious shivered peak apparently of chlorite schist which was close by and reflected a green colour it is of course reported to be of turquoise and inaccessible descending the rocks became more micaceous with broad seams of pipeclay originating in decomposed beds of felspathic gneiss the natives used this to whitewash and mortar their temples  i passed the monastery of neongong the monks of which were building a new temple and came to bring me a large present below it is a pretty little lake about 100 yards across fringed with brushwood we camped at the village of nampok 4370 feet above the sea all thoroughly sodden with rain  during the night much snow had fallen at and above 9000 feet but the weather cleared on the following morning and disclosed the top of mainom rising close above my camp in a series of rugged shivered peaks crested with pines which looked like statues of snow to all other quarters this mountain presents a very gently sloping outline up the teesta valley there was a pretty peep of snowy mountains bearing north 35 degrees east of no great height  i was met by a messenger from dr campbell who told me he was waiting breakfast so i left my party and accompanied by the kajee and meepo hurried down to the valley of the rungoon which flows east to the teesta through a fine forest of tropical trees passing the villages of broom on the top of the ridge above broom a tall stone is erected by the side of the path covered with private marks indicating the height of various individuals who are accustomed to measure themselves thus there was but one mark above 5 feet 7 inches and that was 6 inches higher it turned out to be campbells who had passed a few days before and was thus proved to top the natives of sikkim by a long way and lingo to the spur of that name where i was met by a servant of the sikkim dewans with a pony for my use i stared at the animal and felt inclined to ask what he had to do here where it was difficult enough to walk up and down slippery slopes amongst boulders of rock heavy forest and foaming torrents but i was little aware of what these beasts could accomplish the tartar saddle was imported from tibet and certainly a curiosity oncebut a long time agoit must have been very handsome it was highpeaked covered with shagreen and silvered ornaments wretchedly girthed and with great stirrups attached to short leathers the bridle and headgear were much too complicated for description there were good leather raw hide hairrope and scarlet worsted all brought into use the bit was the ordinary asiatic one jointed and with two rings i mounted on one side and at once rolled over saddle and all to the other the pony standing quite still i preferred walking but dr campbell had begged of me to use the pony as the dewan had procured and sent it at great trouble i however had it led till i was close to bhomsong when i was hoisted into the saddle and balanced on it with my toes in the stirrups and my knees up to my breast twice on the steep descent to the river my saddle and i were thrown on the ponys neck in these awkward emergencies i was assisted by a man on each side who supported my weight on my elbows they seemed well accustomed to easing mounted ponies down hill without giving the rider the trouble of dismounting thus i entered dr campbells camp at bhomsong to the pride and delight of my attendants and received a hearty welcome from my old friend who covered me with congratulations on the successful issue of a journey which at this season and under such difficulties and discouragements he had hardly thought feasible  dr campbells tent was pitched in an orangegrove occupying a flat on the west bank of the teesta close to a small enclosure of pineapples with a pomegranate tree in the middle the valley is very narrow and the vegetation wholly tropical consisting of two species of oak several palms rattancane screwpine pandanus tall grasses and all the natives of dense hot jungles the river is a grand feature broad rocky deep swift and broken by enormous boulders of rock its waters were of a pale opal green probably from the materials of the soft micaceous rocks through which it flows  a cane bridge crosses it whence the name of bhomsong samdong the latter word meaning bridge but had been cut away in feigned distrust of us and the long canes were streaming from their attachments on either shore down the stream and a triangular raft of bamboo was plying instead drawn to and fro by means of a strong cane  soon after arriving i received a present from the rajah consisting of a brick of tibet tea eighty pounds of rancid yak butter in large squares done up in yakhair cloth three loads of rice and one of murwa for beer rolls of bread these rolls or rather sticks of bread are made in tibet of fine wheaten flour and keep for a long time they are sweet and good but very dirtily prepared fowls eggs dried plums apricots jujubes currants and sultana raisins the latter fruits purchased at lhassa but imported thither from western tibet also some trays of coarse milkwhite crystallised salt as dug in tibet  in the evening we were visited by the dewan the head and front of all our sikkim difficulties whose influence was paramount with the rajah owing to the age and infirmities of the latter and his devotion to religion which absorbed all his time and thoughts the dewan was a goodlooking tibetan very robust fair muscular and well fleshed he had a very broad tartar face quite free of hair a small and beautifully formed mouth and chin very broad cheekbones and a low contracted forehead his manners were courteous and polite but evidently affected in assumption of better breeding than he could in reality lay claim to the rajah himself was a tibetan of just respectable extraction a native of the sokpo province north of lhassa his dewan was related to one of his wives and i believe a lhassan by birth as well as extraction having probably also kashmir blood in him the tibetans court promiscuous intercourse between their families and the kashmir merchants who traverse their country though minister he was neither financier nor politician but a mere plunderer of sikkim introducing his relations and those whom he calls so into the best estates in the country and trading in great and small wares from a tibet pony to a tobacco pipe wholesale and retail neither he nor the rajah are considered worthy of notice by the best tibet families or priests or by the chinese commissioners settled in lhassa and jigatzi the latter regard sikkim as virtually english and are contented with knowing that its ruler has no army and with believing that its protectors the english could not march an army across the himalaya if they would  the dewan trading in wares which we could supply better and cheaper naturally regarded us with repugnance and did everything in his power to thwart dr campbells attempts to open a friendly communication between the sikkim and english governments the rajah owed everything to us and was i believe really grateful but he was a mere cipher in the hands of his minister the priests again while rejoicing in our proximity were apathetic and dreaded the more active dewan and the people had long given evidence of their confidence in the english under these circumstances it was in the hope of gaining the rajahs own ear and representing to him the advantages of promoting an intercourse with us and the danger of continuing to violate the terms of our treaty that dr campbell had been authorised by government to seek an interview with his highness at present our relations were singularly infelicitous there was no agent on the sikkim rajahs part to conduct business at dorjiling and the dewan insisted on sending a creature of his own who had before been dismissed for insolence malefactors who escaped into sikkim were protected and our police interrupted in the discharge of their duties slavery was practised and government communications were detained for weeks and months under false pretences  in his interviews with us the dewan appeared to advantage he was fond of horses and shooting and prided himself on his hospitality we gained much information from many conversations with him during which politics were never touched upon our queries naturally referred to tibet and its geography especially its great feature the yarou tsampoo river this he assured us was the burrampooter of assam and that no one doubted it in that country lhassa he described as a city in the bottom of a flatfloored valley surrounded by lofty snowy mountains neither grapes tea silk or cotton are produced near it but in the tartchi province of tibet one months journey east of lhassa rice and a coarse kind of tea are both grown two months journey northeast of lhassa is siling the wellknown great commercial entrepot the entrepot is now removed to tangkeoueulsee huc and gabet in west china and there coarse silk is produced all tibet he described as mountainous and an inconceivably poor country there are no plains save flats in the bottoms of the valleys and the paths lead over lofty mountains sometimes when the inhabitants are obliged from famine to change their habitations in winter the old and feeble are frozen to death standing and resting their chins on their staves remaining as pillars of ice to fall only when the thaw of the ensuing spring commences  we remained several days at bhomsong awaiting an interview with the rajah whose movements the dewan kept shrouded in mystery on dr campbells arrival at this river a week before he found messengers waiting to inform him that the rajah would meet him here this being half way between dorjiling and tumloong thenceforward every subterfuge was resorted to by the dewan to frustrate the meeting and even after the arrival of the rajah on the east bank the dewan communicated with dr campbell by shooting across the river arrows to which were attached letters containing every possible argument to induce him to return to dorjiling such as that the rajah was sick at tumloong that he was gone to tibet that he had a religious fast and rites to perform etc etc  one day we walked up the teesta to the rumphiup river a torrent from mainom mountain to the west the path led amongst thick jungle of wallichia palm prickly rattan canes and the pandanus or screwpine called borr which has a straight often forked palmlike trunk and an immense crown of grassy sawedged leaves four feet long it bears clusters of uneatable fruit as large as a mans fist and their similarity to the pineapple has suggested the name of borr for the latter fruit also which has for many years been cultivated in sikkim and yields indifferent produce beautiful pink balsams covered the ground but at this season few other showy plants were in flower the rocks were chlorite very soft and silvery and so curiously crumpled and contorted as to appear as though formed of scaled of mica crushed together and confusedly arranged in layers the strike was northwest and dip northeast from 60 degrees to 70 degrees  messengers from the dewan overtook us at the river to announce that the rajah was prepared and waiting to give us a reception so we returned and i borrowed a coat from dr campbell instead of my tattered shootingjacket and we crossed the river on the bambooraft as it is the custom on these occasions to exchange presents i was officially supplied with some red cloth and beads these as well as dr campbells present should only have been delivered during or after the audience but our wily friend the dewan here played us a very shabby trick for he managed that our presents should be stealthily brought in before our appearance thus giving to the bystanders the impression of our being tributaries to his highness  the audience chamber was a mere roofed shed of neat bamboo wattle about twenty feet long two bhoteeas in scarlet jackets and with bows in their hands stood on each side of the door and our own chairs were carried before us for our accommodation within was a square wicker throne six feet high covered with purple silk brocaded with dragons in white and gold and overhung by a canopy of tattered blue silk with which material part of the walls also was covered an oblong box containing papers with gilded dragons on it was placed on the stage or throne and behind it was perched crosslegged an odd black insignificant looking old man with twinkling upturned eyes he was swathed in yellow silk and wore on his head a pink silk hat with a flat broad crown from all sides of which hung floss silk this was the rajah a genuine tibetan about seventy years old on some steps close by and ranged down the apartment were his relations all in brocaded silk robes reaching from the throat to the ground and girded about the waist and wearing caps similar to that of the rajah kajees counsellors and shaven mitred lamas were there to the number of twenty all planted with their backs to the wall mute and motionless as statues a few spectators were huddled together at the lower end of the room and a monk waved about an incense pot containing burning juniper and other odoriferous plants altogether the scene was solemn and impressive as campbell well expressed it the genius of lamaism reigned supreme  we saluted but received no complimentary return our chairs were then placed and we seated ourselves when the dewan came in clad in a superb purple silk robe worked with circular gold figures and formally presented us the dewan then stood and as the rajah did not understand hindoostanee our conversation was carried on through the medium of a little bareheaded rosycheeked lama named tchebu clad in a scarlet gown who acted as interpreter the conversation was short and constrained tchebu was known as a devoted servant of the rajah and of the heir apparent and in common with all the lamas he hates the dewan and desires a friendly intercourse between sikkim and dorjiling he is further the only servant of the rajah capable of conversing both in hindoo and tibetan and the uneasy distrustful look of the dewan who understands the latter language only was very evident he was as anxious to hurry over the interview as dr campbell and tchebu were to protract it it was clear therefore that nothing satisfactory could be done under such auspices  as a signal for departure white silk scarfs were thrown over our shoulders according to the established custom in tibet sikkim and bhotan and presents were made to us of china silks bricks of tea woollen cloths yaks ponies and salt with worked silk purses and fans for mrs campbell after which we left the whole scene was novel and very curious we had had no previous idea of the extreme poverty of the rajah of his utter ignorance of the usages of oriental life and of his not having anyone near to instruct him the neglect of our salutation and the conversion of our presents into tribute did not arise from any illwill it was owing to the craft of the dewan in taking advantage of the rajahs ignorance of his own position and of good manners miserably poor without any retinue taking no interest in what passes in his own kingdom subsisting on the plainest and coarsest food passing his time in effectually abstracting his mind from the consideration of earthly things and wrapt in contemplation the sikkim rajah has arrived at great sanctity and is all but prepared for that absorption into the essence of boodh which is the end and aim of all good boodhists the mute conduct of his court who looked like attendants at an inquisition and the profound veneration expressed in every word and gesture of those who did move and speak recalled a pekin reception his attendants treated him as a being of a very different nature from themselves and well might they do so since they believe that he will never die but retire from the world only to reappear under some equally sainted form  though productive of no immediate good our interview had a very favourable effect on the lamas and people who had long wished it and the congratulations we received thereon during the remainder of our stay in sikkim were many and sincere the lamas we found universally in high spirits they having just effected the marriage of the heir apparent himself a lama said to possess much ability and prudence and hence being very obnoxious to the dewan who vehemently opposed the marriage as however the minister had established his influence over the youngest and estranged the rajah from his eldest son and was moreover in a fair way for ruling sikkim himself the church rose in a body procured a dispensation from lhassa for the marriage of a priest and thus hoped to undermine the influence of the violent and greedy stranger  in the evening we paid a farewell visit to the dewan whom we found in a bamboo wickerwork hut neatly hung with bows arrows and round lepcha shields of cane each with a scarlet tuft of yakhair in the middle there were also muskets tibetan arms and much horse gear and at one end was a little altar with cups bells pastiles and images he was robed in a fawncoloured silk gown lined with the softest of wool that taken from unborn lambs like most tibetans he extracts all his beard with tweezers an operation he civilly recommended to me accompanying the advice with the present of a neat pair of steel forceps he aspires to be considered a man of taste and plays the tibetan guitar on which he performed some airs for our amusement the instrument is roundbodied and longarmed with six strings placed in pairs and probably comes from kashmir the tibetan airs were simple and quite pretty with the time well marked  during our stay at bhomsong the weather was cool considering the low elevation 1500 feet and very steady the mean temperature was 5225 degrees the maximum 7125 degrees the minimum 4275 degrees the sun set behind the lofty mountains at 3 pm and in the morning a thick wet white dripping fog settled in the bottom of the valley and extended to 800 or 1000 feet above the riverbed this was probably caused by the descent of cold currents into the humid gorge it was dissipated soon after sunrise but formed again at sunset for a few minutes giving place to clear starlight nights  a thermometer sunk two feet seven inches stood at 64 degrees the temperature of the water was pretty constant at 51 degrees from here to the plains of india the river has a nearly uniform fall of 1000 feet in sixtynine miles or sixteen feet to a mile were its course straight for the same distance the fall would be 1000 feet in forty miles or twentyfive feet to a mile  dr campbells object being accomplished he was anxious to make the best use of the few days that remained before his return to dorjiling and we therefore arranged to ascend mainom and visit the principal convents in sikkim together after which he was to return south whilst i should proceed north to explore the south flank of kinchinjunga for the first day our route was that by which i had arrived we left on christmasday accompanied by two of the rajahs or rather dewans officers of the ranks of dingpun and soupun answering to those of captain and lieutenant the titles were however nominal the rajah having no soldiers and these men being profoundly ignorant of the mysteries of war or drill they were splendid specimens of sikkim bhoteeas ie tibetans born in sikkim sometimes called arrhats tall powerful and well built but insolent and bullying the dingpun wore the lepcha knife ornamented with turquoises together with chinese chopsticks near bhomsong campbell pointed out a hot bath to me which he had seen employed it consisted of a hollowed prostrate tree trunk the water in which was heated by throwing in hot stones with bamboo tongs the temperature is thus raised to 114 degrees to which the patient submits at repeated intervals for several days never leaving till wholly exhausted these baths are called sachoo literally hotwater in tibetan  we stopped to measure some splendid trees in the valley and found the trunk of one to be fortyfive feet round the buttresses and thirty feet above them a large size for the himalaya they were a species of terminalia pentaptera and called by the lepchas sillokkun kun meaning tree  we slept at nampok and the following morning commenced the ascent on the way we passed the temple and lake of neongong the latter is about 400 yards round and has no outlet it contained two english plants the common duckweed lemna minor and potamogeton natans some coots were swimming in it and having flushed a woodcock i sent for my gun but the lamas implored us not to shoot it being contrary to their creed to take life wantonly  we left a great part of our baggage at neongong as we intended to return there and took up with us bedding food etc for two days a path hence up the mountain is frequented once a year by the lamas who make a pilgrimage to the top for worship the ascent was very gradual for 4000 feet we met with snow at the level of dorjiling 7000 feet indicating a colder climate than at that station where none had fallen the vegetation was however similar but not so rich and at 8000 feet trees common also to the top of sinchul appeared with r hodgsoni and the beautiful little winterflowering primrose p petiolaris whose stemless flowers spread like broad purple stars on the deep green foliage above the path runs along the ridge of the precipices facing the southeast and here we caught a glimpse of the great valley of the ryott beyond the teesta with tumloong the rajahs residence on its north flank and the superb snowy peak of chola at its head  one of our coolies loaded with crockery and various indispensables had here a severe fall and was much bruised he however recovered himself but not our goods  the rocks were all of chlorite slate which is not usual at this elevation the strike was northwest and dip northeast at 9000 feet various shrubby rhododendrons prevailed with mountainash birch and dwarfbamboo also r falconeri which grew from forty to fifty feet high the snow was deep and troublesome so we encamped at 9800 feet or 800 feet below the top in a wood of pyrus magnolia rhododendron and bamboo as the ground was deeply covered with snow we laid our beds on a thick layer of rhododendron twigs bamboo and masses of a pendent moss  we passed a very cold night chiefly owing to damp the temperature falling to 24 degrees on the following morning we scrambled through the snow reaching the summit after an hours very laborious ascent and took up our quarters in a large wooden barnlike temple goompa built on a stone platform the summit was very broad but the depth of the snow prevented our exploring much and the silver firs abies webbiana were so tall that no view could be obtained except from the temple the great peak of kinchinjunga is in part hidden by those of pundim and nursing but the panorama of snowy mountains is very grand indeed the effect is quite deceptive the mountains assuming the appearance of a continued chain the distant snowy peaks being seemingly at little further distance than the nearer ones the whole range about twentytwo miles nearer than at dorjiling appeared to rise uniformly and steeply out of black pine forests which were succeeded by the russetbrown of the rhododendron shrubs and that again by tremendous precipices and gulleys into which descended mighty glaciers and perpetual snows this excessive steepness is however only apparent being due to foreshortening  the upper 10000 feet of kinchin and the tops of pundim kubra and junnoo are evidently of granite and are rounded in outline the lower peaks again as those of nursing etc present rugged pinnacles of black and red stratified rocks in many cases resting on white granite to which they present a remarkable contrast the general appearance was as if kinchin and the whole mass of mountains clustered around it had been upheaved by white granite which still forms the loftiest summits and has raised the black stratified rocks in some places to 20000 feet in numerous peaks and ridges one range presented on every summit a cap of black stratified rocks of uniform inclination and dip striking northwest with precipitous faces to the southwest this was clear to the naked eye and more evident with the telescope the range in question being only fifteen miles distant running between pundim and nursing the fact of the granite forming the greatest elevation must not be hastily attributed to that igneous rock having burst through the stratified and been protruded beyond the latter it is much more probable that the upheaval of the granite took place at a vast depth and beneath an enormous pressure of stratified rocks and perhaps of the ocean since which period the elevation of the whole mountain chain and the denudation of the stratified rocks has been slowly proceeding  to what extent denudation has thus lowered the peaks we dare scarcely form a conjecture but considering the number and variety of the beds which in some places overlie the gneiss and granite we may reasonably conclude that many thousand feet have been removed  it is further assumable that the stratified rocks originally took the forms of great domes or arches the prevailing northwest strike throughout the himalaya vaguely indicates a general primary arrangement of the curves into waves whose crests run northwest and southcast an arrangement which no minor or posterior forces have wholly disturbed though they have produced endless dislocations and especially a want of uniformity in the amount and direction of the dip whether the loftiest waves were the result of one great convulsion or of a longcontinued succession of small ones the effect would be the same namely that the strata over those points at which the granite penetrated the highest would be the most dislocated and the most exposed to wear during denudation  we enjoyed the view of this superb scenery till noon when the clouds which had obscured dorjiling since morning were borne towards us by the southerly wind rapidly closing in the landscape on all sides at sunset they again broke retreating from the northward and rising from sinchul and dorjiling last of all whilst a line of vapour thrown by perspective into one narrow band seemed to belt the singalelah range with a white girdle darkened to black where it crossed the snowy mountains and it was difficult to believe that this belt did not really hang upon the ranges from twenty to thirty miles off against which it was projected or that its true position was comparatively close to the mountain on which we were standing and was due to condensation around its cool broad flat summit  as usual from such elevations sunset produced many beautiful effects the zenith was a deep blue darkening opposite the setting sun and paling over it into a peach colour and that again near the horizon passing into a glowing orangered crossed by coppery streaks of cirrhus broad beams of pale light shot from the sun to the meridian crossing the moon and the planet venus far south through gaps in the mountains the position of the plains of india 10000 feet below us was indicated by a deep leaden haze fading upwards in gradually paler bands of which i counted fifteen to the clear yellow of the sunset sky as darkness came on the mists collected around the top of mainom accumulating on the windward side and thrown off in ragged masses from the opposite  the second night we passed here was fine and not very cold the mean temperature being 27 degrees and we kept ourselves quite warm by pinewood fires on the following morning the sun tinged the sky of a lurid yellowred to the southwest over the plains the belts of leaden vapour were fewer twelve being distinguishable and much lower than on the previous evening appearing as if depressed on the visible horizon heavy masses of clouds nestled into all the valleys and filled up the larger ones the mountain tops rising above them like islands  the height of our position i calculated to be 10613 feet colonel waugh had determined that of the summit by trigonometry to be 10702 feet which probably includes the trees which cover it or some rocky peaks on the broad and comparatively level surface  the mean temperature of the twentyfour hours was 327 degrees max 415 degreesmin 272 degrees mean dewpoint 297 and saturation 082 the mercury suddenly fell below the freezing point at sunset and from early morning the radiation was so powerful that a thermometer exposed on snow sank to 212 degrees and stood at 255 degrees at 10 am the black bulb thermometer rose to 132 degrees at 9 am on the 27th or 942 degrees above the temperature of the air in the shade i did not then observe that of radiation from snow but if as we may assume it was not less than on the following morning 212 degrees we shall have a difference of 1486 degrees fahr in contiguous spots the one exposed to the full effects of the sun the other to that of radiation through a rarefied medium to a cloudless sky on the 28th the black bulb thermometer freely suspended over the snow and exposed to the sun rose to 108 degrees or 78 degrees above that of the air in the shade 32 degrees the radiating surface of the same snow in the shade being 212 degrees or 868 degrees colder  having taken a complete set of angles and panoramic sketches from the top of mainom with seventeen hourly observations and collected much information from our guides we returned on the 28th to our tents pitched by the temples at neongong descending 7000 feet a very severe shake along lepcha paths in the evening the lamas visited us with presents of rice fowls eggs etc and begged subscriptions for their temple which was then building reminding dr campbell that he and the governorgeneral had an ample share of their prayers and benefited in proportion as for me they said i was bound to give alms as i surely needed praying for seeing how i exposed myself besides my having been the first englishman who had visited the snows of kinchinjunga the holiest spot in sikkim  on the following morning we visited the unfinished temple the outer walls were of slabs of stone neatly chiselled but badly mortared with felspathic clay and pounded slate instead of lime the partition walls were of clay shaped in moulds of wood parallel planks four feet asunder being placed in the intended position of the walls and left open above the composition was placed in these boxes a little at a time and rammed down by the feet of many men who walked round and round the narrow enclosure singing and also using rammers of heavy wood the outer work was of good hard timber of magnolia pendrekun of the lepchas land oak sokka the common ban or lepcha knife supplied the place of axe saw adze and plane and the graving work was executed with small tools chiefly on toon cedrela a very soft wood the simalkun of the lepchas  this being a festival day when the natives were bringing offerings to the altar we also visited the old temple a small wooden building besides more substantial offerings there were little cones of rice with a round wafer of butter at the top ranged on the altar in order the worshippers on entering walk straight up to the altar and before or after having deposited their gifts they lift both hands to the forehead fall on their knees and touch the ground three times with both head and hands raising the body a little between each prostration they then advance to the head lama kotow similarly to him and he blesses them laying both hands on their heads and repeating a short formula sometimes the dorje is used in blessing as the cross is in europe and when a mass of people request a benediction the lama pronounces it from the door of the temple with outstretched arms the people all being prostrate with their foreheads touching the ground six lamas were at prayer psalms and contemplation sitting crosslegged on two small benches that ran down the building one was reading with his hand and forefinger elevated whilst the others listened anon they all sang hymns repeated sacred or silly precepts to the bystanders or joined in a chorus with boys who struck brass cymbals and blew straight copper trumpets six feet long and conchshells mounted with broad silver wings elegantly carved with dragons there were besides manis or prayingcylinders drums gongs books and trumpets made of human thighbones plain or mounted in silver  throughout sikkim we were roused each morning at daybreak by this wild music the convents being so numerous that we were always within hearing of it to me it was always deeply impressive sounding so foreign and awakening me so effectually to the strangeness of the wild land in which i was wandering and of the many new and striking objects it contained after sleep too during which the mind has either been at rest or carried away to more familiar subjects the feelings of loneliness and sometimes even of despondency conjured up by this solemn music were often almost oppressive  ascending from neongong we reached that pass from the teesta to the great rungeet which i had crossed on the 22nd and this time we had a splendid view down both the valleys of the rivers and the many spars from the ridge communicating between tendong and mainom with many scattered villages and patches of cultivation near the top i found a plant of praong a small bamboo in full seed this sends up many flowering branches from the root and but few leafbearing ones and after maturing its seed and giving off suckers from the root the parent plant dies the fruit is a dark long grain like rice it is boiled and made into cakes or into beer like murwa  looking west from the summit no fewer than ten monastic establishments with their temples villages and cultivation were at once visible in the valley of the great rungeet and in those of its tributaries namely changachelling raklang dholi molli catsuperri dhoobdi sunnook powhungri pemiongchi and tassiding all of considerable size and more or less remarkable in their sites being perched on spurs or peaks at elevations varying from 3000 to 7000 feet and commanding splendid prospects  we encamped at lingcham where i had halted on the 21st and the weather being fine i took bearings of all the convents and mountains around there is much cultivation here and many comparatively rich villages all occupying flatshouldered spurs from mainom the houses are large and the yards are full of animals familiar to the eye but not to the ear the cows of sikkim though generally resembling the english in stature form and colour have humps and grunt rather than low and the cocks wake the morning with a prolonged howling screech instead of the shrill crow of chanticleer  hence we descended northwest to the great rungeet opposite tassiding which is one of the oldest monastic establishments in sikkim and one we were very anxious to visit the descent lay through a forest of tropical trees where small palms vines peppers pandanus wild plantain and pothos were interlaced in an impenetrable jungle and airplants clothed the trees

termination of a long spur from a pineclad shoulder of kinchinjunga called powhungri it divides the great rungeet from its main feeder the ratong which rises from the south face of kinchin we crossed the former by a bridge formed of two bamboo stems slung by canes from two parallel arches of stout branches lashed together  the ascent for 2800 feet was up a very steep dry zigzag path amongst mica slate rocks strike northeast on which grew many tropical plants especially the tukla rottlera tinctoria a plant which yields a brown dye the top was a flat curving northwest and southeast covered with temples chaits and mendongs of the most picturesque forms and in elegant groups and fringed with brushwood wild plantains small palms and appletrees here i saw for the first time the funereal cypress of which some very old trees spread their weeping limbs and pensile  branchlets over the buildings i was not then aware of this tree having been introduced into england by the intrepid mr fortune from china and as i was unable to procure seeds which are said not to ripen in sikkim it was a great and unexpected pleasure on my return home to find it alive and flourishing at kew it is not wild in sikkim but imported there and into bhotan from tibet it does not thrive well above 6000 feet elevation it is called tchenden by the lepchas bhoteeas and tibetans and its fragrant red wood is burnt in the temples  illustrationgroup of chaits at passiding  the lamas met us on the top of the hill bringing a noble present of fowls vegetables and oranges the latter most acceptable after our long and hot march the site is admirably chosen in the very heart of sikkim commanding a fine view and having a considerable river on either side  with the power of retreating behind to the convents of sunnook and powhungri which are higher up on the same spur and surrounded by forest enough to conceal an army considering the turbulent and warlike character of their neighbours it is not wonderful that the monks should have chosen commanding spots and good shelter for their indolent lives for the same reason these monasteries secured views of one another thus from tassiding the great temple of pemiongchi was seen towering 3000 feet over head whilst to the northwest up the course of the river the hillsides seemed sprinkled with monasteries  we camped on a saddle near the village of sunnook at 4000 feet above the sea and on the last day of the year we visited this most interesting monastic establishment ascending from our camp along the ridge by a narrow path cut here and there into steps and passing many rocks covered with inscriptions broken walls of mendongs and other remains of the via sacra between the village and temple at one spot we found a fissure emitting hot vapour of the temperature of 655 degrees that of the air being about 50 degrees it was simply a hole amongst the rocks and near the rungeet a similar one is said to occur whose temperature fluctuates considerably with the season it is very remarkable that such an isolated spring should exist on the top of a sharp ridge 2800 feet above the bottom of this deep valley  the general arrangement on the summit was first the lamas houses with small gardens then three large temples raised on rudely paged platforms and beyond these a square walled enclosure facing the south full of chaits and mendongs looking like a crowded cemetery and planted with funereal cypress cupressus funebris  the house of the principal lama was an oblong square  the lower story of stone and the upper of wood we ascended a ladder to the upper room which was 24 feet by 8 wattled all round with prettily latticed windows opening upon a bamboo balcony used for drying grain under the eaves of the broad thatched roof the ceiling of neat bamboo work was hung with glorious bunches of maize yellow red and brown an altar and closed wicker cage at one end of the room held the penates and a few implements of worship chinese carpets were laid on the floor for us and the cans of murwa brought round  the lama though one of the red sect was dressed in a yellow flowered silk robe but his mitre was red he gave us much information relative to the introduction of boodhism into sikkim  the three temples stand about fifty yards apart but are not parallel to one another although their general direction is east and west timkowski in his travels through mongolia i p 193 says according to the rules of tibetan architecture temples should face the south this is certainly not the rule in sikkim nor so far as i could learn in tibet either each is oblong and narrowed upwards with the door at one end the middle and smallest faces the west the others the east the doorways are all broad low and deep protected by a projecting carved portico the walls are immensely thick of wellmasoned slaty stones the outer surface of each slopes upwards and inwards the inner is perpendicular the roofs are low and thickly thatched and project from eight to ten feet all round to keep off the rain being sometimes supported by long poles there is a very low upper story inhabited by the attendant monks and servants accessible by a ladder at one end of the building the main body of the temple is one large apartment entered through a small transverse vestibule the breadth of the temple in which are tall cylindrical  prayingmachines the carving round the doors is very beautiful and they are gaudily painted and gilded  illustrationdoorway  the northern temple is quite plain the middle one is simply painted red and encircled with a row of black heads with goggle eyes and numerous teeth on a white ground it is said to have been originally dedicated to the evil spirits of the lepcha creed the southern which contains the library is the largest and best and is of an irregular square shape the inside walls and floors are plastered with clay and painted with allegorical representations of boodh etc from the vestibule the principal apartment is entered by broad foldingdoors studded with circular copper bosses and turning on iron hinges it is lighted by latticed windows sometimes protected outside by a bamboo screen owing to the great thickness of the walls  three to four feet a very feeble light is admitted in the principal temple called dugang six hexagonal wooden columns narrowed above with peculiar broad transverse capitals exquisitely gilded and painted support the crossbeams of the roof which are likewise beautifully ornamented sometimes a curlymaned gilt lion is placed over a column and it is always furnished with a black bushy tail squares diamonds dragons and groups of flowers vermilion green gold azure and white are dispersed with great artistic taste over all the beams the heavier masses of colour being separated by fine white lines  illustrationsouthern temple  the altars and idols are placed at the opposite end and two long parallel benches like cathedral stalls run down the centre of the building on these the monks sit at  prayer and contemplation the head lama occupying a stall often of very tasteful design near the altar  illustrationmiddle temple  the principal boodh or image is placed behind the altar under a canopy or behind a silk screen lesser gods and gaily dressed and painted effigies of sainted male or female persons are ranged on either side or placed in niches around the apartment sometimes with separate altars before them whilst the walls are more or less covered with paintings of monks in prayer or contemplation the principal boodh sakya sing sits crosslegged with the left heel up his lefthand always rests on his thigh and holds the padmi or lotus and jewel which is often a mere cup the righthand is either raised with the two forefingers up or holds the dorje or rests on the  calf of the upturned leg sakya has generally curled hair lamas have mitres females various headdresses most wear immense earrings and some rosaries all are placed on rude pediments so painted as to convey the idea of their rising out of the petals of the pink purple or white lotus none are in any way disagreeable on the contrary most have a calm and pleasing expression suggestive of contemplation  illustrationaltar and images central figure akshobya the first of the pancha boodha  the great or south temple contained a side altar of very elegant shape placed before an image encircled by a glory flowers juniper peacocks feathers pastiles and rows of brass cups of water were the chief ornaments of the altars  besides the instruments i have elsewhere enumerated in this temple was the library containing several hundred books in pigeonholes placed in recesses for a particular account

temple a entrance b four praying cylinders c altar with seven brass cups of water d four columns e and f images g library  the effect on entering these cold and gloomy temples is very impressive the dugang in particular is exquisitely ornamented and painted and the vista from the vestibule to the principal idol of carved and coloured pillars and beams is very picturesque within the general arrangement of the colours and gilding is felt to be harmonious and pleasing especially from the introduction of slender white streaks between the contrasting masses of colour  as adopted in the great exhibition building of 1851 it is also well worthy of remark that the brightest colours are often used in broad masses and when so are always arranged chromatically in the sequence of the rainbows hues and are hence never displeasing to the eye the hues though bright are subdued by the imperfect light the countenances of the images are all calm and their expression solemn whichever way you turn the eye is met by some beautiful specimen of colouring or carving or some object of veneration the effect is much heightened by the incense of juniper and sweetsmelling herbs which the priests burn on entering by their grave and decorous conduct and by the feeling of respect that is demanded by a religion which theoretically inculcates and adores virtue in the abstract and those only amongst men who practise virtue to the idol itself the boodhist attaches no real importance it is an object of reverence not of worship and no virtue or attribute belong to it per se it is a symbol of the creed and the adoration is paid to the holy man whom it represents  beyond the temples are the chaits and mendongs scattered without much order and i counted nearly twentyfive chaits of the same form in sikkim the form of the cube alone is always strictly preserved that of the pyramid and hemisphere being often much modified the cube stands on a flight of usually three steps and is surmounted by a low pyramid of five steps on this is placed a swelling urnshaped body which represents the hemisphere and is surmounted by another cube on the latter is a slender round or angled spire represented by a pyramid in burma crowned with a crescent and disc or sun in moon generally the whole is of stone with the exception of the spire which is of wood painted red between eight and thirty feet high the largest is consecrated to the memory of the rajahs eldest son who however is not buried here a group of these structures is as i have often remarked extremely picturesque and those at tassiding from their  number variety and size their commanding and romantic position and their being interspersed with weeping cypresses are particularly so  the tassiding temples and convents were founded upwards of 300 years ago by the lamas who accompanied the first rajah to sikkim and they have been continuously served by lamas of great sanctity many of whom have been educated at lhassa they were formerly very wealthy but during the nepal war they were plundered of all their treasures their silver gongs and bells their best idols dorjes and manis and stripped of their ornaments since which time pemiongchi has been more popular in proof of their antiquity it was pointed out that most of the symbols and decorations were those of pure lama boodhism as practised in tibet  although the elevation is but 4840 feet the weather was cold and raw with rain at noon followed by thunder and lightning these electrical disturbances are frequent about midsummer and midwinter prevailing over many parts of india  january 1st 1849the morning of the new year was bright and beautiful though much snow had fallen on the mountains and we left sunnook for pemiongchi situated on the summit of a lofty spur on the opposite side of the ratong we descended very steeply to the bed of the river alt 2480 feet which joins the great rungeet below the convents the rocks were micaceous dipping west and northwest 45 degrees and striking north and northeast which direction prevailed for 1000 feet or so up the opposite spur i had observed the same dip and stroke on the east flank of the tassiding spur but both the ratong on its west side and the great rungeet on the east flow in channels that show no relation to either the dip or strike  i have generally remarked in sikkim that the channels of the rivers when cutting through or flowing at the base of bluff cliffs are neither parallel to nor at right angles to the strike of the rocks forming the cliffs i do not hence conclude that there is no original connection between the directions of the rivers and the lines of fracture but whatever may have once subsisted between the direction of the fissures and that of the strike it is in the sikkim himalaya now wholly masked by shiftings which accompanied subsequent elevations and depressions  mr hopkins has mathematically demonstrated that the continued exertion of a force in raising superimposed strata would tend to produce two classes of fractures in those strata those of the first order at right angles to the direction of the wave or ridge or line of strike those of the second order parallel to the strike supposing the force to be withdrawn after the formation of the two fractures the result would be a ridge or mountain chain with diverging fissures from the summit crossed by concentric fissures and the courses which the rivers would take in flowing down the ridge would successively be at right angles and parallel to the strike of the strata now in the himalaya a prevalent strike to the northwest has been recognised in all parts of the chain but it is everywhere interfered with by mountains presenting every other direction of strike and by their dip never remaining constant either in amount or direction consequently as might be expected the directions of the river channels bear no apparent relation to the general strike of the rocks  we crossed the ratong twenty yards broad by a cane bridge suspended between two rocks of green chlorite full of veins of granite ascending we passed the village of kameti on a spur on the face of which  were strewed some enormous detached blocks of white and pink stratified quartz the rocks in situ were all chlorite schist  looking across the valley to the flank of mainom the disposition of the ridges and ravines on its sides was very evident many of the latter throughout their westerly course from their commencement at 10000 feet to their debouchure in the great rungeet at 2000 had a bluff cliffy northern flank and a sloping southern one the dip of the surfaces is therefore northwest the exposure consequently of the villages which occupy terraces on the south flanks of the lateral valleys the tassiding spur presented exactly the same arrangement of its ravines and the dip of the rocks being northwest it follows that the planes of the sloping surfaces coincide in direction though not in amount of inclination with that of the dip of the subjacent strata which is anything but a usual phenomenon in sikkim  the ascent to pemiongchi continued very steep through woods of oaks chesnuts and magnolias but no treefern palms pothos or plantain which abound at this elevation on the moister outer ranges of sikkim the temple elev 7083 feet is large eighty feet long and in excellent order built upon the lofty terminal point of the great east and west spur that divides the kulhait from the ratong and rungbee rivers and the great changachelling temple and monastery stand on another eminence of the same ridge two miles further west  the view of the snowy range from this temple is one of the finest in sikkim the eye surveying at one glance the vegetation of the tropics and the poles deep in the valleys the riverbeds are but 3000 feet above the sea and are choked with figtrees plantains and palms to  these succeed laurels and magnolias and higher up still oaks chesnuts birches etc there is however no marked line between the limits of these two last forests which form the prevailing arboreous vegetation between 4000 and 10000 feet and give a lurid line to the mountains pine forests succeed for 2000 feet higher when they give place to a skirting of rhododendron and berberry among these appear black naked rocks rising up in cliffs between which are gulleys down which the snow now on the 1st january descended to 12000 feet the mountain flanks are much more steep and rocky than those at similar heights on the outer ranges and cataracts are very numerous and of considerable height though small in volume  pemiongchi is at the same elevation as dorjiling and the contrast between the shoulders of 8000 to 10000 feet on kinchinjunga and those of equal height on tendong and tonglo is very remarkable looking at the latter mountains from dorjiling the observer sees no rock waterfall or pine throughout their whole height whereas the equally wooded flanks of these inner ranges are rocky streaked with threadlike waterfalls and bristling with silver firs  this temple the most ancient in sikkim is said to be 400 years old it stands on a paved platform and is of the same form and general character as those of tassiding inside it is most beautifully decorated especially the beams columns capitals and architraves but the designs are coarser than those of tassiding mr hodgson informed me that many of the figures and emblems in this temple are those of tantrica boodhism including shiva devi and other deities usually called brahminical kakotak or the snake king a figure terminating below in a snake is also seen with the tiger elephant and curlymaned lion the square end of every beam in the roof is ornamented either with a lotus flower or with a tibetan character in endless diversity  illustrationinterior of the temple at pemiongchi   of colour and form and the walls are completely covered with allegorical paintings of lamas and saints expounding or in contemplation with glories round their heads mitred and holding the dole and jewel  the principal image is a large and hideous figure of sakyathoba in a recess under a blue silk canopy contrasting with a calm figure of the late rajah wearing a cap and coronet  pemiongchi was once the capital of sikkim and called the sikkim durbar the rajahs residence was on a curious flat to the south of the temple and a few hundred feet below it where are the remains of for this country extensive walls and buildings during the nepal war the rajah was driven west across the teesta whilst the ghorkas plundered tassiding pemiongchi changachelling and all the temples and convents to the east of that river it was then that the famous history of sikkim this remarkable and beautiful manuscript was written on thick oblong sheets of tibet paper painted black to resist decay and the letters were yellow and gold the nepalese soldiers wantonly employed the sheets to roof the sheds they erected as a protection from the weather compiled by the lamas of pemiongchi and kept at this temple was destroyed with the exception of a few sheets with one of which dr campbell and myself were each presented we were told that the monks of changachelling and those of this establishment had copied what remained and were busy compiling from oral information etc whatever value the original may have possessed however is irretrievably lost a magnificent copy of the boodhist scriptures was destroyed at the same time it consisted of 400 volumes each containing several hundred sheets of daphne paper  the ground about the temple was snowed and we descended a few hundred feet to encamp in a most picturesque grove among chaits and inscribed stones with  a peep of the temples above nightingales warbled deliciously night and morning which rather surprised us as the minimum thermometer fell to 278 degrees and the ground next day was covered with hoarfrost the elevation being 6580 feet these birds migrate hither in october and november lingering in the himalayan valleys till the cold of early spring drives them further south to the plains of india whence they return north in march and april  on the 2nd of january i parted from my friend who was obliged to hurry to the great annual fair at titalya i regretted much being unable to accompany dr campbell to this scene of his disinterested labours especially as the nawab of moorshedabad was to be present one of the few wealthy native princes of bengal who still keep a court worth seeing but i was more anxious to continue my explorations northward till the latest moment i however accompanied him for a short distance on his way towards dorjiling we passed the old durbar called phieungoong bamboohill so named from the abundance of a small bamboo phieung the buildings now in ruins occupy a little marshy flat hemmed in by slate rocks and covered with brambles and andromeda bushes a wall a bastion and an arched gateway are the only traces of fortifications they are clothed with mosses lichens and ferns  a steep zigzag path descending amongst long grass and scarlet rhododendrons leads to the kaysing mendong described at chapter xii here i bade adieu to dr campbell and toiled up the hill feeling very lonely the zest with which he had entered into all my pursuits and the aid he had afforded me together with the charm that always attends companionship with one who enjoys every incident of travel had so attracted me to him that i found it difficult to recover my spirits  it is quite impossible for anyone who cannot from experience realise the solitary wandering life i had been leading for months to appreciate the desolate feeling that follows the parting from one who has heightened every enjoyment and taken far more than his share of every annoyance and discomfort the few days we had spent together appeared then and still as months  on my return to pemiongchi i spent the remainder of the day sketching in the great temple gossiping with the lamas and drinking salted and buttered teasoup which i had begun to like when the butter was not rancid  my route hence was to be along the south flank of kinchinjunga north to jongri which lay about four or five marches off on the road to the long deserted pass of kanglanamo by which i had intended entering sikkim from nepal when i found the route up the yalloong valley impracticable the village and ruined convents of yoksun lay near the route and the temples of doobdi catsuperri and molli on the ratong river  i descended to the village of tchonpong alt 4980 feet where i was detained a day to obtain rice of which i required ten days supply for twentyfive people on the way i passed groves of the paperyielding edgeworthia gardneri it bears round heads of fragrant beautiful yellow flowers and would be a valuable acquisition to an english conservatory  from tchonpong we descended to the bed of the rungbee alt 3160 feet an affluent of the ratong flowing in a deep galley with precipitous sides of mica schist full of garnets dipping west and northwest 45 degrees it was spanned by a bridge of two loose bamboo culms about fifteen yards long laid across without handrails after wet sand had been thrown on it the barefooted coolies crossed easily enough but i having shoes on required a hand to steady me from this point we crossed a lofty spur to the ratong alt 3000 feet where we encamped the coolies being unable to proceed further on such very bad roads this river descends from the snows of kinchin and consequently retains the low temperature 42 degrees being fully 7 degrees colder than the rungbee which at an elevation of but 3000 feet appears very remarkable it must however be observed that scarcely anywhere does the sun penetrate to the bottom of its valley  we encamped on a gravelly flat fifty feet above the river strewn with waterworn boulders and so densely covered with tall artemisiae gigantic grasses bamboo plantain fern and acacia that we had to clear a space in the jungle which exhaled a rank heavy smell  hoarfrost formed copiously in the night and though above the suns rays were very powerful they did not reach this spot till 730 am the frost remaining in the shade till nearly 9 am and this on plantains and other inhabitants of hothouses in england  hence i ascended to yoksun one of the most curious and picturesque spots in sikkim and the last inhabited place towards kinchinjunga the path was excessively steep and rocky for the first mile or two and then alternately steep and flat mixed with many tropical trees were walnuts of the common english variety a tree which though planted here is wild near dorjiling where it bears a fullsized fruit as hard as a hickorynut those i gathered in this place were similar whereas in bhotan the cultivated nut is larger thinshelled and the kernel is easily removed we ascended one slope of an angle of 36 degrees 30 minutes which was covered with light black mould and had been recently cleared by fire we found millet  now cultivated on it from the top the view of the ratong valley was very fine to the north lay yoksun appearing from this height to occupy a flat two miles long and one broad girdled by steep mountains to the north and east dipping very suddenly 2200 feet to the ratong on the west to the right was a lofty hill crowned with the large temple and convents of doobdi shadowed by beautiful weeping cypresses and backed by lofty pineclad mountains northward the gorge of the ratong opened as a gloomy defile above which rose partially snowed mountains which shut out kinchinjunga to the west massive pineclad mountains rose steeply while the little hamlet of lathiang occupied a remarkable shelf overhanging the river appearing inaccessible except by ropes from above southwest the long spurs of molli and catsuperri each crowned with convents or temples descended from singalelah and parallel to them on the south but much longer and more lofty was the great mountain range north of the kulbait with the temples and convents of pemiongchi and changachelling towering in the air the latter range dips suddenly to the great rungeet where tassiding with its chaits and cypresses closed the view the day was half cloud half sunshine and the various effects of light and shade now bringing out one or other of the villages and temples now casting the deep valleys into darker gloom was wonderfully fine  yoksun was the earliest civilised corner of sikkim and derived its name which signifies in lepcha three chiefs from having been the residence of three lamas of great influence who were the means of introducing the first tibetan sovereign into the country at present it boasts of but little cultivation and a scattered population inhabiting a few hamlets 5500 feet above the sea beautiful lanes and paths wind everywhere over the gentle slopes and through the copsewood that has replaced the timbertrees of a former period mendongs and chaits are very numerous some of great size and there are also the ruins of two very large temples near which are some magnificent weeping cypresses eighty feet high these fine trees are landmarks from all parts of the flat they form irregular cones of pale bright green with naked gnarled tops the branches weep gracefully but not like the picture in macartneys embassy to china whence originated the famous willowpattern of our crockery the ultimate branchlets are very slender and pendulous my lepcha boys used to make elegant chaplets of them binding the withes with scarlet worsted the trunk is quite erect smooth cylindrical and pinelike it harbours no moss but airplants orchids and ferns nestle on the limbs and pendulous lichens like our beardmoss wave from the branches  in the evening i ascended to doobdi the path was broad and skilfully conducted up a very steep slope covered with forest the top which is 6470 feet above the sea and nearly 1000 above yoksun is a broad partially paved platform on which stand two temples surrounded by beautiful cypresses one of these trees perhaps the oldest in sikkim measured sixteen and a half feet in girth at five feet from the ground and was apparently ninety feet high it was not pyramidal the top branches being dead and broken and the lower limbs spreading they were loaded with masses of whiteflowered coelogynes and vacciniums the younger trees were pyramidal  i was received by a monk of low degree who made many apologies for the absence of his superior who had  been ordered an eight years penance and seclusion from the world of which only three had passed on inquiry i learnt the reason for this the holy father having found himself surrounded by a family to which there would have been no objection had he previously obtained a dispensation as however he had omitted this preliminary and was able to atone by prayer and payment he had been condemned to do penance probably at his own suggestion as the seclusion will give him sanctity and eventually lead to his promotion when his error shall have been forgotten  illustrationtemple and weeping cypress  both temples are remarkable for their heavily ornamented twostoried porticos which occupy nearly the whole of one end the interior decorations are in a ruinous  condition and evidently very old they have no hindoo emblems  the head lama sent me a present of dried peaches with a bag of walnuts called koalkun by the lepchas and tagasching by the bhoteeas the two terminations alike signifying tree  the view of yoksun from this height was very singular it had the appearance of an enormous deposit banked up against a spur to the south and mountains to the east and apparently levelled by the action of water this deposit seemed as though having once completely filled the valley of the ratong that river had cut a gorge 2000 feet deep between it and the opposite mountain  although the elevation is so low snow falls abundantly at doobdi in winter i was assured that it has been known of the depth of five feet a statement i consider doubtful the quantity is however certainly greater than at equal heights about dorjiling no doubt owing to its proximity to kinchinjunga  i was amused here by watching a child playing with a popgun made of bamboo similar to that of quill with which most english children are familiar which propels pellets by means of a springtrigger made of the upper part of the quill it is easy to conclude such resemblances between the familiar toys of different countries to be accidental but i question their being really so on the plains of india men may often be seen for hours together flying what with us are childrens kites and i procured a jewsharp from tibet these are not the toys of savages but the amusements of people more than halfcivilised and with whom we have had indirect communication from the earliest ages the lepchas play at quoits using slate for the purpose and at the highland  games of putting the stone and drawing the stone chess dice draughts punch hockey and battledore and shuttlecock are all indochinese or tartarian and no one familiar with the wonderful instances of similarity between the monasteries ritual ceremonies attributes vestments and other paraphernalia of the eastern and western churches can fail to acknowledge the importance of recording even the most trifling analogies or similarities between the manners and customs of the young as well as of the old    chapter xv  leave yoksun for kinchinjungaascend ratong valley saltsmuggling over

salttraders from tibetkinchin ascent oflichens surfaces sculptured by snow and iceweather at jongrisnow shades for eyes  i left yoksun on an expedition to kinchinjunga on the 7th of january it was evident that at this season i could not attain any height but i was most anxious to reach the lower limit of that mass of perpetual snow which descends in one continuous sweep from 28000 to 15000 feet and radiates from the summit of kinchin along every spur and shoulder for ten to fifteen miles towards each point of the compass  the route lay for the first mile over the yoksun flat and then wound along the almost precipitous east flank of the ratong 1000 feet above its bed leading through thick forest it was often difficult crossing torrents by calms of bamboo and leading up precipices by notched poles and roots of trees i wondered what could have induced the frequenting of such a route to nepal when there were so many better ones over singalelah till i found from my guide that he had habitually smuggled salt over this pass to avoid the oppressive duty levelled by the dewan on all imports from tibet by the eastern passes he further told  me that it took five days to reach yalloong in nepal front yoksun on the third of which the kanglanamo pass is crossed which is open from april to november but is always heavily snowed owing to this duty and the remoteness of the eastern passes the people on the west side of the great rungeet were compelled to pay an enormous sum for salt and the lamas of changachelling and pemiongchi petitioned dr campbell to use his influence with the nepal court to have the kanglanamo pass reopened and the power of trading with the tibetans of wallanchoon yangma and kambachen restored to them the pass having been closed since the nepalese war to prevent the sikkim people from kidnapping children and slaves as was alleged to be their custom an accusation in which there was probably some truth for the sikkim dingpun who guided dr campbell and myself to mainom tassiding etc since kidnapped or caused to be abducted a girl of brahmin parents from the mai valley of nepal a transaction which cost him some 300 rupees the nepal durbar was naturally furious the more so as the dingpun had no caste and was therefore abhorred by all brahmins restitution was demanded through dr campbell who caused the incensed dingpun to give up his paramour and her jewels he vowed vengeance against dr campbell and found means to gratify it as i shall hereafter show  we passed some immense landslips which had swept the forest into the torrent and exposed white banks of angular detritus of gneiss and granite we crossed one 200 yards long by a narrow treacherous path on a slope of 35 degrees the subjacent gneiss was nearly vertical striking northeast we camped at 6670 feet amongst a vegetation i little expected to find so close to the snows of kinchin it consisted of oak maple birch laurel rhododendron white daphne jessamine arum begonia cyrtandraceae pepper fig menispermum wild cinnamon scitamineae several epiphytic orchids vines and ferns in great abundance  on the following day i proceeded northwest up the ratong river here a furious torrent which we crossed  and then ascended a very steep mountain called mon lepcha immense detached masses of gneiss full of coarse garnets lay on the slope some of which were curiously marked with a series of deep holes large enough to put ones fist in and said to be the footprints of the sacred cow they appeared to me to have been caused by the roots of trees which spread over the rocks in these humid regions and wear channels in the hardest material especially when they follow the direction of its lamination or stratification  i encamped at a place called buckeem alt 8650 ft in a forest of abies brunoniana and webbiana yew oak various rhododendrons and small bamboo snow lay in patches at 8000 feet and the night was cold and clear on the following morning i continued the ascent alternately up steeps and along perfectly level shelves on which were occasionally frozen pools surrounded with dwarf juniper and rhododendrons across one i observed the track of a yak in the snow it presented two ridges probably from the long hair of this animal which trails on the ground sweeping the snow from the centre of its path at 11000 feet the snow lay deep and soft in the woods of silver fir and the coolies waded through it with difficulty  enormous fractured boulders of gneiss were frequent over the whole of mon lepcha from 7000 to 11000 feet they were of the same material as the rock in situ and as unaccountable in their origin as the loose blocks on dorjiling and sinchul spurs at similar elevations often cresting narrow ridges i measured one angular detached block forty feet high resting on a steep narrow shoulder of the spur in a position to which it was impossible it could have rolled and it is equally difficult to suppose that glacial ice deposited it 4000 feet above the bottom of the gorge  except we conclude the valley to have been filled with ice to that depth a glance at the map will show that mon lepcha is remarkably situated opposite the face of kinchinjunga and at the great bend of the ratong had that valley ever been filled with water during a glacial period mon lepcha would have formed a promontory and many floating bergs from kinchin would have been stranded on its flank but i nowhere observed these rocks to be of so fine a granite as i believe the upper rocks of kinchin to be and i consequently cannot advance even that farfetched solution with much plausibility  as i ascended the rocks became more granitic with large crystals of mica the summit was another broad bare flat elevated 13080 feet and fringed by a copse of rose berberry and very alpine rhododendrons the himalayan heather adromeda fastigiata grew abundantly here affording us good fuel  the toilsome ascent through the soft snow and brushwood delayed the coolies who scarcely accomplished five miles in the day some of them having come up by dark i prepared to camp on the mountaintop strewing thick masses of andromeda and moss which latter hung in great tufts from the bushes on the snow my blankets bad not arrived but there was no prospect of a snowstorm  the sun was powerful when i reached the summit and i was so warm that i walked about barefoot on the frozen snow without inconvenience preferring it to continuing in wet stockings the temperature at the time was 295 degrees with a brisk southeast moist wind and the dew point 228 degrees  the night was magnificent brilliant starlight with a pale mist over the mountains the thermometer fell to 155 degrees at 730 pm and one laid upon wood with its bulb freely exposed sank to 75 degrees the snow sparkled with broad  flakes of hoarfrost in the full moon which was so bright that i recorded my observations by its light owing to the extreme cold of radiation i passed a very uncomfortable night the minimum thermometer fell to 1 degrees in shade at sunrise the temperature was 115 degrees that of grass cleared on the previous day from snow and exposed to the sky 65 degrees that on wool 22 degrees and that on the surface of the snow 07 degrees  the sky was clear and every rock leaf twig blade of grass and the snow itself were covered with broad rhomboidal plates of hoarfrost nearly onethird of an inch across while the metal scale of the thermometer instantaneously blistered my tongue as the sun rose the light reflected from these myriads of facets had a splendid effect  before sunrise the atmosphere was still and all but cloudless to the southeast were visible the plains of india at least 140 miles distant where as usual horizontal layers of leaden purple vapour obscured the horizon behind these the sun rose majestically instantly dispersing them while a thin haze spread over all the intervening mountains from its slanting beams reaching me through otherwise imperceptible vapours these as the sun mounted higher again became invisible though still giving that transparency to the atmosphere and brilliant definition of the distances so characteristic of a damp yet clear day  mon lepcha commands a most extensive view of sikkim southward to dorjiling at my feet lay the great and profound valley of the ratong a dark gulf of vegetation looking northward the eye followed that river to the summit of kinchinjunga distant eighteen miles which fronts the beholder as mont blanc does when seen from the mountains on the opposite side of the valley of chamouni to the east are the immense precipices and  glaciers of pundim and on the west those of kubra forming great supporters to the stupendous mountain between them mon lepcha itself is a spur running southeast from the kubra shoulder it is very open and covered with rounded hills for several miles further north terminating in a conspicuous conical black hummock this i have beau told is the true kubra and the great snowy mountain behind it which i here in conformity with the dorjiling nomenclature call kubra has no name being considered a part of kinchin called gubroo of 15000 feet elevation which presents a black cliff to the south  kinchinjunga rises in three heads of nearly equal height the eastern and western tops are respectively 27826 and 28177 feet above the level of the sea which form a line running northwest it exposes many white or grey rocks bare of snow and disposed in strata i am aware that the word strata is inappropriate here the appearance of stratification or bedding if it indicate any structure of the rock being i cannot doubt due to that action which gives parallel cleavage planes to granite in many parts of the world and to which the socalled lamination or foliation of slate and gneiss is supposed by many geologists to be due it is not usual to find this structure so uniformly and conspicuously developed through large masses of granite as it appeared to me to be on the sides of kinchinjunga and on the top of junnoo as seen from the choonjerma pass chapter xi plate but it is sometimes very conspicuous and nowhere more than in the descent of the grimsel towards meyringen where the granite on the east flank of that magnificent gorge seems cleft into parallel nearly vertical strata sloping to the west the colour of all which above 20000 feet and the rounded knobbed form of the summit suggest a granitic formation lofty snowed ridges project from kubra into the ratong valley presenting black precipices of stratified rocks to the southward pundim has a very grand appearance being eight miles distant and nearly 9000 feet above mon lepcha it subtends an angle of 12 degrees while kinchin top though 15000 feet higher than mon lepcha being eighteen miles distant rises only 9 degrees 30 minutes above the true horizon these angular heights are too small to give much grandeur and apparent elevation to mountains however lofty nor would they do so in this case were it not that the ratong valley which intervenes is seen to be several thousand feet lower and many degrees below the real horizon  illustrationkinchinjunga and pundim from mon lepcha  pundim has a tremendous precipice to the south which to judge from its bareness of snow must be nearly perpendicular and it presented a superb geological section the height of this precipice i found by angles with a pocket sextant to be upwards of 3400 feet and that of its top to be 21300 above the sea and consequently only 715 feet less than that of the summit of pundim itself which is 22015 feet this cliff is of black stratified rocks sloping to the west and probably striking northwest permeated from top to bottom by veins of white granite disposed in zigzag lines which produce a contortion of the gneiss and give it a marbled appearance the same structure may be seen in miniature on the transported blocks which abound in the sikkim rivers where veins of finely grained granite are forced in  all directions through the gneiss and form parallel seams or beds between the laminae of that rock united by transverse seams and crumpling up the gneiss itself like the crushed leaves of a book the summit of pundim itself is all of white rock rounded in shape and forming a cap to the gneiss which weathers into precipices  a succession of ridges 14000 to 18000 feet high presented a line of precipices running south from pundim for several miles immense granite veins are exposed on their surfaces and they are capped by stratified rocks sloping to the east and apparently striking to the northwest which being black contrast strongly with the white granite beneath them these ridges instead of being roundtopped are broken into splintered crags behind which rises the beautiful conical peak of nursing 19139 feet above the sea eight miles distant and subtending an angle of 8 degrees 30 minutes  at the foot of these precipices was a very conspicuous series of lofty moraines round whose bases the ratong wound these appeared of much the same height rising several hundred feet above the valley they were comparatively leveltopped and had steep shelving rounded sides  i have been thus particular in describing the upper ratong valley because it drains the south face of the loftiest mountain on the globe and i have introduced angular heights and been precise in my details because the vagueness with which all terms are usually applied to the apparent altitude and steepness of mountains and precipices is apt to give false impressions it is essential to attend to such points where scenery of real interest and importance is to be described it is customary to speak of peaks as towering in the air which yet subtend an angle of very few degrees of almost precipitous ascents  which when measured are found to be slopes of 18 degrees or 20 degrees and of cliffs as steep and stupendous which are inclined at a very moderate angle  the effect of perspective is as often to deceive in details as to give truth to general impressions and those accessories are sometimes wanting in nature which when supplied by art give truth to the landscape thus a streak of clouds adds height to a peak which should appear lofty but which scarcely rises above the true horizon and a belt of mist will sunder two snowy mountains which though at very different distances for want of a play of light and shade on their dazzling surfaces and from the extreme transparency of the air in lofty regions appear to be at the same distance from the observer  the view to the southward from mon lepcha including the country between the sealike plains of india and the loftiest mountain on the globe is very grand and neither wanting in variety nor in beauty from the deep valleys choked with tropical luxuriance to the scanty yak pasturage on the heights above seems but a step at the first coupdoceil but resolves itself on a closer inspection into five belts 1 palm and plantain 2 oak and laurel 3 pine 4 rhododendron and grass and 5 rock and snow from the bed of the ratong in which grow palms with screwpine and plantain it is only seven miles in a direct line to the perpetual ice from the plains of india or outer himalaya one may behold snowy peaks rise in the distance behind a foreground of tropical forest here on the contrary all the intermediate phases of vegetation are seen at a glance except in the himalaya this is no common phenomenon and is owing to the very remarkable depth of the riverbeds that part of the valley of the ratong where tropical vegetation ceases is but 4000  feet above the sea and though fully fifty miles as the crow flies and perhaps 200 by the windings of the river from the plains of india is only eight in a straight line and forty by the windings from the snows which feed that river in other words the descent is so rapid that in eight miles the ratong waters every variety of vegetation from the lichen of the poles to the palm of the tropics whilst throughout the remainder of its mountain course it falls from 4000 to 300 feet flowing amongst tropical scenery through a valley whose flanks rise from 5000 to 12000 feet above its bed  from mon lepcha we proceeded northwest towards jongri along a very open rounded bare mountain covered with enormous boulders of gneiss of which the subjacent rock is also composed the soil is a thick clay full of angular stones everywhere scooped out into little depressions which are the dry beds of pools and are often strewed with a thin layer of pebbles black tufts of alpine aromatic rhododendrons of two kinds r anthopogon and setosum with dwarf juniper comprised all the conspicuous vegetation at this season  after a two hours walk keeping at 13000 feet elevation we sighted jongri i am assured by capt sherwill who in 1852 proceeded along and surveyed the nepal frontier beyond this point to gubroo that this is not jongri but yangpoong the difficulty of getting precise information especially as to the names of seldomvisited spots is very great i was often deceived myself undesignedly i am sure on the part of my informants but in this case i have dr campbells assurance who has kindly investigated the subject that there is no mistake on my part captain sherwill has also kindly communicated to me a map of the head waters of the rungbee yungya and yalloong rivers of which being more correct than my own i have gladly availed myself for my map gubroo he informs me is 15000 feet in altitude and dips in a precipice 1000 feet high facing kubra which prevented his exploring further north there were two stone huts on the bleak face of the spur scarcely distinguishable at the distance of half a mile from the great blocks around them to the north gubroo rose in dismal grandeur backed by the dazzling snows of kubra which now seemed quite near its lofty top alt 24005 feet being only eight miles distant much snow lay on the ground in patches and there were few remains of herbaceous vegetation those i recognised were chiefly of poppy potentilla gentian geranium fritillary umbelliferae grass and sedges  on our arrival at the huts the weather was still fine with a strong northwest wind which meeting the warm moist current from the ratong valley caused much precipitation of vapour as i hoped to be able to visit the surrounding glaciers from this spot i made arrangements for a stay of some days giving up the only habitable hut to my people i spread my blankets in a slope from its roof to the ground building a little stone dyke round the skirts of my dwelling and a fireplace in front  hence to yalloong in nepal by the kanglanamo pass is two days march the route crosses the singalelah range at an elevation of about 15000 feet south of kubra and north of a mountain that forms a conspicuous feature southwest from jongri as a crest of black fingered peaks tipped with snow  it is difficult to conceive the amount of labour expended upon every pound of salt imported into this part of sikkim from tibet and as an enumeration of the chief features of the routes it must follow will give some idea of what the circuit of the loftiest mountain in the globe involves i shall briefly allude to them premising that the circuit of mont blanc may be easily accomplished in four days the shortest route to yoksun the first village south of kinchin from the nearest tibetan village north of that mountain involves a detour of onethird of the  circumference of kinchin it is evident that the most direct way must be that nearest the mountaintop and therefore that which reaches the highest accessible elevation on its shoulders and which at the same time dips into the shallowest valleys between those shoulders the actual distance in a straight line is about fifty miles from yoksun to the mart at or near tashirukpa  the marches between them are as follows    1 to yalloong two days crossing kanglanamo pass 15000 feet high    3 to foot of choonjerma pass descending to 10000 feet    4 cross choonjerma pass 15260 feet and proceed to kambachen        11400 feet    5 cross nango pass 15770 and camp on yangma river 11000 feet    6 ascend to foot of kanglachem pass and camp at 15000 feet    7 cross kanglachem pass probably 16500 feet and    810 it is said to be three marches hence to the tibetan customhouse and that two more snowy passes are crossed  this allows no day of rest and gives only five milesas the crow fliesto be accomplished each day but i assume fully fourteen of road distance the labour spent in which would accomplish fully thirty over good roads four snowed passes at least are crossed all above 15000 feet and after the first day the path does not descend below 10000 feet by this route about onethird of the circuit of kinchinjunga is accomplished supposing the circuit were to be completed by the shortest practicable route that is keeping as near the summit as possible the average time required for a man with his load would be upwards of a month  to reach tashirukpa by the eastern route from yoksun being a journey of about twentyfive days requires a long detour to the southward and eastward and afterwards the ascent of the teesta valley to kongra lama and so north to the tibetan arun  my first operation after encamping and arranging my instruments was to sink the ground thermometer but the earth being frozen for sixteen inches it took four men several hours work with hammer and chisel to penetrate so deep there was much vegetable matter for the first eight or ten inches and below that a fine red clay i spent the afternoon which was fine in botanising when the sun shone the smell of the two rhododendrons was oppressive especially as a little exertion at this elevation brings on headache there were few mosses but crustaceous lichens were numerous and nearly all of them of scotch alpine european and arctic kinds the names of these given by the classical linnaeus and wahlenberg tell in some cases of their birthplaces in others of their hardihood their lurid colours and weatherbeaten aspects such as tristis gelida glacialis arctica alpina saxatilis polaris frigida and numerous others equally familiar to the scotch botanist i recognised many as natives of the wild mountains of cape horn and the rocks of the stormy antarctic ocean since visiting which regions i had not gathered them the lichen called geographicus was most abundant and is found to indicate a certain degree of cold in every latitude descending to the level of the sea in latitude 52 degrees north and 50 degrees south but in lower latitudes only to be seen on mountains it flourishes at 10000 feet on the himalaya ascending thence to 18000 feet its name however was not intended to indicate its wide range but the curious  maplike patterns which its yellow crust forms on the rocks  of the blocks of gneiss scattered over the jongri spur many are twenty feet in diameter the ridge slopes gently southwest to the choroong river and more steeply northeast to the ratong facing kinchin it rises so very gradually to a peaked mountain between jongri and kubra that it is not possible to account for the transport and deposit of these boulders by glaciers of the ordinary form viz by a stream of ice following the course of a valley and we are forced to speculate upon the possibility of ice having capped the whole spur and moved downwards transporting blocks from the prominences on various parts of the spur  the cutting up of the whole surface of this rounded mountain into little pools now dry of all sizes from ten to about one hundred yards in circumference is a very striking phenomenon the streams flow in shallow transverse valleys each passing through a succession of such pools accompanying a steplike character of the general surface the beds are stony becoming more so where they enter the pools upon several of the larger of which i observed curving ridges of large stones radiating outwards on to their beds from either margin of the entering stream more generally large stones were deposited opposite every embouchure  this superficial sculpturing must have been a very recent operation and the transport of the heavy stones opposite the entrance of the streams has been effected by ice and perhaps by snow just as the arctic ice strews the shores of the polar ocean with rocks  the weather had been threatening all day northern and westerly currents contending aloft with the southeast  tradewind of sikkim and meeting in strife over the great upper valley of the ratong stately masses of white cumuli wheeled round that gulf of glaciers partially dissipating in an occasional snowstorm but on the whole gradually accumulating  on my arrival the thermometer was 32 degrees with a powerful sun shining and it fell to 28 degrees at 4 pm when the north wind set in at sunset the moon rose through angry masses of woolly cirrus its broad full orb threw a flood of yellow light over the serried tops south of pundim thence advancing obliquely towards nursing it stood tiptoe for a few minutes on that beautiful pyramid of snow whence it seemed to take flight and mount majestically into midair illuminating kinchin pundim and kubra  i sat at the entrance of my gipsylike hut anxiously watching the weather and absorbed in admiration of the moonrise from which my thoughts were soon diverted by its fading light as it entered a dense mass of marestail cirrus it was very cold and the stillness was oppressive i had been urged not to attempt such an ascent in january my provisions were scanty firewood only to be obtained from some distance the open undulating surface of jongri was particularly exposed to heavy snowdrifts and the path was at the best a scarcely perceptible track i followed every change of the wind every fluctuation of the barometer and thermometer each accession of humidity and the courses of the clouds aloft at 7 pm the wind suddenly shifted to the west and the thermometer instantly rose from 20 degrees to 30 degrees after 8 pm the temperature fell again and the wind drew round from west by south to northeast when the fog cleared off the barometer rose no more than it usually does towards 10 pm and though it clouded again with the temperature at 17 degrees the wind  seemed steady and i went to bed with a relieved mind  jan 10during the night the temperature fell to 112 degrees and at 6 am was 198 degrees falling again to 17 degrees soon after though clouds were rapidly coming up from the west and southwest the wind remained northerly till 8 am when it shifted to southwest and the temperature rose to 25 degrees as it continued fine with the barometer high i ventured on a walk towards gubroo carefully taking bearings of my position i found a good many plants in a rocky valley close to that mountain which i in vain attempted to ascend the air was 30 degrees with a strong and damp southwest wind and the cold was so piercing that two lads who were with me although walking fast became benumbed and could not return without assistance at 11 am a thick fog obliged us to retrace our steps it was followed by snow in soft round pellets like sago that swept across the hard ground during the afternoon it snowed unceasingly the wind repeatedly veering round the compass always from west to east by south and so by north to west again the flakes were large soft and moist with the south wind and small hard and dry with the north glimpses of blue sky were constantly seen to the south under the gloomy canopy above but they augured no change as darkness came on the temperature fell to 15 degrees and it snowed very hard at 6 pm it was 11 degrees but rose afterwards to 18 degrees  the night was very cold and wintry i sat for some hours behind a blanket screen which had to be shifted every few minutes at my tentdoor keeping up a sulky fire and peering through the snow for signs of improvement but in vain the clouds were not dense for the moons light was distinct shining on the glittering snowflakes that fell relentlessly my anxiety was great and i could not help censuring myself severely for exposing a party to so great danger at such a season i found comfort in the belief that no idle curiosity had prompted me and that with a good motive and a strong prestige of success one can surmount a host of difficulties still the snow fell and my heart sank as my fire declined and the flakes sputtered on the blackening embers my little puppy who had gambolled all day amongst the drifting white pellets now whined and crouched under my thick woollen cloak the inconstant searching wind drifted the snow into the tent whose roof so bagged in with the accumulation that i had to support it with sticks and dreaded being smothered if the weight should cause it to sink upon my bed during my sleep the increasing cold drove me however to my blankets and taking the precaution of stretching a tripod stand over my head so as to leave a breathing hole by supporting the roof if it fell in i slept soundly with my dog at my feet  at sunrise the following morning the sky was clear with a light north wind about two feet of snow had fallen the drifts were deep and all trace of the path obliterated the minimum thermometer had fallen to 37 degrees the temperature rose to 27 degrees at 9 am after which the wind fell and with it the thermometer to 18 degrees soon however southerly breezes set in bringing up heavy masses of clouds  my lighthearted companions cheerfully prepared to leave the ground they took their appointed loads without a murmur and sought protection for their eyes from the glare of the newly fallen snow some with as much of my crape veil as i could spare others with shades of brown paper or of hair from the yaks tails whilst a few had spectacleshades of woven hair and the lepchas loosened their pigtails and combed their long hair over their eyes and faces it is from freshfallen snow alone that much inconvenience is felt owing i suppose to the light reflected from the myriads of facets which the crystals of snow present i have never suffered inconvenience in crossing beds of old snow or glaciers with weathered surfaces which absorb a great deal of light and reflect comparatively little and that little coloured green or blue  the descent was very laborious especially through the several miles of bush and rock which lie below the summit so that although we started at 10 am it was dark by the time we reached buckeem where we found two lame coolies whom we had left on our way up and who were keeping up a glorious fire for our reception  illustrationmaitrya the sixth or coming boodh     chapter xvi  ratong river below mon lepchafernsvegetation of yoksun

heehillarrive at little rungeetat dorjilingits deserted and wintry appearance  on the following day we marched to yoksun the weather was fair though it was evidently snowing on the mountains above i halted at the ratong river at the foot of mon lepcha where i found its elevation to be 7150 feet its edges were frozen and the temperature of the water 36 degrees it is here a furious torrent flowing between gneiss rocks which dip southsoutheast and is flanked by flattopped beds of boulders gravel and sand twelve to fourteen feet thick its vegetation resembles that of dorjiling but is more alpine owing no doubt to the proximity of kinchinjunga the magnificent rhododendron argenteum was growing on its banks on the other hand i was surprised to see a beautiful fern a trichomanes very like the irish one which is not found at dorjiling the same day at about the same elevation i gathered sixty species of fern many of very tropical forms they consisted of the abovementioned trichomanes three hymenophyllae vittaria pleopeltis and marattia together with several selaginellas no doubt the range of such genera is extended in proportion to the extreme damp and equable climate here as about dorjiling treeferns are however absent and neither plantains epiphytical orchideae nor palms are so abundant or ascend so high as on the outer ranges about yoksun itself which occupies a very warm sheltered flat many tropical genera occur such as tall bamboos of two kinds grasses allied to the sugarcane scarlet erythrina and various araliaceae amongst which was one species whose pith was of so curious a structure that i had no hesitation in considering the then unknown chinese substance called ricepaper to belong to a closely allied plant the chinese ricepaper has long been known to be cut from cylinders of pith which has always a central hollow chamber divided into compartments by septa or excessively thin plates it is only within the last few months that my supposition has been confirmed by my fathers receiving from china after many years of correspondence specimens of the ricepaper plant itself which very closely resemble in botanical characters as well as in outward appearance of size and habit the sikkim plant  the natives collect the leaves of many aralias as fodder for cattle for which purpose they are of the greatest service in a country where grass for pasture is so scarce this is the more remarkable since they belong to the natural family of ivy which is usually poisonous the use of this food however gives a peculiar taste to the butter in other parts of sikkim figleaves are used for the same purpose and branches of a birdcherry prunus a plant also of a very poisonous family abounding in prussic acid  we were received with great kindness by the villagers of yoksun who had awaited our return with some anxiety and on hearing of our approach had collected large supplies of food amongst other things were tares called by the lepchas kullai yams book and a bread made by bruising together damp maize and rice into tough thin cakes ketchung tapha the lamas of doobdi were especially civil having a favour to ask which was that i would intercede with dr campbell to procure the permission of the nepalese to reopen the kanglanamo pass and thus give some occupation to their herds of yaks which were now wandering idly about  i botanized for two days on the yoksun flat searching for evidence of lacustrine strata or moraines being more than ever convinced by the views i had obtained of this place from mon lepcha that its uniformity of surface was due to water action it is certainly the most level area of its size that i know of in sikkim though situated in one of the deepest valleys and surrounded on almost all sides by very steep mountains and it is far above the flat gravel terraces of the present riverbeds i searched the surface of the flat for gravel beds in vain for though it abounds in depressions that must have formerly been lakebeds and are now marshes in the rainy season these were all floored with clay along the western edge where the descent is very steep for 1800 feet to the ratong i found no traces of stratified deposits though the spurs which projected from it were often flattened at top the only existing lake has sloping clay banks covered with spongy vegetable mould it has no permanent affluent or outlet its present drainage being subterranean or more probably by evaporation but there is an old waterchannel several feet above its level it is eighty to a hundred yards across and nearly circular its depth three or four feet increased to fifteen or sixteen in the rains like all similar pools in sikkim it contains little or no animal life at this season and i searched in vain for shells insects or frogs all around were great blocks of gneiss some fully twelve feet square  the situation of this lake is very romantic buried in a tall forest of oaks and laurels and fringed by wild camellia shrubs the latter are not the leafy deep green largeblossomed plants of our greenhouses but twiggy bushes with small scattered leaves and little yellowish flowers like those of the teaplant the massive walls of a ruined temple rise close to the water which looks like the still moat of a castle beside it are some grand old funereal cypresses with ragged scattered branches below where they struggle for light in the dense forest but raising their heads aloft as bright green pyramids  illustrationaltar and songboom at yoksun  after some difficulty i found the remains of a broad path that divided into two one of them led to a second ruined temple fully a mile off and the other i followed to a grove in which was a gigantic chait it was a beautiful lane throughout bordered with bamboo brambles gayflowered melastomaceae like hedgeroses and scarlet erythrina there were many old mendongs and chaits on the way which i was always careful to leave on the right hand in passing such being the rule among boodhists the same which ordains that the prayingcylinder or mani be made to revolve in a direction against the suns motion  this great chait is the largest in sikkim it is called nirbogong and appears to be fully forty feet high facing it is a stone altar about fifteen feet long and four broad and behind this again is a very curious erection called songboom used for burning juniper as incense it resembles a small smelting furnace and consists of an elongated conical stone building eight feet high raised on a single block it is hollow and divided into three stories or chambers in the lower of which is a door by which fuel is placed inside and the smoke ascending through holes in the upper slabs escapes by lateral openings from the top compartment these structures are said to be common in tibet but i saw no other in sikkim  during my stay at yoksun the weather was very cold especially at night considering the elevation 5600 feet the mean temperature was 39 degrees the extremes being 192 degrees and 60 degrees and even at 8 am the thermometer laid on the frosty grass stood at 20 degrees temperatures which are rare at dorjiling 1500 feet higher i could not but regard with surprise such half tropical genera as perennialleaved vines saccharum erythrina large bamboos osbeckia and cultivated millet resisting such low temperatures this is no doubt due to the temperature of the soil being always high i did not sink a thermometer at yoksun but from observations taken at similar elevations the temperature of the earth at three feet depth may be assumed to be 55 degrees  on the 14th january i left yoksun for the lake and temples of catsuperri the former of which is by much the largest in sikkim after a steep descent of 1800 feet we reached the ratong where its bed is only 3790 feet above the sea it is here a turbulent stream twelve yards across with the usual features of gravel terraces huge boulders of gneiss and some of the same rock in situ striking northeast some idea of its velocity may be formed from the descent it makes from the foot of mon lepcha where the elevation of its bed was 7150 feet giving a fall of 3350 feet in only ten miles  hence i ascended a very steep spur through tropical vegetation now become so familiar to me that i used to count the number of species belonging to the different large natural orders as i went along i gathered only thirtyfive ferns at these low elevations in the same space as produces from fifty to sixty in the more equable and humid regions of 6000 feet grasses on the other hand were much more numerous the view of the flat of yoksun from lungschung village opposite to it and on about the same level is curious as is that of the hamlet of lathiang on the same side which i have before noticed as being placed on a very singular flat shelf above the ratong and is overhung by rocks  ascending very steeply for several thousand feet we reached a hollow on the catsuperri spur beyond which the lake lies buried in a deep forest a lama from the adjacent temple accompanied us and i found my people affecting great solemnity as they approached its sacred bounds they incessantly muttered om mani etc kotowed to trees and stones and hung bits of rag on the bushes a pretence of opposing our progress was made by the priest who of course wanted money this i did not appear to notice and after a steep descent we were soon on the shores of what is for sikkim a grand sheet of water 6040 feet above the sea without any apparent outlet it may be from three to five hundred yards across in the rains but was much less now and was bordered by a broad marsh of bog moss sphagnum in which were abundance of azolla colouring the waters red and sedges along the banks were bushes of rhododendron barbatum and berberis insignis this magnificent new species has not been introduced into england it forms a large bush with deepgreen leaves seven inches long and bunches of yellow flowers but the mass of the vegetation was similar to that of dorjiling  we crossed the marsh to the edge of the lake by a rude paved way of decaying logs through which we often plunged up to our knees the lama had come provided with a piece of bark shaped like a boat some juniper incense and a matchbox with which he made a fire and put it in the boat which he then launched on the lake as a votive offering to the presiding deity it was a dead calm but the impetus he gave to the bark shot it far across the lake whose surface was soon covered with a thick cloud of white smoke taking a rupee from me the priest then waved his arm aloft and pretended to throw the money into the water singing snatches of prayers in tibetan and at times shrieking at the top of his voice to the dryad who claims these woods and waters as his own there was neither bird beast nor insect to be seen and the scenery was as impressive to me as the effect of the simple service was upon my people who prayed with redoubled fervour and hung more rags on the bushes  i need hardly say that this invocation of the gods of the woods and waters forms no part of lama worship but the lepchas are but half boodhists in their hearts they dread the demons of the grove the lake the snowy mountain and the torrent and the crafty lama takes advantage of this modifies his practices to suit their requirements and is content with the formal recognition of the spiritual supremacy of the church this is most remarkably shown in their acknowledgment of the day on which offerings had been made from time immemorial by the pagan lepchas to the genius of kinchinjunga by holding it as a festival of the church throughout sikkim on that occasion an invocation to the mountain is chanted by priests and people in chorus like the lamas address to the genius of catsuperri lake its meaning if it ever had any is not now apparent it runs thus             kanchinjinga pemi kadup              gnetche tangla dursha tember              zu jinga pemsum serkiem              dischze kubra kanchin tong this was written for me by dr campbell who like myself has vainly sought its solution it is probably a mixture of tibetan and lepcha both as much corrupted as the celebrated om mani padmi boom which is universally pronounced by lepchas menny pemmy boom this reminds me that i never got a solution of this sentence from a lama of whatever rank or learning and it was only after incessant inquiry during a residence of many years in nepal that mr hodgson at last procured the interpretation or rather paraphrase hail to him sakya of the lotus and the jewel which is very much the same as m klaproth and other authorities have given  the two catsuperri temples occupy a spur 445 feet above the lake and 6485 feet above the sea they are poor and only remarkable for a miserable weepingwillow tree planted near them said to have been brought from lhassa the monks were very civil to me and offered amongst other things a present of excellent honey one was an intelligent man and gave me much information he told me that there were upwards of twenty religious establishments in sikkim containing more than 1000 priests these have various claims upon the devout thus tassiding doobdi changachelling and pemiongchi are celebrated for their antiquity and the latter also for being the residence of the head lama catsuperri for its lake raklang for its size etc all are under one spiritual head who is the tupgain lama or eldest son of the rajah and who resides at the phadong convent near tumloong the lama of pemiongchi is however the most highly respected on account of his age position and sanctity advancement in the hierarchy is dependent chiefly on interest but indirectly on works also pilgrimages to lhassa and teshoo loombo are the highest of these and it is clearly the interest of the supreme pontiffs of those ecclesiastical capitals to encourage such and to intimate to the sikkim authorities the claims those who perform them have for preferment dispensations for petty offences are granted to lamas of low degree and monks by those of higher station but crimes against the church are invariably referred to tibet and decided there  the election to the sikkim lamaseries is generally conducted on the principle of selfgovernment but pemiongchi and some others are often served by lamas appointed from tibet or ordained there at some of the great convents i never heard of an instance of any sikkim lama arriving at such sanctity as to be considered immortal and to reappear after death in another individual nor is there any election of infants all are of the ningma dookpa or shammar sect and are distinguished by their red mitres they were once dominant throughout tibet but after many wars the following account of the early war between the red and the yellowmitred lamas was given me by tchebu lamafor twentyfive generations the redcape dookpa or ningma prevailed in tibet when they split into two sects who contended for supreme power the lama of phado who headed the dissenters and adopted a yellow mitre being favoured by the emperor of china to whom reference was made a persecution of the red lamas followed who were caught by the yellowcaps and their mitres plunged into dyeing vats kept always ready at the lamaseries the dookpa however still held teshoo loombo and applied to the sokpo north tibet lamas for aid who bringing horses and camels easily prevailed over the gelookpa or yellow sect but afterwards treacherously went over to them and joined them in an attack on teshoo loombo which was plundered and occupied by the gelookpas the dookpa thereafter took refuge in sikkim and bhotan whence the bhotan rajah became their spiritual chief under the name of dhurma rajah and is now the representative of that creed goorucknath is still the dookpas favourite spiritual deity of the older creed which is however no longer in the ascendant the dalai lama of teshoo loombo is a gelookpa as is the rimbochay lama and the potala lama of lhassa according to tchebu lama but turner travels in tibet p 315 says the contrary the gelookpa consider sakya thoba or tsongkaba alias mahamouni as their great avatar with the yellowcaps they were driven from that country and took refuge principally in the himalaya the bhotan or dhurma bhotan is generally known as the dhurma country see note chapter v rajah became the spiritual head of this sect and as is well known disputes the temporal government also of his country with the deva rajah who is the hereditary temporal monarch and never claims spiritual jurisdiction i am indebted to dr campbell for a copy and translation of the dhurma rajahs great seal containing the attributes of his spirituality a copy of which i have appended to the end of this chapter  the internal organisation of the different monastic establishments is very simple the head or teshoo lama i have been informed by letters from dr campbell that the pemiongchi lama is about to remove the religious capital of sikkim to dorjiling and build there a grand temple and monastery this will be attractive to visitors and afford the means of extending our knowledge of east tibet rules supreme then come the monks and various orders of priests and then those who are candidates for orders and dependents both laybrothers and slaves there are a few nunneries in sikkim and the nuns are all relatives or connections of the rajah his sister is amongst them during the greater part of the year all lead a more or less idle life the dependents being the most occupied in carrying wood and water cultivating the land etc  the laybrothers are often skilful workmen and are sometimes lent or hired out as labourers especially as housebuilders and decorators no tax of any kind is levied on the church which is frequently very rich in land flocks and herds and in contributions from the people land is sometimes granted by the rajah but is oftener purchased by the priests or willed or given by the proprietor the services to which i have already alluded are very irregularly performed in most temples only on festival days which correspond to the tibetan ones so admirably described in mm huc and gabets narrative in a few however service is performed daily especially in such as stand near frequented roads and hence reap the richest harvest  like all the natives of tibet and sikkim the priests are intolerably filthy in some cases so far carrying out their doctrines as not even to kill the vermin with which they swarm all are nominally bound to chastity but exemptions in favour of lamas of wealth rank or power are granted by the supreme pontiffs both in tibet and sikkim i constantly found swarms of children about the lamaseries who were invariably called nephews and nieces  descending from the catsuperri temples i encamped at the village of tengling elevation 5257 feet where i was waited upon by a bevy of forty women lepchas and sikkim bhoteeas accompanied by their children and bringing presents of fowls rice and vegetables and apologising for the absence of their male relatives who were gone to carry tribute to the rajah thence i marched to changachelling first descending to the tengling river which divides the catsuperri from the molli ridge and which i crossed  treeferns here advance further north than in any other part of sikkim i did not visit the molli temples but crossed the spur of that name to the rungbee river whose bed is 3300 feet above the sea thence i ascended upwards of 3500 feet to the changachelling temples passing tchongpong village the ridge on which both pemiongchi and changachelling are built is excessively narrow at top it is traversed by a via sacra connecting these two establishments this is a pretty wooded walk passing mendongs and chaits hoary with lichens and mosses to the north the snows of kinchinjunga are seen glimmering between the trunks of oaks laurels and rhododendrons while to the south the sinchul and dorjiling spurs shut out the view of the plains of india  changachelling temples and chaits crown a beautiful rocky eminence on the ridge their roofs cones and spires peeping through groves of bamboo rhododendrons and arbutus the ascent is by broad flights of steps cut in the micaslate rocks up which shaven and girdled monks with rosaries and long red gowns were dragging loads of bamboo stems that produced a curious rattling noise at the summit there is a fine temple with the ruins of several others and of many houses the greater part of the principal temple which is twostoried and divided into several compartments is occupied by families the monks were busy repairing the part devoted to worship which consists of a large chamber and vestibule of the usual form the outside walls are daubed red with a pigment of burnt felspathic clay which is dug hard by some were painting the vestibule with colours brought from lhassa where they had been trained to the art amongst other figures was one playing on a guitar a very common symbol in the vestibules of sikkim temples i also saw an angel playing on the flute and a snakeking offering fruit to a figure in the water who was grasping a serpent amongst the figures i was struck by that of an englishman whom to my amusement and the limners great delight i recognised as myself i was depicted in a flowered silk coat instead of a tartan shooting jacket my shoes were turned up at the toes and i had on spectacles and a tartar cap and was writing notes in a book on one side a snakeking was politely handing me fruit and on the other a horrible demon was writhing  a crowd had collected to see whether i should recognise myself and when i did so the merriment was extreme they begged me to send them a supply of vermilion goldleaf and brushes our so called camelshair pencils being much superior to theirs which are made of marmots hair  i was then conducted to a house where i found salted and buttered tea and murwa beer smoking in hospitable preparation as usual the house was of wood and the inhabited apartments above the low basement story were approached by an outside ladder like a swiss cottage within were two rooms floored with earth the inner was small and opened on a verandah that faced kinchinjunga whence the keen wind whistled through the apartment  the head lama my jolly fat friend of the 20th of december came to breakfast with me followed by several children nephews and nieces he said but they were uncommonly like him for such a distant relationship and he seemed extremely fond of them and much pleased when i stuffed them with sugar  changachelling hill is remarkable for having on its summit an immense tabular mass of chlorite slate resting apparently horizontally on variously inclined rocks of the same it is quite flattopped ten to twelve yards each way and the sides are squared by art the country people attribute its presence here to a miracle  the view of the kinchin range from this spot being one of the finest in sikkim and the place itself being visible from dorjiling i took a very careful series of bearings which with those obtained at pemiongchi were of the utmost use in improving my map which was gradually progressing to my disappointment i found that neither priest nor people knew the name of a single snowy mountain i also asked in vain for some interpretation of the lines i have quoted at earlier they said they were lepcha worship and that they only used them for the gratification of the people on the day of the great festival of kinchinjunga  hence i descended to the kulhait river on my route back to dorjiling visiting my very hospitable tippling friend the kajee of lingcham on the way down he humbly begged me to get him a pair of spectacles for no other object than to look wise as he had the eyes of a hawk he told me that mine drew down universal respect in sikkim and that i had been drawn with them on in the temple at changachelling and that a pair would not only wonderfully become him but afford him the most pleasing recollections of myself happily i had the means of gratifying him and have since been told that he wears them on state occasions  i encamped by the river 3160 feet above the sea amongst figs and plantains on a broad terrace of pebbles boulders and sand ten feet above the stream the rocks in the latter were covered with a red conferva the sand on the banks was disposed in layers alternately white and red the white being quartz and the red pulverised garnets the arranging of these sandbands by the water must be due to the different specific gravities of the garnet and quartz the former being lighter is lifted by the current on to the surface of the quartz and left there when the waters retire  on the next day i ascended hee hill crossed it at an elevation of 7290 feet and camped on the opposite side at 6680 feet in a dense forest the next march was still southward to the little rungeet guardhouse below dorjiling spur which i reached after a fatiguing walk amidst torrents of rain the banks of the little rungeet river which is only 1670 feet above the sea are very flat and low with broad terraces of pebbles and shingle upon which are huge gneiss boulders fully 200 feet above the stream  on the 19th of january i ascended the tukvor spur to dorjiling and received a most hospitable welcome from my friend mr muller now almost the only european inhabitant of the place mr hodgson having gone down on a shooting excursion in the terai and dr campbell being on duty on the bhotan frontier the place looked what it really waswholly deserted the rain i had experienced in the valley had here been snow and the appearance of the broad snowed patches clear of trees and of the many houses without smoke or inhabitant and the tall scattered trees with black bark and all but naked branches was dismal in the extreme the effect was heightened by an occasional hindoo who flitted here and there along the road crouching and shivering with white cotton garments and bare legs  the delight of my lepcha attendants at finding themselves safely at home again knew no bounds and their parents waited on me with presents and other tokens of their goodwill and gratitude i had no lack of volunteers for a similar excursion in the following season though with their usual fickleness more than half failed me long before the time arrived for putting their zeal to the proof    i am indebted to dr campbell for the accompanying impression and description of the seal of the dhurma rajah or sovereign pontiff of bhotan and spiritual head of the whole sect of the dookpa or redmitred lama boodhists the translations were made by aden tchehu lama who accompanied us into sikkim in 1849 and i believe they are quite correct the tibetan characters run from left to right  the seal of the dhurma rajah is divided into a centre portion and sixteen rays in the centre is the word dookyin which means the dookpa creed around the dookyin are sixteen similar letters meaning i or i am the sixteen radial compartments contain his titles and attributes thus commencing from the centre erect one and passing round from left to right  1 i am the spiritual and temporal chief of the realm 2 the defender of the faith 3 equal to saruswati in learning 4 chief of all the boodhs 5 head expounder of the

the hills where carts were provided to carry them five days journey to the mahanuddy river which flows into the ganges whence they were transported by water to calcutta  on the 27th of february i left dorjiling to join mr hodgson at titalya on the plains the weather was raw cold and threatening snow lay here and there at 7000 feet and all vegetation was very backward and wore a wintry garb the laurels maples and deciduousleaved oaks hydrangea and cherry were leafless but the abundance of chesnuts and evergreen oaks rhododendrons aucuba linonia and other shrubs kept the forest well clothed the oaks had borne a very unusual number of acorns during  the last season which were now falling and strewing the road in some places so abundantly that it was hardly safe to ride down hill  the plains of bengal were all but obscured by a dense haze partly owing to a peculiar state of the atmosphere that prevails in the dry months and partly to the fires raging in the terai forest from which white wreaths of smoke ascended stretching obliquely for miles to the eastward and filling the air with black particles of grassstems carried 4000 feet aloft by the heated ascending currents that impinge against the flanks of the mountains  in the tropical region the air was scented with the white blossoms of the vitex agnuscastus which grew in profusion by the roadside but the forest which had looked so gigantic on my arrival at the mountains the previous year appeared small after the far more lofty and bulky oaks and pines of the upper regions of the himalaya  the evening was sultry and close the heated surface of the earth seemed to load the surrounding atmosphere with warm vapours and the sensation as compared with the cool pure air of dorjiling was that of entering a confined tropical harbour after a long seavoyage  i slept in the little bungalow of punkabaree and was wakened next morning by sounds to which i had long been a stranger the voices of innumerable birds and the humming of great bees that bore large holes for their dwellings in the beams and rafters of houses never before had i been so forcibly struck with the absence of animal life in the regions of the upper himalaya  breakfasting early i pursued my way in the socalled cool of the morning but this was neither bright nor fresh the night having been hazy there had been no terrestrial radiation and the earth was dusty and parched while the  sun rose through a murky yellowish atmosphere with illdefined orb thick clouds of smoke pressed upon the plains and the faint easterly wind wafted large flakes of grass charcoal sluggishly through the air  vegetation was in great beauty though past its winter prime the tropical forest of india has two flowering seasons one in summer of the majority of plants and the other in winter of acanthaceae bauhinia dillenia bombax etc of these the former are abundant and render the jungle gay with large and delicate white red and purple blossoms coarse illfavoured vultures wheeled through the air languid bengalees had replaced the active mountaineers jackallike curs of low degree teemed at every village and ran howling away from the onslaught of my mountain dog and the tropics with all their beauty of flower and genial warmth looked as forbidding and unwholesome as they felt oppressive to a frame that had so long breathed the fresh mountain air  mounted on a stout pony i enjoyed my scamper of sixteen miles over the wooded plains and undulating gravelly slopes of the terai intervening between the foot of the mountains and siligoree bungalow where i rested for an hour in the afternoon i rode on leisurely to titalya sixteen miles further along the banks of the mahanuddy the atmosphere being so densely hazy that objects a few miles off were invisible and the sun quite concealed though its light was so powerful that no part of the sky could be steadily gazed upon this state of the air is very curious and has met with various attempts at explanation dr mlelland calcutta journal of natural history vol i p 52 attributes the haze of the atmosphere during the northwest winds of this season wholly to suspended earthy particles but the haze is present even in the calmest weather and extreme dryness is in all parts of the world usually accompanied by an obscure horizon captain campbell calcutta journal of natural history vol ii p 44 also objects to dr mclellands theory citing those parts of southern india which are least likely to be visited by duststorms as possessing an equally hazy atmosphere and further denies its being influenced by the hygrometric state of the atmosphere  all unsatisfactory to me it accompanies great heat dryness and elasticity of the suspended vapours and is not affected by wind during the afternoon the latter blew with violence but being hot and dry brought no relief to my still unacclimated frame my pony alone enjoyed the freedom of the boundless plains and the gallop or trot being fatiguing in the heat i tried in vain to keep him at a walk his spirits did not last long however for he flagged after a few days tropical heat my little dog had run thirty miles the day before exclusive of all the detours he had made for his own enjoyment and he flagged so much after twenty more this day that i had to take him on my saddlebow where after licking his hot swollen feet he fell fast asleep in spite of the motion  after leaving the wooded terai at siligoree trees became scarce and clumps of bamboos were the prevalent features these with an occasional banyan peepul or betelnut palm near the villages were the only breaks on the distant horizon a powerfully scented clerodendron and an osbeckia gay with blossoms like dogroses were abundant the former especially under trees where the seeds are dropped by birds  at titalya bungalow i received a hearty welcome from mr hodgson and congratulations on the success of my nepal journey which afforded a theme for many conversations  in the evening we had three sharp jerking shocks of an earthquake in quick succession at 98 pm appearing to come up from the southward they were accompanied by a hollow rumbling sound like that of a waggon passing over a wooden bridge the shock was felt strongly at dorjiling and registered by mr muller at 910 pm we had accurately adjusted our watches chronometers the previous morning and the motion may therefore fairly be assumed to have been transmitted northwards through the intervening distance of forty miles in two minutes both mr muller and mr hodgson had noted a much more severe shock at 610 pm the previous evening which i who was walking down the mountain did not experience this caused a good deal of damage at dorjiling in cracking wellbuilt walls earthquakes are frequent all along the himalaya and are felt far in tibet they are however most common towards the eastern and western extremities of india owing in the former case to the proximity of the volcanic forces in the bay of bengal cutch and scinde as is well known have suffered severely on many occasions and in several of them the motion has been propagated through affghanistan and little tibet to the heart of central asia see woods travels to the oxus  on the morning of the 1st of march dr campbell arrived at the bungalow from his tour of inspection along the frontier of bhotan and the rungpore district and we accompanied him hence along the british and sikkim frontier as far west as the mechi river which bounds nepal on the east  terai is a name loosely applied to a tract of country at the very foot of the himalaya it is persian and signifies damp politically the terai generally belongs to the hillstates beyond it geographically it should appertain to the plains of india and geologically it is a sort of neutral country being composed neither of the alluvium of the plains nor of the rocks of the hills but for the most part of alternating beds of sand gravel and boulders brought from the mountains botanically it is readily defined as the region of foresttrees amongst which the sal the most valuable of indian timber is conspicuous in most parts though not now in sikkim where it has been destroyed the terai soil is generally light dry and gravelly such as the sal always prefers and varies in breadth from ten miles along the sikkim frontier to thirty and more on the nepalese in the latter country it is called the morung and supplies sal and sissoo timber for the calcutta market the logs being floated down the konki and cosi rivers to the ganges the gravelbeds extend uninterruptedly upon the plains for fully twenty miles south of the sikkim mountains the gravel becoming smaller as the distance increases and large blocks of stone not being found beyond a few miles from the rocks of the himalaya itself even in the beds of rivers however large and rapid throughout its breadth this formation is conspicuously cut into flattopped terraces flanking the spurs of the mountains at elevations varying from 250 to nearly 1000 feet above the sea these terraces are of various breadth and length the smallest lying uppermost and the broadest flanking the rivers below the isolated hills beyond are also flattopped and terraced this deposit contains no fossils and its general appearance and mineral constituents are the only evidence of its origin which is no doubt due to a retiring ocean that washed the base of the sikkim himalaya received the contents of its rivers and wearing away its bluff spurs spread a talus upwards of 1000 feet thick along its shores it is not at first sight evident whether the terracing is due to periodic retirements of the ocean or to the levelling effects of rivers that have cut channels through the deposit in many places especially along the banks of the great streams the gravel is smaller obscurely interstratified with sand and the flattened pebbles overlap rudely in a manner characteristic of the effects of running water but such is  not the case with the main body of the deposit which is unstratified and much coarser  the alluvium of the gangetic valley is both interstratified with the gravel and passes into it and was no doubt deposited in deep water whilst the coarser matter this too is nonfossiliferous and is of unknown depth except at calcutta where the sand and clay beds have been bored through to the depth of 120 feet below which the first pebbles were met with whence these pebbles were derived is a curious problem the great himalayan rivers convey pebbles but a very few miles from the mountains on to the plains of india and there is no rock in situ above the surface within many miles of calcutta in any direction was accumulating at the foot of the mountains  this view is selfevident and has occurred i believe to almost every observer at whatever part of the base of the himalaya he may have studied this deposit its position above the sandstones of the sewalik range in the northwest himalaya and those of sikkim which appear to be modern fossiliferous rocks indicates its being geologically of recent formation but it still remains a subject of the utmost importance to discover the extent and nature of the ocean to whose agency it is referred i have elsewhere remarked that the alluvium of the gangetic valley may to a great degree be the measure of the denudation which the himalaya has suffered along its indian watershed it was no doubt during the gradual rise of that chain from the ocean that the gravel and alluvium were deposited and in the terraces and alternation of these there is evidence that there have been many subsidences and elevations of the coastline during which the gravel has suffered greatly from denudation  i have never looked at the sikkim himalaya from the plains without comparing its bold spurs enclosing sinuous river gorges to the weatherbeaten front of a mountainous coast and in following any of its great rivers the scenery  of its deep valleys no less strikingly resembles that of such narrow arms of the sea or fiords as characterize every mountainous coast of whatever geological formation such as the west coast of scotland and norway of south chili and fuegia of new zealand and tasmania there are too in these himalayan valleys at all elevations below 600 feet terraced pebblebeds rising in some cases eighty feet above the rivers which i believe could only have been deposited by them when they debouched into deep water and both these and the beds of the rivers are strewed down to 1000 feet with masses of rock such accumulations and transported blocks are seen on the raised beaches of our narrow scottish salt water lochs exposed by the rising of the land and they are yet forming of immense thickness on many coasts by the joint action of tides and streams  i have described meeting with ancient moraines in every himalayan valley i ascended at or about 7000 or 8000 feet elevation proving that at one period the glaciers descended fully so much below the position they now occupy this can only be explained by a change of climate such a change of temperature without any depression or elevation of the mountains has been thought by capt r strachey journal of geological society an able himalayan observer to be the necessary consequence of an ocean at the foot of these mountains for the amount of perpetual snow and consequent descent of the glaciers increasing indirectly in proportion to the humidity of the climate and the snowfall he conjectured that the proximity of the ocean would prodigiously increase such a deposition of snowto me this argument appears inconclusive for the first effect of such a vast body of water would be to raise the temperature of winter and as it is the rain rather than the sun of summer which removes the sikkim snow so would an increase of this rain elevate rather than depress the level of perpetual snow or by a depression of the mountain mass equal to 8000 feet since the formation of these moraines  the country about titalya looks desert from that want of trees and cultivation so characteristic of the upper level throughout this part of the plains which is covered with  short poor pasturegrass the bungalow stands close to the mahanuddy on a low hill cut into an escarpment twenty feet high which exposes a section of riverlaid sand and gravel alternating with thick beds of rounded pebbles  shortly after dr campbells arrival the meadows about the bungalow presented a singular appearance being dotted over with elephants brought for purchase by government it was curious to watch the arrival of these enormous animals which were visible nearly two miles across the flat plains nor less interesting was it to observe the wonderful docility of these giants of the animal kingdom often only guided by naked boys perched on their necks scolding swearing and enforcing their orders with the iron goad there appeared as many tricks in elephantdealers as in horsejockeys and of many animals brought but few were purchased government limits the price to about 75 pounds and the height to the shoulder must not be under seven feet which incredible as it appears may be estimated within a fraction as being three times the circumference of the forefoot the pedigree is closely inquired into the hoofs are examined for cracks the teeth for age and many other points attended to  the sikkim frontier from the mahanuddy westward to the mechi is marked out by a row of tall posts the country is undulating and though fully 400 miles from the ocean and not sixty from the top of the loftiest mountain on the globe its average level is not 300 feet above that of the sea the upper levels are gravelly and loosely covered with scattered thorny jujube bushes occasionally tenanted by the florican which scours these downs like a bustard sometimes a solitary fig or a thorny acacia breaks the horizon and there are a few gnarled trees of the scarlet butea frondosa  on our route i had a good opportunity of examining the line of junction between the alluvial plains that stretch south to the ganges and the gravel deposit flanking the hills the rivers always cut broad channels with scarped terraced sides and their low banks are very fertile from the mud annually spread by the evershifting streams that meander within their limits there are however few shrubs and no trees the houses which are very few and scattered are built on the gravelly soil above the lower level being very malarious  thirty miles south of the mountains numerous isolated flattopped hills formed of stratified gravel and sand with large waterworn pebbles rise from 80 to 200 feet above the mean level which is about 250 feet above the sea these too have always scarped sides and the channels of small streams completely encircle them  at this season few insects but grasshoppers are to be seen even mosquitos being rare birds however abound and we noticed the common sparrow hoopoe waterwagtail skylark osprey and several egrets  we arrived on the third day at the mechi river to the west of which the nepal terai or morung begins whose belt of sal forest loomed on the horizon so raised by refraction as to be visible as a dark line from the distance of many miles it is however very poor all the large trees having been removed we rode for several miles into it and found the soil dry and hard but supporting a prodigious undergrowth of gigantic harsh grasses that reached to our heads though we were mounted on elephants besides sal there was abundance of butea diospyros terminalia and symplocos with the dwarf phoenix palm and occasionally cycas tigers wild elephants and the rhinoceros are said to be found here but we saw none  the old and new mechi rivers are several miles apart but flow in the same depression a low swamp many miles broad which is grazed at this season and cultivated during the rains the grass is very rich partly owing to the moisture of the climate and partly to the retiring waters of the rivers both circumstances being the effects of proximity to the himalaya hence cattle buffalos and the common humped cow of india are driven from the banks of the ganges 300 miles to these feeding grounds for the use of which a trifling tax is levied on each animal the cattle are very carelessly herded and many are carried off by tigers  having returned to titalya mr hodgson and i set off in an eastern direction for the teesta river whose embouchure from the mountains to the plains i was anxious to visit though the weather is hot and oppressively so in the middle of the day there are few climates more delicious than that of these grassy savannahs from december to march we always started soon after daybreak on ponies and enjoyed a twelve to sixteen miles gallop in the cool of the morning before breakfast which we found prepared on our arrival at a tent sent on ahead the night before the road led across an open country or followed paths through interminable ricefields now dry and dusty on poor soil a whiteflowered leucas monopolized the space like our charlock and poppy it was apparently a pest to the agriculturist covering the surface in some places like a sprinkling of snow sometimes the riverbeds exposed fourteen feet of pure stratified sand with only an inch of vegetable soil above  at this season the mornings are very hazy with the thermometer at sunrise 60 degrees one laid on grass during the night falling 7 degrees below that temperature dew forms  but never copiously by 10 am the temperature has risen to 75 degrees and the faint easterly morning breezes die away the haze thickens and covers the sky with a white veil the thermometer rising to 82 degrees at noon and the west wind succeeding in parching tornados and furious gusts increasing with the temperature which attains its maximum in the afternoon and falling again with its decline at sunset the evenings are calm but the earth is so heated that the thermometer stands at 10 pm at 66 degrees and the minimum at night is not below 55 degrees great drought accompanies the heat at this season but not to such a degree as in northwest india or other parts of this meridian further removed from the hills in the month of march and during the prevalence of west winds the mean temperature was 79 degrees and the dewpoint 22 degrees lower indicating great drought the temperature at calcutta was 7 degrees warmer and the atmosphere very much damper  on the second day we arrived at jeelpigoree a large straggling village near the banks of the teesta a good way south of the forest here we were detained for several days waiting for elephants with which to proceed northwards the natives are cooches a mogul mongolian race who inhabit the open country of this district replacing the mechis of the terai forest they are a fine athletic people not very dark and formed the oncepowerful house of cooch behar latterly the upper classes have adopted the religion of the brahmins and have had caste conferred upon them while the lower orders have turned mahomedans these chiefly agriculturists are a timid oppressed class who everywhere fled before us and were with difficulty prevailed upon even to direct us along our road a rude police is established by the british government all over the country and to it the traveller applies  for guides and assistance but the conches were so shy and difficult to deal with that we were generally left to our own resources  grass is the prevailing feature of the country as there are few shrubs and still fewer trees goats and the common indian cow are plentiful but it is not swampy enough for the buffalo and sheep are scarce on account of the heat of the climate this uniformity of feature over so immense an area is however due to the agency of man and is of recent introduction as all concur in affirming that within the last hundred years the face of the country was covered with the same long junglegrasses which abound in the terai forest and the troops cantoned at titalya a central position in these plains from 1816 to 1828 confirm this statement as far as their immediate neighbourhood is concerned  these gigantic gramineae seem to be destroyed by fire with remarkable facility at one season of the year and it is well that this is the case for whether as a retainer of miasma a shelter for wild beasts both carnivorous and herbivorous alike dangerous to man or from their liability to ignite and spread destruction far and wide the grassjungles are most serious obstacles to civilization next to the rapidity with which it can be cleared the adaptation of a great part of the soil to irrigation during the rains has greatly aided the bringing of it under cultivation  by far the greater proportion of this universal short turf grass is formed of andropogon acicularis cynodon dactylon called dhob this is the best pasture grass in the plains of india and the only one to be found over many thousands of square miles and in sandy places imperata cylindrica  where the soil is wetter ameletia indica is abundant giving a heatherlike colour to the turf with its pale purple flowers wherever there is standing water its surface is reddened by the azolla and salvinia is also common  at jeelpigoree we were waited upon by the dewan who governs the district for the rajah a boy about ten years old whose estates are locked up during the trial of an interminable suit for the succession that has been instituted against him by a natural son of the late rajah we found the dewan to be a man of intelligence who promised us elephants as soon as the great hooli festival now commenced should be over  the large village at the time of our visit was gay with holiday dresses it is surrounded by trees chiefly of banyan jack mango peepul and tamarind interminable ricefields extend on all sides and except bananas slender betelnut palms and sometimes pawn or betelpepper there is little other extensive cultivation the roseapple orange and pineapple are rare as are cocoanuts there are few date or fanpalms and only occasionally poor crops of castoroil and sugarcane in the gardens i noticed jasmine justicia adhatoda hibiscus and others of the very commonest indian ornamental plants while for food were cultivated chenopodium yams sweet potatos and more rarely peas beans and gourds bamboos were planted round the little properties and smaller clusters of houses in oblong squares the ridge on which the plants grew being usually bounded by a shallow ditch the species selected was not the most graceful of its family the stems or culms being densely crowded erect as thick at the base as the arm copiously branching and very feathery throughout their whole length of sixty feet  a gayflowered osbeckia was common along the roadsides  and with a clerodendron clerodendron leaves bruised are used to kill vermin flyblows etc in cattle and the twigs form toothpicks the flowers are presented to mahadeo as a god of peace milk honey flowers fruit amrit ambrosia etc being offered to the pacific gods as vishnu krishna etc while mudar asclepias bhang cannabis sativa datura flesh blood and spirituous liquors are offered to siva doorga kali and other demoniacal deities whose strong sweet odour was borne far through the air formed a low undershrub beneath every tree generally intermixed with three ferns a polypodium pteris and goniopteris  the cottages are remarkable and have a very neat appearance presenting nothing but a low whitewashed platform of clay and an enormous high narrow black neatly thatched roof so arched along the ridge that its eaves nearly touch the ground at each gable and looking at a distance like a gigantic roundbacked elephant the walls are of neatlyplatted bamboo each window of which there are two is crossed by slips of bamboo and wants only glass to make it look european they have besides shutters of wattle that open upwards projecting during the day like the porthatches of a ship and let down at night within the rooms are airy and clean one end contains the machans bedsteads the others some raised clay benches the fire frequently an enormous hookah round wattled stools and various implements the inhabitants appeared more than ordinarily welldressed the men in loose flowing robes of fine cotton or muslin the women in the usual garb of a simple thick cotton cloth drawn tight immediately above the breast and thence falling perpendicularly to the knee the colour of this is a bright blue in stripes bordered above and below with red  i anticipated some novelty from a visit to a durbar court so distant from european influence as that of the rajah of jeelpigoree all eastern courts subject to the company are however now shorn of much of their glory  and the condition of the upper classes is greatly changed under the mogul rule the country was farmed out to zemindars some of whom assumed the title of rajah they collected the revenue for the sovereign retaining by law ten per cent on all that was realized there was no intermediate class the peasant paying directly to the zemindar and he into the royal treasury latterly the zemindars have become farmers under the companys rule and in the adjudication of their claims lord cornwallis then governorgeneral made great sacrifices in their favour levying only a small tribute in proportion to their often great revenues in the hope that they would be induced to devote their energies and some of their means to the improvement of the condition of the peasantry this expectation was not realized the younger zemindars especially subject to no restraint except from aggressions on their neighbours fell into slothful habits and the collecting of the revenue became a trading speculation entrusted to middle men the zemindar selects a number who again are at liberty to collect through the medium of several subrenting classes hence the peasant suffers and except a generally futile appeal to the rajah he has no redress the law secures him tenure as long as he can pay his rent and to do this he has recourse to the usurer borrowing in spring at 50 and oftener 100 per cent the seed plough and bullocks he reaps in autumn and what is then not required for his own use is sold to pay off part of his original debt the rest standing over till the next season and thus it continues to accumulate till overwhelmed with difficulties he is ejected or flees to a neighbouring district the zemindar enjoys the same right of tenure as the peasant the amount of impost laid on his property  was fixed for perpetuity whatever his revenue be he must pay so much to the company or he forfeits his estates and they are put up for auction  one evening we visited the young rajah at his residence which has rather a good appearance at a distance its white walls gleaming through a dark tope of mango betel and cocoanut a short rude avenue leads to the entrance gate under the trees of which a large bazaar was being held stocked with cloths simple utensils ornaments sweetmeats five species of fish from the teesta and the betelnut  we entered through a guardhouse where were some of the rajahs sepoys in the european costume and a few of the companys troops lent to the rajah as a security against some of the turbulent pretenders to his title within was a large courtyard flanked by a range of buildings some of good stonework some of wattle in all stages of disrepair a great crowd of people occupied one end of the court and at the other we were received by the dewan and seated on chairs under a canopy supported by slender silvered columns some slovenly natchgirls were dancing before us kicking up clouds of dust and singing or rather bawling through their noses the usual indelicate hymns in honour of the hooli festival there were also fiddlers cutting uncouth capers in rhythm with the dancers anything more deplorable than the music dancing and accompaniments cannot well be imagined yet the people seemed vastly pleased and extolled the performers  the arrival of the rajah and his brothers was announced by a crash of tomtoms and trumpets while over their heads were carried great gilt canopies with them came a troop of relations of all ages and amongst them a poor little black girl dressed in honour of us in an oldfashioned  english chintz frock and muslin cap in which she cut the drollest figure imaginable she was carried about for our admiration like a huge dutch doll crying lustily all the time  the festivities of the evening commenced by handing round trays full of pithballs the size of a nutmeg filled with a mixture of flour sand and red lacpowder with these each pelted his neighbour the thin covering bursting as it struck any object and powdering it copiously with red dust a more childish and disagreeable sport cannot well be conceived and when the balls were expended the dust itself was resorted to not only fresh but that which had already been used was gathered up with whatever dirt it might have become mixed one rude fellow with his hand full sought to entrap his victims into talking when he would stuff the nasty mixture into their mouths  at the end attar of roses was brought into which little pieces of cotton fixed on slips of bamboo were dipped and given to each person the heat dust stench of the unwashed multitude noise and increasing familiarity of the lower orders warned us to retire and we effected our retreat with precipitancy  the rajah and his brother were very fine boys lively frank unaffected and well disposed they have evidently a good guide in the old dewan but it is melancholy to think how surely should they grow up in possession of their present rank they will lapse into slothful habits and take their place amongst the imbeciles who now represent the once powerful rajahs of bengal  we rode back to our tents by a bright moonlight very dusty and tired and heartily glad to breathe the cool fresh air after the stifling ordeal we had undergone  on the following evening the elephants were again in waiting to conduct us to the rajah he and his relations  were assembled outside the gates mounted upon elephants amid a vast concourse of people the children and dewan were seated in a sort of cradle the rest were some in howdahs and some astride on elephants backs six or eight together all the idols were paraded before them and powdered with red dust the people howling shouting and sometimes quarrelling our elephants took their places amongst those of the rajah and when the mob had sufficiently pelted one another with balls and dirty red powder a torchlight procession was formed the idols leading the way to a very large tank bounded by a high rampart within which was a broad esplanade round the water  the effect of the whole was very striking the glittering cars and barbaric gaud of the idols showing best by torchlight while the white robes and turbans of the undulating sea of people and the great black elephants picking their way with matchless care and consideration contrasted strongly with the quiet moonbeams sleeping on the still broad waters of the tank  thence the procession moved to a field where the idols were placed on the ground and all dismounted the dewan then took the children by the hand and each worshipped his tutelary deity in a short prayer dictated by the attendant brahmin and threw a handful of red dust in its face after another ordeal of powder singing dancing and suffocation our share in the hooli ended and having been promised elephants for the following morning we bade a cordial farewell to our engaging little hosts and their staid old governor  on the 10th of march we were awakened at an early hour by a heavy thunderstorm from the southwest the sunrise was very fine through an arch 10 degrees high of bright blue sky above which the whole firmament was mottled with cirrus it continued cloudy with light winds  throughout the day but clear on the horizon from this tinge such storms became frequent ushering in the equinox and the less hazy sky and rising hygrometer predicted an accession of moisture in the atmosphere  we left for rangamally a village eight miles distant in a northerly direction our course lying along the west bank of the teesta  the river is here navigated by canoes thirty to forty feet long some being rudely cut out of a solid log of sal while others are built the planks of which there are but few being sewed together or clamped with iron and the seams caulked with the fibres of the root of dhak butea frondosa and afterwards smeared with the gluten of diospyros embryopteris the bed of the river is here threequarters of a mile across of which the stream does not occupy onethird its banks are sandcliffs fourteen feet in height a few small fish and watersnakes swarm in the pools  the whole country improved in fertility as we advanced towards the mountains the grass became greener and more trees shrubs herbs and birds appeared in front the dark boundaryline of the sal forest loomed on the horizon and to the east rose the low hills of bhotan both backed by the outer ranges of the himalaya  flocks of cranes were abundant overhead flying in wedges or breaking up into open order preparing for their migration northwards which takes place in april their return occurring in october a small quail was also common on the ground tamarisk jhow grew in the sandy bed of the river its flexible young branches are used in various parts of india for wattling and basketmaking  in the evening we walked to the skirts of the sal forest  the great trunks of the trees were often scored by tigers claws this animal indulging in the catlike propensity of rising and stretching itself against such objects two species of dillenia were common in the forest with long grass symplocos emblica and cassia fistula now covered with long pods several parasitical airplants grew on the dry trees as oberonia vanda and aerides  at rangamally the height of the sandy banks of the teesta varies from fifteen to twenty feet the bed is a mile across and all sand now covered with anthistiria grass fifteen feet high a little sissoo and bombax the current much divided and opaque green from the glacial origin of most of its headstreams the west bank was covered with a small sal forest mixed with acacia catechu and brushwood growing in a poor vegetable loam over very dry sand  the opposite or bhotan bank is much lower and always flooded during the rains which is not the case on the western side where the water rises to ten feet below the top of the bank or from seven to ten feet above its height in the dry season and it then fills its whole bed this information we had from a police jemadar who has resided many years on this unhealthy spot and annually suffers from fever the sal forest has been encroached upon from the south for many miles within the memory of man by clearing in patches and by indiscriminate felling  about ten miles north of rangamally we came to an extensive flat occupying a recess in the high west bank the site of the old capital baikantpore of the jeelpigoree rajah hemmed in as it is on three sides by a dense forest and on all by many miles of malarious terai it appears sufficiently secure from ordinary enemies during a great part of the year the soil is sandy overlying gravel  and covered with a thick stratum of fine mud or silt which is only deposited on these low flats on it grew many naturalized plants as hemp tobacco jack mango plantain and orange  about eight miles on we left the riverbed and struck westerly through a dense forest to a swampy clearance occupied by the village of rummai which appeared thoroughly malarious and we pitched the tent on a narrow low ridge above the level of the plain  it was now cool and pleasant partly due no doubt to a difference in the vegetation and the proximity of swamp and forest and partly also to a change in the weather which was cloudy and threatening much rain too had fallen here on the preceding day  brahmins and priests of all kinds are few in this miserable country near the villages and under the large trees are every here and there a few immature thatched cottages four to six feet high in which the tutelary deities of the place are kept they are idols of the very rudest description of vishnu as an ascetic baikant nath a wooden doll gilt and painted standing with the hands raised as if in exhortation and one leg crossed over the other again kartik the god of war is represented sitting astride on a peacock with the right hand elevated and holding a small flat cup  some fine muscular cooches were here brought for mr hodgsons examination but we found them unable or unwilling to converse in the cooch tongue which appears to be fast giving place to bengalee  we walked to a stream which flows at the base of the retiring sandcliffs and nourishes a dense and richlyvaried jungle producing many plants as beautiful acanthaceae indian horsechesnut loaded with white racemes of flowers  gay convolvuli laurels terrestrial and parasitic orchideae dillenia casting its enormous flowers as big as two fists pepper figs and in strange association with these a hawthorn and the yellowflowered indian strawberry which ascends 7500 feet on the mountains and hodgsonia a new cucurbitaceous genus clinging in profusion to the trees and also found 5000 feet high on the mountains  in the evening we rode into the forest which was dry and very unproductive and thence along the riverbanks through acacia catechu belted by sissoo which often fringes the stream always occupying the lowest flats the foliage at this season is brilliantly green and as the evening advanced a yellow convolvulus burst into flower like magic adorning the bushes over which it climbed  it rained on the following morning after which we left for the exit of the teesta proceeding northwards sometimes through a dense forest of sal timber sometimes dipping into marshy depressions or riding through grassy savannahs breasthigh the coolness of the atmosphere was delicious and the beauty of the jungle seemed to increase the further we penetrated these primaeval forests  eight miles from rummai we came on a small river from the mountains with a cooch village close by inhabited during the dry season by timbercutters from jeelpigoree it is situated upon a very rich black soil covered with saccharum and various gigantic grasses but no bamboo these long grasses replace the sal of which we did not see one good tree  we here mounted the elephants and proceeded several miles through the prairie till we again struck upon the high sal forestbank continuous with that of rummai and rangamally but much loftier it formed one of many terraces which stretch along the foot of the hills from  punkabaree to the teesta but of which none are said to occur for eight miles eastwards along the bhotan dooars if true this is probably due in part to the alteration of the course of the teesta which is gradually working to the westward and cutting away these lofty banks  the elephantdrivers appeared to have taken us by mistake to the exit of the chawa a small stream which joins the teesta further to the eastward the descent to the bed of this rivulet round the first spur of rock we met with was fully eighty feet through a very irregular depression probably the old bed of the stream it runs southwards from the hills and was covered from top to bottom with slatepebbles we followed the river to its junction with the teesta along a flat broad gulley bounded by denselywooded steep banks of clay slate on the north and the lofty bank on the south between these the bed was strewed with great boulders of gneiss and other rocks luxuriantly clothed with long grass and trees of wild plantain erythrina and bauhinia the latter gorgeously in flower  the sal bank formed a very fine object it was quite perpendicular and beautifully stratified with various coloured sands and gravel it tailed off abruptly at the junction of the rivers and then trended away southwest forming the west bank of the teesta the latter river is at its outlet a broad and rapid but hardly impetuous stream now fifty yards across gushing from between two low forestclad spurs it appeared about five feet deep and was beautifully fringed on both sides with green sissoo  some canoes were here waiting for us formed of hollowed trunks of trees thirty feet long two were lashed together with bamboos and the boatmen sat one at the head and one at the stern of each we lay along the  bottom of the vessels and in a second we were darting down the river at the rate of at least ten or fifteen miles an hour the bright waters leaping up on all sides and bounding in jetsdeau between prows and sterns of the coupled vessels sometimes we glided along without perceptible motion and at others jolted down bubbling rapids the steersmen straining every nerve to keep their barks head to the current as she impatiently swerved from side to side in the eddies to our jaded and parched frames after the hot forenoons ride on the elephants the effect was delicious the fresh breeze blew on our heated foreheads and down our open throats and chests we dipped our hands into the clear cool stream and there was music in the waters to our ears fresh verdure on the banks clear pebbles soft sand long english riverreaches forest glades and deep jungles followed in rapid succession and as often as we rounded a bend or shot a rapid the scene changed from bright to brighter still so continuing until dusk when we were slowly paddling along the then torpid current opposite rangamally the following temperatures of the waters of the teesta were taken at intervals during our passage from its exit to rangamally a distance of fifteen linear miles and thirty miles following the bends                      water            air exit 2h 30m pm    62 degrees      3                622 degrees     74 degrees      330             632 degrees      4                64

baikant  the absence of large stones or boulders of rock in the bed of the teesta is very remarkable considering the great volume and rapidity of the current and that it shoots directly from the rocky hills to the gravelly plains at the  embouchure there are boulders as big as the head and in the stream four miles below the exit the boatmen pointed out a stone as large as the body as quite a marvel  they assured us that the average rise at the mouth of the river in the rains was not more than five feet the mean breadth of the stream is from seventy to ninety yards from the point where it leaves the mountains to its junction with the megna is at this season thirteen days voyage the return occupying from twenty to twentyfive days with the boats unladen the name teesta signifies quiet this river being so in comparison with other himalayan torrents further west the cosi konki etc which are devastators of all that bounds their course  we passed but two crossingplaces at one the river is divided by an island covered with the rude chaits and flags of the boodhists we also saw some cooch fishermen who throw the net much as we do a fine mahaser a very large carp was the best fish they had of cultivation there was very little and the only habitations were a few grasshuts of the boatmen or buffalo herdsmen a rare cooch village of catechu and sal cutters or the shelter of timberfloaters who seem to pass the night in nests of long dry grass  our servants not having returned with the elephants from rummai we spent the following day at rangamally shooting and botanizing i collected about 100 species in a couple of hours and observed perhaps twice that number the more common i have repeatedly alluded to and excepting some small terrestrial orchids i added nothing of particular interest to my collection the following is a list of the principal genera most of which are englishpolygonum quercus sonchus gnaphalium cratagus lobelia lactuca hydrocotyle saponaria campanula bidens rubus oxalis artemisia fragaria clematis dioscorea potamogeton chara veronica viola smilax  on the 14th of march we proceeded west to siligoree along the skirts of the ragged sal forest birds are certainly the most conspicuous branch of the natural history of this country and we saw many species interesting either from their habits beauty or extensive distribution we noticed no less than sixteen kinds of swimming birds several of which are migratory and english the shoveller whiteeyed and common wild ducks merganser brahminee and indian goose anser indica common and gargany teal two kinds of gull one of shearwater rhynchops ablacus three of tern and one of cormorant besides these there were three egrets the large crane stork green heron and the demoiselle the english sandmartin kingfisher peregrinefalcon sparrowhawk kestrel and the european vulture the wild peacock and junglefowl there were at least 100 peculiarly indian birds in addition of which the more remarkable were several kinds of mina of starling vulture kingfisher magpie quail and lapwing  the country gradually became quite beautiful much undulated and diversified by bright green meadows sloping lawns and deeply wooded nullahs which lead from the sal forest and meander through this varied landscape more beautiful sites for fine mansions could not well be and it is difficult to suppose so lovely a country should be so malarious as it is before and after the rains excessive heat probably diffusing widely the miasma from small stagnant surfaces we noticed a wild hog absolutely the first wild beast of any size i sawon the plains except the hispid hare lepus hispidus and the barking deer stylocerus ratna the hare we found to be the best game of this part of india except the teal the pheasants of dorjiling are poor the deer all but uneatable and the florican however dressed i considered a far from excellent bird  a good many plants grow along the streams the sandy beds of which are everywhere covered with the marks of tigers feet the only safe way of botanizing is by pushing through the jungle on elephants an uncomfortable method from the quantity of ants and insects which drop from the foliage above and from the risk of disturbing pendulous bees and ants nests  a peculiar species of willow salix tetrasperma is common here which is a singular fact as the genus is characteristic of cold and arctic latitudes and no species is found below 5000 feet elevation on the sikkim mountain where it grows on the inner himalaya only some kinds ascending to 16000 feet  east of siligoree the plains are unvaried by tree or shrub and are barren wastes of short turf or sterile sand with the dwarfpalm phoenix acaulis a sure sign of a most hungry soil  the latter part of the journey i performed on elephants during the heat of the day and a more uncomfortable mode of conveyance surely never was adopted the camels pace is more fatiguing but that of the elephant is extremely trying after a few miles and is so injurious to the human frame that the mahouts drivers never reach an advanced age and often succumb young to spinediseases brought on by the incessant motion of the vertebral column the broiling heat of the elephants black back and the odour of its oily driver are disagreeable accompaniments as are its habits of snorting water from its trunk over its parched skin and the consequences of the great bulk of green food which it consumes  from siligoree i made a careful examination of the  gravel beds that occur on the road north to the foot of the hills and thence over the tertiary sandstone to punkabaree at the rukti river which flows southwest the road suddenly rises and crosses the first considerable hill about two miles south of any rock in situ this river cuts a cliff from 60 to 100 feet high composed of stratified sand and waterworn gravel further south the spur declines into the plains its course marked by the sal that thrives on its gravelly soil the road then runs northwest over a plain to an isolated hill about 200 feet high also formed of sand and gravel we ascended to the top of this and found it covered with blocks of gneiss and much angular detritus hence the road gradually ascends and becomes clayey argillaceous rocks and a little ochreous sandstone appeared in highlyinclined strata dipping north and covered with great waterworn blocks of gneiss above a flat terrace flanked to the eastward by a low wooded hill and another rise of sandstone lead on to the great baisarbatti terrace  bombax erythrina and duabanga lagaerstraemia grandiflora were in full flower and with the profusion of bauhinia rendered the treejungle gay the two former are leafless when flowering the duabanga is the pride of these forests its trunk from eight to fifteen feet in girth is generally forked from the base and the long pendulous branches which clothe the trunk for 100 feet are thickly leafy and terminated by racemes of immense white flowers which especially when in bud smell most disagreeably of assafoetida the magnificent apocyneous climber beaumontia was in full bloom ascending the loftiest trees and clothing their trunks with its splendid foliage and festoons of enormous funnelshaped white flowers  the report of a bed of ironstone eight or ten miles west  of punkabaree determined our visiting the spot and the locality being in a dense jungle the elephants were sent on ahead  we descended to the terraces flanking the balasun river and struck west along junglepaths to a looselytimbered flat a sudden descent of 150 feet landed us on a second terrace further on a third dip of about twenty feet in some places obliterated flanks the bed of the balasun the river itself being split into many channels at this season the west bank which is forty feet high is of stratified sand and gravel with vast slightlyworn blocks of gneiss from the top of this we proceeded southwest for three miles to some mechi villages the inhabitants of which flocked to meet us bringing milk and refreshments  the loharghur or iron hill lies in a dense dry forest its plainward flanks are very steep and covered with scattered weatherworn masses of ochreous and black ironstone many of which are several yards long it fractures with faint metallic lustre and is very earthy in parts it does not affect the compass there are no pebbles of ironstone nor waterworn rocks of any kind found with it  the sandstones close by cropped out in thick beds dip north 70 degrees they are very soft and beds of laminated clay and of a slaty rock are intercalated with them also an excessively tough conglomerate formed of an indurated blue or grey paste with nodules of harder clay there are no traces of metal in the rock and the lumps of ore are wholly superficial  below punkabaree the baisarbatti stream cuts through banks of gravel overlying the sandstone dip north 65 degrees the sandstone is gritty and micaceous intercalated with beds of indurated shale and clay in which i found the shaft apparently of a bone there were also beds of the  same clay conglomerate which i had seen at loharghur and thin seams of brown lignite with a rhomboidal cleavage in the bed of the stream were carbonaceous shales with obscure impressions of fern leaves of trizygia and vertebraria both fossils characteristic of the burdwan coalfields see chapter i but too imperfect to justify any conclusion as to the relation between these formations these traces of fossils are not sufficient to identify the formation with that of the sewalik hills of northwest india but its contents together with its strike dip and position relatively to the mountains and its mineralogical character incline me to suppose it may be similar its appearance in such small quantities in sikkim where it rises but a few hundred feet above the level of the sea whereas in kumaon it reaches 4000 feet may be attributed to the greater amount of wearing which it must have undergone the plains from which it rises being 1000 feet lower than those of kumaon and the sea having consequently retired later exposing the sikkim sandstone to the effects of denudation for a much longer period hitherto no traces of this rock or of any belonging to a similar geological epoch have been found in the valleys of sikkim but when the narrowness of these is considered it will not appear strange that such may have been removed from their surfaces first by the action of a tidal ocean and afterwards by that of tropical rains  ascending the stream these shales are seen in situ overlain by the metamorphic clayslate of the mountains and dipping inwards northwards like them this is at the foot of the punkabaree spur and close to the bungalow where a stream and landslip expose good sections the carbonaceous beds dip north 60 degrees and 70 degrees and run east and west much quartz rock is intercalated with them and soft white and pink micaceous sandstones the coalseams are few in number six to twelve inches thick very confused and distorted and full of elliptic nodules or spheroids of quartzy slate covered with concentric scaly layers of coal they overlie the sandstones mentioned above these scanty notices of superposition being collected in a country clothed with the densest tropical forest where a geologist pursues his fatiguing investigations under disadvantages that can hardly be realized in england will i fear long remain unconfirmed  i may mention however that the appearance of inversion of the strata at the foot of great mountainmasses has been observed in the alleghany chain and i believe in the alps dr mlelland informs me that in the curruckpore hills south of the ganges the clayslates are overlain by beds of micaslate gneiss and granite which pass into one another  illustrationa mech native of the sikkim terai  a poor mech was fishing in the stream with a basket curiously formed of a cylinder of bamboo cleft all round in innumerable strips held together by the joints above and below these strips being stretched out as a balloon in the  middle and kept apart by a hoop a small hole is cut in the cage and a mousetrap entrance formed the cage is placed in the current with the open end upwards where the fish get in and though little bigger than minnows cannot find their way out  on the 20th we had a change in the weather a violent storm from the southwest occurred at noon with hail of a strange form the stones being sections of hollow spheres half an inch across and upwards formed of cones with truncated apices and convex bases these cones were aggregated together with their bases outwards the large masses were followed by a shower of the separate conical pieces and that by heavy rain on the mountains this storm was most severe the stones lay at dorjiling for seven days congealed into masses of ice several feet long and a foot thick in sheltered places at purneah fifty miles south stones one and two inches across fell probably as whole spheres  ascending to khersiong i found the vegetation very backward by the roadsides the rain had cleared the atmosphere and the view over the plains was brilliant on the top of the khersiong spur a tremendous gale set in with a cold west wind the storm cleared off at night which at 10 pm was beautiful with forked and sheet lightning over the plains far below us the equinoctial gales had now fairly set in with violent southeast gales heavy thunder lightning and rain  whilst at khersiong i took advantage of the very fair section afforded by the road from punkabaree to examine the structure of the spur which seems to be composed of very highly inclined contorted beds dip north of metamorphic rocks gneiss micaslate clayslate and quartz the foliation of which beds is parallel to the dip of the strata over all reposes a bed of clay capped with a layer of  vegetable mould nowhere so thick and rich as in the more humid regions of 7000 feet elevation the rocks appeared in the following succession in descending along the top are found great blocks of very compact gneiss buried in clay half a mile lower the same rock appears dipping northnortheast 50 degrees below this beds of saccharine quartz with seams of mica dip northnorthwest 20 degrees some of these quartz beds are folded on themselves and look like flattened trunks of trees being composed of concentric layers each from two to four inches thick we exposed twentyseven feet of one fold running along the side of the road which was cut parallel to the strike each layer of quartz was separated from its fellows by one of mica scales and was broken up into cubical fragments whose surfaces are no doubt cleavage and jointing places i had previously seen but not understood such flexures produced by metamorphic action on masses of quartz when in a pasty state in the falkland islands where they have been perfectly well described by mr darwin journal of geological society for 1846 p 267 and voyage of the beagle in whose views of the formation of these rocks i entirely concur  the flexures of the gneiss are incomparably more irregular and confused than those of the quartz and often contain flattened spheres of highly crystalline felspar that cleave perpendicularly to the shorter axis these spheres are disposed in layers parallel to the foliation of the gneiss and are the result of a metamorphic action of great intensity effecting a complete rearrangement and crystallization of the quartz and mica in parallel planes whilst the felspar is aggregated in spheres just as in the rearrangement of the mineral constituents of micaschists the alumina is crystallized in the garnets and in the clayslates the iron into pyrites  the quartz below this dips northnorthwest 45 degrees to 50 degrees and alternates with a very hard slaty schist dipping northwest 45 degrees and still lower is a bluegrey clayslate dipping northnorthwest 30 degrees these rest on beds of slate folded like the quartz mentioned above but with cleavageplanes forming lines radiating from the axis of each flexure and running through all the concentric folds below this are the plumbago and clay slates of punkabaree which alternate with beds of micaschist with garnets and appear to repose immediately upon the carboniferous strata and sandstone but there is much disturbance at the junction  on reascending from punkabaree the rocks gradually appear more and more dislocated the clayslate less so than the quartz and micaschist and that again far less than the gneiss which is so shattered and bent that it is impossible to say what is in situ and what not vast blocks lie superficially on the ridges and the tops of all the outer mountains as of khersiong spur of tonglo sinchul and dorjiling appear a pile of such masses injected veins of quartz are rare in the lower beds of schist and clayslate whilst the gneiss is often full of them and on the inner and loftier ranges these quartz veins are replaced by granite with tourmaline  lime is only known as a stalactitic deposit from various streams at elevations from 1000 to 7000 feet one such stream occurs above punkabaree which i have not seen another within the sinchul range on the great rungeet river above the exit of the rummai a third wholly in the great central himalayan range flowing into the lachen river the total absence of any calcareous rock in sikkim and the appearance of the deposit in isolated streams at such distant localities probably indicates a very remote origin of the limecharged waters  from khersiong to dorjiling gneiss is the only rock and is often decomposed into claybeds 20 feet deep in which the narrow often zigzag folia of quartz remain quite entire and undisturbed whilst every trace of the foliation of the softer mineral is lost  at pacheem dorjiling weather with fog and drizzle commenced and continued for two days we reached dorjiling on the 24th of march and found that the hail which had fallen on the 20th was still lying in great masses of crumbling ice in sheltered spots the fall had done great damage to the gardens and dr campbells teaplants were cut to pieces  illustrationpocketcomb used bt the mech

brunonianavenomous snakeshornets and other insects choongtam templepictures of lhassamineralsscenery  after my return from the terai i was occupied during the month of april in preparations for an expedition to the loftier parts of sikkim the arrangements were the same as for my former journey except with regard to food which it was necessary should be sent out to me at intervals for we had had ample proof that the resources of the country were not equal to provisioning a party of from forty to fifty men even had the dewan been favourable to my travelling which was clearly not the case  dr campbell communicated to the rajah my intention of starting early in may for the upper teesta valley and  in the governorgenerals name requested that he would facilitate my visiting the frontier of sikkim northeast of kinchinjunga the desired permission was after a little delay received which appeared to rouse the dewan to institute a series of obstructions to my progress which caused so many delays that my exploration of the country was not concluded till october and i was prevented returning to dorjiling before the following christmas  since our visit to the rajah in december no vakeel agent had been sent by the durbar to dorjiling and consequently we could only communicate indirectly with his highness while we found it impossible to ascertain the truth of various reports promulgated by the dewan and meant to deter me from entering the country in april the lassoo kajee was sent as vakeel but having on a previous occasion been dismissed for insolence and incapacity and again rejected when proposed by the dewan at bhomsong he was refused an audience and he encamped at the bottom of the great rungeet valley where he lost some of his party through fever he retired into sikkim exasperated pretending that he had orders to delay my starting in consequence of the death of the heir apparent and that he was prepared to use strong measures should i cross the frontier  no notice was taken of these threats the rajah was again informed of my intended departure unless his own orders to the contrary were received through a proper accredited agent and i left dorjiling on the 3rd of may accompanied by dr campbell who insisted on seeing me fairly over the frontier at the great rungeet river  arrangements were made for supplies of rice following me by instalments our daily consumption being 80 lbs a mans load after crossing into sikkim i mustered my  party at the great rungeet river i had fortytwo in all of whom the majority were young lepchas or sikkimborn people of tibetan races all were active and cheerful looking follows only one was goitred and he had been a salttrader i was accompanied by a guard of five sepoys and had a lepcha and tibetan interpreter i took but one personal servant a portuguese halfcaste john hoffman by name who cooked for me he was a native of calcutta and though hardy patient and longsuffering and far bettertempered was in other respects very inferior to clamanze who had been my servant the previous year and who having been bred to the sea was as handy as he was clever but who like all other natives of the plains grew intolerably weary of the hills and left me  the first part of my route lay over tendong a very fine mountain which rises 8613 feet and is a conspicuous feature from dorjiling where it is known as mount ararat the lepchas have a curious legend of a man and woman having saved themselves on its summit during a flood that once deluged sikkim the coincidence of this story with the english name of ararat suggests the probability of the legend being fabulous but i am positively assured that it is not so but that it was current amongst the lepchas before its english name was heard of and that the latter was suggested from the peculiar form of its summit resembling that given in childrens books as the restingplace of the ark  the ascent from the great rungeet alt 818 feet is through dry woods of sal and pines p longifolia i camped the first night at the village of mikk alt 3900 feet and on the following day ascended to namtc alt 5600 feet  on the route i was met by the lama of silokfoke goompa though a resident on the lassoo kajees estates he politely brought me a present at the same time apologising for not waiting till i had encamped owing to his excessive fat which prevented his climbing i accepted his excuses though well aware that his real reason was that he wished to pay his respects and show his good feeling in private besides his ordinary canonicals he carried a tall crozierheaded staff and had a curious horn slung round his neck full of amulets it was short of a transparent red colour and beautifully carved and was that of the small cow of lhassa which resembles the english species and is not a yak it is called tundro  namtchi was once a place of considerable importance and still possesses a mendong with six rows of inscribed slabs a temple and a lama attached thereto the latter waited on me soon after i had encamped but he brought no present and i was not long kept in suspense as to his motives these people are poor dissemblers if they intend to obstruct they do it clumsily and hesitatingly in this instance the lama first made up to my people and being coolly received kept gradually edging up to my tentdoor where after an awkward salute he delivered himself with a very bad grace of his mission which was from the lassoo kajee to stop my progress i told him i knew nothing of the lassoo kajee or his orders and should proceed on the following morning he then urged the bad state of the roads and advised me to wait two days till he should receive orders from the rajah upon which i dismissed him  soon afterwards as i sat at my tentdoor looking along the narrow bushy ridge that winds up the mountain i saw twenty or thirty men rapidly descending the rocky  path they were lepchas with blue and white striped garments bows and quivers and with their long knives gleaming in the sun they seemed to be following a figure in red lama costume with a scarlet silk handkerchief wound round his head its ends streaming behind him though expecting this apparition to prove the renowned kajee and his myrmidons coming to put a sudden termination to my progress i could not help admiring the exceeding picturesqueness of the scenery and party my fears were soon dissipated by my men joyfully shouting the tchebu lama the tchebu lama and i soon recognised the rosy face and twinkling eyes of my friend of bhomsong the only man of intelligence about the rajahs court and the one whose services as vakeel were particularly wanted at dorjiling  he told me that the lassoo kajee had orders from whom he would not say to stop my progress but that i should proceed nevertheless and that there was no objection to my doing so and he despatched a messenger to the rajah announcing my progress and requesting him to send me a guide and to grant me every facility asserting that he had all along fully intended doing so  on the following morning the lama proceeded to dorjiling and i continued the ascent of tendong sending my men round the shoulder to temi in the teesta valley where i proposed to pass the night the road rapidly ascends by a narrow winding path covered with a loose forest of oaks rhododendrons and various shrubs not found at equal elevations on the wetter dorjiling ranges amongst them the beautiful laburnumlike piptanthus nepalensis with golden blossoms was conspicuous enormous blocks of white and red stratified quartz and slate some 20 and even 40 yards long rest on the narrow  ridge at 7000 feet elevation the last ascent is up a steep rounded cone with a broad flat top covered with dwarf bamboo a few oaks laurels magnolias and whiteflowered rhododendron trees r argenteum which obstructed the view i hung the barometers near one of the many chaits on the summit where there is also a rude temple in which worship is performed once a year the elevation is 8671 feet by my observations 8663 by col waughs trigonometrical observations the geological formation of tendong in some measure accounts for its peculiar form on the conical summit are hard quartzoze porphyries which have apparently forced up the gneiss and slates which dip in all directions from the top and are full of injected veins of quartz below 7000 feet micaschist prevails always inclined at a very high angle and i found jasper near namtchi with other indications of plutonic action  the descent on the north side was steep through a rank vegetation very different from that of the south face the oaks are very grand and i measured one whose trunk was decayed and split into three however which i found to be 49 feet in girth at 5 feet from the ground near temi alt 4770 feet i gathered the fruit of kadsura a climbing plant allied to magnolia bearing round heads of large fleshy red drupes which are pleasantly acid and much eaten the seeds are very aromatic  from temi the road descends to the teesta the course of which it afterwards follows the valley was fearfully hot and infested with mosquitos and peepsas many fine plants grew in it especially upon the broad terraces of gravel some of which are upwards of a mile long and 200 feet above the stream they are covered with boulders of rock and are generally opposite feeders of the river i especially noticed aristolochia saccata  which climbs the loftiest trees bearing its curious pitchershaped flowers near the ground only its leaves are said to be good food for cattle houttuynia a curious herb allied to pepper grew on the banks which from the profusion of its white flowers resembled strawberrybeds the leaves are eaten by the lepchas but the most magnificent plant of these jungles is hodgsonia a genus i have dedicated to my friend mr hodgson a gigantic climber allied to the gourd bearing immense yellowishwhite pendulous blossoms whose petals have a fringe of buffcoloured curling threads several inches long the fruit is of a rich brown like a small melon in form and contains six large nuts whose kernels called katiorpot by the lepchas are eaten the stem when cut discharges water profusely from whichever end is held downwards the took hydnocarpus is a beautiful evergreen tree with tufts of yellow blossoms on the trunk its fruit is as large as an orange and is used to poison fish while from the seeds an oil is expressed tropical oaks and terminalias are the giants of these low forests the latter especially having buttressed trunks appear truly gigantic one of a kind called sunglok measured 47 feet in girth at 5 feet and 21 at 15 feet from the ground and was fully 200 feet high i could only procure the leaves by firing a ball into the crown some of their trunks lay smouldering on the ground emitting a curious smell from the mineral matter in their ashes of whose constituents an account will be found in the appendix  birds are very rare as is all animal life but insects and a small freshwater crab thelphusa tihi of the lepchas shells from the absence of lime are extremely scarce and i scarcely picked up a single specimen the most common are species of cyclostoma  the rains commenced on the 10th of may greatly increasing the discomforts of travelling but moderating the heat by drenching thunderstorms which so soaked the mens loads that i was obliged to halt a day in the teesta valley to have waterproof covers made of platted bamboowork enclosing phrynium leaves i was delighted to find that my little tent was impervious to water though its thickness was but of one layer of blanket it was a single ridge with two poles 7 feet high 8 feet long and 8 feet broad at the base forming nearly an equilateral triangle in front  bhomsong was looking more beautiful than ever in its rich summer clothing of tropical foliage i halted during an hour of heavy rain on the spot where i had spent the previous christmas and could not help feeling doubly lonely in a place where every rock and tree reminded me of that pleasant time the isolation of my position the hostility of the dewan and consequent uncertainty of the success of a journey that absorbed all my thoughts the prevalence of fevers in the valleys i was traversing and the many difficulties that beset my path all crowded on the imagination when fevered by exertion and depressed by gloomy weather and my spirits involuntarily sank as i counted the many miles and months intervening between me and my home  the little flat on which i had formerly encamped was now covered with a bright green crop of young rice the house then occupied by the dewan was now empty and unroofed but the suspension bridge had been repaired and its light framework of canes spanning the boiling flood of the teesta formed a graceful object in this most beautiful landscape the temperature of the river was 58 degrees only 7 degrees above that of midwinter owing to the now melting snows i had rather expected to meet either with a guide or with some further obstruction here but as none appeared i proceeded onwards as soon as the weather moderated  illustrationpandanus sikkim screwpine  higher up the scenery resembles that of tchintam on the tambur the banks are so steep as to allow of no road and the path ascends from the river at 1000 feet to lathiang village at 4800 feet up a wild rocky torrent that descends from mainom to the teesta the cliffs here are covered with wild plantains and screwpines pandanus  50 feet high that clasp the rocks with cablelike roots and bear one or two crowns of drooping leaves 5 feet long two palms rattan calamus and areca gracilis penetrate thus far up the teesta valley but are scarcely found further  from the village the view was superb embracing the tropical gulley below with the flat of bhomsong deep down in the gorge its bright ricefields gleaming like emeralds amid the dark vegetation that surrounded it the teesta winding to the southward the pineclad rocky top of mainom 10613 feet high to the southwest the cone of mount ararat far to the south to the north black mountains tipped with snow and to the east the magnificent snowy range of chola girdling the valley of the ryott with a diadem of frosted silver the coolies each carrying upwards of 80 lb load had walked twelve hours that day and besides descending 2000 feet they had ascended nearly 4000 feet and gone over innumerable ups and downs besides  beyond lathiang a steep and dangerous path runs along the east flank of mainom sometimes on narrow ledges of dry rock covered with long grass sometimes dipping into wooded gullies full of edgeworthia gardneri and small trees of andromeda and rhododendron covered with orchids especially some species of sunipia and cirrhopetalum which have not yet been introduced into england of great beauty  descending to gorh 4100 feet i was met by the lama of that district a tall disagreeablelooking fellow who informed me that the road ahead was impassable the day being spent i was obliged to camp at any rate after which he visited me in full canonicals bringing me a handsome present but assuring me that he had no authority to let me advance i treated him with civility and regretted my objects being so imperative and my orders so clear that i was obliged to proceed on the following morning on which he abruptly decamped as i suspected in order to damage the paths and bridges he came again at daylight and expostulated further but finding it of no use he volunteered to accompany me officiously offering me the choice of two roads i asked for the coolest knowing full well that it was useless to try and outwit him in such matters at the first stream the bridge was destroyed but seeing the planks peeping through the bushes in which they had been concealed i desired the lama to repair it which he did without hesitation so it was at every point the path was cumbered with limbs of trees crossingstones were removed from the streams and all natural difficulties were increased i kept constantly telling the lama that as he had volunteered to show me the road i felt sure he intended to remove all obstacles and accordingly i put him to all the trouble i possibly could which he took with a very indifferent grace when i arrived at the swinging bridge across the teesta i found that the canes were loosened and that slips of bamboo so small as nearly to escape observation were ingeniously placed low down over the single bamboo that formed the footing intended to trip up the unwary passenger and overturn him into the river which was deep and with a violent current whilst the lama was cutting these one of my party found a charcoal writing on a tree announcing the speedy arrival from the rajah of my old guide meepo and he shortly afterwards appeared with instructions to proceed with me though not to the tibetan frontier the lateness of the season the violence of the rains and the fears on the rajahs part that i might  suffer from fever or accident were all urged to induce me to return or at least only to follow the west branch of the teesta to kinchinjunga these reasons failing i was threatened with chinese interference on the frontier all these objections i overruled by refusing to recognise any instructions that were not officially communicated to the superintendent of dorjiling  the gorh lama here took leave of me he was a friend of the dewan and was rather surprised to find that the rajah had sent me a guide and now attempted to pass himself off as my friend pompously charging meepo with the care of me and bidding me a very polite farewell i could not help telling him civilly but plainly what i thought of him and so we parted  meepo was very glad to join my party again he is a thorough lepcha in heart a great friend of his rajah and of tchebu lama and one who both fears and hates the dewan he assured me of the rajahs good wishes and intentions but spoke with great doubt as to the probability of a successful issue to my journey he was himself ignorant of the road but had brought a guide whose appearance however was against him and who turned out to be sent as a spy on us both  instead of crossing the teesta here we kept on for two days up its west bank to a cane bridge at lingo where the bed of the river is still only 2000 feet above the sea though 45 miles distant from the plains and flowing in a valley bounded by mountains 12000 to 16000 feet high the heat was oppressive from the closeness of the atmosphere the great power of the sun now high at noonday and the reflection from the rocks leeches began to swarm as the damp increased and stinging flies of various kinds my clothes were drenched with perspiration during five  hours of every day and the crystallising salt irritated the skin on sitting down to rest i was overcome with languor and sleep and but for the copious supply of fresh water everywhere travelling would have been intolerable the coolies were all but naked and were constantly plunging into the pools of the rivers for though filthy in their persons they revel in cold water in summer they are powerful swimmers and will stem a very strong current striking out with each arm alternately it is an animated sight when twenty or thirty of these swarthy children of nature are disporting their muscular figures in the water diving after large fish and sometimes catching them by tickling them under the stones  of plants i found few not common at similar elevations below dorjiling except another kind of treefern alsophila spinulosa the pugjik of the lepchas who eat the soft watery pith it is abundant in east bengal and the peninsula of india the other sikkim treefern a gigantea is far more common from the level of the plains to 6500 elevation and is found as far south as java whose pith is eaten in times of scarcity the indiarubber fig penetrates thus far amongst the mountains but is of small size a gentian arenaria and some subalpine plants are met with though the elevation is only 2000 feet and the whole climate thoroughly tropical they were annuals usually found at 7000 to 10000 feet elevation and were growing here on mossy rocks cooled by the spray of the river whose temperature was only 563 degrees my servant having severely sprained his wrist by a fall the lepchas wanted to apply a moxa which they do by lighting a piece of puffball or nepal paper that burns like tinder laying it on the skin and blowing it till a large open sore is produced they shook their heads at my treatment which consisted in transferring some of the leeches from our persons to the inflamed part  after crossing the teesta by the cane bridge of lingo our route lay over a steep and lofty spur round which the river makes a great sweep on the ascent of this ridge we passed large villages on flats cultivated with buckwheat the saddle is 5500 feet high and thence a rapid descent leads to the village of singtam which faces the north and is 300 feet lower and 3000 feet above the river which is here no longer called the teesta but is known as the lachenlachoong from its double origin in the rivers of these names which unite at choongtam twenty miles higher up of these the source of the lachen is in the cholamoo lakes in tibet while the lachoong rises on the south flank of donkia mountain both many marches north of my present position at singtam the lachenlachoong runs westward till joined by the rihi from the north and the rinoong from the west after receiving which it assumes the name of teesta of these affluents the rinoong is the largest and drains the southeast face of kinchinjunga and pundim and the north of nursing all which mountains are seen to the northnorthwest of singtam the rinoong valley is cultivated for several miles up and has amongst others the village and lamasery of bah beyond this the view of black rugged precipices with snowy mountains towering above them is one of the finest in sikkim there is a pass in that direction from bah over the tckonglah to the thlonok valley and thence to the province of jigatzi in tibet but it is almost impracticable  illustrationview of kinchinjunga from singtam looking northwestward  a race of wild men called harrummo are said to inhabit the head of the valley living in the woods of a district called mundpo beyond bah they shun habitations speak an unintelligible tongue have more hair on the face than lepchas and do not plait that of their heads but  wear it in a knot they use the bow and arrow and eat snakes and vermin which the lepchas will not touch such is the account i have heard and which is certainly believed in sikkim similar stories are very current in half civilized countries and if this has any truth it possibly refers to the chepangs hodgson in bengal asiatic societys journal for 1848 a very remarkable race of doubtful affinity and origin inhabiting the nepal forests  at singtam i was waited on by the soubah of the district a tall portly bhoteea who was destined to prove a most active enemy to my pursuits he governs the country between gorh and the tibet frontier for the maharaanee wife of the rajah whose dowry it is and she being the dewans relative i had little assistance to expect from her agent his conduct was very polite and he brought me a handsome offering for myself but after delaying me a day on the pretext of collecting food for my people of which i was in want i was obliged to move on with no addition to my store and trust to obtaining some at the next village or from dorjiling owing however to the increasing distance and the destruction of the roads by the rains my supplies from that place were becoming irregular i therefore thought it prudent to reduce my party by sending back my guard of sepoys who could be of no further use  from this point the upper portion of the course of the teesta lachenlachoong is materially different from what it is lower down becoming a boisterous torrent as suddenly as the tambur does above mywa guola its bed is narrower large masses of rock impede its course nor is there any place where it is practicable for rafts at any season the only means of passing it being by cane bridges that are thrown across high above the stream  the slope on either side of the valley is very steep that on the north in particular appearing too precipitous for any road and being only frequented by honey seekers who scale the rocks by cane ladders and thus reach the pendulous beesnests which are so large as in some instances to be conspicuous features at the distance of a mile this pursuit appeared extremely perilous the long threadlike canes in many places affording the only footing over many yards of cliff the procuring of this honey however is the only means by which many of the idle poor raise the rent which they must pay to the rajah  the most prominent effect of the steepness of the valleys is the prevalence of landslips which sometimes descend for 3000 feet carrying devastation along their course they are caused either by the melting of the snowbeds on the mountains or by the action of the rains on the stratified rocks and are much increased in effect and violence by the heavy timbertrees which swaying forwards loosen the earth at their roots and give impetus to the mass this phenomenon is as frequent and destructive as in switzerland where however more lives are lost from the country being more populous and from the people recklessly building in places particularly exposed to such accidents a most destructive one had however occurred here the previous year by which a village was destroyed together with twelve of its inhabitants and all the cattle the fragments of rock precipitated are sometimes of enormous size but being a soft micaschist are soon removed by weathering it is in the rainy season that landslips are most frequent and shortly after rain they are pretty sure to be heard far or near i crossed the debris of the great one alluded to on the first march beyond singtam the whole face of the mountain appeared more or less torn up for fully  a mile presenting a confused mass of white micaceous clay full of angular masses of rock the path was very difficult and dangerous being carried along the steep slope at an angle in some places of 35 degrees and it was constantly shifting from the continued downward sliding and from the action of streams some of which are large and cut deep channels in one i had the misfortune to lose my only sheep which was carried away by the torrent these streams were crossed by means of sticks and ricketty bamboos and the steep sides sometimes twenty or thirty feet high were ascended by notched poles  the weather continued very hot for the elevation 4000 to 5000 feet the rain brought no coolness and for the greater part of the three marches between singtam and chakoong we were either wading through deep mud or climbing over rocks leeches swarmed in incredible profusion in the streams and damp grass and among the bushes they got into my hair hung on my eyelids and crawled up my legs and down my back i repeatedly took upwards of a hundred from my legs where the small ones used to collect in clusters on the instep the sores which they produced were not healed for five months afterwards and i retain the scars to the present day snuff and tobacco leaves are the best antidote but when marching in the rain it is impossible to apply this simple remedy to any advantage the best plan i found to be rolling the leaves over the feet inside the stockings and powdering the legs with snuff  another pest is a small midge or sandfly which causes intolerable itching and subsequent irritation and is in this respect the most insufferable torment in sikkim the minutest rent in ones clothes is detected by the acute senses of this insatiable bloodsucker which is itself so  small as to be barely visible without a microscope we daily arrived at our campingground streaming with blood and mottled with the bites of peepsas gnats midges and mosquitos besides being infested with ticks  as the rains advanced insects seemed to be called into existence in countless swarms large and small moths cockchafers glowworms and cockroaches made my tent a noahs ark by night when the candle was burning together with winged ants mayflies flying earwigs and many beetles while a very large species of tipula daddylonglegs swept its long legs across my face as i wrote my journal or plotted off my map after retiring to rest and putting out the light they gradually departed except a few which could not find the way out and remained to disturb my slumbers  chakoong is a remarkable spot in the bottom of the valley at an angle of the lachenlachoong which here receives an affluent from gnarem a mountain 17557 feet high on the chola range to the east this is called black rock in col waughs map i doubt gnarem being a generally known name the people hardly recognise the mountain as sufficiently conspicuous to bear a name there is no village but some grass huts used by travellers which are built close to the river on a very broad flat fringed with alder hornbeam and birch the elevation is 4400 feet and many european genera not found about dorjiling and belonging to the temperate himalaya grow intermixed with tropical plants that are found no further north the birch willow alder and walnut grow side by side with wild plantain erythrina wallichia palm and gigantic bamboos the cedrela toona figs melastoma scitamineae balsams pothos peppers and gigantic climbing vines grow mixed with brambles speedwell paris forgetmenot and nettles  that sting like poisoned arrows the wild english strawberry is common but bears a tasteless fruit its inferiority is however counterbalanced by the abundance of a grateful yellow raspberry parasitical orchids dendrobium nobile and densiflorum etc cover the trunks of oaks while thalictrum and geranium grow under their shade monotropa and balanophora both parasites on the roots of trees the one a native of north europe and the other of a tropical climate push their leafless stems and heads of flowers through the soil together and lastly treeferns grow associated with the pteris aquilina brake and lycopodium clavatum of our british moors and amongst mosses the superb himalayan lyellia crispa this is one of the most remarkable mosses in the himalaya mountains and derives additional interest from having been named after the late charles lyell esq of kinnordy the father of the most eminent geologist of the present day with the english funaria hygrometrica  the dense jungles of chakoong completely cover the beautiful flat terraces of stratified sand and gravel which rise in three shelves to 150 feet above the river and whose edges appear as sharply cut as if the latter had but lately retired from them they are continuous with a line of quartzy cliffs covered with scarlet rhododendrons and in the holes of which a conglomerate of pebbles is found 150 feet above the river everywhere immense boulders are scattered about some of which are sixty yards long their surfaces are waterworn into hollows proving the river to have cut through nearly 300 feet of deposit which once floored its valley lower down the valley and fully 2000 feet above the river i had passed numerous angular blocks resting on gentle slopes where no landslips could possibly have deposited them and which i therefore refer to ancient glacial action one of these  near the village of niong was nearly square eighty feet long and ten high  it is a remarkable fact that this hot damp gorge is never malarious this is attributable to the coolness of the river and to the water on the flats not stagnating for at choongtam a march further north and 1500 feet higher fevers and ague prevail in summer on similar flats but which have been cleared of jungle and are therefore exposed to the sun  i had had constant headache for several mornings on waking which i did not fail to attribute to coming fever or to the unhealthiness of the climate till i accidentally found it to arise from the wormwood upon a thick couch of the cut branches of which i was accustomed to sleep and which in dry weather produced no such effects this wormwood artemisia indaca is one of the most common sikkim plants at 2000 to 6000 feet elevation and grows twelve feet high it is a favourite food of goats  from chakoong to choongtam the route lay northwards following the course of the river or crossing steep spurs of vertical strata of micaschist that dip into the valley and leave no space between their perpendicular sides and the furious torrent immense landslips seamed the steep mountain flanks and we crossed with precipitation one that extended fully 4000 feet and perhaps much more up a mountain 12000 feet high on the east bank it moves every year and the mud and rocks shot down by it were strewn with the green leaves and twigs of shrubs some of the flowers on which were yet fresh and bright while others were crushed these were mixed with gigantic trunks of pines with ragged bark and scored timbers the talus which had lately been poured into the valley formed a gently sloping bank twenty feet high over which the lachenlachoong rolled from a pool above caused by the damming up of its waters on either side of the pool were cultivated terraces of stratified sand and pebbles fifty feet high whose alderfringed banks joined by an elegant cane bridge were reflected in the placid water forming a little spot of singular quiet and beauty that contrasted with the savage grandeur of the surrounding mountains and the headstrong course of the foaming torrent below amid whose deafening roar it was impossible to speak and be heard  illustrationcanebridge and tukcham mountain  the mountain of choongtam is about 10000 feet high it divides the lachen from the lachoong river and terminates a lofty range that runs for twentytwo miles south from the lofty mountain of kinchinjhow its south exposed face is bare of trees except clumps of pines towards the top and is  very steep grassy and rocky without water it is hence quite unlike the forestclad mountains further south and indicates a drier and more sunny climate the scenery much resembles that of switzerland and of the northwest himalaya especially in the great contrast between the southern and northern exposures the latter being always clothed with a dense vegetation at the foot of this very steep mountain is a broad triangular flat 5270 feet above the sea and 300 feet above the river to which it descends by three level cultivated shelves the village consisting of a temple and twenty houses is placed on the slope of the hill i camped on the flat in may before it became very swampy close to some great blocks of gneiss of which many lie on its surface it was covered with tufts of sedge like carex stellulata and fringed with scarlet rhododendron walnut andromeda e1aeagnus now bearing pleasant acid fruit and small trees of a photinia a plant allied to hawthorn of the leaves of which the natives make tea as they do of gualtheria andromeda vaccinium and other allied plants rice cultivated choongtam is in position and products analogous to lelyp on the tambur vol i chapter ix rice cultivation advances thus high up each valley and at either place bhoteeas replace the natives of the lower valleys in pools surrounded by low banks was just peeping above ground and scanty crops of millet maize and buckwheat flourished on the slopes around  the inhabitants of choongtam are of tibetan origin few of them had seen an englishman before and they flocked out displaying the most eager curiosity the lama and phipun or superior officer of the lachoong valley came to pay their respects with a troop of followers and there was lolling out of tongues and scratching of ears at every sentence spoken and every object of admiration  this extraordinary tibetan salute at first puzzled me excessively nor was it until reading mm huc and gabets travels on my return to england that i knew of its being the ton at lhassa and in all civilised parts of tibet  as the valley was under the singtam soubahs authority i experienced a good deal of opposition and the lama urged the wrath of the gods against my proceeding this argument i said had been disposed of the previous year and i was fortunate in recognising one of my changachelling friends who set forth my kindly offices to the lamas of that convent and the friendship borne me by its monks and by those of pemiongchi many other modes of dissuading me were attempted but with meepos assistance i succeeded in gaining my point the difficulty and delays in remittance of food caused by the landslips having destroyed the road had reduced our provisions to a very low ebb and it became not only impossible to proceed but necessary to replenish my stores on the spot at first provisions enough were brought to myself for the rajah had issued orders for my being cared for and having some practice among the villagers in treating rheumatism and goitres i had the power of supplying my own larder but i found it impossible to buy food for my people at last the real state of the case came out that the rajah having gone to choombi his usual summerquarters in tibet the dewan had issued orders that no food should be sold or given to my people and that no roads were to be repaired during my stay in the country thus cutting off my supplies from dorjiling and in short attempting to starve me out at this juncture meepo received a letter from the durbar purporting to be from the rajah commanding my immediate return on the grounds that i had been long enough in the country for my objects it was not  addressed to me and i refused to receive it as an official communication following up my refusal by telling meepo that if he thought his orders required it he had better leave me and return to the rajah as i should not stir without directions from dr campbell except forwards he remained however and said he had written to the rajah urging him to issue stringent orders for my party being provisioned  we were reduced to a very short allowance before the longexpected supplies came by which time our necessities had almost conquered my resolution not to take by force of the abundance i might see around however well i might afterwards pay it is but fair to state that the improvident villagers throughout sikkim are extremely poor in vegetable food at this season when the winter store is consumed and the crops are still green they are consequently obliged to purchase rice from the lower valleys which owing to the difficulties of transport is very dear and to obtain it they barter wool blankets musk and tibetan produce of all kinds still they had cattle which they would willingly have sold to me but for the dewans orders  there is a great difference between the vegetation of dorjiling and that of similar elevations near choongtam situated far within the himalaya this is owing to the steepness and dryness of the latter locality where there is an absence of dense forest which is replaced by a number of social grasses clothing the mountain sides many new and beautiful kinds of rhododendrons and a variety of european genera deutzia saxifraga caliata thalictrum euphorbia yellow violet labiatae androsace leguminosae coriaria delphinium currant umbelliferae primrose anemone convallaria roscoea mitella herminium drosera which as i have elsewhere noticed are either  wholly absent from the damper ranges of dorjiling or found there several thousand feet higher up on the hill above choongtam village i gathered at 5000 to 6000 feet rhododendron arboreum and dalhousiae which do not generally grow at dorjiling below 7500 feet i collected here ten kinds of rhododendron which however are not the social plants that they become at greater elevations still in the delicacy and beauty of their flowers four of them perhaps excel any others they are r aucklandii whose flowers are five inches and a half in diameter r maddeni r dalhousiae and r edgeworthii all whiteflowered bushes of which the two first rise to the height of small trees the yew appears at 7000 feet whilst on the outer ranges as on tonglo it is only found at 9500 to 10000 feet and whereas on tonglo it forms an immense tall tree with long sparse branches and slender drooping twigs growing amongst gigantic magnolias and oaks at choongtam it is small and rigid and much resembling in appearance our churchyard yew the yew spreads east from kashmir to the assam himalaya and the khasia mountains and the japan philippine island mexican and other north american yews belong to the same widelydiffused species in the khasia its most southern limit it is found as low as 5000 feet above the sealevel at 8000 feet the abies brunoniana is found a tree quite unknown further south but neither the larch nor the albies smithiana khutrow accompanied it they being confined to still more northern regions  i have seldom had occasion to allude to snakes which are rare and shy in most parts of the himalaya i however found an extremely venomous one at choongtam a small black viper a variety of the cobra di capello dr gray to whom i am indebted for the following information assures me that this reptile is not specifically distinct from the common cobra of india though all the mountain specimens of it which he has examined retain the same small size and dark colour of the other sikkim reptiles which i procured seven are colubridae and innocuous five crotalidae are venomous three of which are new species belonging to the genera parias and trimesurus lizards are not abundant but i found at choongtam a highly curious one plestiodon sikkimensis gray a kind of skink whose only allies are two north american congeners and a species of agama a chameleonlike lizard which in many important points more resembled an allied american genus than an asiatic one the common immense earthworm of sikkim ichthyophis glutinosus is a native of the khasia mountains singapore ceylon and java it is a most remarkable fact that whereas seven out of the twelve sikkim snakes are poisonous the sixteen species i procured in the khasia mountains are innocuous  which it replaces in the drier grassy parts of the interior of sikkim the large cobra not inhabiting in the mountain regions altogether i only collected about twelve species in sikkim seven of which are venomous and all are dreaded by the lepchas an enormous hornet vespa magnifica sm nearly two inches long was here brought to me alive in a cleftstick lolling out its great thornlike sting from which drops of a milky poison distilled its sting is said to produce fatal fevers in men and cattle which may very well be the case judging from that of a smaller kind which left great pain in my hand for two days while a feeling of numbness remained in the arm for several weeks it is called vok by the lepchas a common name for any bee its larvae are said to be greedily eaten as are those of various allied insects  choongtam boasts a profusion of beautiful insects amongst which the british swallowtail butterfly papilio machaon disports itself in company with magnificent black gold and scarletwinged butterflies of the trojan group so typical of the indian tropics at night my tent was filled with small waterbeetles berosi that quickly put out the candle and with lovely moths came huge cockchafers encerris griffithii and enormous and foetid flyingbugs of the genus derecterix which bear great horns on the thorax the irritation of mosquito and midge bites and the disgusting insects that clung with spiny legs to the blankets of my tent and bed were often as effectual in banishing sleep as were my anxious thoughts regarding the future  the temple at choongtam is a poor wooden building but contains some interesting drawings of lhassa with its extensive lamaseries and temples they convey the idea of a town gleaming like moscow with gilded and copper roofs but on a nearer aspect it is found to consist of a mass of stone houses and large religious edifices many stories high the walls of which are regularly pierced with small square ornamented windows mm huc and gabets account of lhassa is i do not doubt excellent as to particulars but the trees which they describe as magnificent and girdling the city have uniformly been represented to me as poor stunted willows apricots poplars and walnuts confined to the gardens of the rich no doubt the impression left by these objects on the minds of travellers from treeless tartary and of sikkimites reared amidst stupendous forests must be widely different the information concerning lhassa collected by timkowski travels of the russian mission to china in 1821 is greatly exaggerated though containing much that is true and curious the dyke to protect the city from inundations i never heard of but there is a current story in sikkim that lhassa is built in a lakebed which was dried up by a miracle of the lamas and that in heavy rain the earth trembles and the waters bubble through the soil a dorjiling rainfall i have been assured would wash away the whole city ermann travels in siberia i p 186 mentions a town klinchi near perm thus built over subterraneous springs and in constant danger of being washed away mm huc and gabet allude to the same tradition under another form they say that the natives of the banks of the kokonor affirm that the waters of that lake once occupied a subterranean position beneath lhassa and that the waters sapped the foundations of the temples as soon as they were built till withdrawn by supernatural agency  there is nothing remarkable in the geology of choongtam the base of the hill consists of the clay and mica slates overlain by gneiss generally dipping to the eastward in the latter are granite veins containing fine tourmalines actinolites are found in some highly metamorphic gneisses brought by landslips from the neighbouring heights the weather in may was cloudy and showery but the rain which fell was far less in amount than that at dorjiling during the day the suns power was great but though it rose between five and six am it never appeared above the lofty peaked mountains that girdle the valley till eight am  dark pines crest the heights around and landslips score their flanks with white seams below while streaks of snow remain throughout the month at 9000 feet above and everywhere silvery torrents leap down to

mountainbebaviour of my party bridge constructed over zemucross riveralarm of my party camp on zemu river  from this place there were two routes to tibet each of about six days journey one lay to the northwest up the lachen valley to the kongra lama pass the other to the east up the lachoong to the donkia pass the latter river has its source in small lakes in sikkim south of the donkia mountain a shoulder of which the pass crosses commanding a magnificent view into tibet the lachen on the other hand the principal source of the teesta rises beyond sikkim in the cholamoo lakes the frontier at kongra lama was described to me as being a political and not a natural boundary marked out by cairns standing on a plain and crossing the lachen river to both donkia and kongra lama i had every right to go and was determined if possible to reach them in spite of meepos ignorance our guides endeavours to frighten my party and mislead myself and the country peoples dread of incurring the dewans displeasure  the lachen valley being pronounced impracticable in the height of the rains a month later it behoved me to attempt it first and it possessed the attraction of leading to a frontier described as far to the northward of the snowy himalaya on a lofty plateau whose plants and animals were different from anything i had previously seen  after a week the coolies arrived with supplies they had been delayed by the state of the paths and had consequently consumed a great part of my stock reducing it to eight days allowance i therefore divided my party leaving the greater number at choongtam with a small tent and instructions to forward all food to me as it arrived i started with about fifteen attendants on the 25th of may for lamteng three marches up the lachen  descending the stepformed terraces i crossed the lachen by a good cane bridge the river is a headstrong torrent and turbid from the vast amount of earthy matter which it bears along and this character of extreme impetuosity unbroken by any still bend or even swirling pool it maintains uninterruptedly at this season from 4000 to 10000 feet it is crossed three times always by cane bridges and i cannot conceive any valley of its nature to be more impracticable at such a season on both sides the mountains rose densely forestclad at an average angle of 35 degrees to 40 degrees to 10000 and 15000 feet its extreme narrowness and the grandeur of its scenery were alike recalled to my mind on visiting the sachs valley in the valais of switzerland from which however it differs in its luxuriant forest and in the slopes being more uniform and less broken up into those imposing precipices so frequent in switzerland but which are wanting in the temperate regions of the sikkim himalaya  at times we scrambled over rocks 1000 feet above the river or descended into gorges through whose tributary torrents we waded or crossed swampy terraced flats of unstratified shingle above the stream whilst it was sometimes necessary to round rocky promontories in the river stemming the foaming torrent that pressed heavily against the chest as one by one we were dragged along by powerful lepchas our haltingplaces were on flats close to the river covered with large trees and carpeted with a most luxuriant herbage amongst which a wild buckwheat polygonum polygonum cymosum wall this is a common himalayan plant and is also found in the khasia mountains was abundant which formed an excellent spinach it is called pullopbi a name i shall hereafter have occasion to mention with gratitude  a few miles above choongtam we passed a few cottages on a very extensive terrace at tumlong but between this and lamteng the country is uninhabited nor is it frequented during the rains we consequently found that the roads had suffered the little bridges and aids to climb precipices and cross landslips had been carried away and at one place we were all but turned back this was at the taktoong river a tributary on the east bank which rushes down at an angle of 15 degrees in a sheet of silvery foam eighteen yards broad it does not where i crossed it flow in a deep gulley having apparently raised its bed by an accumulation of enormous boulders and a plank bridge was thrown across it against whose slippery and narrow footboards the water dashed loosening the supports on either bank and rushing between their foundation stones  my unwilling guide had gone ahead with some of the coolies i had suspected him all along perhaps unjustly of avoiding the most practicable routes but when i found him waiting for me at this bridge to which he sarcastically pointed with his bow i felt that had he known of it to have made difficulties before would have been a work of supererogation he seemed to think i should certainly turn back and assured me there was no other crossing a statement i afterwards found to be untrue so comforting myself with the hope that if the danger were imminent meepo would forcibly stop me i took off my shoes and walked steadily over the tremor of the planks was like that felt when standing on the paddlebox of a steamer and i was jerked up and down as my weight pressed them into the boiling flood which shrouded me with spray i looked neither to the right nor to the left lest the motion of the swift waters should turn my head but kept my eye on the white jets deau springing up between the woodwork and felt thankful when fairly on the opposite bank my loaded coolies followed crossing one by one without fear or hesitation the bridge was swept into the lachen very shortly afterwards  towards lamteng the path left the river and passed through a wood of abies smithiana also called a khutrow and morinda i had not before seen this tree in the himalaya it is a spruce fir much resembling the norway spruce in general appearance but with longer pendulous branches the wood is white and considered indifferent though readily cleft into planks it is called seh larch appears at 9000 feet with abies brunoniana an austere crabapple walnut and the willow of babylon the two latter perhaps cultivated yellow jessamine and ash all scarce trees in sikkim are more or less abundant in the valley from 7000 to 8000 feet as is an ivy very like the english but with fewer and smaller yellow or reddish berries and many other plants woodsorrel a whitestemmed bramble birch some maples nut gigantic lily lilium giganteum euphorbia pedicularis spiraea philadelphus deutzia indigofera and various other south europe and north american genera not found at equal elevations on the outer ranges of the himalaya  chateng a spur from the lofty peak of tukcham tuk signifies head in lepcha and cheam or chaum i believe has reference to the snow the height of tukcham has been recalculated by capt r strachey with angles taken by myself at dorjiling and jillapahar and is approximate only 19472 feet high rises 1000 feet above the west bank of the river and where crossed

bushy trees of white rose a whiteblossomed apple a pyrus like aria another like mountainash scarlet rhododendrons arboreum and barbatum holly maples and goughia this fine plant was named wight ic plant in honour of capt gough son of the late commanderinchief and an officer to whom the botany of the peninsula of india is greatly indebted it is a large and handsome evergreen very similar in foliage to a fine rhododendron and would prove an invaluable ornament on our lawns if its hardier varieties were introduced into this country a curious evergreen laurellike tree there were also daphnes purple magnolia and a pink sweetblossomed sphaerostema many english waterplants sparganium typha potamogeton callitriche utricularia sedges and rushes grew in the water but i found no shells tadpoles however swarmed which later in the season become large frogs the paintedlady butterfly cynthia cardui and a pretty blue were flitting over the flowers together with some great tropical kinds that wander so far up these valleys accompanying marlea the only subtropical tree that ascends to 8500 feet in the interior of sikkim  the river runs close tinder the eastern side of the valley which slopes so steeply as to appear for many miles almost a continuous landslip 2000 feet high  lamteng village where i arrived on the 27th of may is quite concealed by a moraine to the south which with a parallel ridge on the north forms a beautiful bay in the mountains 8900 feet above the sea and 1000 above the lachen the village stands on a grassy and bushy flat around which the pineclad mountains rise steeply to the snowy peaks and black cliffs which tower above it contains about forty houses forming the winterquarters of the inhabitants of the valley who in summer move with their flocks and herds to the alpine pastures of the tibet frontier the dwellings are like those described at wallanchoon but the elevation being lower and the situation more sheltered they are more scattered whilst on account of the dampness of the climate they are raised higher from the ground and the shingles with which they are tiled made of abies webbiana decay in two or three years many are painted lilac with the gables in diamonds of red black and white the roofs are either of wood or of the bark of abies brunoniana held down by large stones within they are airy and comfortable they are surrounded by a little cultivation of buckwheat radishes turnips and mustard the inhabitants though paying rent to the sikkim rajah consider themselves as tibetans and are so in language dress features and origin they seldom descend to choongtam but yearly travel to the tibetan towns of jigatzi kambajong giantchi and even to lhassa having always commercial and pastoral transactions with the tibetans whose flocks are pastured on the sikkim mountains during summer and who trade with the plains of india through the medium of these villagers  illustrationlamteng village  the snow having disappeared from elevations below 11000 feet the yaks sheep and ponies had just been driven 2000 feet up the valley and the inhabitants were preparing to follow with their tents and goats to summer quarters at tallum and tungu many had goitres and rheumatism for the cure of which they flocked to my tent dryrubbing for the latter and tincture of iodine for the former gained me some credit as a doctor i could however procure no food beyond trifling presents of eggs meal and more rarely fowls  on arriving i saw a troop of large monkeys  macacus pelops hodgson this is a very different species from the tropical kind seen in nepal and mentioned at vol i chapter xii gambolling in a wood of abies brunoniana this surprised me as i was not prepared to find so tropical an animal associated with a vegetation typical of a boreal climate the only other quadrupeds seen here were some small earless rats and muskdeer the young female of which latter sometimes afforded me a dish of excellent venison being though darkcoloured and lean tender sweet and shortfibred birds were scarce with the exception of alpine pigeons columba leuconota redlegged crows corvus graculus l and the horned pheasant meleagris satyra l in this month insects are scarce elater and a black earwig being the most frequent two species of serica also flew into my tent and at night moths closely resembling european ones came from the firwoods the vegetation in the neighbourhood of lamteng is european and north american that is to say it unites the boreal and temperate floras of the east and west hemispheres presenting also a few features peculiar to asia this is a subject of very great importance in physical geography as a country combining the botanical characters of several others affords materials for tracing the direction in which genera and species have migrated the causes that favour their migrations and the laws that determine the types or forms of one region which represent those of another a glance at the map will show that sikkim is geographically peculiarly well situated for investigations of this kind being centrically placed whether as regards southeastern asia or the himalayan chain again the lachen valley at this spot is nearly equidistant from the tropical forests of the terai and the sterile mountains of tibet for which reason representatives both of the dry central asiatic and siberian and of the humid malayan floras meet there  the mean temperature of lamteng about 50 degrees is that of the isothermal which passes through britain in lat 52 degrees and east europe in lat 48 degrees cutting the parallel of 45 degrees in siberia due north of lamteng itself descending to lat 42 degrees on the east coast of asia ascending to lat 48 degrees on the west of america and descending to that of new york in the united states this mean temperature is considerably increased by descending to the bed of the lachen at 8000 feet and diminished by ascending tukcham to 14000 feet which gives a range of 6000 feet of elevation and 20 degrees of mean temperature but as the climate and vegetation become arctic at 12000 feet it will be as well to confine my observations to the flora of 7000 to 10000 feet of the mean temperature namely between 53 degrees and 43 degrees the isothermal lines corresponding to which embrace on the surface of the globe at the level of the sea a space varying in different meridians from three to twelve degrees of latitude on the west coast of europe where the distance between these isothermal lines is greatest this belt extends almost from stockholm and the shetlands to paris at first sight it appears incredible that such a limited area buried in the depths of the himalaya should present nearly all the types of the flora of the north temperate zone not only however is this the case but space is also found at lamteng for the intercalation of types of a malayan flora otherwise wholly foreign to the north temperate region  a few examples will show this amongst trees the conifers are conspicuous at lamteng and all are of genera typical both of europe and north america namely silver fir spruce larch and juniper besides the yew there are also species of birch alder ash apple oak willow cherry birdcherry mountainash thorn walnut hazel maple poplar ivy holly andromeda rhamnus of bushes rose berberry bramble rhododendron elder cornel willow honeysuckle currant spiraea viburnum cotoneaster hippophae herbaceous plants as an example the ground about my tent was covered with grasses and sedges amongst which grew primroses thistles speedwell wild leeks arum convallaria callitriche oxalis ranunculus potentilla orchis chaerophyllum galium paris and anagallis besides cultivated weeds of shepherdspurse dock mustard mithridate cress radish turnip thlaspi arvense and poa annua are far too numerous to be enumerated as a list would include most of the common genera of european and north american plants  of north american genera not found in europe were buddleia podophyllum magnolia sassafras tetranthera hydrangea diclytra aralia panax symplocos trillium and clintonia the absence of heaths is also equally a feature in the flora of north america of european genera not found in north america the lachen valley has coriaria hypecoum and various cruciferae the japanese and chinese floras are represented in sikkim by camellia deutzia stachyurus aucuba helwingia stauntonia hydrangea skimmia eurya anthogonium and enkianthus the malayan by magnolias talauma many vacciniums and rhododendrons kadsura goughia marlea both coriaceous and deciduousleaved caelogyne oberonia cyrtosia calanthe and other orchids ceropegia parochetus balanophora and many scitamineae and amongst trees by engelhardtia goughia and various laurels  shortly after my arrival at lamteng the villagers sent to request that i would not shoot as they said it brought on excessive rain in griffiths narrative of pembertons mission to bhotan posthumous papers journal p 283 it is mentioned that the gylongs lamas attributed a violent storm to the members of the mission shooting birds and consequent damage to the crops my necessities did not admit of my complying with their wish unless i could procure food by other means and i at first paid no attention to their request the people however became urgent and the choongtam lama giving his high authority to the superstition it appeared impolitic to resist their earnest supplication though i was well aware that the story was trumped up by the lama for the purpose of forcing me to return i yielded on the promise of provisions being supplied from the village which was done to a limited extent and i was enabled to hold out till more arrived from dorjiling now owing to the state of the roads at the distance of twenty days march the people were always civil and kind there was no concealing the fact that the orders were stringent prohibiting my party being supplied with food but many of the villagers sought opportunities by night of replenishing my stores superstitious and timorous they regard a doctor with great veneration and when to that is added his power of writing drawing and painting their admiration knows no bounds they flocked round my tent all day scratching their ears lolling out their tongues making a clucking noise smiling and timidly peeping over my shoulder but flying in alarm when my little dog resented their familiarity by snapping at their legs the men spend the whole day in loitering about smoking and spinning wool the women in active duties a few were engaged in drying the leaves of a shrub symplocos for the tibet market which are used as a yellow dye whilst occasionally a man might be seen cutting a spoon or a yaksaddle out of rhododendron wood  during my stay at lamteng the weather was all but uniformly cloudy and misty with drizzling rain and a southerly or upvalley wind during the day which changed to an easterly one at night occasionally distant thunder was heard my raingauges showed very little rain compared with what fell at dorjiling during the same period the clouds were thin both sun and moon shining through them without however the former warming the soil hence my tent was constantly wet nor did i once sleep in a dry bed till the 1st of june which ushered in the month with a brilliant sunny day at night it generally rained in torrents and the roar of landslips and avalanches was then all but uninterrupted for hour after hour sometimes it was a rumble at others a harsh grating sound and often accompanied with the crashing of immense timbertrees or the murmur of the distant snowy avalanches the amount of denudation by atmospheric causes is here quite incalculable and i feel satisfied that the violence of the river at this particular part of its course where it traverses those parts of the valleys which are most snowy and rainy is proximately due to impediments thus accumulated in its bed  it was sometimes clear at sunrise and i made many ascents of tukcham hoping for a view of the mountains towards the passes but i was only successful on one occasion when i saw the table top of kinchinjhow the most remarkable and one of the most distant peaks of dazzling snow which is seen from dorjiling and which i was told is far beyond sikkim in tibet such however is not the case kinchinjhow is on the frontier of sikkim though a considerable distance behind the most snowy of the sikkim mountains i kept up a constant intercourse with choongtam sending my plants thither to be dried and gradually reducing my party as our necessities urged my so doing lastly i sent back the shooters who had procured very little and whose occupation was now gone  on the 2nd of june i received the bad news that a large party of coolies had been sent from dorjiling with rice but that being unable or afraid to pass the landslips they had returned we had now no food except a kid a few handfuls of flour and some potatos which had been sent up from choongtam all my endeavours to gain information respecting the distance and position of the frontier were unavailing probably indeed the lama and phipun or chief man of the village were the only persons who knew the villagers calling all the lofty pastures a few marches beyond lamteng bhote or cheen tibet dr campbell had procured for me information by which i might recognise the frontier were i once on it but no description could enable me to find my way in a country so rugged and forestclad through tortuous and perpetually forking valleys along often obliterated paths and under cloud and rain to these difficulties must be added the deception of the rulers and the fact of which i was not then aware that the tibet frontier was formerly at choongtam but from the lepchas constantly harassing the tibetans the latter after the establishment of the chinese rule over their country retreated first to zemu samdong a few hours walk above lamteng then to tallum samdong 2000 feet higher and lastly to kongra lama 16000 feet up the west flank of kinchinjhow  on the third of june i took a small party with my tent and such provisions as i had to explore up the river on hearing of my intention the phipun volunteered to take me to the frontier which he said was only two hours distant at zemu samdong where the lachen receives the zemu river from the westward this i knew must be false but i accepted his services and we started accompanied by a large body of villagers who eagerly gathered plants for me along the road  the scenery is very pretty the path crosses extensive and dangerous landslips or runs through fine woods of spruce and abies brunoniana and afterwards along the riverbanks which are fringed with willow called lama and hippophae the great red rose rosa macrophylla one of the most beautiful himalayan plants whose single flowers are as large as the palm of the hand was blossoming while golden potentillas and purple primroses flowered by the stream and pyrola in the firwoods  just above the fork of the valley a wooden bridge samdong crosses the zemu which was pointed out to me as the frontier and i was entreated to respect two sticks and a piece of worsted stretched across it this i thought too ridiculous so as my followers halted on one side i went on the bridge threw the sticks into the stream crossed and asked the phipun to follow the people laughed and came over he then told me that he had authority to permit of my botanising there but that i was in cheen and that he would show me the guardhouse to prove the truth of his statement he accordingly led me up a steep bank to an extensive broad flat several hundred feet above the river and forming a triangular base to the great spur which rising steeply behind divides the valley this flat was marshy and covered with grass and buried in the jungle were several ruined stone houses with thick walls pierced with loopholes these had no doubt been occupied by tibetans at the time when this was the frontier  the elevation which i had attained that of the river being 8970 feet being excellent for botanising i camped and the villagers contented with the supposed success of their strategy returned to lamteng  my guide from the durbar had staid behind at lainteng and though meepo and all my men well knew that this was not the frontier they were ignorant as to its true position nor could we even ascertain which of the rivers was the lachen the eastern afterwards proved to be the lachen the only routes i possessed indicated two paths northwards from lamteng neither crossing a river and i therefore thought it best to remain at zemu samdong till provisions should arrive i accordingly halted for three days collecting many new and beautiful plants and exploring the roads of which five paths or yaktracks diverged from this point one on either bank of each river and one leading up the fork  on one occasion i ascended the steep hill at the fork it was dry and rocky and crowned with stunted pines stacks of different sorts of pinewood were stored on the flat at its base for export to tibet all thatched with the bark of abies brunoniana of these the larch larix griffithii sah splits well and is the most durable of any but the planks are small soft and white i never saw this wood to be red closegrained and hard like that of the old swiss larch nor does it ever reach so great a size the silver fir abies webbiana dunshing also splits well it is white soft and highly prized for durability the wood of abies brunoniana semadoong is like the others in appearance but is not durable its bark is however very useful the spruce abies smithiana seh has also white wood which is employed for posts and beams these woods are all soft and loose in grain compared with their european allies these are the only pines whose woods are considered very useful and it is a curious circumstance that none produce any quantity of resin turpentine or pitch which may perhaps be accounted for by the humidity of the climate  pinus longifolia called by the lepchas gnietkoong and by the bhoteeas teadong only grows in low valleys where better timber is abundant the weeping blue juniper juniperus recurva deschoo and the arboreous black one called tchokpo this i have vol i chapter xi referred to the j excelsa of the northwest himalaya a plant which under various names is found in many parts of europe and many parts of europe and north america but since then dr thomson and i have had occasion to compare my sikkim conifers with the northwest himalayan ones and we have found that this sikkim species is probably new and that j excelsa is not found east of nepal yield beautiful wood like that of the pencil cedar also a juniper from bermuda j bermudiana but are comparatively scarce as is the yew taxus baccata tingschi whose timber is red the tchenden or funereal cypress again is valued only for the odour of its wood pinus excelsa tongschi though common in bhotan is as i have elsewhere remarked not found in east nepal or sikkim the wood is admirable being durable closegrained and so resinous as to be used for flambeaux and candles  on the flat were flowering a beautiful magnolia with globular sweetscented flowers like snowballs several balsams with species of convallaria cotoneaster gentian spiraea euphorbia pedicularis and honeysuckle on the hillside were creeping brambles lovely yellow purple pink and white primroses whiteflowered thalictrum and anemone berberry podophyllum white rose fritillary lloydia etc on the flanks of tukcham in the bed of a torrent i gathered many very alpine plants at the comparatively low elevation of 10000 feet as dwarf willows pinguicula a genus not previously found in the himalaya oxyria adrosace tofieldia arenaria saxifrages and two dwarf heathlike andromedas besides these a month later the following flowered in profusion scarlet buddleia gigantic lily yellow jasmine aster potentilla several kinds of orchids willowherb epilobium purple roscoea neillia morina many grasses and umbelliferae these formed a rank and dense herbaceous mostly annual vegetation six feet high bound together with cuscuta climbing leguminosae and ceropegia the great summer heat and moisture here favour the ascent of various tropical genera of which i found in august several orchideae calanthe microstylis and coelogyne also begonia bryonia cynanchum aristolochia eurya procris acanthaceae and cyrtandraseae the rocks were all of gneiss with granite veins tourmaline and occasionally pieces of pure plumbago  our guide had remained at lamteng on the plea of a sore on his leg from leechbites his real object however was to stop a party on their way to tibet with madder and canes who had they continued their journey would inevitably have pointed out the road to me the villagers themselves now wanted to proceed to the pasturinggrounds on the frontier so the phipun sent me word that i might proceed as far as i liked up the east bank of the zemu i had explored the path and finding it practicable and likely to intersect a less frequented route to the frontier that crossing the tekonglah pass from bah see chapter xviii i determined to follow it a supply of food arrived from dorjiling on the 5th of june reduced however to one bag of rice but with encouraging letters and the assurance that more would follow at once my men of whom i bad eight behaved admirably although our diet had for five days chiefly consisted of polygonum pullopbi wild leeks lagook nettles and procris an allied and more succulent herb eked out by eight pounds of tibet meal tsamba which i had bought for ten shillings by stealth from the villagers what concerned me most was the destruction of my plants by constant damp and the want of sun to dry the papers which reduced my collections to a tithe of what they would otherwise have been  from zemu samdong the valley runs northwest for two marches to the junction of the zemu with the thlonok which rises on the northeast flank of kinchinjunga at this place i halted for several days while building a bridge over the thlonok the path runs first through a small forest of birch alder and maple on the latter of which i found balanophora a curious leafless parasite mentioned at vol i chapter v growing abundantly this species produces the great knots on the maple roots from which the tibetans form the cups mentioned by mm huc and gabet i was so fortunate as to find a small store of these knots cleaned and cut ready for the turner and hidden behind a stone by some poor tibetan who had never retained to the spot they had evidently been there a very long time  in the ravines there were enormous accumulations of ice the result of avalanches one of them crossed the river forming a bridge thirty feet thick at an elevation of only 9800 feet above the sea this icebridge was 100 yards broad and flanked by heaps of boulders the effects of combined land and snowslips these stony places were covered with a rich herbage of rhubarb primroses euphorbia sedum polygonum convallaria and a purple dentaria kenroopbi a cruciferous plant much eaten as a potherb in the pinewoods a large mushroom onglau cortinarius emodensis of the rev m j berkeley who has named and described it from my specimens and drawings it is also called yungla tchamo by the tibetans the latter word signifying a toadstool mr berkeley informs me that the whole vast genus cortinarius scarcely possesses a single other edible species he adds that c violaceus and violaceocinereus are eaten in austria and italy but not always with safety tibet was abundant which also forms a favourite article of food another potherb to which i was afterwards more indebted than any was a beautiful smilacina which grows from two to five feet high and has plaited leaves and crowded panicles of white bellshaped flowers like those of its ally the lily of the valley which it also resembles in its mucilaginous properties it is called choklibi it is also found on the top of sinchul near dorjiling and its young flowerheads sheathed in tender green leaves form an excellent vegetable nor must i forget to include amongst the eatable plants of this hungry country young shoots of the mountainbamboo which are good either raw or boiled and may be obtained up to 12000 feet in this valley a species of asarum asarabacca grows in the pinewoods a genus not previously known to be himalayan the root like its english medicinal congener has a strong and peculiar smell at 10000 feet abies webbiana commences with a close undergrowth of a small twiggy holly this and the dense thicket of rhododendron of which i had already gathered thirteen kinds in this valley on the banks of the river and edges of the wood rendered the march very fatiguing and swarms of midges kept up a tormenting irritation  the zemu continued an impetuous muddy torrent whose hoarse voice mingled with the deep grumbling noise the dull rumbling noise thus produced is one of the most singular phenomena in these mountains and cannot fail to strike the observer at night especially the sound seems increased the reason of which is not apparent for in these regions so wanting in animal life the night is no stiller than the day and the melting of snow being less the volume of waters must be somewhat though not conspicuously diminished the interference of sound by heated currents of different density is the most obvious cause of the diminished reverberation during the day to which humboldt adds the increased tension of vapour and possibly an echo from its particles of the boulders rolling along its bed was my lullaby for many nights its temperature at zemu samdong was 45 degrees to 46 degrees in june at its junction with the thlonok it comes down a steep gulley from the north foreshortened into a cataract 1000 feet high and appearing the smaller stream of the two whilst the thlonok winds down from the snowy face of kinchinjunga which is seen up the valley bearing wsw about twenty miles distant all around are lofty and rocky mountains sparingly wooded with pines and larch chiefly on their south flanks which receive the warm moist upvalley winds the faces exposed to the north being colder and more barren exactly the reverse of what is the case at choongtam where the rocky and sunny southexposed flanks are the driest  my tent was pitched on a broad terrace opposite the junction of the zemu and thlonok and 10850 feet above the sea it was sheltered by some enormous transported blocks of gneiss fifteen feet high and surrounded by a luxuriant vegetation of most beautiful rhododendrons in full flower willow white rose white flowered cherry thorn maple and birch some great tuberousrooted arums two species of arisaema called tong by the tibetans and sinkree by the lepchas were very abundant and the ground was covered with small pits in which were large wooden pestles these are used in the preparation of food from the arums to which the miserable inhabitants of the valley have recourse in spring when their yaks are calving the roots are bruised with the pestles and thrown into these holes with water acetous fermentation commences in seven or eight days which is a sign that the acrid poisonous principle is dissipated the pulpy sour and fibrous mass is then boiled and eaten its nutriment being the starch which exists in small quantities and which they have not the skill to separate by grating and washing this preparation only keeps a few days and produces bowel complaints and loss of the skin and hair especially when insufficiently fermented besides this the choklibi and many other esculents abounded here and we had great need of them before leaving this wild uninhabited region  i repeatedly ascended the north flank of tukcham along a watercourse by the side of which were immense slips of rocks and snowbeds the mountainside being excessively steep some of the masses of gneiss thus brought down were dangerously poised on slopes of soft shingle and daily moved a little downwards all the rocks were gneiss and granite with radiating crystals of tourmaline as thick as the thumb below 12000 to 13000 feet the mountainsides were covered with a dense scrub of rhododendron bushes except where broken by rocks landslips and torrents above this the winters snow lay deep and black rocks and small glaciers over which avalanches were constantly falling with a sullen roar forbade all attempts to proceed my object in ascending was chiefly to obtain views and compass bearings in which i was generally disappointed once only i had a magnificent prospect of kinchinjunga sweeping down in one unbroken mass of glacier and ice fully 14000 feet high to the head of the thlonok river whose upper valley appeared a broad bay of ice doubtless forming one of the largest glaciers in the himalaya and increased by lateral feeders that flow into it from either flank of the valley the south side of this the thlonok valley is formed by a range from kinchinjunga running east to tukcham where it terminates from it rises the beautiful mountain liklo d2 of the peaks laid down in colonel waughs trigonometrical survey from dorjiling i believe to be the liklo of dr campbells itineraries from dorjiling to lhassa compiled from the information of the traders see bengal asiatic societys journal for 1848 the routes in which proved of the utmost value to me 22582 feet high which from dorjiling appears as a sharp peak but is here seen to be a jagged crest running north and south on the north flank of the valley the mountains are more sloping and black with patches of snow above 15000 feet but little anywhere else except on another beautiful peak alt 19240 feet marked d3 on the map this flank is also continuous from kinchin it divides sikkim from tibet and runs northeast to the great mountain chomiomo which was not visible the streams from its north flank flowing into the arun river in tibet a beautiful blue arch of sky spanned all this range indicating the dry tibetan climate beyond  i made two futile attempts to ascend the thlonok river to the great glaciers at the foot of kinchinjunga following the south bank and hoping to find a crossingplace and so to proceed north to tibet the fall of the river is not great at this part of its course nor up to 12000 feet which was the greatest height i could attain and about eight miles beyond my tents above that point at the base of liklo the bed of the valley widens and the rhododendron shrubbery was quite impervious while the sides of the mountain were inaccessible we crossed extensive snowbeds by cutting holes in their steep faces and rounded rocks in the bed of the torrent dragging one another through the violent current whose temperature was below 40 degrees  on these occasions the energy of meepo nimbo the chief of the coolies and the lepcha boys was quite remarkable and they were as keenly anxious to reach the holy country of tibet as i could possibly be it was sometimes dark before we got back to our tents tired with torn clothes and cut feet and hands returning to a miserable dinner of boiled herbs but never did any of them complain or express a wish to leave me in the evenings and mornings they were always busy changing my plants and drying the papers over a sulky fire at my tentdoor and at night they slept each wrapt in his own blanket huddled together under a rock with another blanket thrown over them all provisions reached us so seldom and so reduced in quantity that i could never allow more than one pound of rice to each man in a day and frequently during this trying month they had not even that and i eked out our meagre supply with a few ounces of preserved meats occasionally splicing the main brace with weak rum and water  at the highest point of the valley which i reached water boiled at 1913 indicating an elevation of 11903 feet the temperature at 1 pm was nearly 70 degrees and of the wet bulb 55 degrees indicating a dryness of 0462 and dew point 470 such phenomena of heat and dryness are rare and transient in the wet valleys of sikkim and show the influence here of the tibetan climate i gathered here amongst an abundance of alpine species all of european and arctic type a curious trefoil the parochetus communis which ranges through 9000 feet of elevation on the himalaya and is also found in java and ceylon  after boiling my thermometer on these occasions i generally made a little tea for the party a refreshment to which they looked forward with childlike eagerness the fairness with which these goodhearted people used to divide the scanty allowance and afterwards the leaves which are greatly relished was an engaging trait in their simple character i have still vividly before me their sleek swarthy faces and twinkling tartar eyes as they lay stretched on the ground in the sun or crouched in the sleet and snow beneath some sheltering rock each with his little polished wooden cup of tea watching my notes and instruments with curious wonder asking how high are we how cold is it and comparing the results with those of other stations with much interest and intelligence  on the 11th june my active people completed a most ingenious bridge of branches of trees bound by withes of willow by which i crossed to the north bank where i camped on an immense flat terrace at the junction of the rivers and about fifty feet above their bed the first step or ascent from the river is about five feet high and formed of waterworn boulders pebbles and sand scarcely stratified the second fully 1000 yards broad is ten feet high and swampy the uppermost is fifteen feet above the second and is covered with gigantic boulders and vast rotting trunks of fallen pines buried in an impenetrable jungle of dwarf smallleaved holly and rhododendrons the surface was composed of a rich vegetable mould which where clear of forest supported a rank herbage six to eight feet high this consisted of grasses sedges bupleurum rhubarb ranunculus convallaria smilacina nettles thistles arum balsams and the superb yellow meconopsis nepalensis whose racemes of golden poppylike flowers were as broad as the palm of the hand it grows three and even six feet high and resembles a small hollyhock whilst a stately heracleum ten feet high towered over all forests of silver fir with junipers and larch girdled these flats and on their edges grew rhododendrons scarlet spiraea several honeysuckles white clematis and viburnum ferns are much scarcer in the pinewoods than elsewhere in the forest regions of the himalaya in this valley alt 10850 feet i found only two kinds hymenophyllum lomaria cystopteris davallia two polypodia and several aspidia and asplenia selaginella ascends to zemu samdong 9000 feet the pteris aquilina brake does not ascend above 10000 feet  our first discovery after crossing was of a good bridge across the zemu above its junction and of a path leading down to zemu samdong this was however scarcely traceable up either stream my men were better housed here in sheds and i made several more ineffectual attempts to ascend the valley to the glaciers the path gradually vanishing ran alternately through firwoods and over open grassy spots covered with vegetation amongst which the gigantic arum was plentiful whose roots seemed to be the only attraction in this wet and miserable valley  on my return one day i found my people in great alarm the phipun having sent word that we were on the tibet side of the rivers and that tibetan troops were coming to plunder my goods and carry my men into slavery i assured them he only wanted to frighten them that the cheen soldiers were civil orderly people and that as long as meepo was with us there was no cause for fear fortunately a young muskdeer soon afterwards broke cover close to the tent and its flesh wonderfully restored their courage still i was constantly harassed by threats some of my people were suffering from cold and bowel complaints and i from rheumatism while one fine lad who came from dorjiling was delirious with a violent fever contracted in the lower valleys which sadly dispirited my party  having been successful in finding a path i took my tent and a few active lads 1000 feet up the zemu camping on a high rock above the forest region at 12070 feet hoping thence to penetrate northwards i left my collections in the interim at the junction of the rivers where the sheds and an abundance of firewood were great advantages for preserving the specimens at this elevation we were quite free from midges and leeches the latter had not appeared above 11500 feet but the weather continued so uniformly rainy and bad that we could make no progress i repeatedly followed the river for several miles ascending to 13300 feet but though its valley widened and its current was less rapid the rhododendron thickets below and the cliffs above defeated all endeavours to reach the drier climate beyond of which i had abundant evidence in the arch of brilliant blue that spanned the heavens to the north beyond a black canopy of clouds that hid everything around and poured down rain without one days

curds and churnshospitalitykinchinjhow and chomiomomagnificent sceneryreach kongra lama pass  my little tent was pitched in a commanding situation on a rock fifty feet above the zemu overlooking the course of that river to its junction with the thlonok the descent of the zenlu in one thousand feet is more precipitous than that of any other river of its size with which i am acquainted in sikkim yet immediately above my camp it was more tranquil than at any part of its course onwards to the plains of india whether as the zemu lachen or teesta on the west bank a fine mountain rose in steep ridges and shrubby banks to 15000 feet on the east a rugged cliff towered above the stream and from this huge masses of rock were ever and anon precipitated into the torrent with a roar that repeatedly spread consternation amongst us during rains especially and at night when the chilled atmospheric currents of air descend and the sound is not dissipated as in the daytime the noise of these falls is sufficiently alarming my tent was pitched near the base of the cliff and so high above the river that i had thought it beyond the reach of danger but one morning i found that a large fragment of granite had been hurled during the night to my very door my dog having had a very narrow escape to what depth the accumulation at the base of this cliff may reach i had no means of judging but the rapid slope of the riverbed is mainly due to this and to old moraines at the mouth of the valley below i have seen few finer sights than the fall of these stupendous blocks into the furious torrent along which they are carried amid feathery foam for many yards before settling to rest  across the thlonok to the southwards rose the magnificent mountain of tukcham but i only once caught a glimpse of its summit which even then clouded over before i could get my instruments adjusted for ascertaining its height its top is a sharp cone surrounded by rocky shoulders that rise from a mass of snow its eastern slope of 8000 feet is very rapid about 38 degrees from its base at the zemu river to its summit  glaciers in the northwest himalaya descend to 11000 feet but i could not discover any in these valleys even so low as 14000 feet though at this season extensive snowbeds remain unmelted at but little above 10000 feet the foot of the stupendous glacier filling the broad head of the thlonok is certainly not below 14000 feet though being continuous with the perpetual snow or neve of the summit of kinchinjunga it must have 14000 feet of ice in perpendicular height to urge it forwards  all my attempts to advance up the zemu were fruitlesss and a snow bridge by which i had hoped to cross to the opposite bank was carried away by the daily swelling river while the continued bad weather prevented any excursions for days together botany was my only resource and as vegetation was advancing rapidly under the influence of the southerly winds i had a rich harvest for though compositae pedicularis and a few more of the finer himalayan plants flower later june is still the most glorious month for show  rhododendrons occupy the most prominent place clothing the mountain slopes with a deep green mantle glowing with bells of brilliant colours of the eight or ten species growing here every bush was loaded with as great a profusion of blossoms as are their northern congeners in our english gardens primroses are next both in beauty and abundance and they are accompanied by yellow cowslips three feet high purple polyanthus and pink largeflowered dwarf kinds nestling in the rocks and an exquisitely beautiful blue miniature species whose blossoms sparkle like sapphires on the turf gentians begin to unfold their deep azure bells aconites to rear their tall blue spikes and fritillaries and meconopsis burst into flower on the black rocks the gigantic rhubarb forms pale pyramidal towers a yard high of inflated reflexed bracts that conceal the flowers and overlapping one another like tiles protect them from the wind and rain a whorl of broad green leaves edged with red spreads on the ground at the base of the plant contrasting in colour with the transparent bracts which are yellow margined with pink this is the handsomest herbaceous plant in sikkim it is called tchuka and the acid stems are eaten both raw and boiled they are hollow and full of pure water the root resembles that of the medicinal rhubarb but it is spongy and inert it attains a length of four feet and grows as thick as the arm the dried leaves afford a substitute for tobacco a smaller kind of rhubarb is however more commonly used in tibet for this purpose it is called chula  the elevation being 12080 feet i was above the limit of trees and the ground was covered with many kinds of smallflowered honeysuckles berberry and white rose besides these i found a prickly aralia maple two currants eight or nine rhododendrons many sedums rhodiola white clematis redflowered cherry birch willow viburnum juniper a few ferns two andromedas menziesia and spircaea and in addition to the herbs mentioned above may be enumerated parnassia many saxifrages soldanella draba and various other cruciferae nardostachys spikenard epilobium thalictrum and very many other genera almost all typical of the siberian north european and arctic floras  i saw no birds and of animals only an occasional muskdeer insects were scarce and quite different from what i had seen before chiefly consisting of phryganea mayfly and some carabidae an order that is very scarce in the himalaya with various moths chiefly geometrae  the last days of june as is often the case were marked by violent storms and for two days my tent proved no protection similar weather prevailed all over india the barometer falling very low i took horary observations of the barometer in the height of the storm on the 30th the tide was very small indeed 024 inch between 950 am and 4 pm and the thermometer ranged between 47 degrees and 578 degrees between 7 am and midnight snow fell abundantly as low as 13000 feet and the rivers were much swollen the size and number of the stones they rolled along producing a deafening turmoil only 37 inches of rain fell between the 23rd of june and the 2nd of july whilst 21 inches fell at dorjiling and 67 inches at calcutta during the same period the mean temperature was 48 degrees extremes 62 degrees365 degrees the humidity was nearly at saturationpoint the wind southerly very raw and cold and drizzling rain constantly fell a comparison of thirty observations with dorjiling gave a difference of 14 degrees temperature which is at the rate of 1 degree for every 347 feet of ascent fortyseven observations comparative with calcutta gave 348 degrees difference and if 55 degrees of temperature be deducted for northing in latitude the result is 1 degree for every 412 feet of ascent my observations at the junction of the rivers alt 10850 feet during the early part of the mouth gave 1 degree to 304 feet as the result of twentyfour observations with dorjiling and 1 degree to 394 feet from seventyfour observations with calcutta  the temperature of these rivers varies extremely at different parts of their course depending on that of their affluents the teesta is always cool in summer where its bed is below 2000 feet its temperature being 20 degrees below that of the air whereas in midwinter when there is less cloud and the snows are not melting it is only a few degrees colder than the air during my sojourn at bhomsong in midwinter of 1848 see v i chapter xiii the mean temperature of the teesta was 51 degrees and of the air 523 degrees at that elevation the river water rarely exceeds 60 degrees at midsummer between 4000 feet and 300 the plains its mean temperature varies about 10 degrees between january and july at 6000 feet it varies from 55 degrees to 43 degrees during the same period and at 10000 feet it freezes at the edges in winter and rises to 50 degrees in july at this season in descending from 12000 feet to 1000 feet its temperature does not rise 10 degrees though that of the air rises 30 degrees or 40 degrees it is a curious fact that the temperature of the northern feeders of the teesta in some parts of their course rises with the increasing elevation of this the zemu afforded a curious example during my stay at its junction with the thlonok it was 46 degrees or 6 degrees warmer than that river at 1100 feet higher it was 48 degrees and at 1100 feet higher still it was 49 degrees these observations were repeated in different weeks and several times on the same day both in ascending and descending and always with the same result they told as certainly as if i had followed the river to its source that it rose in a drier and comparatively sunny climate and flowed amongst little snowed mountains  meanwhile the lachen phipun continued to threaten us and i had to send back some of the more timorous of my party on the 28th of june fifty men arrived at the thlonok and turned my people out of the shed at the junction of the rivers together with the plants they were preserving my boards papers and utensils the boys came to me breathless saying that there were tibetan soldiers amongst them who declared that i was in cheen and that they were coming on the following morning to make a clean sweep of my goods and drive me back to dorjiling i had little fear for myself but was anxious with respect to my collections it was getting late in the day and raining and i had no mind to go down and expose myself to the first brunt of their insolence which i felt sure a night of such weather would materially wash away meepo was too frightened but nimbo my bhotan coolie sirdar volunteered to go with two stout fellows and he accordingly brought away my plants and papers having held a parley with the enemy who as i suspected were not tibetans the best news he brought was that they were half clad and without food the worst that they swaggered and bullied he added with some pride that he gave them as good as he got which i could readily believe nimbo being really a resolute fellow in east nepal he drew his knife on a ghorka sepoy and in the following winter was bold enough to make his escape in chains from tumloong and accomplished in tibet slang  on the following morning it rained harder than ever and the wind was piercingly cold my timid lepchas huddled behind my tent which from its position was only to be stormed in front i dismantled my little observatory and packed up the instruments tied my dog kinchin to one of the tentpegs placed a line of stones opposite the door and seated myself on my bed on the ground with my gun beside me  the dog gave tongue as twenty or thirty people defiled up the glen and gathered in front of my tent they were ragged bhoteeas with bare heads and legs in scanty woollen garments sodden with rain which streamed off their shaggy hair and furrowed their sooty faces their whole appearance recalled to my mind dugald dalgettys friends the children of the mist  they appeared nonplussed at seeing no one with me and at my paying no attention to them whilst the valiant kinchin effectually scared them from the tentdoor when they requested a parley i sent the interpreter to say that i would receive three men and that only provided all the rest were sent down immediately this as i anticipated was acceded to at once and there remained only the lachen phipun and his brother without waiting to let him speak i rated him soundly saying that i was ready to leave the spot when he could produce any proof of my being in bhote or cheen which he knew well i was not that since my arrival at lachen he had told me nothing but lies and had contravened every order both of the rajah and of tchebu lama i added that i had given him and his people kindness and medicine their return was bad and he must go about his business at once having as i knew no food and i having none for him he behaved very humbly throughout and finally took himself off much discomfited and two days afterwards sent men to offer to assist me in moving my things  the first of july was such a day as i had long waited for to obtain a view and i ascended the mountain west of my camp to a point where water boiling at 1857 degrees air 42 degrees gave an elevation of 14914 feet on the top of the range about 1000 feet above this there was no snow on the eastern exposures except in hollows but on the west slopes it lay in great fields twenty or thirty feet thick while to the north the mountains all appeared destitute of snow with grassy flanks and rugged tops  drizzling mist which had shrouded tukcham all the morning soon gathered on this mountain and prevented any prospect from the highest point reached but on the ascent i had an excellent view up the zemu which opened into a broad grassy valley where i saw with the glass some wooden sheds but no cattle or people to reach these however involved crossing the river which was now impossible and i reluctantly made up my mind to return on the morrow to zemu samdong and thence try the other river  on my descent to the thlonok i found that the herbaceous plants on the terraces had grown fully two feet during the fortnight and now presented almost a tropical luxuriance and beauty thence i reached zemu samdong in one day and found the vegetation there even more gay and beautiful the gigantic lily was in full flower and scenting the air with the lovely red rose called chirring by the tibetans neillia was blossoming profusely at my old campingground to which i now returned after a months absence  soon after my arrival i received letters from dr campbell who had strongly and repeatedly represented to the rajah his opinion of the treatment i was receiving and this finally brought an explicit answer to the effect that his orders had been full and peremptory that i should be supplied with provisions and safely conducted to the frontier with these came letters on the rajahs part from tchebu lama to the lachen phipun ordering him to take me to the pass but not specifying its position fortunately however dr campbell sent me a route which stated the pass to be at kongra lama several marches beyond this and in the barren country of tibet  on the 5th of july the singtam soubah arrived from chola the rajahs summer residence he was charged to take me to the frontier and brought letters from his highness as well as a handsome present consisting of tibet cloth and a dress of china silk brocaded with gold the ranee also sent me a basket of lhassa sweetmeats consisting of sultana raisins from bokhara sliced and dried apricots from lhassa and diospyros fruit from china called gubroon by the tibetans the soubah wanted to hurry me on to the frontier and back at once being no doubt instigated to do so by the dewans party and by his having no desire to spend much time in the dreary lofty regions i wanted to explore i positively refused however to start until more supplies arrived except he used his influence to provide me with food and as he insisted that the frontier was at tallum samdong only one march up the lachen i foresaw that this move was to be but one step forward though in the right direction he went forward to tallum at once leaving me to follow  the lamteng people had all migrated beyond that point to tungu where they were pasturing their cattle i sent thither for food and procured a little meal at a very high price a few fowls and eggs the messenger brought back word that tungu was in tibet and that the villagers ignored kongra lama a large piece of yakflesh being brought for sale i purchased it but it proved the toughest meat i ever ate being no doubt that of an animal that had succumbed to the arduous duties of a saltcarrier over the passes at this season however when the calves are not a month old it was in vain to expect better  large parties of women and children were daily passing my tent from tungu to collect arumroots at the thlonok all with baskets at their backs down to rosy urchins of six years old they returned after several days their baskets neatly lined with broad rhododendron leaves and full of a nauseouslooking yellow acid pulp which told forcibly of the extreme poverty of the people the children were very fair indeed the young tibetan is as fair as an english brunette before his perennial coat of smoke and dirt has permanently stained his face and it has become bronzed and wrinkled by the scorching sun and rigorous climate of these inhospitable countries children and women were alike decked with roses and all were goodhumoured and pleasant behaving with great kindness to one another and unaffected politeness to me  during my ten days stay at zemu samdong i formed a large collection of insects which was in great part destroyed by damp many were new beautiful and particularly interesting from belonging to types whose geographical distribution is analogous to that of the vegetation the caterpillar of the swallowtail butterfly papilio machaon was common feeding on umbelliferous plants as in england and a sphynx like s euphorbiae was devouring the euphorbias the english cynthia cardui paintedlady butterfly was common as were sulphurs marbles pontia whites blues and thecla of british aspect but foreign species amongst these tropical forms were rare except one fine black swallowtail of moths noctuae and geometrae abounded with many flies and tipulae hymenoptera were scarce except a yellow ophion which lays its eggs in the caterpillars abovementioned beetles were most rare and what is remarkable the woodborers longicorns and curculio particularly so a large telephora was very common and had the usual propensity of its congeners for blood lamellicorns were also abundant  on the 11th of july five coolies arrived with rice they had been twenty days on the road and had been obliged to make great detours the valley being in many places impassable they brought me a parcel of english letters and i started up the lachen on the following day with renewed spirits and high hopes the road first crossed the zemu and the spur beyond and then ascended the west bank of the lachen a furious torrent for five or six miles during which it descends 1000 feet in a chasm from which rise lofty black pineclad crags topped by snowy mountains 14000 to 16000 feet high one remarkable mass of rock on the east bank is called sakyazong or the abode of sakya often pronounced thakya one of the boodhist trinity at its base a fine cascade falls into the river  above 11000 feet the valley expands remarkably the mountains recede become less wooded and more grassy while the stream is suddenly less rapid meandering in a broader bed and bordered by marshes covered with carex blysmus dwarf tamarisk and many kinds of yellow and red pedicularis both tall and beautiful there are far fewer rhododendrons here than in the damper zemu valley at equal elevations and more siberian or dry country types of vegetation as astragali of several kinds habenaria epipactis dandelion and a caraway whose stems called in tibet gzira are much sought for as a condiment umbelliferae abound here with sage ranunculus anemone aconites halenia gentians panax euphrasia speedwell prunella vulgaris thistles bistort parnassia purple orchis prenanthes and lactuca the woody plants of this region are willows birch cotoneaster maple three species of viburnum three of spiraea vaccinium aralia deutzia philadelphus rhododendrons two junipers silver fir larch three honeysuckles neillia and a pieris whose white blossoms are so full of honey as to be sweet and palatable the singtam soubah and lachen phipun received me at the bridge samdong at tallum and led me across the river into cheen they affirmed to a pretty green sward near some gigantic gneiss boulders where i camped close by the river and 11480 feet above the sea  the village of tallum consists of a few wretched stone huts placed in a broad part of the valley which is swampy and crossed by several ancient moraines which descend from the gulleys on the east flank i have elsewhere noticed that in sikkim the ancient moraines above 9000 feet are almost invariably deposited from valleys opening to the westward the cottages are from four to six feet high without windows and consist of a single apartment containing neither table chair stool nor bed the inmates huddle together amid smoke filth and darkness and sleep on a plank and their only utensils are a bamboo churn copper bamboo and earthenware vessels for milk butter etc  grassy or stony mountains slope upwards at an angle of 20 degrees at lamteng and up the zemu the slopes are 40 degrees and 50 degrees giving a widely different aspect to the valleys from these flats to 15000 feet but no snow is visible except on kinchinjhow and chomiomo about fifteen miles up the valley both these are flattopped and dazzlingly white rising into small peaks and precipitous on all sides they are grand bold isolated masses quite unlike the ordinary snowy mountains in form and far more imposing even than kinchinjunga though not above 22000 feet in elevation  herbaceous plants are much more numerous here than in any other part of sikkim and sitting at my tentdoor i could without rising from the ground gather fortythree plants in england thirty is on the average the equivalent number of plants which in favourable localities i have gathered in an equal space in both cases many are seedlings of shortlived annuals and in neither is the number a test of the luxuriance of the vegetation it but shows the power which the different species exert in their struggle to obtain a place of which all but two belonged to english genera in the rich soil about the cottages were crops of dock shepherdspurse thlaspi arvense cynoglossum of two kinds one used as a potherb balsams nettle galeopsis mustard radish and turnip on the neighbouring hills which i explored up to 15000 feet i found many fine plants partaking more or less of the siberian type of which corydalis leguminosae artemisia and pedicularis are familiar instances i gathered upwards of 200 species nearly all belonging to north european genera twentyfive were woody shrubs above three feet high and six were ferns cryptogramma crispa davallia two aspidia and two polypodia i gathered ten at the same elevation in the damper zemu valley see chapter xix note i gathered in this valley a new species of the remarkable european genus struthiopteris which has not been found elsewhere in the himalaya sedges were in great profusion amongst them three of british kinds seven or eight were orchideae including a fine cypripedium  the entomology of tallum like its botany was siberian arctic types occurring at lower elevations than in the wetter parts of sikkim of beetles the honeyfeeding ones prevailed with european forms of others that inhabit yakdroppings as aphodius and geotrupes predaceous genera were very rare as carabus and staphylinus so typical of boreal regions coccinella ladybird which swarms at dorjiling does not ascend so high and a clytus was the only longicorn bupretis elater and blaps were found but rarely of butterflies the machaon seldom reaches this elevation but the paintedlady pontia colias hipparchia argynnis and polyommatus are all found bees were common both bombus and andraena but there were no wasps and but few ants grasshoppers and other orthoptera were rare as were hemiptera tipula was the common dipterous insect with a small sandfly there were neither leeches mosquitos ticks nor midges pigeons redlegged crows and hawks were the common birds with a few waders in the marshes  being now fairly behind most of the great snow and raincollecting mountains i experienced a considerable change in the climate which characterises all these rearward lofty valleys where very little rain falls and that chiefly drizzle but this is so constant that the weather feels chilly raw and comfortless and i never returned dry from botanising the early mornings were bright with views northwards of blue sky and kinchinjhow while to the south the lofty peak of tukcham though much nearer was seldom seen and black cumuli and nimbi rolled up the steep valley of the lachen to be dissipated in mist over tallum the suns rays were however powerful at intervals during the forenoon whence the mean maximum temperature of july occurred at about 10 am the temperature of the river was always high varying with the heat of the day from 47 degrees to 52 degrees the mean being 50 degrees  these streams do not partake of the diurnal rise and fall so characteristic of the swiss rivers and those of the western himalaya where a powerful sun melts the glaciers by day and their headstreams are frozen by night here the clouds alike prevent solar and nocturnal radiation the temperature is more uniform and the corroding power of the damp southerly wind that blows strongly throughout the day is the great melting agent one morning i saw a vivid and very beautiful halo 20 degrees distant from the suns disc it was no doubt caused by snow in the higher regions of the atmosphere as a sharp shower of rain fell immediately afterwards these are rare phenomena in mountainous countries  the singtam soubah visited me daily and we enjoyed long friendly conversations he still insisted that the yangchoo the name he gave to the lachen at this place was the boundary and that i must not go any further his first question was always how long do you intend to remain here have you not got all the plants and stones you want you can see the sun much better with those brasses and glasses alluding to the sextant etc lower down it is very cold here and there is no foodto all which i had but one reply that i should not return till i had visited kongra lama he was a portly man and i think at heart goodnatured i had no difficulty in drawing him on to talk about tibet and the holy city of teshoo loombo with its thousands of gilt temples nunneries and convents its holiest of all the holy grand lamas of tibet and all the wide boodhist world besides had it even been politic i felt it would be unfair to be angry with a man who was evidently in a false position between myself and his two rulers the rajah and dewan who had a wife and family on the smiling flanks of singtam and who longed to be soaking in the warm rain of sikkim drinking murwa beer a luxury unknown amongst these tibetans and gathering in his crops of rice millet and buckwheat though i may owe him a grudge for his subsequent violence i still recall with pleasure the hours we spent together on the banks of the lachen in all matters respecting the frontier his lies were circumstantial and he further took the trouble of bringing country people to swear that this was cheen and that there was no such place as kongra lama i had written to ask dr campbell for a definite letter from tchebu lama on this point but unfortunately my despatches were lost the messenger who conveyed them missed his footing in crossing the lachen and escaped narrowly with life while the turban in which the letters were placed was carried down the current  finally the soubah tried to persuade my people that one so incorrigibly obstinate must be mad and that they had better leave me one day after we had had a long discussion about the geography of the frontier he inflamed my curiosity by telling me that kinchinjhow was a very holy mountain more so than its sisterpeaks of chumulari and kinchinjunga and that both the sikkim and tibetan lamas and chinese soldiers were ready to oppose my approach to it this led to my asking him for a sketch of the mountains he called for a large sheet of paper and some charcoal and wanted to form his mountains of sand i however ordered rice to be brought and though we had but little scattered it about wastefully this had its effect he stared at my wealth for he had all along calculated on starving me out and retired looking perplexed and crestfallen nothing puzzled him so much as my being always occupied with such to him unintelligible pursuits a tibetan cui bono was always in his mouth what good will it do you why should you spend weeks on the coldest hungriest windiest loftiest place on the earth without even inhabitants drugs and idle curiosity he believed were my motives and possibly a reverence for the religion of boodh sakya and tsongkaba latterly he had made up his mind to starve me out and was dismayed when he found i could hold out better than himself and when i assured him that i should not retrace my steps until his statements should be verified by a letter from tchebu that i had written to him and that it would be at least thirty days before i could receive an answer  on the 19th of july he proposed to take me to tungu at the foot of kinchinjhow and back upon ponies provided i would leave my people and tent which i refused to do after this i saw little of him for several days and began to fear he was offended when one morning his attendant came to me for medicine with a dismal countenance and in great alarm he twisted his fingers together over his stomach to symbolise the nature of the malady which produced a commotion in his masters bowels and which was simply the colic i was aware that he had been reduced to feed upon tong the arumroot and herbs and had always given him half the pigeons i shot which was almost the only animal food i had myself now i sent him a powerful dose of medicine adding a few spoonfuls of china tea and sugar for friendship  on the 22nd being convalescent he visited me looking wofully yellow after a long pause during which he tried to ease himself of some weighty matter he offered to take me to tungu with my tent and people and thence to kongra lama if i would promise to stay but two nights i asked whether tungu was in cheen or sikkim he replied that after great enquiry he had heard that it was really in sikkim then said i we will both go tomorrow morning to tungu and i will stay there as long as i please he laughed and gave in with apparent good grace  after leaving tallum the valley contracts passing over great ancient moraines and again expanding wider than before into broad grassy flats the vegetation rapidly diminishes in stature and abundance and though the ascent to tungu is trifling the change in species is very great the spiraea maple pieris cherry and larch disappear leaving only willow juniper stunted birch silver fir white rose aralia berberry currant and more rhododendrons than all these put together cyananthus a little blue flower allied to campanula and one of the most beautiful alpines i know covered the turfy ground with orchis pedicularis gentian potentilla geranium purple and yellow meconopsis and the artemisia of dorjiling which ascends to 12000 feet and descends to the plains having a range of 11500 feet in elevation of ferns hymenophyllum cistopteris and cryptogramma crispa ascend thus high while mushrooms and other english fungi one of great size growing in large clumps is the english agaricus comans fr and i found it here at 12500 feet as also the beautiful genus crucibulum which is familiar to us in england growing on rotten sticks and resembling a diminutive birds nest with eggs in it grew amongst the grass  illustrationtungu village  tungu occupies a very broad valley at the junction of the tunguchoo from the east and the lachen from the north the hills slope gently upwards to 16000 feet at an average angle of 15 degrees they are flat and grassy at the base and no snow is anywhere to be seen in the woodcut the summit of chomiomo is introduced as it appears from a few hundred feet above the point of view a stupendous rock about fifty feet high lay in the middle of the valley broken in two it may have been detached from a cliff or have been transported thither as part of an ancient moraine which extends from the mouth of the tunguchoo valley across that of the lachen the appearance and position of this great block and of the smaller piece lying beside it rather suggest the idea of the whole mass having fallen perpendicularly from a great height through a crevasse in a glacier than of its having been hurled from so considerable a distance as from the cliffs on the flanks of the valley it is faithfully represented in the accompanying woodcut a few wooden houses were collected near this rock and several black tents were scattered about i encamped at an elevation of 12750 feet and was waited on by the lachen phipun with presents of milk butter yakflesh and curds and we were not long before we drowned old enmity in buttered and salted tea  on my arrival i found the villagers in a meadow all squatted crosslegged in a circle smoking their brass and iron pipes drinking tea and listening to a letter from the rajah concerning their treatment of me whilst my men were pitching my tent i gathered forty plants new to me all of tartarian types more siberian plants appeared as astragali chenopodium artemisia some grasses new kinds of pedicularis delphinium and some small orchids three species of parnassia and six primroses made the turf gay mixed with saxifrages androsace and campanula by the cottages was abundance of shepherdspurse lepidium and balsams with dock galeopsis and cuscuta several low dwarf species of honeysuckle formed stunted bushes like heather and anisodus a curious plant allied to hyoscyamus whose leaves are greedily eaten by yaks was very common wheat or barley i was assured had been cultivated at tungu when it was possessed by tibetans and inhabited by a frontier guard but i saw no appearance of any cultivation the fact is an important one as barley requires a mean summer temperature of 48 degrees to come to maturity according to my observations the mean temperature of tungu in july is upwards of 50 degrees and by calculation that of the three summer months june july and august should be about 465 degrees as however i do not know whether these cerealia were grown as productive crops much stress cannot be laid upon the fact of their having been cultivated for in a great many parts of tibet the barley is annually cut green for fodder  in the evening the sick came to me their complaints as usual being rheumatism ophthalmia goitres cuts bruises and poisoning by tong arum fungi and other deleterious vegetables at tallum i attended an old woman who dressed her ulcers with plantago plantain leaves a very common scotch remedy the ribs being drawn out from the leaf which is applied fresh it is rather a strong application  on the following morning i was awakened by the shrill cries of the tibetan maidens calling the yaks to be milked tooshtoosh toooosh in a gradually higher key to which toosh seemed supremely indifferent till quickened in her movements by a stone or stick levelled with unerring aim at her ribs these animals were changing their long winters wool for sleek hair and the former hung about them in ragged masses like tow their calves gambolled by their sides the drollest of animals like asscolts in their antics kicking up their short hindlegs whisking their bushy tails in the air rushing up and down the grassy slopes and climbing like cats to the top of the rocks  the soubah and phipun came early to take me to kongra lama bringing ponies genuine tartars in bone and breed remembering the dewans impracticable saddle at bhomsong i stipulated for a horsecloth or pad upon which i had no sooner jumped than the beast threw back his ears seated himself on his haunches and to my consternation slid backwards down a turfy slope pawing the earth with his forefeet as he went and leaving me on the ground amid shrieks of laughter from my lepchas my steed being caught i again mounted and was being led forward when he took to shaking himself like a dog till the pad slipped under his belly and i was again unhorsed other ponies displayed equal prejudices against my mode of riding or having my weight anywhere but well on their shoulders being allpowerful in their forequarters and so i was compelled to adopt the high demipique saddle with short stirrups which forced me to sit with my knees up to my nose and to grip with the calves of my legs and heels all the gear was of yak or horsehair and the bit was a curb and ring or a powerful twisted snaffle  the path ran nnw for two miles and then crossed the lachen above its junction with the nunee i suspect there is a pass by the nunee to the sheds i saw up the zemu valley on the 2nd of july as i observed yaks grazing high up the mountains the distance cannot be great and there is little or no snow to interfere from the west the stream was rapid and twelve yards in breadth its temperature was 48 degrees about six miles above tungu the lachen is joined by the chomiochoo a large affluent from chomiomo mountain above this the lachen meanders along a broad stony bed and the path rises over a great ancient moraine whose level top is covered with pools but both that and its south face are bare from exposure to the south wind which blows with fury through this contracted part of the valley to the rarified atmosphere of the lofty open and dry country beyond its north slope on the contrary is covered with small trees and brushwood rhododendron birch honeysuckle and mountainash these are the most northern shrubs in sikkim and i regarded them with deep interest as being possibly the last of their kind to be met with in this meridian for many degrees further north perhaps even no similar shrubs occur between this and the siberian altai a distance of 1500 miles the magnificent yellow cowslip primula sikkimensis gilded the marshes and caltha this is the c scaposa n sp the common caltha palustris or marsh marigold of england which is not found in sikkim is very abundant in the northwest himalaya trollius anemone arenaria draba saxifrages potentillas ranunculus and other very alpine plants abounded  at the foot of the moraine was a tibetan camp of broad black yakhair tents stretched out with a complicated system of ropes and looking at a distanceto borrow m hucs graphic similelike fatbodied longlegged spiders their general shape is hexagonal about twelve feet either way and they are stretched over six short posts and encircled with a low stone wall except in front in one of them i found a buxom girl the image of good humour making butter and curd from yakmilk the churns were of two kinds one being an oblong box of birchbark or close bamboo wickerwork full of branched rhododendron twigs in which the cream is shaken she goodnaturedly showed me the inside which was frosted with snowwhite butter and alive with maggots the other churn was a goatskin which was rolled about and shaken by the four legs the butter is made into great squares and packed in yakhair cloths the curd is eaten either fresh or dried and pulverised when it is called tscheuzip  except bamboo and copper milkvessels wooden ladles teachurn and pots these tents contained no furniture but goatskins and blankets to spread on the ground as a bed the fire was made of sheep and goatsdroppings lighted with juniperwood above it hung tufts of yakshair one for every animal lost during the season the siberians hang tufts of horsehair inside their houses from superstitious motives ermanns siberia i 281 by which means a reckoning is kept although this girl had never before seen a european she seemed in no way discomposed at my visit and gave me a large slice of fresh curd  beyond this place alt 14500 feet the valley runs up northeast becoming very stony and desolate with green patches only by the watercourses at this place however thick fogs came on and obscured all view at 15000 feet i passed a small glacier on the west side of the valley the first i had met with that descended nearly to the river during the whole course of the teesta  five miles further on we arrived at the tents of the phipun whose wife was prepared to entertain us with tartar hospitality magnificent tawny tibet mastiffs were baying at the tentdoor and some yaks and ponies were grazing close by we mustered twelve in number and squatted crosslegged in a circle inside the tent the soubah and myself being placed on a pretty chinese rug salted and buttered tea was immediately prepared in a teapot for us on the mat and in a great caldron for the rest of the party parched rice and wheatflour curd and roasted maize called popcorn in america and prepared by roasting the maize in an iron vessel when it splits and turns partly inside out exposing a snowwhite spongy mass of farina it looks very handsome and would make a beautiful dish for dessert were offered us and we each produced our wooden cup which was kept constantly full of scalding teasoup which being made with fresh butter was very good the flour was the favourite food of which each person dexterously formed little doughballs in his cup an operation i could not well manage and only succeeded in making a nauseous paste that stuck to my jaws and in my throat our hostess hospitality was too exigeant for me but the others seemed as if they could not drink enough of the scalding tea  we were suddenly startled from our repast by a noise like loud thunder crash following crash and echoing through the valley the phipun got up and coolly said the rocks are falling it is time we were off it will rain soon the moist vapours had by this time so accumulated as to be condensed in rain on the cliffs of chomiomo and kinchinjhow which being loosened precipitated avalanches of rocks and snow we proceeded amidst dense fog soon followed by hard rain the roar of falling rocks on either hand increasing as these invisible giants spoke to one another in voices of thunder through the clouds the effect was indescribably grand and as the weather cleared and i obtained transient peeps of their precipices of blue ice and black rock towering 5000 feet above me on either hand the feeling of awe produced was almost overpowering heavy banks of vapour still veiled the mountains but the rising mist exposed a broad stony track along which the lachen wandered split into innumerable channels and enclosing little oases of green vegetation lighted up by occasional gleams of sunshine though all around was enveloped in gloom there was in front a high blue arc of cloudless sky between the beetling cliffs that formed the stern portals of the kongra lama pass     chapter xxi  top of

ceremonies beside a sickbed  we reached the boundary between sikkim and tibet early in the afternoon it is drawn along kongra lama which is a low flat spur running east from kinchinjhow towards chomiomo at a point where these mountains are a few miles apart thus crossing the lachen river the upper valley of the lachen in tibet which i ascended in the following october is very open flat barren and stony it is bounded on the north by rounded spurs from chomiomo which are continued east to donkia forming a watershed to the lachen on the south and to the arun on the north it is marked by cairns of stone some rudely fashioned into chaits covered with votive rags on wands of bamboo i made the altitude by barometer 15745 feet above the sea and by boiling water 15694 feet the water boiling at 1841 degrees the temperature of the air between 240 and 4 pm varied from 413 degrees to 425 degrees the dewpoint 398 degrees that of the lachen was 47 degrees which was remarkably high we were bitterly cold as the previous rain had wetted us through and a keen wind was blowing up the valley the continued mist and fog intercepted all view except of the flanks of the great mountains on either hand of the rugged snowy ones to the south and of those bounding the lachen to the north the latter were unsnowed and appeared lower than kongra lama the ground apparently sloping away in that direction but when i ascended them three months afterwards i found they were 3000 feet higher a proof how utterly fallacious are estimates of height when formed by the eye alone my informants called them peukathlo peu signifies north in tibetan and thlo a hill in lepcha  isolated patches of vegetation appeared on the top of the pass where i gathered forty kinds of plants most of them being of a tufted habit characteristic of an extreme climate some as species of caryophylleae forming hemispherical balls on the naked soil others the other plants found on the pass were of smooth hairless ones ranunculus fumitory several species of stellaria arenaria cruciferae parnassia morina saxifrages sedum primrose herminium polygonum campanula umbelliferae grasses and carices of woolly or hairy once anemone artemisia myosotis draba potentilla and several compositae etc growing in matted tufts level with the ground the greater portion had no woolly covering nor did i find any of the cottony species of saussurea which are so common on the wetter mountains to the southward some most delicateflowered plants even defy the biting winds of these exposed regions such are a prickly meconopsis with slender flowerstalks and four large blue poppylike petals a cyananthus with a membranous bellshaped corolla and a fritillary other curious plants were a little yellow saxifrage with long runners very like the arctic s flagellaris of spitzbergen and melville island and the strongscented spikenard nardostachys  the rocks were chiefly of reddish quartz and so was the base of chomiomo kinchinjhow on the contrary was of gneiss with granite veins the strike of both was northwest and the dip northeast 20 degrees to 30 degrees  we made a fire at the top with sheeps droppings of which the phipun had brought up a bagfull and with it a pair of goatskin bellows which worked by a slit that was opened by the hand in the act of raising when inflated the hole was closed and the skin pressed down thus forcing the air through the bamboo nozzle this is the common form of bellows throughout tibet and the himalaya  after two hours i was very stiff and cold and suffering from headache and giddiness owing to the elevation and having walked about thirteen miles botanizing i was glad to ride down we reached the phipuns tents about 6 pm and had more tea before proceeding to tungu the night was fortunately fine and calm with a few stars and a bright young moon which with the glare from the snows lighted up the valley and revealed magnificent glimpses of the majestic mountains as the moon sank and we descended the narrowing valley darkness came on and with a boy to lead my surefooted pony i was at liberty uninterruptedly to reflect on the events of a day on which i had attained the object of so many years ambition now that all obstacles were surmounted and i was returning laden with materials for extending the knowledge of a science which had formed the pursuit of my life will it be wondered at that i felt proud not less for my own sake than for that of the many friends both in india and at home who were interested in my success  we arrived at tungu at 9 pm my pony not having stumbled once though the path was rugged and crossed by many rapid streams the soubahs little shaggy steed had carried his portly frame fully fifteen stone weight the whole way out and back and when he dismounted it shook itself snorted and seemed quite ready for supper  on the following morning i was occupied in noting and arranging my collections which consisted of upwards of 200 plants all gathered above 14000 feet elevation amongst them the most numerous natural orders and genera were cruciferae 10 compositae 20 ranunculaceae 10 alsineae 9 astragali 10 potentillae 8 grasses 12 carices 15 pedicularis 7 boragineae 7 letters arrived from dorjiling with unusual speed having been only seventeen days on the road they were full of valuable suggestions and encouragement from my friends hodgson campbell and tchebu lama  on the 26th of july the phipun who waited on me every morning with milk and butter and whose civility and attentions were now unremitting proposed that i should accompany him to an encampment of tibetans at the foot of kinchinjhow we mounted ponies and ascended the tunguchoo eastwards it was a rapid river for the first thousand feet flowing in a narrow gorge between sloping grassy and rocky hills on which large herds of yaks were feeding tended by women and children whose black tents were scattered about the yakcalves left their mothers to run beside our ponies which became unmanageable being almost callous to the bit and the whole party was sometimes careering over the slopes chased by the grunting herds in other places the path was narrow and dangerous when the sagacious animals proceeded with the utmost gravity and caution rounding one rocky spur my pony stumbled and pitched me forward fortunately i lighted on the path  the rocks were gneiss with granite veins strike northeast dip southeast they were covered with ephedra a curious genus of small shrubs allied to pines that grows in the south of europe this species is the european e vulgaris it inhabits the driest parts of northwest india and ascends to 17000 feet in tibet but is not found in the moist intervening countries an onosma which yields a purple dye orchis and species of androsace while the slopes were clothed with the spikenard and purple pedicularis and the moist grounds with yellow cowslip and long grass a sudden bend in the valley opened a superb view to the north of the full front of kinchinjhow extending for four or five miles east and west its perpendicular sides studded with the immense icicles which are said to have obtained for it the name of jhowthe bearded kinchin eastward a jagged spur stretches south rising into another splendid mountain called changokhang the eagles crag from whose flanks descend great glaciers the sources of the tunguchoo  we followed the course of an affluent called the chachoo along whose bed ancient moraines rose in successive ridges on these i found several other species of european genera delphinium hypecoum sagina gymnandra artemisia caltha dracocephalum leontopodium over one of these moraines 500 feet high the path ascends to the plains of palung an elevated grassy expanse two miles long and four broad extending southward from the base of kinchinjhow its surface though very level for so mountainous a country is yet varied with open valleys and sloping hills 500 to 700 feet high it is bounded on the west by low rounded spurs from kinchinjhow that form the flank of the lachen valley while on the east it is separated from changokhang by the chachoo which cuts a deep east and west trench along the base of kinchinjhow and then turns south to the tunguchoo the course of the chachoo where it turns south is most curious it meanders in sickleshaped curves along the marshy bottom of an old lakebed with steep shelving sides 500 to 600 feet deep and covered with juniper bushes these which grow on an eastern exposure exist at a higher elevation than any other bushes i have met with it is fed by the glaciers of kinchinjhow and some little lakes to the east  the mean height of palung plains is 16000 feet they are covered with transported blocks and i have no doubt their surface has been much modified by glacial action i was forcibly reminded of them by the slopes of the wengern alp but those of palung are far more level kinchinjhow rises before the spectator just as the jungfrau monch and eigher alps do from that magnificent point of view  on ascending a low hill we came in sight of the tibet camp at the distance of a mile when the great mastiffs that guarded it immediately bayed and our ponies starting off at full gallop we soon reached an enclosure of stone dykes within which the black tents were pitched the dogs were of immense size and ragged like the yaks from their winter coat hanging to their flanks in great masses each was chained near a large stone on and off which he leapt as he gave tongue they are very savage but great cowards and not remarkable for intelligence  illustrationlepcha girls the outer figures and tibetan women  the people were natives of gearee and kambajong in the adjacent province of dingcham which is the loftiest coldest most windy and arid in eastern tibet and in which are the sources of all the streams that flow to nepal sikkim and bhotan on the one side and into the yarutsampu on the other these families repair yearly to palung with their flocks herds and tents paying tribute to the sikkim rajah for the privilege they arrive in june and leave in september both men and women were indescribably filthy as they never wash their faces were perfectly black with smoke and exposure and the womens with a pigment of grease as a protection from the wind the men were dressed as usual in the blanketcloak with brass pipes long knives flint steel and amulets the women wore similar but shorter cloaks with silver and copper girdles trowsers and flannel boots their headdresses were very remarkable a circular band of plaited yaks hair was attached to the back hair and encircled the head like a saints glory i find in ermanns siberia i p 210 that the married women of yekaterinberg wear a headdress like an ancient glory covered with jewels whilst the unmarried ones plait their tresses the same distinguished traveller mentions having seen a lad of six years old suckled amongst the tungooze of east siberia at some distance round it a band crossed the forehead from which coins corals and turquoises hung down to the eyebrows while lappets of these ornaments fell over the ears their own hair was plaited in two tails brought over the shoulders and fastened together in front and a little yellow felt cap traversely elongated so as not to interfere with the shape of the glory was perched on the head their countenances were pleasing and their manners timid  the children crawled halfnaked about the tent or burrowed like moles in an immense heap of goats and sheepdroppings piled up for fuel upon which the family lounged an infant in arms was playing with a coral ornamented much like ours and was covered with jewels and coins this custom of decorating children is very common amongst halfcivilised people and the coral is perhaps one of the last relics of a barbarous age that is retained amongst ourselves one mother was nursing her baby and churning at the same time by rolling the goatskin of yakmilk about on the ground extreme poverty induces the practice of nursing the children for years and in one tent i saw a lad upwards of four years of age unconcernedly taking food from his aunt and immediately afterwards chewing hard dry grains of maize  the tents were pitched in holes about two feet and a half deep and within them a wall of similar height was built all round in the middle was a long clay arched fireplace with holes above over which the cauldrons were placed the fire being underneath saddles horsecloths and the usual accoutrements and implements of a nomad people all of the rudest description hung about there was no bed or stool but chinese rugs for sleeping on i boiled water on the fireplace its temperature 1845 degrees with that of the air 455 degrees gave an elevation of 15867 feet barometric observations taken in october at a point considerably lower down the stream made the elevation 15620 feet or a few feet lower than kongra lama pass  a lama accompanied this colony of tibetans a festival in honour of kinchinjhow being annually held at a large chait hard by which is painted red ornamented with banners and surmounted by an enormous yaks skull that faces the mountain the lama invited me into his tent where i found a wife and family an extempore altar was at one end covered with wafers and other pretty ornaments made of butter stamped or moulded with the fingers the extensive use of these ornaments throughout tibet on the occasion of religious festivals is alluded to by mm huc and gabet the tents being insupportably noisome i preferred partaking of the buttered bricktea in the open air after which i went to see the shawlwool goats sheared in a pen close by there are two varieties one is a large animal with great horns called rappoo this is the changra and the smaller the chyapu of mr hodgsons catalogue see british museum catalogue the other smaller and with slender horns is called tsilloo the latter yields the finest wool but they are mixed for ordinary purposes i was assured that the sheep of which large flocks were grazing near afford the finest wool of any the animals were caught by the tail their legs tied the long winters hair pulled out and the remainder cut away with a broad flat knife which was sharpened with a scythestone the operation was clumsily performed and the skin much cut  turnips are grown at palung during the short stay of the people and this is the most alpine cultivation in sikkim the seed is sown early in july and the tubers are fit to be eaten in october if the season is favourable they did not come to maturity this year as i found on again visiting this spot in october but their tops had afforded the poor tibetans some good vegetables the mean temperature of the three summer months at palung is probably about 40 degrees an element of comparatively little importance in regulating the growth and ripening of vegetables at great elevations in tibetan climates where a warm exposure the amount of sunshine and of radiated heat have a much greater influence  during the winter when these families repair to kambajong in tibet the flocks and herds are all stallfed with long grass cut on the marshy banks of the yaru snow is said to fall five feet deep at that place chiefly after january and it melts in april  after tea i ascended the hills overhanging the lachen valley which are very bare and stony large flocks of sheep were feeding on them chiefly upon small tufted sedges allied to the english carex pilularis which here forms the greatest part of the pasture the grass grows mixed with it in small tufts and is the common scotch mountain pasturegrass festuca ovina  on the top of these hills which for barrenness reminded me of the descriptions given of the siberian steppes i found at 17000 feet elevation several minute arctic plants with rhododendron nivale the most alpine of woody plants on their sterile slopes grew a curious plant allied to the cherleria of the scotch alps forming great hemispherical balls on the ground eight to ten inches across altogether resembling in habit the curious balsambog bolax glebaria of the falkland islands which grows in very similar scenes arenaria rupifraga fenzl this plant is mentioned by dr thomson travels in tibet p 426 as common in tibet as far north as the karakoram at an elevation between 16000 and 18000 feet in sikkim it is found at the same level specimens of it are exhibited in the kew museum as one instance illustrative of the chaotic state of indian botany i may here mention that this little plant a denizen of such remote and inaccessible parts of the globe and which has only been known to science a dozen years bears the burthen of no less than six names in botanical works this is the bryomorpha rupifraga of karelin and kireloff enumeration of soongarian plants who first described it from specimens gathered in 1841 on the alatau mountains east of lake aral in ledebours flora rossica i p 780 it appears as arenaria subgenus dicranilla rupifraga fenzl ms in decaisne and cambessedes plants of jacquemonts voyage aus indes orientales it is described as flourensia caespitosa and in the plates of that work it appears as periandra caespitosa and lastly in endlichers genera plantarum fenzl proposes the long new generic name of thylacospermum for it i have carefully compared the himalayan and alatau plants and find no difference between them except that the flower of the himalayan one has 4 petals and sepals 8 stamens and 2 styles and that of the alatau 5 petals and sepals 10 stamens and 23 styles characters which are very variable in allied plants the flowers appear polygamous as in the scotch alpine cherleria which it much resembles in habit and to which it is very nearly related in botanical characters  a few days afterwards i again visited palung with the view of ascertaining the height of perpetual snow on the south face of kinchinjhow unfortunately bad weather came on before i reached the tibetans from whom i obtained a guide in consequence from this place a ride of about four miles brought me to the source of the chachoo in a deep ravine containing the terminations of several short abrupt glaciers de saussures glaciers of the second order see forbes travels in the alps p 79 and into which were precipitated avalanches of snow and ice i found it impossible to distinguish the glacial ice from perpetual snow the larger beds of snow where presenting a flat surface being generally drifts collected in hollows or accumulations that have fallen from above when these accumulations rest on slopes they become converted into ice and obeying the laws of fluidity flow downwards as glaciers i boiled water at the most advantageous position i could select and obtained an elevation of 16522 feet temperature of boiling water 183 degrees air 35 degrees it was snowing heavily at this time and we crouched under a gigantic boulder benumbed with cold i had fortunately brought a small phial of brandy which with hot water from the boilingapparatus kettle refreshed us wonderfully  the spur that divides these plains from the lachen river rises close to kinchinjhow as a lofty cliff of quartzy gneiss dipping northeast 30 degrees this i had noticed from the kongra lama side on this side the dip was also to the northward and the whole cliff was crossed by cleavage planes dipping south and apparently cutting those of the foliation at an angle of about 60 degrees it is the only decided instance of the kind i met with in sikkim i regretted not being able to examine it carefully but i was prevented by the avalanches of stones and snow which were continually being detached from its surface i extremely regret not having been at this time acquainted with mr d sharpes able essays on the foliation cleavage etc of slaty rocks gneiss etc in the geological societys journal ii p 74 and v p 111 and still more so with his subsequent papers in the philosophical transactions as i cannot doubt that many of his observations and in particular those which refer to the great arches in which the folia commonly called strata are disposed would receive ample illustration from a study of the himalaya at vol i chapter xiii i have distantly alluded to such an arrangement of the gneiss etc into arches in sikkim to which my attention was naturally drawn by the writings of professor sedgwick geolog soc trans and mr darwin geological observations in south america on these obscure subjects i may add that wherever i met with the gneiss mica schists and slates in sikkim very near one another i invariably found that their cleavage and foliation were conformable this for example may be seen in the bed of the great rungeet below dorjiling where the slates overlie mica schists and where the latter contain beds of conglomerate in these volumes i have often used the more familiar term of stratification for foliation this arises from my own ideas of the subject not having been clear when the notes were taken  the plants found close to the snow were minute primroses parnassia draba tufted wormwoods artemisia saxifrages gentian small compositae grasses and sedges our ponies unconcernedly scraped away the snow with their hoofs and nibbled the scanty herbage when  i mounted mine he took the bit between his teeth and scampered back to palung over rocks and hills through bogs and streams and though the snow was so blinding that no object could be distinguished he brought me to the tents with unerring instinct as straight as an arrow  wild animals are few in kind and rare in individuals at tungu and elsewhere on this frontier though there is no lack of cover and herbage this must be owing to the moist cold atmosphere and it reminds me that a similar want of animal life is characteristic of those climates at the level of the sea which i have adduced as bearing a great analogy to the himalaya in lacking certain natural orders of plants thus new zealand and fuegia possess the former no land animal but a rat and the latter very few indeed and none of any size such is also the case in scotland and norway again on the damp west coast of tasmania quadrupeds are rare whilst the dry eastern half of the island once swarmed with opossums and kangaroos a few miles north of tungu the sterile and more lofty provinces of tibet abound in wild horses antelopes hares foxes marmots and numerous other quadrupeds although their altitude climate and scanty vegetation are apparently even more unsuited to support such numbers of animals of so large a size than the karroos of south africa and the steppes of siberia and arctic america which similarly abound in animal life the laws which govern the distribution of large quadrupeds seem to be intimately connected with those of climate and we should have regard to these considerations in our geological speculations and not draw hasty conclusions from the absence of the remains of large herbivora in formations disclosing a redundant vegetation  besides the wild sheep found on these mountains a species of marmot the lagopus tibetanus of hodgson i procured one that displayed an extraordinary tenacity of life part of the skull was shot away and the brain protruded still it showed the utmost terror at my dog kardiepieu of the tibetans sometimes migrates in swarms like the lapland lemming from tibet as far as tungu there are few birds but redlegged crows and common ravens most of the insects belonged to arctic types and they were numerous in individuals as meloe and some flowerfeeding lamellicorns of butterflies i saw blues polyommatus marbled whites pontia colias and argynnis a small curculio was frequent and i found scolopendra ants and earthworms on sunny exposures as high as 15500 feet  illustrationtibet marmot  the choongtam lama was at a small temple near tungu during the whole of my stay but he would not come to visit me pretending to be absorbed in his devotions passing one day by the temple i found him catechising two young aspirants for holy orders he is one of the dukpa sect wore his mitre and was seated crosslegged on the grass with his scriptures on his knees he put questions to the boys when he who answered best took the other some yards off put him down on his hands and knees threw a cloth over his back and mounted then kicking spurring and cuffing his steed he was galloped back to the lama and kicked off when the catechising recommenced  i spent a week at tungu most pleasantly ascending the neighbouring mountains and mixing with the people whom i found uniformly kind frank and extremely hospitable sending their children after me to invite me to stop at their tents smoke and drink tea often refusing any remuneration and giving my attendants curds and yakflesh if on foot i was entreated to take a pony and when tired i never scrupled to catch one twist a yakhair rope over its jaw as a bridle and throwing a goathair cloth upon its back if no saddle were at hand ride away whither i would next morning a boy would be sent for the steed perhaps bringing an invitation to come and take it again so i became fond of bricktea boiled with butter salt and soda and expert in the tartar saddle riding about perched on the shoulders of a rough pony with my feet nearly on a level with my pockets and my knees almost meeting in front  on the 28th of july much snow fell on the hills around as low as 14000 feet and half an inch of rain at tungu an inch and a half fell at dorjiling during the same period the former soon melted and i made an excursion to chomiomo on the following day hoping to reach the lower line of perpetual snow ascending the valley of the chomiochoo i struck north up a steep slope that ended in a spur of vast tabular masses of quartz and felspar piled like slabs in a stone quarry dipping southwest 5 degrees to 10 degrees and striking northwest these resulted from the decomposition of gneiss from which the layers of mica bad been washed away when the rain and frost splitting up the fragments the dislocation is continued to a great depth into the substance of the rock  large silky cushions of a forgetmenot grew amongst the rocks spangled with beautiful blue flowers and looking like turquoises set in silver the delphininin glaciale this new species has been described for the flora indica of dr thomson and myself it is a remarkable plant very closely resembling and as it were representing the d brunonianum of the western himalaya the latter plant smells powerfully of musk but not so disagreeably as this does was also abundant exhaling a rank smell of musk it indicates a very great elevation in sikkim and on my ascent far above it therefore i was not surprised to find water boil at 1826 degrees air 43 degrees which gives an altitude of 16754 feet  a dense fog with sleet shut out all view and i did not know in what direction to proceed higher beyond the top of the sharp stony ridge i had attained here there was no perpetual snow which is to be accounted for by the nature of the surface facilitating its removal the edges of the rocks which project through the snow becoming heated and draining off the water as it melts  during my stay at tungu from the 23rd to the 30th of july no day passed without much deposition of moisture but generally in so light a form that throughout the whole time but one inch was registered in the raingauge during the same time four inches and a half of rain fell at dorjiling and three inches and a half at calcutta the mean temperature was 50 degrees max 65 degrees min 407 degrees extremes 6538 degrees the mean range 233 degrees was thus much greater than at dorjiling where it was only 89 degrees a thermometer sunk three feet varied only a few tenths from 576 degrees by twentyfive comparative observations with calcutta 1 degree fahr is the equivalent of every 362 feet of ascent and twenty comparative observations with dorjiling give 1 degree for every 340 feet the barometer rose and fell at the same hours as at lower elevations the tide amounting to 0060 inch between 950 am and 4 pm  i left tungu on the 30th of july and spent that night at tallum where a large party of men had just arrived with loads of madder rice canes bamboos planks etc to be conveyed to tibet on yaks and ponies about 300 loads of timber each of six planks are said to be taken across the kongra lama pass annually and about 250 of rice besides canes madder bamboos cottons cloths and symplocos leaves for dyeing this is no doubt a considerably exaggerated statement and may refer to both the kongra lama and donkia passes on the following day i descended to lamteng gathering a profusion of fine plants by the way  the flat on which i had encamped at this place in may and june being now a marsh i took up my abode for two days in one of the houses and paid the usual penalty of communication with these filthy people for which my only effectual remedy was boiling all my garments and bedding yet the house was high airy and light the walls composed of bamboo lath and plaster  tropical cicadas ascend to the pinewoods above lamteng in this month and chirp shrilly in the heat of the day and glowworms fly about at night the common bengal and java toad bufo scabra abounded in the marshes a remarkable instance of wide geographical distribution for a batrachian which is common at the level of the sea under the tropics  on the 3rd of august i descended to choongtam which i reached on the 5th the lakes on the chateng flat alt 8750 feet were very full and contained many english waterplants sparganium ramosum eleocharis palustris scirpus triqueter and callitriche verna some very tropical genera ascend thus high as paspalum amongst grasses and scleria a kind of sedge  the temperature of the water was 92 degrees near the edges where a waterinsect notonecta was swimming about  below this i passed an extensive stalactitic deposit of lime and a second occurred lower down on the opposite side of the valley the apparently total absence of limestone rocks in any part of sikkim for which i made careful search renders these deposits which are far from unfrequent very curious can the limestone which appears in tibet underlie the gneiss of sikkim we cannot venture to assume that these limecharged streams which in sikkim burst from the steep flanks of narrow mountain spurs at elevations between 1000 and 7000 feet have any very remote or deep origin if the limestone be not below the gneiss it must either occur intercalated with it or be the remains of a formation now all but denuded in sikkim  terrific landslips had taken place along the valley carrying down acres of rock soil and pineforests into the stream i saw one from kampo samdong on the opposite flank of the valley which swept over 100 yards in breadth of forest i looked in vain for any signs of scratching or scoring at all comparable to that produced by glacial action the bridge at the tuktoong mentioned at chapter xix being carried away we had to ascend for 1000 feet to a place where the river could be crossed by a very precipitous path and descend on the opposite side in many places we had great difficulty in proceeding the track being obliterated by the rains torrents and landslips along the flats now covered with a dense rank vegetation we waded ankle and often knee deep in mud swarming with leeches and instead of descending into the valley of the now too swollen lachen we made long detours rounding spurs by canes and bamboos suspended from trees  at choongtam the ricefields were flooded and the whole flat was a marsh covered with tropical grasses and weeds and alive with insects while the shrill cries of cicadas frogs and birds filled the air sandflies mosquitos cockroaches and enormous cockchafers eucerris griffithii a magnificent species three very splendid insects of the outer ranges of sikkim never occurred in the interior these are a gigantic curculio calandra a woodborer a species of goliathbeetle cheirotonus macleaii and a smaller species of the same rare family trigonophorus nepalensis of these the former is very scarce the latter extremely abundant flying about at evenings both are flowerfeeders eating honey and pollen in the summer of 1848 the months at dorjiling were well marked by the swarms of peculiar insects that appeared in inconceivable numbers thus april was marked by a great black passalus a beetle oneandahalf inch long that flies in the face and entangles itself in the hair may by stagbeetles and longicorns june by coccinella ladybirds white moths and flyingbugs july by a dryptis a longnecked carabideous insect august by myriads of earwigs cockroaches goliathbeetles and cicadas september by spiders mantis great locusts grasshoppers flyingbugs crickets ants spiders caterpillars and leeches were but a few of the pests that swarmed in my tent and made free with my bed great lazy butterflies floated through the air thecla and hesperides skipped about and the great nymphalidae darted around like swallows the venomous black cobra was common and we left the path with great caution as it is a lazy reptile and lies basking in the sun many beautiful and harmless green snakes four feet long glided amongst the bushes my dogs caught a rageu ragoah according to hodgson but it is not the procapra picticaudata of tibet a very remarkable animal half goat and half deer the flesh was good and tender darkcoloured and lean  i remained here till the 15th of august though 5 degrees further north and 5268 feet above the level of calcutta the mean temperature at choongtam this month was only 125 degrees cooler than at calcutta forty observations giving 1 degree fahr as equal to 690 feet of elevation whereas in may the mean of twentyseven observations gave 1 degree fahr as equal to 260 feet the mean difference of temperature being then 25 degrees the mean maximum of the day was 80 degrees and was attained at 11 am after which clouds formed and the thermometer fell to 66 degrees at sunset and 56 degrees at night in my blanket tent the heat rose to upwards of 100 degrees in calm weather the afternoons were generally squally and rainy arranging my lachen valley collections previous to starting for the lachoong whence i hoped to reach tibet again by a different route crossing the donkia pass and thence exploring the sources of the teesta at the cholamoo lakes  whilst here i ascertained the velocity of the currents of the lachen and lachoong rivers both were torrents than which none could be more rapid short of becoming cataracts the rains were at their height and the melting of the snows at its maximum i first measured several hundred yards along the banks of each river above the bridges repeating this several times as the rocks and jungle rendered it very difficult to do it accurately then sitting on the bridge i timed floating masses of different materials and sizes that were thrown in at the upper point i was surprised to find the velocity of the lachen only nine miles per hour for its waters seemed to shoot past with the speed of an arrow but the floats showed the whole stream to be so troubled with local eddies and backwaters that it took from fortythree to fortyeight seconds for each float to pass over 200 yards as it was perpetually submerged by undercurrents the breadth of the river averaged sixtyeight feet and the discharge was 4420 cubic feet of water per second the temperature was 57 degrees  at the lachoong bridge the jungle was still denser and the banks quite inaccessible in many places the mean velocity was eight miles an hour the breadth ninetyfive feet the depth about the same as that of the lachen giving a discharge of 5700 cubic feet of water per second hence it appears that the lachoong being so much the more copious stream should in one sense be regarded as the continuation of the teesta rather than the lachen which however has by far the most distant source their united streams discharge upwards of 10000 cubic feet of water per second in the height of the rains which is however a mere fraction of the discharge of the teesta when that river leaves the himalaya the ganges at hurdwar discharges 8000 feet per second during the dry season its temperature was also 57 degrees these streams retain an extraordinary velocity for many miles upwards the lachen to its junction with the zemu at 9000 feet and the zemu itself as far up as the thlonok at 10000 feet and the lachoong to the village of that name at 8000 feet their united streams appear equally rapid till they become the teesta at singtam the slope of the bed of the lachen from below the confluence of the zemu to the village of singtam is 174 feet per mile or 1 foot in 30 that of the lachoong from the village of that name to singtam is considerably less  on the 15th of august having received supplies from dorjiling i started up the north bank of the lachoong following the singtam soubah who accompanied me officially and with a very bad grace poor fellow he expected me to have returned with him to singtam and thence gone back to dorjiling and many a sore struggle we had on this point at choongtam he had been laid up with ulcerated legs from the bites of leeches and sandflies which required my treatment  the path was narrow and ran through a jungle of mixed tropical and temperate plants as paris dipsacus circaea thalictrum saxifraga ciliaris spiranthes malva hypoxis anthericum passiflora drosera didymocarpus poplar calamagrostis and eupatorium many of which are not found at this elevation on the damp outer ranges of dorjiling we crossed to the south bank by a fine canebridge forty yards long the river being twentyeight across and here i have to record the loss of my dog kinchin the companion of all my late journeyings and to whom i had become really attached he had a bad habit of which i had vainly tried to cure him of running for a few yards on the round bamboos by which the canebridges are crossed and on which it was impossible for a dog to retain his footing in this situation he used to get thoroughly frightened and lie down on the bamboos with his legs hanging over the water and having no hold whatever i had several times rescued him from this perilous position which was always rendered more imminent from the shaking of the bridge as i approached him on the present occasion i stopped at the foot of some rocks below the bridge botanizing and kinchin having scrambled up the rocks ran on to the bridge i could not see him and was not thinking about him when suddenly his shrill short barks of terror rang above the roaring torrent i hastened to the bridge but before i could get to it he had lost his footing and had disappeared holding on by the cane i strained my eyes till the bridge seemed to be swimming up the valley and the swift waters to be standing still but to no purpose he had been carried under at once and swept away miles below for many days i missed him by my side on the mountain and by my feet in camp he had become a very handsome dog with glossy black hair pendent triangular ears short muzzle high forehead jetblack eyes straight limbs arched neck and a most glorious tail curling over his back the woodcut at vol i chapter ix gives the character of the tibet mastiff to which breed his father belonged but it is not a portrait of himself having been sketched from a dog of the pure breed in the zoological societys gardens by c jenyns esq  a very bad road led to the village of keadom situated on a flat terrace several hundred feet above the river and 6609 feet above the sea where i spent the night here are cultivated plantains and maize although the elevation is equal to parts of dorjiling where these plants do not ripen  the river above keadom is again crossed by a plank bridge at a place where the contracted streams flow between banks forty feet high composed of obscurely stratified gravel sand and waterworn boulders above this the path ascends lofty flattopped spurs which overhang the river and command some of the most beautiful scenery in sikkim the southeast slopes are clothed with abies brunoniana at 8000 feet elevation and cleft by a deep ravine from which projects what appears to be an old moraine fully 1500 or perhaps 2000 feet high extensive landslips on its steep flank expose through the telescope a mass of gravel and angular blocks while streams cut deep channels in it  this valley is far more open and grassy than that of the lachen and the vegetation also differs much umbelliferae and compositae abound and were then flowering and an orchis satyrium nepalense scented like our english gymnadenia covered the ground in some places with tall green habenariae and a yellow spathoglottis a genus with pseudobulbs of shrubs xanthoxylon rhus prinsepia cotoneaster pyrus poplar and oak formed thickets along the path while there were as many as eight and nine kinds of balsams some eight feet high in the afternoon we reached lachoong which is by far the most picturesque village in the temperate region of sikkim grassy flats of different levels sprinkled with brushwood and scattered clumps of pine and maple occupy the valley whose west flanks rise in steep rocky and scantily wooded grassy slopes about five miles to the north the valley forks two conspicuous domes of snow rising from the intermediate mountains the eastern valley leads to lofty snowed regions and is said to be impracticable the lachoong flows down the western which appeared rugged and covered with pine woods on the east tunkra mountain this mountain is seen from dorjiling its elevation is about 18700 feet rises in a superb unbroken sweep of dark pinewood and cliffs surmounted by black rocks and white fingering peaks of snow south of this the valley of the tunkrachoo opens backed by sharp snowed pinnacles which form the continuation of the chola range over which a pass leads to the phari district of tibet which intervenes between sikkim and bhotan southwards the view is bounded by snowy mountains and the valley seems blocked up by the remarkable morainelike spur which i passed above keadom  illustrationlachoong valley and village looking south  stupendous moraines rise 1500 feet above the lachoong in several concentric series curving downwards and outwards so as to form a bellshaped mouth to the valley of the tunkrachoo those on the upper flank are much the largest and the loftiest of them terminates in a conical hill crowned with boodhist flags and its steep sides cut into horizontal roads or terraces one of which is so broad and flat as to suggest the idea of its having been cleared by art  illustrationlofty ancient moraines in the lachoong valley looking southeast  on the south side of the tunkrachoo river the moraines are also more or less terraced as is the floor of the lachoong valley and its east slopes 1000 feet up i have since been greatly struck with the similarity between the features of this valley and those of chamouni though the latter is on a smaller scale above the lavanchi moraine the spectator standing in the expanded part below the village of argentiere and looking upwards sees the valley closed above by the ancient moraine of the argentiere glacier and below by that of lavanchi and an all sides the slopes are cut into terraces strewed with boulders i found traces of stratified pebbles and sand on the north flank of the lavanchi moraine however which i failed to discover in those of lachoong the average slope of these pineclad sikkim valleys much approximates to that of chamouni and never approaches the precipitous character of the bernese alps valleys kandersteg lauterbrunnen and grindelwald  the river is fourteen yards broad and neither deep nor rapid the village is on the east bank and is large for sikkim it contains fully 100 good wooden houses raised on posts and clustered together without order it was muddy and intolerably filthy and intersected by some small streams whose beds formed the roads and at the same time the common sewers of the natives there is some wretched cultivation in fields full of such english weeds as shepherds purse nettles solanum nigrum and dock besides many himalayan ones as balsams thistles a beautiful geranium mallow haloragis and cucurbitaceous plants of wheat barley peas radishes and turnips rice was once cultivated at this elevation 8000 feet but the crop was uncertain some very tropical grasses grow wild here as eragrostis and panicum in gardens the hollyhock is seen it is said to be introduced through tibet from china also pinus excelsa from bhotan peaches walnuts and weeping willows a tall poplar was pointed out to me as a great wonder it had two species of pyrus growing on its boughs evidently from seed one was a mountain ash the other like pyrus aria  soon after camping the lachoong phipun a very tall intelligent and agreeable looking man waited on me with the usual presents and a request that i would visit his sick father his house was lofty and airy in the inner room the sick man was stretched on a board covered with a blanket and dying of pressure on the brain he was surrounded by a deputation of lamas from teshoo loombo sent for in this emergency the principal one was a fat fellow who sat crosslegged before a blockprinted tibetan book plates of raw meat rice and other offerings and the bells dorje etc of his profession others sat around reading or chanting services and filling the room with incense at one end of the apartment was a good library in a beautifully carved bookcase

here from the consequences of leechbites i took the opportunity of visiting the tunkralah pass represented as the most snowy in sikkim which i found to be the case the route lay over the moraines on the north flank of the tunkrachoo which are divided by narrow dry gullies these ridges of the moraine separated by gullies indicate the progressive retirement of the ancient glacier after periods of rest the same phenomena may be seen on a diminutive scale in the swiss alps by any one who carefully examines the lateral and often the terminal moraines of any retiring or diminishing glacier at whose base or flanks are concentric ridges which are successive deposits and composed of enormous blocks disintegrating into a deep layer of clay all are clothed with luxuriant herbage and flowering

enkianthus pyrus cherry pieris laurel and goughia the muskdeer inhabits these woods and at this season i have never seen it higher large monkeys are also found on the skirts of the pineforests and the ailurus ochraceus hodgs a curious longtailed animal peculiar to the himalaya something between a diminutive bear and a squirrel in the dense and gigantic forest of abies brunoniana and silver fir i measured one of the former trees and found it twentyeight feet in girth and above 120 feet in height the abies webbiana attains thirtyfive feet in girth with a trunk unbranched for forty feet  the path was narrow and difficult in the wood and especially along the bed of the stream where grew ugly trees of larch eighty feet high and abundance of a new species of alpine strawberry with oblong fruit at 11560 feet elevation i arrived at an immense rock of gneiss buried in the forest here currantbushes were plentiful generally growing on the pinetrunks in strange association with a small species of begonia a hothouse tribe of plants in england emerging from the forest vast old moraines are crossed in a shallow mountain valley several miles long and broad 12000 feet above the sea choked with rhododendron shrubs and nearly encircled by snowy mountains magnificent gentians grew here also senecio corydalis and the aconitum luridum n sp whose root is said to be as virulent as a ferox and a napellus the result of dr thomsons and my examination of the himplayan aconites of which there are seven species is that the one generally known as a ferox and which supplies a great deal of the celebrated poison is the common a napellus of europe the plants were all fully a month behind those of the lachen valley at the same elevation heavy rain fell in the afternoon and we halted under some rocks as i had brought no tent my bed was placed beneath the shelter of one near which the rest of the party burrowed i supped off half a yaks kidney an enormous organ in this animal  on the following morning we proceeded up the valley towards a very steep rocky barrier through which the river cut a narrow gorge and beyond which rose lofty snowy mountains the peak of tunkra being to our left hand north saxifrages grew here in profuse tufts of golden blossoms and chrysosplenium rushes mountainsorrel oxyria and the bladderheaded saussurea whose flowers are enclosed in inflated membranous bracts and smell like putrid meat there were also splendid primroses the spikenard valerian and golden potentillas  the ascent was steep and difficult up a stony valley bounded by precipices in this the river flowed in a northwest direction and we were obliged to wade along it though its waters were bitterly cold the temperature being 39 degrees at 15000 feet we passed from great snowbeds to the surface of a glacier partly an accumulation of snow increased by lateral glaciers its slope was very gentle for several miles the surface was eroded by rain and very rough whilst those of the lateral glaciers were ribboned crevassed and often conspicuously marked with dirtbands  a gently sloping saddle bare of snow which succeeds the glacier forms the top of the tunkra pass it unites two snowy mountains and opens on the great valley of the machoo which flows in a part of tibet between sikkim and bhotan its height is 16083 feet above the sea by barometer and 16137 feet by boilingpoint nothing can be more different than the two slopes of this pass that by which i had come presented a gentle snowy acclivity bounded by precipitous mountains while that which opened before me was a steep rocky broad grassy valley where not a particle of snow was to be seen and yaks were feeding near a small lake not 1000 feet down nor were snowy mountains visible anywhere in this direction except far to the southeast in bhotan this remarkable difference of climate is due to the southerly wind which ascends the tibetan or machoo valley being drained by intervening mountains before reaching this pass whilst the sikkim current brings abundant vapours up the teesta and lachoong valleys  chumulari lies to the ene of the tunkra pass and is only twentysix miles distant but not seen phari is two marches off in an easterly direction and choombi one to the southeast choombi is the general name given to a large tibetan province that embraces the head of the machoo river and includes phari eusa choombi and about thirteen other villages corresponding to as many districts that contain from under a dozen to 300 houses each varying with the season and state of trade the latter is considerable phari being next to dorjiling the greatest tibetan bhotan sikkim and indian entrepot along the whole himalaya east of nepal the general form of choombi valley is triangular the broader end northwards it is bounded by the chola range on the west from donkia to gipmoochi and by the kamphee or chakoong range to the east which is i believe continuous with chumulari these meridional ranges approximate to the southward so as to form a natural boundary to choombi the machoo river rising from chumulari flows through the choombi district and enters bhotan at a large mart called rinchingoong whence it flows to the plains of india where it is called at couchbehar the torsha or as some say the godadda and falls into the burrampooter  the choombi district is elevated for the only cultivation is a summer or alpine one neither rice maize nor millet being grown there it is also dry for the great height of the bhotan mountains and the form of the machou valley cut off the rains and there is no dense forest it is very mountainous all carriage being on mens and yaks backs and is populous for this part of the country the inhabitants being estimated at 3000 in the trading season when many families from tibet and bhotan erect booths at phari  a civil officer at phari collects the revenue under the lhassan authorities and there is also a tibetan fort an officer and guard the inhabitants of this district more resemble the bhotanese than tibetans and are a thievish set finding a refuge under the paropilo of bhotan there was once a large monastery called kazioo goompa at choombi with upwards of one hundred lamas during a struggle between the sikkim and bhotan monks for superiority in it the abbot died his avatar reappeared in two places at once in bhotan as a relative of the paropilo himself and in sikkim as a brother of the powerful gangtok kajee their disputes were referred to the dalai lama who pronounced for sikkim this was not to be disputed by the pilo who however plundered the goompa of its silver gold and books leaving nothing but the bare walls for the successful lama the lhassan authorities made no attempt to obtain restitution and the monastery has been consequently neglected who taxes the refugees according to the estimate he forms of their plunder the tibetans seldom pursue the culprits as the lhassan government avoids all interference south of their own frontier  from choombi to lhassa is fifteen days long journeys for a man mounted on a stout mule all the rice passing through phari is monopolised there for the chinese troops at lhassa the grazing for yaks and small cattle is excellent in choombi and the pinus excelsa is said to grow abundantly there though unknown in sikkim but i have not heard of any other peculiarity in its productions  very few plants grew amongst the stones at the top of the tunkra pass and those few were mostly quite different from those of palung and kongra lama a pinkflowered arenaria two kinds of corydalis the cottony saussurea and diminutive primroses were the most conspicuous the only others were leontopodium sedum saxifrage ramunculus hyperboreus ligularia two species of polygonum a trichostomum stereocaulon and lecidea geographica not one grass or sedge the wind was variable blowing alternately up both valleys bringing much snow when it blew from the teesta though deflected to a northwest breeze when on the contrary it blew from tibet it was though southerly dry clouds obscured all distant view the temperature varied between noon and 130 pm from 39 degrees to 405 degrees the air being extremely damp  returning to the foot of the glacier i took up my quarters for two days under an enormous rock overlooking the broad flat valley in which i had spent the previous night and directly fronting tunkra mountain which bore north about five miles distant this rock was sixty to eighty feet high and 15250 feet above the sea it was of gneiss and was placed on the top of a bleak ridge facing the north no shrub or bush being near it the gentle slope outwards of the rock afforded the only shelter and a more utterly desolate place than lacheepia as it is called i never laid my unhoused head in it commanded an incomparable view due west across the lachoong and lachen valleys of the whole group of kinchinjunga snows from tibet southwards and as such was a most valuable position for geographical purposes  the night was misty and though the temperature was 35 degrees i was miserably cold for my blankets being laid on the bare ground the chill seemed to strike from the rock to the very marrow of my bones in the morning the fog hung till sunrise when it rose majestically from all the mountaintops but the view obtained was transient for in less than an hour the dense woolly banks of fog which choked the valleys ascended like a curtain to the warmed atmosphere above and slowly threw a veil over the landscape i waited till the last streak of snow was shut out from my view when i descended to breakfast on himalayan grouse tetraoperdix nivicola a small gregarious bird which inhabits the loftiest stony mountains and utters a short cry of quiok quiok in character and appearance it is intermediate between grouse and partridge and is good eating though tough  hoping to obtain another view which might enable me to correct the bearings taken that morning i was tempted to spend a second night in the open air at lacheepia passing the day botanizing scarcely a grass and no astragali grow on these stony and snowy slopes and the smallest heathlike andromeda a still smaller menziesia an erotic genus previously unknown in the himalaya and a prostrate willow are the only woodystemmed plants above 15000 feet in the vicinity and taking observations of the barometer and wetbulb i also boiled three thermometers by turns noting the grave errors likely to attend observations of this instrument for elevation these will be more particularly alluded to in the appendix where will be found a comparison of elevations deduced from boiling point and from barometric observations the height of lacheepia is 14912 feet by boilingpoint and 15262 feet by barometer little rain fell during the day but it was heavy at night though there was fortunately no wind and i made a more comfortable bed with tufts of juniper brought up from below our fire was principally of wet rhododendron wood with masses of the aromatic dwarf species which being full of resinous glands blazed with fury next day after a very transient glimpse of the kinchinjunga snows i descended to lachoong where i remained for some days botanizing during my stay i was several times awakened by all the noises and accompaniments of a nightattack or alarm screaming voices groans shouts and ejaculations the beating of drums and firing of guns and flambeaux of pinewood gleaming amongst the trees and flitting from house to house the cause i was informed was the presence of a demon who required exorcisement and who generally managed to make the villagers remember his visit by their missing various articles after the turmoil made to drive him away the custom of driving out demons in the above manner is constantly practised by the lamas in tibet mm huc and gabet give a graphic account of such an operation during their stay at kounboum  on the 29th of august i left lachoong and proceeded up the valley the road ran along a terrace covered with long grass and bounded by lofty banks of unstratified gravel and sand and passed through beautiful groves of green pines rich in plants no oak nor chesnut ascends above 9000 feet here or elsewhere in the interior of sikkim where they are replaced by a species of hazel corylus in the north himalaya on the other hand an oak quercus semecarpifolia see vol i chapter viii is amongst the most alpine trees and the nut is a different species more resembling the european on the outer sikkim ranges oaks q annulata ascend to 10000 feet and there is no hazel above the fork the valley contracts extremely and its bed is covered with moraines and landslips which often bury the larches and pines marshes occur here and there full of the sweetscented hierochloe grass the scotch thalictrum alpinum and an eriocaulon which ascends to 10000 feet the old moraines were very difficult to cross and on one i found a barricade which had been erected to deceive me regarding the frontier had i chosen this route instead of the lachen one in may  broad flats clothed with rhododendron alternate with others covered with mud boulders and gravel which had flowed down from the gorges on the west and which still contained trees inclined in all directions and buried up to their branches some of these debacles were 400 yards across and sloped at an angle of 2 degrees to 3 degrees bearing on their surfaces blocks fifteen yards in diameter none were to be compared in size and extent with that at bex at the mouth of the rhone valley they seem to subside materially as i perceived they had left marks many feet higher on the treetrunks such debacles must often bury standing forests in a very favourable material climate and position for becoming fossilized  on the 30th of august i arrived at yeumtong a small summer cattlestation on a flat by the lachoong 11920 feet above the sea the general features of which closely resemble those of the narrow swiss valleys the west flank is lofty and precipitous with narrow gullies still retaining the winters snow at 12500 feet the east gradually slopes up to the two snowy domes seen from lachoong the bed of the valley is alternately a flat lakebed in which the river meanders at the rate of three and a half miles an hour and sudden descents cumbered with old moraines over which it rushes in sheets of loam silverfirs ascend nearly to 13000 feet where they are replaced by large junipers sixty feet high up the valley chango khang is seen with a superb glacier descending to about 14000 feet on its south flank enormous masses of rock were continually precipitated from the west side close to the shed in which i had taken up my quarters keeping my people in constant alarm and causing a great commotion among the yaks dogs and ponies on the opposite side of the river is a deep gorge in which an immense glacier descends lower than any i have seen in sikkim i made several attempts to reach it by the gully of its discharging stream but was always foiled by the rocks and dense jungle of pines rhododendron and dwarf holly  the snowbanks on the face of the domeshaped mountain appearing favourable for ascertaining the position of the level of perpetual snow i ascended to them on the 6th of september and found the mean elevation along an even continuous and gradual slope with a full southwest exposure to be 15985 feet by barometer and 15816 feet by boilingpoint these beds of snow however broad and convex cannot nevertheless be distinguished from glaciers they occupy it is true mountain slopes and do not fill hollows like glaciers commonly so called but they display the ribboned structure of ice and being viscous fluids descend at a rate and to a distance depending on the slope and on the amount of annual accumulation behind their termination must therefore be far below that point at which all the snow that falls melts which is the theoretical line of perpetual snow before returning i attempted to proceed northwards to the great glacier hoping to descend by its lateral moraine but a heavy snowstorm drove me down to yeumtong  some hotsprings burst from the bank of the lachen a mile or so below the village they are used as baths the patient remaining three days at a time in them only retiring to eat in a little shed close by the discharge amounts to a few gallons per minute the temperature at the source is 1126 degrees and 106 degrees in the bath this water boiled at 1916 degrees the same at which snowwater and that of the river did giving an elevation of 11730 feet observations on the mineral constituents of the water will be found in the appendix the water has a slightly saline taste it is colourless but emits bubbles of sulphuretted hydrogen gas blackening silver a cold spring temperature 42 degrees emerged close by and the lachoong not ten yards off was 47 degrees to 50 degrees a conferva grows in the hot water and the garnets are worn out of the gneiss rock exposed to its action  the singtam soubah had been very sulky since leaving choongtam and i could scarcely get a drop of milk or a slice of curd here i had to take him to task severely for sanctioning the flogging of one of my men a huntsman who had offered me his services at choongtam and who was a civil industrious fellow though he had procured me little besides a huge monkey which had nearly bitten off the head of his best dog i had made a point of consulting the soubah before hiring him for fear of accidents but this did not screen him from the jealousy of the choongtam lama who twice flogged him in the goompa with rattans with the soubahs consent alleging that he had quitted his service for mine my people knew of this but were afraid to tell me which the poor fellow did himself  the lachoong phipun visited me on the 7th of september he had officiously been in tibet to hear what the tibetan people would say to my going to donkia and finding them supremely indifferent returned to be my guide a months provision for ten men having arrived from dorjiling i left yeumtong the following day for momay samdong the loftiest yak grazing station in sikkim palung being too cold for yaks and within a days journey of the donkia pass  the valley remains almost level for several miles the road continuing along the east bank of the lachen shoots of stones descend from the ravines all of a white finegrained granite stained red with a minute conferva which has been taken by himalayan travellers for red snow red snow was never found in the antarctic regions during sir james rosss south polar voyage nor do i know any authentic record of its having been seen in the himalaya a phenomenon i never saw in sikkim  at a fork of the valley several miles above yeumtong and below the great glacier of chango khang the ancient moraines are prodigious much exceeding any i have elsewhere seen both in extent in the size of the boulders and in the height to which the latter are piled on one another many boulders i measured were twenty yards across and some even forty and the chaotic scene they presented baffles all description they were scantily clothed with stunted silver firs  beyond this the path crosses the river and ascends rapidly over a mile of steeply sloping landslip composed of angular fragments of granite that are constantly falling from above and are extremely dangerous at 14000 feet trees and shrubs cease willow and honeysuckle being the last and thence onward the valley is bleak open and stony with lofty rocky mountains on either side the south wind brought a cold drizzling rain which numbed us and two of the lads who had last come up from dorjiling were seized with a remittent fever originally contracted in the hot valleys luckily we found some cattlesheds in which i left them with two men to attend on them  momay samdong is situated in a broad part of the lachoong valley where three streams meet it is on the west of chango khang and is six miles southeast of kinchinjhow and seven southwest of donkia it is in the same latitude as palung but scarcely so lofty the mean of fiftysix barometrical observations contemporaneous with calcutta makes it 15362 feet above the sea nearly the elevation of lacheepia near the tunkra pass from which however its scenery and vegetation entirely differ  i pitched my tent close to a little shed at the gently sloping base of a mountain that divided the lachoong river from a western tributary it was a wild and most exposed spot long stony mountains grassy on the base near the river distant snowy peaks stupendous precipices moraines glaciers transported boulders and rocks rounded by glacial action formed the dismal landscape which everywhere met the view there was not a bush six inches high and the only approach to woody plants were minute creeping willows and dwarf rhododendrons with a very few prostrate junipers and ephedra  the base of the spur was cut into broad flat terraces composed of unstratified sand pebbles and boulders the remains doubtless of an enormously thick glacial deposit the terracing is as difficult to be accounted for in this valley as in that of yangma east nepal both valleys being far too broad and descending too rapidly to admit of the hypothesis of their having been blocked up in the lower part and the upper filled with large lakes the formation of small lakes however between moraines and the sides of the valleys they occupy or between two successively formed moraines as i have elsewhere mentioned will account for very extensive terraced areas of this kind and it must be borne in mind that when the momay valley was filled with ice the breadth of its glacier at this point must have been twelve miles and it must have extended east and west from chango khang across the main valley to beyond donkia still the great moraines are wanting at this particular point and though atmospheric action and the rivers have removed perhaps 200 feet of glacial shingle they can hardly have destroyed a moraine of rocks large enough to block up the valley another tributary falls into the lachoong at momay which leads eastwards up to an enormous glacier that descends from donkia snowy mountains rise nearly all round it those on its south and east divide sikkim from the phari province in tibet those on the north terminate in a forked or cleft peak which is a remarkable and conspicuous feature from momay this which i have called forked donkia its elevation by my observations is about 21870 feet is the termination of a magnificent amphitheatre of stupendous snowclad precipices continuously upwards of 20000 feet high that forms the east flank of the upper lachoong from donkia top again the mountains sweep round to the westward rising into fingered peaks of extraordinary magnificence and thencestill running westdip to 18500 feet forming the donkia pass and rise again as the great mural mass of kinchinjhow this girdle of mountains encloses the head waters of the lachoong which rises in countless streams from its perpetual snows glaciers and small lakes its north drainage is to the cholamoo lakes in tibet in which is the source of the lachen which flows round the north base of kinchinjhow to kongra lama  the bottom of the lachoong valley at momay is broad tolerably level grassy and covered with isolated mounds and ridges that point down the valley and are the remains of glacial deposits it dips suddenly below this and some gneiss rocks that rise in its centre are remarkably moutonneed or rounded and have boulders perched on their summits though manifestly rounded and grooved by ancient glaciers i failed to find scratches on these weatherworn rocks i have repeatedly and equally in vain sought for scratchings on many of the most conspicuously moutonneed gneiss rocks of switzerland the retention of such markings depends on other circumstances than the mere hardness of the rock or amount of aqueous action what can be more astonishing than to see these most delicate scratches retained in all their sharpness on rocks clothed with seaweed and shells and exposed at every tide in the bays of western scotland  the lachoong is here twelve or fifteen yards wide and runs over a pebbly bed cutting a shallow channel through the deposits down to the subjacent rock which is in some cases scooped out six or eight feet deep by its waters i do not doubt that the flatness of the floor of the momay valley is caused by the combined action of the streams that drained the three glaciers which met here for the tendency of retiring glaciers is to level the floors of valleys by giving an evershifting direction to the rivers which drain them and which spread detritus in their course supposing these glaciers to have had no terminal moraines they might still have forced immense beds of gravel into positions that would dam up lakes between the ice and the flanks of the valleys and thus produce much terracing on the latter we are still very ignorant of many details of ice action and especially of the origin of many enormous deposits which are not true moraines these so conspicuous in the lofty himalayan valleys are not less so in those of the swiss alps witness that broad valley in which grindelwald village is situated and which is covered to an immense depth with angular detritus moulded into hills and valleys also the whole broad open upper rhone valley above the village of munster and below that of obergestelen the action of broad glaciers on gentle slopes is to raise their own beds by the accumulation of gravel which their lower surface carries and pushes forward i have seen small glaciers thus raised 300 feet leaving little doubt in my mind that the upper himalayan valleys were thus choked with deposit 1000 feet thick of which indeed the proofs remain along the flanks of the yangma valley the denuding and accumulating effects of ice thus give a contour to mountain valleys and sculpture their flanks and floors far more rapidly than sea action or the elements after a very extensive experience of ice in the antarctic ocean and in mountainous countries i cannot but conclude that very few of our geologists appreciate the power of ice as a mechanical agent which can hardly be overestimated whether as glacier iceberg or pack ice heaping shingle along coasts  on our arrival we found that a party of buxom goodnatured looking girls who were tending yaks were occupying the hut which however they cheerfully gave up to my people spreading a black tent close by for themselves and next morning they set off with all their effects packed upon the yaks the ground was marshy and covered with cowslips ranunculus grasses and sedges cyananthus blue asters gentians etc the spot appearing highly favourable for observations i determined to remain here during the equinoctial month and put my people on twothirds allowance ie four pounds of rice daily for three men allowing them to send down the valley to cater for what more they could get the singtam soubah was intensely disgusted with my determination he accompanied me next day to the pass and having exhausted his persuasions threats and warnings about snow wind robbers starvation and cheen sepoys departed on the 12th for yeumtong leaving me truly happy for the first time since quitting dorjiling i had now a prospect of uninterruptedly following up my pursuits at an elevation little below that of the summit of mont blanc surrounded by the loftiest mountains and perhaps the vastest glaciers on the globe my instruments were in perfect order and i saw around me a curious and varied flora  the morning of the 9th of september promised fair though billowy clouds were rapidly ascending the valley to the eastward my attention was directed to a double rainbow the upper was an arch of the usual form and the lower was the curved illuminated edge of a bank of cumulus with the orange hues below we took the path to the donkia pass fording the river and ascending in a northeast direction along the foot of stony hills that rise at a gradual slope of 12 degrees to broad unsnowed ridges 18000 to 19000 feet high shallow valleys glacierbound at their upper extremities descend from the still loftier rearward mountains and in these occur lakes about five miles up a broad opening on the west leads to tomo chamo as the eastern summit of kinchinjhow is called on one occasion i ascended this valley which is very broad flat and full of lakes at different elevations one at about 17000 feet elevation is threequarters of a mile long but not deep no waterplants grew in it but there were plenty of others round its margin i collected in the dry bed of a stream near it a curious white substance like thick felt formed of felspathic silt no doubt the product of glacial streams and the siliceous cells of infusoriae it much resembles the fossil or meteoric paper of germany which is also formed of the lowest tribes of freshwater plants though considered by ehrenberg as of animal origin a vein of granite in the bottom of the valley had completely altered the character of the gneiss which contained veins of jasper and masses of amorphous garnet much olivine is found in the fissures of the gneiss this feral is very rare in sikkim but i have also seen it in the fissures of the white gneissy granite of the surrounding heights above this the valley expands very much and is stony and desert stupendous mountains upwards of 21000 feet high rear themselves on all sides and the desolation and grandeur of the scene are unequalled in my experience the path again crosses the river which is split into many channels and proceeds northwards over gravelly terraces and rocks with patches of scotch alpine grasses festuca ovina and poa laxa sedges stipa dandelion allardia gentians saussurea and astraga1us varied with hard hemispherical mounds of the alsineous plant mentioned at chapter xxi  i passed several shallow lakes at 17500 feet their banks were green and marshy and supported thirty or forty kinds of plants at the head of the valley a steep rocky crest 500 feet high rises between two precipitous snowy peaks and a very fatiguing ascent at this elevation leads to the sharp rocky summit of the donkia pass 18466 feet above the sea by barometer and 17866 by boilingpoint the view on this occasion was obscured by clouds and fogs except towards tibet in which direction it was magnificent but as i afterwards twice ascended this pass and also crossed it i shall here bring together all the particulars i noted  the tibetan view from its novelty extent and singularity demands the first notice the cholamoo lake lay 1500 feet below me at the bottom of a rapid and rocky descent it was a blue sheet of water three or four miles from north to south and one and a half broad hemmed in by rounded spurs from kinchinjhow on one side and from donkia on the other the lachen flowed from its northern extremity and turning westward entered a broad barren valley bounded on the north by red stony mountains called bhomtso which i saw from kongra lama and ascended with dr campbell in the october following though 18000 to 19000 feet high these mountains were wholly unsnowed beyond this range lay the broad valley of the arun and in the extreme northwest distance to the north of nepal were some immense snowy mountains reduced to mere specks on the horizon the valley of the arun was bounded on the north by very precipitous black rocky mountains sprinkled with snow beyond these again from north to northwest snowtopped range rose over range in the clear purple distance the nearer of these was the kianglah which forms the axis or watershed of this meridian its south drainage being to the arun river and its north to the yarutsampu it appeared forty to fifty miles off and of great mean elevation 20000 feet the vast snowy mountains that rose beyond it were i was assured beyond the yaru in the salt lake country this salt country was described to me as enormously lofty perfectly sterile and fourteen days march for loaded men and sheep from jigatzi there is no pasture for yaks whose feet are cut by the rocks the salt is dug so they express it from the margin of lakes as is the carbonate of soda pleu of the tibetans a spur from chomiomo cut off the view to the southward of northwest and one from donkia concealed all to the east of north  illustrationtibet and cholamoo lake from the summit of the donkia pass looking northwest  the most remarkable features of this landscape were its enormous elevation and its colours and contrast to the black rugged and snowy himalaya of sikkim all the mountains between donkia pass and the arun were comparatively gently sloped and of a yellow red colour rising and falling in long undulations like dunes 2000 to 3000 feet above the mean level of the arun valley and perfectly bare of perpetual snow or glaciers rocks everywhere broke out on their flanks and often along their tops but the general contour of that immense area was very open and undulating like the great ranges of central asia described by mm huc and gabet beyond this again the mountains were rugged often rising into peaks which from the angles i took here and subsequently at bhomtso cannot be below 24000 feet and are probably much higher the most lofty mountains were on the range north of nepal not less than 120 miles distant and which though heavily snowed were below the horizon of donkia pass  cholamoo lake lay in a broad scantily grassed sandy and stony valley snowbeds rocks and glaciers dipped abruptly towards its head but on its west bank a lofty brickred spur sloped upwards from it conspicuously cut into terraces for several hundred feet above its waters  kambajong the chief tibetan village near this after phari and giantchi is situated on the arun called in tibet chomachoo on the road from sikkim to jigatzi i have adopted the simplest mode of spelling this name that i could find and omitted the zong or jong which means fort and generally terminates it i think it would not be difficult to enumerate fully a dozen ways of spelling the word of which shigatzi digarchi and djigatzi are the most common the tibetans tell me that they cross two passes after leaving donkia or kongra lama en route for jigatzi on both of which they suffer from headaches and difficulty of breathing one is over the kambajong range the other much loftier is over that of kianglah as they do not complain of bhomtso which is also crossed and is 18500 feet the others may be very lofty indeed the distance from donkia pass to jigatzi is said to be ten days journey for loaded yaks now according to turners observations evidently taken with great care that capital is in latitude 29 degrees 4 minutes 20 seconds north or only seventy miles north of donkia and as the yak travels at the rate of sixteen miles a day the country must be extraordinarily rugged or the valleys tortuous turner took eight or nine days on his journey from phari to teshoo loombo a distance of only eighty miles yet he is quoted as an authority for the fact of tibet being a plain he certainly crossed an undulating country probably 16000 to 17000 feet high a continuation eastwards of the cholamoo features and part of the same mountain range that connects chumulari and donkia he had always lofty mountains in eight and rugged ones on either side after he had entered the painomchoo valley it is a remarkable and significant fact that turner never appears to have seen chumulari after having passed it nor donkia kinchinjhow or kinchinjunga at any time and teshoo loombo i did not see it but a long stony mountain range above the town is very conspicuous its sides presenting an interrupted line of cliffs resembling the portholes of a ship some freshfallen snow lay at the base but none at the top which was probably 18500 feet high the banks of the arun are thence inhabited at intervals all the way to tingre where it enters nepal  donkia rises to the eastward of the pass but its top is not visible i ascended over loose rocks to between 19000 and 20000 feet and reached vast masses of blue ribboned ice capping the ridges but obtained no further prospect to the west the beetling east summit of kinchinjhow rises at two miles distance 3000 to 4000 feet above the pass a little south of it and north of chango khang the view extends through a gap in the sebolah range across the valley of the lachen to kinchinjunga distant fortytwo miles the monarch of mountains looked quite small and low from this point and it was difficult to believe it was 10000 feet more lofty than my position i repeatedly looked from it to the high tibetan mountains in the extreme northwest distance and was more than ever struck with the apparently immense distance and consequent altitude of the latter i put however no reliance on such estimates  to the south the eye wandered down the valley of the lachoong to the mountains of the chola range which appear so lofty from dorjiling but from here are sunk far below the horizon on comparing these with the northern landscape the wonderful difference between their respective snowlevels amounting to fully 5000 feet was very apparent southeast the stupendous snowy amphitheatre formed by the flank of donkia was a magnificent spectacle  this wonderful view forcibly impressed me with the fact that all eyeestimates in mountainous countries are utterly fallacious if not corrected by study and experience i had been led to believe that from donkia pass the whole country of tibet sloped away in descending steppes to the tsampu and was more or less of a plain and could i have trusted my eyes only i should have confirmed this assertion so far as the slope was concerned when however the levelled theodolite was directed to the distance the reverse was found to be the case unsnowed and apparently low mountains touched the horizon line of the telescope which proves that if only 37 miles off they must from the dip of the horizon be at least 1000 feet higher than the observers position the same infallible guide cuts off mountaintops and deeply snowed ridges which to the unaided eye appear far lower than the point from which they are viewed but which from the quantity of snow on them must be many thousand feet higher and from the angle they subtend in the instrument must be at an immense distance the want of refraction to lift the horizon the astonishing precision of the outlines and the brilliancy of the images of mountains reduced by distance to mere specks are all circumstances tending to depress them to appearance the absence of trees houses and familiar objects to assist the eye in the appreciation of distance throws back the whole landscape which seen through the rarified atmosphere of 18500 feet looks as if diminished by being surveyed through the wrong end of a telescope  a few rude cairns were erected on the crest of the pass covered with wands red banners and votive offerings of rags i found a fine slab of slate inscribed with the tibetan characters om mani padmi hom which meepo allowed me to take away as the reward of my exertions the ridge is wholly formed of angular blocks of white gneissy granite split by frost it was not a proper granite but a highly metamorphic felspathic gneiss with very little mica being i suspect a gneiss which by metamorphic action was almost remolten into granite the lamination was obscure and marked by faint undulating lines of mica it cleaves at all angles but most generally along fissures with highly polished undulated black surfaces the strike of the same rock near at hand was northwest and dip northeast at various angles there was no snow on the pass itself but deep drifts and glaciers descended in hollows on the north side to 17000 feet the rounded northern red shoulder of kinchinjhow by cholamoo lake apparently 19000 feet high was quite bare and as i have said i ascended donkia to upwards of 19000 feet before i found the rocks crusted with ice snow transformed into ice throughout its whole mass in short glacial ice in all physical characters and the ground wholly frozen i assume therefore that 19000 feet at this spot is not below the mean level at which all the snow melts that falls on a fair exposure to the south this probably coincides with a mean temperature of 20 degrees forty miles further north in tibet the same line is probably at 20000 feet for there much less snow falls and much more melts in proportion two secondary considerations materially affecting the melting of snow and hence exerting a material influence on the elevation of the snowline appear to me never to have been sufficiently dwelt upon both however bear directly upon the great elevation of the snowline in tibet from the imperfect transmission of the heating rays of the sun through films of water which transmit perfectly the luminous rays it follows that the direct effects of the rays in clear sunshine are very different at equal elevations of the moist outer and dry inner himalaya secondly naked rock and soil absorb much more heat than surfaces covered with vegetation and this heat again radiated is infinitely more rapidly absorbed by snow or other white surfaces than the direct heat of the suns rays is hence at equal elevations the ground heats sooner and the snow is more exposed to the heat thus radiated in arid tibet than in the wooded and grassed mountains of sikkim from the elevation of about 19300 feet which i attained on donkia i saw a fine illustration of that atmospheric phenomenon called the spectre of the brocken my own shadow being projected on a mass of thin mist that rose above the tremendous precipices over which i hung my head was surrounded with a brilliant circular glory or rainbow probably caused by spiculae of ice floating in the atmosphere the lateral surfaces of which would then have an uniform inclination of 60 degrees this according to the observations of mariotte venturi and fraunhoefer being the angle necessary for the formation of halos  the temperature of the donkia pass is much higher than might be anticipated from its great elevation and from the fact of its being always bitterly cold to the feelings this is no doubt due to the warmth of the ascending currents and to the heat evolved during the condensation of their vapours i took the following observations  sept 9 130330 pm temp 418 degrees dp 303 degrees difference 115 degrees tension 01876 humidity 0665 sept 27 115315 pm temp 492 degrees dp 326 degrees difference 166 degrees tension 02037 humidity 0560 oct 19 300330 pm temp 401

proper deduction for latitude allows 508 and 460 feet as equivalent to 1 degree fahr i left a minimum thermometer on the summit on the 9th of september and removed it on the 27th but it had been lifted and turned over by the action of the frost and snow on the loose rocks amongst which i had placed it the latter appearing to have been completely shifted fortunately the instrument escaped unhurt with the index at 28 degrees  a violent southerly wind with a scud of mist and sometimes snow always blew over the pass but we found shelter on the north face where i twice kindled a fire and boiled my thermometers on the 9th of september the boilingpoint was 1813 degrees and on the 27th 1812 degrees in both observations i believe the kettle communicated a higher temperature to the thermometer than that of the water for the elevations deduced are far too low on one occasion i felt the pulses of my party several times during two hours repose without eating the mean of eight persons was 105 degrees the extremes being 92 degrees and 120 degrees and my own 108 degrees  one flowering plant ascends to the summit the alsinaceous one mentioned at chapter xxi the fescue grass a little fern woodsia and a saussurea a pinkflowered woolly saussurea and delphinium glaciale are two of the most lofty plants both being commonly found from 17500 to 18000 feet ascend very near the summit and several lichens grow on the top as cladonia vermicularis the yellow lecidea geographica and the orange l miniata this is one of the most arctic antarctic and universally diffused plants the other lichens were lecidea atroalba oreina elegans and chlorophana all alpine european and arctic species at 17000 feet occur lecanora ventosa physodes candelaria sordida atra and the beautiful swiss l chrysoleuca also european species also some barren mosses at 18300 feet i found on one stone only a fine scotch lichen a species of gyrophora the tripe de roche of arctic voyagers and the food of the canadian hunters it is also abundant on the scotch alps  before leaving i took one more long look at the boundless prospect and now that its important details were secured i had leisure to reflect on the impression it produced there is no loftier country on the globe than that embraced by this view and no more howling wilderness well might the singtam soubah and every tibetan describe it as the loftiest coldest windiest and most barren country in the world were it buried in everlasting snows or burnt by a tropical sun it might still be as utterly sterile but with such sterility i had long been familiar here the colourings are those of the fiery desert or volcanic island while the climate is that of the poles never in the course of all my wanderings had my eye rested on a scene so dreary and inhospitable the cities of the plain lie sunk in no more deathlike sea than cholamoo lake nor are the tombs of petra hewn in more desolate cliffs than those which flank the valley of the tibetan arun  on our return my pony strained his shoulder amongst the rocks as a remedy the lachoong phipun plunged a lancet into the muscle and giving me his own animal rode mine down these animals called tanghan are wonderfully strong and enduring they are never shod and the hoof often cracks and they become pigeontoed they are frequently blind of one eye when they are called zemik blind ones but this is thought no great defect they average 5 pounds to 10 pounds for a good animal in tibet and the best fetch 40 pounds to 50 pounds in the plains of india where they become acclimated and thrive well giantchi jhansijeung of turner is the best mart for them in this part of tibet where some breeds fetch very high prices the tibetans give the foals of value messes of pigs blood and raw liver which they devour greedily and it is said to strengthen them wonderfully the custom is i believe general in central asia humboldt pens nar iv p 320 describes the horses of caraccas as occasionally eating salt meat it drizzled and sleeted all the way and was dark before we arrived at the tent  at night the tibetan dogs are let loose when they howl dismally on one occasion they robbed me of all my meat a fine piece of yaks flesh the yaks are also troublesome and bad sleepers they used to try to effect an entrance into my tent pushing their muzzles under the flaps at the bottom and awakening me with a snort and moist hot blast before the second night i built a turf wall round the tent and in future slept with a heavy tripod by my side to poke at intruders  birds flock to the grass about momay larks finches warblers abundance of sparrows feeding on the yakdroppings and occasionally the hoopoe waders cormorants and wild ducks were sometimes seen in the streams but most of them were migrating south the yaks are driven out to pasture at sunrise and home at sunset till the middle of the month when they return to yeumtong all their droppings are removed from near the tents and piled in heaps as these animals unlike their masters will not sleep amid such dirt these heaps swarm with the maggots of two large flies a yellow and black affording abundant food to redlegged crows ravens and swallows butterflies are rare the few are mostly colias hipparchia polyommatus and melitaea these i have seen feeding at 17000 feet when found higher they have generally been carried up by currents of beetles an aphodeus in yakdroppings and an elaphrus a predaceous genus inhabiting swamps are almost the only ones i saw the wild quadrupeds are huge sheep in flocks of fifty the ovis ammon called gnow i never shot one not having time to pursue them for they were very seldom seen and always at great elevations the larger marmot is common and i found the horns of the tchiru antelope neither the wild horse fox hare nor tailless rat cross the donkia pass white clover shepherds purse dock plantain and chickweed are imported here by yaks but the common prunella of europe is wild and so is a groundsel like senecio jacobaea ranunculus sibbaldia and 200 other plants the grasses are numerous they belong chiefly to poa festuca stipa and other european genera  i repeatedly attempted to ascend both kinchinjhow and donkia from momay and generally reached from 18000 to 19000 feet but never much higher an elevation of 20000 and perhaps 22000 feet might i should think easily be attained by practice in tibet north of sikkim the observations taken on these excursions are sufficiently illustrated by those of donkia pass they served chiefly to perfect my map measure the surrounding peaks and determine the elevation reached by plants all of which were slow operations the weather of this month being so bad that i rarely returned dry to my tent fog and drizzle if not sleet and snow coming on during every day without exception  i made frequent excursions to the great glacier of kinchinjhow its valley is about four miles long broad and flat changokhang the elevation of this mountain is about 20560 feet by the mean of several observations taken from surrounding localities rears its blue and white cliffs 4500 feet above its west flank and throws down avalanches of stones and snow into the valley hot springs supposing the mean temperature of the air at the elevation of the momay springs to be 26 degrees or 28 degrees which may be approximately assumed and that as some suppose the heat of thermal springs is due to the internal temperature of the globe then according to the law of increment of heat in descending of 1 degree for fifty feet we should find the temperature of 110 degrees at a depth of 4100 feet or at 11900 feet above the level of the sea direct experiment with internal heat has not however been carried beyond 2000 feet below the surface and as the ratio of increment diminishes with the depth that above assigned to the temperature of 110 degrees is no doubt much too little the momay springs more probably owe their temperature to chemical decomposition of sulphurets of metals i found pyrites in tibet on the north flank of the mountain kinchinjhow in limestones associated with shales burst from the ground near some granite rocks on its floor about 16000 feet above the sea and only a mile below the glacier and the water collects in pools its temperature is 110 degrees and in places 116 degrees or 4 degrees hotter than that of the yeumtong hotsprings though 4000 feet higher and of precisely the same character a barbarea and some other plants make the neighbourhood of the hotsprings a little oasis and the large marmot is common uttering its sharp chirping squeak  the terminal moraine is about 500 feet high quite barren and thrown obliquely across the valley from northeast to southwest completely hiding the glacier from its top successive smaller parallel ridges indicating the periodic retirements of the glacier lead down to the ice which must have sunk several hundred feet this glacier descends from kinchinjhow the huge cliff of whose eastern extremity dips into it the surface less than half a mile wide is exceedingly undulated and covered with large pools of water ninety feet deep and beds of snow and is deeply corroded gigantic blocks are perched on pinnacles of ice on its surface and the gravel cones for a description of this curious phenomenon which has been illustrated by agassiz see forbess alps p 26 and 347 are often twenty feet high the crevassing so conspicuous on the swiss glaciers is not so regular on this and the surface appears more like a troubled ocean due no doubt to the copious rain and snowfalls throughout the summer and the corroding power of wet fogs the substance of the ice is ribboned dirtbands are seen from above to form long loops on some parts and the lateral moraines like the terminal are high above the surface these notes made previous to reading professor forbess travels in the alps sufficiently show that perpetual snow whether as ice or glacier obeys the same laws in india as in europe and i have no remarks to offer on the structure of glaciers that are not well illustrated and explained in the abovementioned admirable work  its average slope for a mile above the terminal moraines was less than 5 degrees and the height of its surface above the sea 16500 feet by boilingpoint the thickness of its ice probably 400 feet between the moraine and the west flank of the valley is a large lake with terraced banks whose bottom covered with fine felspathic silt is several hundred feet above that of the valley it is half a mile long and a quarter broad and fed partly by glaciers of the second order on changokhang and sebolah and partly by filtration through the lateral moraine

glaciers east of momay the valley is much longer than that leading to the kinchinjhow glacier and at 16000 or 17000 feet elevation containing four marshes or lakes alternating with as many transverse moraines that have dammed the river these moraines seem in some cases to have been deposited where rocks in the bed of the valley obstructed the downward progress of the ancient glacier hence when this latter finally retired it rested at these obstructions and accumulated there great deposits which do not cross the valley but project from each side obliquely into it the rocks in situ on the floor of the valley are all moutonneed and polished on the top sides and face looking up the valley but are rugged on that looking down it gigantic blocks are poised on some the lowest of the ancient moraines completely crosses the river which finds its way between the boulders  under the red cliff of forked donkia the valley becomes very broad bare and gravelly with a confusion of moraines and turns more northwards at the angle the present terminal moraine rises like a mountain i assumed it to be about 800 feet high this is the largest and longest terminal moraine backed by an existing glacier that i examined with care i doubt its being so high as the moraine of the allalein glacier below the matmaark sea in the sachs valley valais switzerland but it is impossible to compare such objects from memory the donkia one was much the most uniform in height and crosses the valley from nne to ssw from the summit which rises above the level of the glacier and from which i assume its present retirement a most striking scene opened the ice filling an immense basin several miles broad and long formed a low dome this convexity of the ice is particularly alluded to by forbes travels in the alps p386 as the renflement of rendu and surface bombee of agassiz and is attributed to the effects of hydrostatic pressure tending to press the lower layers of ice upwards to the surface my own impression at the time was that the convexity of the surface of the donkia glacier was due to a subjacent mountain spur running south from donkia itself i know however far too little of the topography of this glacier to advance such a conjecture with any confidence in this case as in all similar ones broad expanses being covered to an enormous depth with ice the surface of the latter must in some degree be modified by the ridges and valleys it conceals the typical surface bombee which is conspicuous in the himalaya glaciers i was wont in my ignorance of the mechanical laws of glaciers to attribute to the more rapid melting of the edges of the glacier by the radiated heat of its lateral moraines and of the flanks of the valley that it occupies with forked donkia on the west and a serried range of rustyred scarped mountains 20000 feet high on the north and east separating large tributary glaciers other still loftier tops of donkia appeared behind these upwards of 22000 feet high but i could not recognise the true summit 23176 feet the surface was very rugged and so deeply honeycombed that the foot often sank from six to eight inches in crisp wet ice i proceeded a mile on it with much more difficulty than on any swiss glacier this was owing to the elevation and the corrosion of the surface into pits and pools of water the crevasses being but few and distant i saw no dirtbands on looking down upon it from a point i attained under the red cliff of forked donkia at an elevation of 18307 feet by barometer and 18597 by boilingpoint the weather was very cold the thermometer fell from 41 degrees to 34 degrees and it snowed heavily after 3 pm  the strike of all the rocks gneiss with granite veins seemed to be northeast and dip northwest 30 degrees such also were the strike and dip on another spur from donkia north of this which i ascended to 19000 feet on the 26th of september it abutted on the scarped precipices 3000 feet high of that mountain i had been attracted to the spot by its bright orangered colour which i found to be caused by peroxide of iron the highly crystalline nature of the rocks at these great elevations is due to the action of veins of finegrained granite which sometimes alter the gneiss to such an extent that it appears as if fused into a fine granite with distinct crystals of quartz and felspar the most quartzy layers are then roughly crystallized into prisms or their particles are aggregated into spheres composed of concentric layers of radiating crystals as is often seen in agates the rearrangement of the mineral constituents by heat goes on here just as in trap cavities filled with crystals being formed in rocks exposed to great heat and pressure where mica abounds it becomes black and metallic and the aluminous matter is crystallised in the form of garnets  illustrationsummit of forked donkia and goa antelopes  at these great heights the weather was never fine for more than an hour at a time and a driving sleet followed by thick snow drove me down on both these occasions another time i ascended a third spur from this great mountain and was overtaken by a heavy gale and thunderstorm the latter is a rare phenomenon it blew down my tripod and instruments which i had thought securely propped with stones and the thermometers were broken but fortunately not the barometer on picking up the latter which lay with its top down the hill a large bubble of air appeared which i passed up and down the tube and then allowed to escape when i heard a rattling of broken glass in the cistern having another barometer this barometer one of newmans portable instruments i have now at kew it was compared with the royal societys standard before leaving england and varied according to comparisons made with the calcutta standard 0012 during its travels on leaving calcutta its error was 0 and on arriving in england by the standard of the royal society 004 i have given in the appendix some remarks on the use of these barometers which though they have obvious defects are less liable to derangement far more portable and stand much heavier shocks than those of any other construction with which i am familiar at my tent i hastened to ascertain by comparison whether the instrument which had travelled with me from england and taken so many thousand observations was seriously damaged to my delight an error of 0020 was all i could detect at momay and all other lower stations on my return to dorjiling in december i took it to pieces and found the lower part of the bulb of the attached thermometer broken off and floating on the mercury having quite expected this i always checked the observations of the attached thermometer by another buthow it is not easy to saythe broken one invariably gave a correct temperature  illustrationview from an elevation of 18000 feet of the east top of kinchinjhow and of tibet over the ridge that connects it with donkia wild sheep ovis ammon in the foreground   the kinchinjhow spurs are not accessible to so great an elevation as those of donkia but they afford finer views over tibet across the ridge connecting kinchinjow with donkia  broad summits here as on the opposite side of the valley are quite bare of snow at 18000 feet though where they project as sloping hogbacked spurs from the parent mountain the snows of the latter roll down on them and form glacial caps the reverse of glaciers in valleys but which overflow as it were on all sides of the slopes and are ribboned the convexity of the curves however seems to be upwards such reversed glaciers ending abruptly on broad stony shoulders quite free of snow should on no account be taken as indicating the lower limit of perpetual snow and crevassed  on the 18th of september i ascended the range which divides the lachen from the lachoong valley to the sebolah pass a very sharp ridge of gneiss striking northwest and dipping northeast which runs south from kinchinjhow to changokhang a yaktrack led across the kinchinjhow glacier along the bank of the lake and thence westward up a very steep spur on which was much glacial ice and snow but few plants above 16000 feet at nearly 17000 feet i passed two small lakes on the banks of one of which i found bees a mayfly ephemera and gnat the two latter bred on stones in the water which the day being fine had a temperature of 53 degrees while that of the large lake at the glacier 1000 feet lower was only 39 degrees  the view from the summit commands the whole castellated front of kinchinjhow the sweep of the donkia cliffs to the east changokhangs blunt cone of ribbed snow this ridging or furrowing of steep snowbeds is explained at vol i chapter x over head while to the west across the grassy palung dunes rise chomiomo the thlonok mountains and kinchinjunga in the distance the latter bore 241 degrees 30 minutes it was distant about thirtyfour miles and subtended an angle of 3 degrees 2 minutes 30 seconds the rocks on its north flanks were all black while those forming the upper 10000 feet of the south face were white hence the top is probably granite overlaid by the gneiss on the north the palung plains now yellow with withered grass were the most curious part of the view hemmed in by this range which rises 2000 feet above them and by the lachen hills on the east they appeared a dead level from which kinchinjhow reared its head like an island from the ocean it is impossible to contemplate the abrupt flanks of all these lofty mountains without contrasting them with the sloping outlines that prevail in the southern parts of sikkim all such precipices are i have no doubt the results of sea action and all posterior influence of subaerial action aqueous or glacial tends to wear these precipices into slopes to fill up valleys and to level mountains of all such influences heavy rainfalls and a luxuriant vegetation are probably the most active and these features are characteristic of the lower valleys of sikkim which are consequently exposed to very different conditions of wear and tear from those which prevail on these loftier rearward ranges  the black tents of the tibetans were still there but the flocks were gone the broad fosselike valley of the chachoo was at my feet with the river winding along its bottom and its flanks dotted with black juniper bushes  the temperature at this elevation between 1 and 3 pm varied from 38 degrees to 59 degrees the mean being 465 degrees with the dewpoint 346 degrees the height i made 17585 feet by barometer and 17517 by boilingpoint i tried the pulses of eight persons after two hours rest they varied from 80 to 112 my own being 104 as usual at these heights all the party were suffering from giddiness and headaches  throughout september various parties passed my tent at momay generally lamas or traders the former wrapped in blankets wearing scarlet and gilt mitres usually rode grunting yaks which were sometimes led by a slaveboy or a mahoganyfaced nun with a broad yellow sheepskin cap with flaps over her ears short petticoats and striped boots the domestic utensils pots pans and bamboos of butter teachurn bellows stools books and sacred implements usually hung rattling on all sides of his holiness and a sumpter yak carried the tents and mats for sleeping on several occasions large parties of traders with thirty or forty yaks about 600 loaded yaks are said to cross the donkia pass annually laden with planks passed and occasionally a shepherd with tibet sheep goats and ponies i questioned many of these travellers about the courses of the tibetan rivers they all agreed one lad only declared that the kambajong river flowed northwest to dobtah and sarrh and thence turned north to the yaru but all campbells itineraries as well as mine make the dobtah lake drain into the chomachoo north of wallanchoon which latter river the nepalese also affirm flows into nepal as the arun the lachen and lachoong phipuns both insisted on this naming to me the principal towns on the way southwest from kambajong along the river to tingri maidan via tashirukpa chait which is north of wallanchoon pass in stating the kambajong or chomachoo liver north of the lachen to be the arun of nepal and that it rose near the ramchoo lake of turners route the lake itself discharges either into the arun or into the painomchoo flowing to the yaru but this point i could never satisfactorily ascertain  the weather at momay during september was generally bad after 11 am little snow or rain fell but thin mists and drizzle prevailed less than one inch and a half of rain was collected though upwards of eleven fell at calcutta and rather more at dorjiling the mornings were sometimes fine cold and sunny with a north wind which had blown down the valley all night and till 9 am when the southeast wind with fog came on throughout the day a north current blew above the southern and when the mist was thin the air sparkled with spiculae of snow caused by the cold dry upper current condensing the vapours of the lower this southern current passes over the tops of the loftiest mountains ascending to 24000 feet and discharging frequent showers in tibet as far north as jigatzi where however violent dry easterly gales are the most prevalent  the equinoctial gales set in on the 21st with a falling barometer and sleet at night on the 23rd and 24th it snowed heavily and being unable to light a fire at the entrance of my tent i spent two wretched days taking observations on the 25th it cleared and the snow soon melted frosty nights succeeded but the thermometer only fell to 31 degrees once during the month and the maximum once rose to 625 degrees the mean temperature from the 9th to the 30th september was 416 degrees the result of fiftysix comparative observations between calcutta and momay give 406 degrees difference which after corrections allows 1 degree fahr for every 438 feet of ascent which coincided with that of 8 am and 8 pm the mean maximum 522 degrees minimum 347 degrees and consequent range 175 degrees at dorjiling the september range is only 95 degrees and at calcutta 10 degrees on seven nights the radiating thermometer fell much below the temperature of the air the mean being 105 degrees and maximum 142 degrees and on seven mornings the sun heated the blackbulb thermometer considerably on the mean to 626 degrees above the air maximum 752 degrees and minimum 43 degrees the greatest heat of the day occurred at noon the most rapid rise of temperature 5 degrees between 8 and 9 am and the greatest fall 55 degrees between 3 and 4 pm a sunk thermometer fell from 525 degrees to 515 degrees between the 11th and 14th when i was obliged to remove the thermometer owing to the accident mentioned above the mercury in the barometer rose and fell contemporaneously with that at calcutta and dorjiling but the amount of tide was considerably less and as is usual during the equinoctial month on some days it scarcely moved whilst on others it rose and fell rapidly the tide amounted to 0062 of an inch  on the 28th of the month the singtam soubah came up from yeumtong to request leave to depart for his home on account of his wifes illness and to inform me that dr campbell had left dorjiling accompanied in compliance with the rajahs orders by the tchebu lama i therefore left momay on the 30th to meet him at choongtam arriving at yeumtong the same night amid heavy rain and sleet  autumnal tints reigned at yeumtong and the flowers had disappeared from its heathlike flat a small eatable cherry with a wrinkled stone was ripe and acceptable in a country so destitute of fruit the absence of vaccinia whortleberries and cranberries and eatable rubi brambles in the alpine regions of the himalaya is very remarkable and they are not replaced by any substitute with regard to vaccinium this is the more anomalous as several species grow in the temperate regions of sikkim thence i descended to lachoong on the 1st of october again through heavy rain the snow lying on the tunkra mountain at 14000 feet the larch was shedding its leaves which turn red before they fall but the annual vegetation was much behind that at 14000 feet and so many late flowerers such as umbelliferae and compositae had come into blossom that the place still looked gay and green the blue climbing gentian crawfurdia now adorned the bushes this plant would be a great acquisition in english gardens a polygonum still in flower here was in ripe fruit near momay 6000 feet higher up the valley  on the following day i made a long and very fatiguing march to choongtam but the coolies were not all able to accomplish it the backwardness of the flora in descending was even more conspicuous than on the previous day the jungles at 7000 feet being gay with a handsome cucurbitaceous plant crossing the lachoong canebridge i paid the tribute of a sigh to the memory of my poor dog and reached my old campingground at choongtam by 10 pm having been marching rapidly for twelve hours my bed and tent came up two hours later and not before the leeches and mosquitos had taxed me severely on the 4th of october i heard the nightingale for the first time this season  expecting dr campbell on the following morning i proceeded down the river to meet him the whole valley was buried under a torrent or debacle of mud shingle and boulders and for half a mile the stream was dammed up into a deep lake amongst the gneiss and granite boulders brought down by this debacle i collected some actinolites but all minerals are extremely rare in sikkim and i never heard of a gem or crystal of any size or beauty or of an ore of any consequence being found in this country  i met my friend on the other side of the mud torrent and i was truly rejoiced to see him though he was looking much the worse for his trying journey through the hot valleys at this season in fact i know no greater trial of the constitution than the exposure and hard exercise that is necessary in traversing these valleys below 5000 feet in the rainy season delay is dangerous and the heat anxiety and bodily suffering from fatigue insects and bruises banish sleep and urge the restless traveller onward to higher and more healthy regions dr campbell had i found in addition to the ordinary dangers of such a journey met with an accident which might have proved serious his pony having been dashed to pieces by falling over a precipice a fate he barely escaped himself by adroitly slipping from the saddle when he felt the animals foot giving way  on our way back to choongtam he detailed to me the motives that had led to his obtaining the authority of the deputygovernor of bengal lord dalhousie being absent for his visiting sikkim foremost was his earnest desire to cultivate a better understanding with the rajah and his officers he had always taken the rajahs part from a conviction that he was not to blame for the misunderstandings which the sikkim officers pretended to exist between their country and dorjiling he had whilst urgently remonstrating with the rajah insisted on forbearance on my part and had long exercised it himself in detailing the treatment to which i was subjected i had not hesitated to express my opinion that the rajah was more compromised by it than his dewan dr campbell on the contrary knew that the dewan was the head and front of the whole system of annoyance in one point of view it mattered little who was in the right but the transaction was a violation of good faith on the part of the sikkim government towards the british for which the rajah however helpless was yet responsible to act upon my representations alone would have been unjust and no course remained but for dr campbell to inquire personally into the matter the authority to do this gave him also the opportunity of becoming acquainted with the country which we were bound to protect as well by our interest as by treaty but from which we were so jealously excluded that should any contingency occur we were ignorant of what steps to take for defence and indeed of what we should have to defend  on the 6th of october we left choongtam for my second visit to the kongra lama pass hoping to get round by the cholamoo lakes and the donkia pass as the country beyond the frontier was uninhabited the tchebu lama saw no difficulty in this provided the lachen phipun and the tibetans did not object our great obstacle was the singtam soubah who by the rajahs order accompanied us to clear the road and give us every facility but who was very sulky and undisguisedly rude to campbell he was in fact extremely jealous of the lama who held higher authority than he did and who alone had the rajahs confidence  our first days march was of about ten miles to one of the riverflats which was covered with wild appletrees whose fruit when stewed with sugar we found palatable the lachen river though still swollen was comparatively clear the rains usually ceasing or at least moderating in october its water was about 5 degrees colder than in the beginning of august  during the second days march we were stopped at the taktoong river by the want of a bridge which the singtam soubah refused to exert himself to have repaired its waters were however so fallen that our now large party soon bridged it with admirable skill we encamped the second night on chateng and the following day made a long march crossing the zemu and ascending halfway to tallum samdong the alpine foliage was rapidly changing colour and that of the berberry turning scarlet gave a warm glow to the mountain above the forest lamteng village was deserted turnips were maturing near the houses and buckwheat on the slope behind the latter is a wintercrop at lower elevations and harvested in april at zemu samdong the willowleaves were becoming sear and yellow and the rosebushes bore enormous scarlet hips two inches long and covered with bristles they were sweet and rather good eating near tungu where we arrived on the 9th the great sikkim currant was in fruit its berries are much larger than the english and of the same beautiful red colour but bitter and very acid they are however eaten by the tibetans who call them kewdemah  near the village i found dr campbell remonstrating with the lachen phipun on the delays and rude treatment i had received in june and july the man of course answered every question with falsehoods which is the custom of these people and produced the rajahs orders for my being treated with every civility as a proof that he must have behaved as he ought the singtam soubah as was natural hung back for it was owing to him alone that the orders had been contravened and the phipun appealed to the bystanders for the truth of this  the phipun accompanied by his larpun or subordinate officer had prepared for us a sumptuous refreshment of tea soup which was brewing by the road and in which all animosities were soon washed away we took up our abode at tungu in a wooden but under the great rock where we were detained for several days by bad weather i was assured that during all august and september the weather had been uniformly gloomy as at momay though little rain had fallen  we had much difficulty in purchasing a sufficient number of blankets these were made of goats wool teazed into a satiny surface by little teazlelike brushes of bamboo for our people and in arranging for our journey to which the lachen phipun was favourable promising us ponies for the expedition the vegetation around was wholly changed since my july visit the rhododendron scrub was verdigrisgreen from the young leaves which burst in autumn and expose at the end of each branchlet a flowerbud covered with resinous scales which are thrown off in the following spring the jungle was spotted yellow with the withered birch maple and mountainash and scarlet with berberry bushes while above the pastures were yellowbrown with the dead grass and streaked with snow  amongst other luxuries we procured the flesh of yak calves which is excellent veal we always returned the foot for the mother to lick while being milked without which she yields nothing the yak goes nine months with calf and drops one every two years bearing altogether ten or twelve the common sikkim cow of lower elevations at dorjiling invariably goes from nine and a half to ten months and calves annually ponies go eleven months and foal nearly every year in tibet the sheep are annually sheared the ewes drop their young in spring and autumn but the lambs born at the latter period often die of cold and starvation and double lambing is unknown whereas in the plains of bengal where however sheep cannot be said to thrive without pulse fodder twins are constantly born at dorjiling the sheep drop a lamb once in the season the tibetan mutton we generally found dry and stringy  in these regions many of my goats and kids had died foaming at the mouth and grinding their teeth and i here discovered the cause to arise from their eating the leaves of rhododendron cinnabarinum the poisonous honey produced by other species is alluded to at vol i chapter ix an andromeda and a gualtheria i have been assured are equally deleterious kema kechoong lepcha kema signifying rhododendron this species alone is said to be poisonous and when used as fuel it causes the face to swell and the eyes to inflame of which i observed several instances as the subject of firewood is of everyday interest to the traveller in these regions i may here mention that the rhododendron woods afford poor fires juniper burns the brightest and with least smoke abies webbiana though emitting much smoke gives a cheerful fire far superior to larch the larch of northern asia larix europoea is said to produce a pungent smoke which i never observed to be the case with the sikkim species spruce or abies brunoniana at dorjiling oak is the common fuel alder is also good chestnut is invariably used for blacksmiths charcoal magnolia has a disagreeable odour and laurel burns very badly  the phenomenon of phosphorescence is most conspicuous on stacks of firewood at dorjiling during the damp warm summer months may to october at elevations of 5000 to 8000 feet it may be witnessed every night by penetrating a few yards into the forestat least it was so in 1848 and 1849 and during my stay there billets of decayed wood were repeatedly sent to me by residents with inquiries as to the cause of their luminosity it is no exaggeration to say that one does not need to move from the fireside to see this phenomenon for if there is a partially decayed log amongst the firewood it is almost sure to glow with a pale phosphoric light a stack of firewood collected near my hosts mr hodgson cottage presented a beautiful spectacle for two months in july and august and on passing it at night i had to quiet my pony who was always alarmed by it the phenomenon invariably accompanies decay and is common on oak laurel tetranthera birch and probably other timbers it equally appears on cut wood and on stumps but is most frequent on branches lying close to the ground in the wet forests i have reason to believe that it spreads with great rapidity from old surfaces to freshly cut ones that it is a vital phenomenon and due to the mycelium of a fungus i do not in the least doubt for i have observed it occasionally circumscribed by those black lines which are often seen to bound mycelia on dead wood and to precede a more rapid decay i have often tried but always in vain to coax these mycelia into developing some fungus by placing them in damp rooms etc when camping in the mountains i frequently caused the natives to bring  phosphorescent wood into my tent for the pleasure of watching its soft undulating light which appears to pale and glow with every motion of the atmosphere but except in this difference of intensity it presents no change in appearance night after night alcohol heat and dryness soon dissipate it electricity i never tried it has no odour and my dog who had a fine sense of smell paid no heed when it was laid under his nose as far as my observations go this phenomenon of light is confined to the lower orders of vegetable life to the fungi alone and is not dependent on irritability i have never seen luminous flowers or roots nor do i know of any authenticated instance of such which may not be explained by the presence of mycelium or of animal life in the animal kingdom luminosity is confined i believe to the invertebrata and is especially common amongst the radiata and mollusca it is also frequent in the entromostracous crustacea and in various genera of most orders of insects in all these even in the sertulariae i have invariably observed the light to be increased by irritation in which respect the luminosity of animal life differs from that of vegetable  the weather continuing bad and snow falling the country people began to leave for their winterquarters at lamteng in the evenings we enjoyed the company of the phipun and tchebu lama who relished a cup of sugarless tea more than any other refreshment we could offer from them we collected much tibetan informationthe former was an inveterate smoker using a pale mild tobacco mixed largely with leaves of the small wild tibetan rhubarb called chula snuff is little used and is principally procured from the plains of india  we visited palung twice chiefly in hopes that dr campbell might see the magnificent prospect of kinchinjhow from its plains the first time we gained little beyond a ducking but on the second october the 15th the view was superb and i likewise caught a glimpse of kinchinjunga from the neighbouring heights bearing south 60 degrees west and distant forty miles i also measured barometrically the elevation at the great chait on the plains and found it 15620 feet and by carefully boiled thermometers 15283 on the 13th october and 15566 on the 15th the difference being due to the higher temperature on the latter day and to a rise of 03 degree on both boilingpoint thermometers above what the same instruments stood at on the 13th the elevation of tungu from the october barometrical observations was only seven feet higher than that given by those of july the respective heights being 12766 feet in july and 12773 in october the elevation of tungu by boilingpoint was 12650 feet by a set of july observations 12818 by a set taken on the 11th of october and 12544 by a set on the 14th of october the discrepancies were partly due to the temperature corrections but mainly to the readings of the thermometers which were july 28 sunset 1895 air 473 degrees elev 12650 oct 11 noon   1895 air 376 degrees elev 12818 oct 14 sunset 1901 air 453 degrees elev 12544 the mean temperature had fallen from 50 degrees in july to 41 degrees and that of the sunk thermometer from 57 degrees to 514 degrees the mean range in july was 233 degrees and in october 138 degrees the weather during the latter period being however uniformly cold and misty this was much below the mean monthly range which probably exceeds 30 degrees much more rain fell in october at tungu than at dorjiling which is the opposite to what occurs during the rainy season  october 15th having sent the coolies forward with instructions to halt and camp on this side of the kongra lama pass we followed them taking the route by palung and thence over the hills to the lachen to the east of which we descended and further up its valley joined the advanced party in a rocky glen called sitong an advantageous camping ground from being sheltered by rocks which ward off the keen blasts its elevation is 15370 feet above the sea and the magnificent west cliff of kinchinjhow towers over it not a mile distant bearing due east and subtending an angle of 243 degrees the afternoon was misty but at 7 pm the southeast wind fell and was immediately succeeded by the biting north return current which dispelled the fog hoarfrost sparkled on the ground and the moon shone full on the snowy head of kinchinjhow over which the milkyway and the broad flashing orbs of the stars formed a jewelled diadem the night was very windy and cold though the thermometer fell no lower than 22 degrees that placed in a polished parabolic reflector to 20 degrees and another laid on herbage to 175 degrees  on the 16th we were up early i felt very anxious about the prospect of our getting round by donkia pass and cholamoo which would enable me to complete the few remaining miles of my long survey of the teesta river and which promised immense results in the views i should obtain of the country and of the geology and botany of these lofty snowless regions campbell though extremely solicitous to obtain permission from the tibetan guard who were waiting for us on the frontier was nevertheless bound by his own official position to yield at once to their wishes should they refuse us a passage  the sun rose on our camp at 730 am when the north wind fell and within an hour afterwards the temperature had risen to 45 degrees having had our sticks it was an invariable custom of our lepcha and tibetan attendants to warm the handles of our sticks in cold weather before starting on our daily marches this is one of many little instances i could adduce of their thoughtfulness and attention to the smallest comforts of the stranger and wanderer in their lands warmed and handed to us we started on ponies accompanied by the lama only to hold a parley with the tibetans ordering the rest of the party to follow at their leisure we had not proceeded far when we were joined by two tibetan sepoys who on our reaching the pass bellowed lustily for their companions when campbell and the lama drew up at the chait of kongra lama and announced his wish to confer with their commandant  my anxiety was now wound up to a pitch i saw men with matchlocks emerging from amongst the rocks under chomiomo and despairing of permission being obtained i goaded my pony with heels and stick and dashed on up the lachen valley resolved to make the best of a splendid day and not turn back till i had followed the river to the cholamoo lakes the sepoys followed me a few paces but running being difficult at 16000 feet they soon gave up the chase  a few miles ride in a northeast direction over an open undulating country brought me to the lachen flowing westwards in a broad open stony valley bounded by kinchinjhow on the south its face being as precipitous as that on the opposite side and on the north by the peukathlo a low range of rocky sloping mountains of which the summits were 18000 to 19000 feet above the sea enormous erratic blocks of gneiss strewed the ground which was sandy or gravelly and cut into terraces along the shallow winding river the green and sparkling waters of which rippled over pebbles or expanded into lagoons the already scanty vegetation diminished rapidly it consisted chiefly of scattered bushes of a dwarf scrubby honeysuckle and tufts of nettle both so brittle as to be trodden into powder and the short leafless twiggy ephedra a few inches higher the most alpine rhododendron r nivale spread its small rigid branches close to the ground the hemispherical arenaria another type of sterility rose here and there and tufts of myosotis artemisia astragali and adrosace formed flat cushions level with the soil grass was very scarce but a running wiry sedge carex moorcroftii bound the sand like the carex arenaria of our english coasts  a more dismally barren country cannot well be conceived nor one more strongly contrasting with the pastures of palung at an equal elevation the long lofty wall of kinchinjhow and donkia presents an effectual barrier to the transmission of moisture to the head of the lachen valley which therefore becomes a type of such elevations in tibet as i proceeded the ground became still more sandy chirping under the ponys feet and where harder it was burrowed by innumerable marmots foxes and the goomchen or tailless rat lagomys badius sounding hollow to the tread and at last becoming so dangerous that i was obliged to dismount and walk  the geological features changed as rapidly as those of the climate and vegetation for the strike of the rocks being northwest and the dip northeast i was rising over the strata that overlie the gneiss the upper part of kinchinjhow is composed of bold icecapped cliffs of gneiss but the long spurs that stretch northwards from it are of quartz conglomerates slates and earthy red clays forming the rounded terraced hills i had seen from donkia pass between these spurs were narrow valleys at whose mouths stupendous blocks of gneiss rest on rocks of a much later geological formation  opposite the most prominent of these spurs the river 16800 feet above the sea runs west forming marshes which were full of zannichellia palustris and ranunculus aquatilis both english and siberian plants the waters contained many shells of a species of lymnaea this is the most alpine living shell in the world my specimens being from nearly 17000 feet elevation it is the lymnaea hookeri reeve proceedings of the zoological society no 204 and the soil near the edge which was covered with tufts of short grass was whitened with effloresced carbonate of soda here were some square stone enclosures two feet high used as pens and for pitching tents in within them i gathered some unripe barley  beyond this i recognised a hill of which i had taken bearings from donkia pass and a few miles further on rounding a great spur of kinchinjunga i arrived in sight of cholamoo lakes with the donkia mountain rearing its stupendous precipices of rock and ice on the east my pony was knocked up and i felt very giddy from the exertion and elevation i had broken his bridle and so led him on by my plaid for the last few miles to the banks of the lake and there with the pleasant sound of the waters rippling at my feet i yielded for a few moments to those emotions of gratified ambition which being unalloyed by selfish considerations for the future become springs of happiness during the remainder of ones life  the landscape about cholamoo lakes was simple in its elements stern and solemn and though my solitary situation rendered it doubly impressive to me i doubt whether the world contains any scene with more sublime associations than this calm sheet of water 17000 feet above the sea with the shadows of mountains 22000 to 24000 feet high sleeping on its bosom  there was much short grass about the lake on which large antelopes chiru antilope hodgsoni i found the horns of this animal on the south side of the donkia pass but i never saw a live one except in tibet the procapra is described by mr hodgson bengal as soc jour 1846 p 388 and is introduced into the cut in this chapter and deer goa procapra picticaudata hodgson were feeding there were also many slatecoloured hales with white rumps lepus oiostolus with marmots and tailless rats the abundance of animal life was wonderful compared with the want of it on the south side of donkia pass not five miles distant in a straight line it is partly due to the profusion of carbonate of soda of which all ruminants are fond and partly to the dryness of the climate which is favourable to all burrowing quadrupeds a flock of common english teal were swimming in the lake the temperature of  which was 55 degrees  illustrationantelopes head the accompanying figures of the heads of the chiru antilope hodgsoni were sketched by lieut maxwell of the bengal artillery from a pair brought to dorjiling it is the socalled unicorn of tibet and of mm huc and gabets narrativea name which the profile no doubt suggested  i had come about fifteen miles from the pass and arrived at 1 pm remaining half an hour i could not form an idea as to whether campbell had followed or not and began to speculate on the probability of passing the night in the open air by the warm side of my steed though the sun shone brightly the wind was bitterly cold and i arrived at the stone dykes of yeumtso at 3 pm quite exhausted with fatigue and headache i there found to my great relief the tchebu lama and lachen phipun they were in some alarm at my absence for they thought i was not aware of the extreme severity of the temperature on the north side of the snows or of the risk of losing my way they told me that after a long discourse with the dingpun or commander of the tibetan sepoys the latter had allowed all the party to pass that the sepoys had brought on the coolies who were close behind but that they themselves had seen nothing of campbell of whom the lama then went in search  the sun set behind chomiomo at 5 pm and the wind at once dropped so local are these violent atmospheric currents which are caused by the heating of the upper extremities of these lofty valleys and consequent rarefaction of the air intense terrestrial radiation immediately follows the withdrawal of the suns rays and the temperature sinks rapidly  soon after sunset the lama returned bringing campbell who having mistaken some glacierfed lakes at the back of kinchinjhow for those of cholamoo was looking for me he too had speculated on having to pass the night under a rock with one plaid for himself and servant in which case i am sure they would both have been frozen to death having no pony to lie down beside he told me that after i had quitted kongra lama leaving him with the tchebu lama and phipun the dingpun and twenty men came up and very civilly but formally forbade their crossing the frontier but that upon explaining his motives and representing that it would save him ten days journey the dingpun had relented and promised to conduct the whole party to the donkia pass  we pitched our little tent in the corner of the cattlepen and our coolies soon afterwards came up mine were in capital health though suffering from headaches but campbells were in a distressing state of illness and fatigue with swollen faces and rapid pulses and some were insensible from symptoms like pressure on the brain i have never experienced bleeding at the nose ears lips or eyelids either in my person or that of my companions on these occasions nor did i ever meet with a recent traveller who has dr thomson has made the same remark and when in switzerland together we were assured by auguste balmat francois coutet and other experienced mont blanc guides that they never witnessed these symptoms nor the blackness of the sky so frequently insisted upon by alpine travellers these were chiefly ghorkas nepalese the tibetan dingpun and his guard arrived last of all he was a droll little object short fat deeply marked with smallpox swarthy and greasy he was robed in a green woollen mantle and was perched on the back of a yak which also carried his bedding and cooking utensils the latter rattling about its flanks horns neck and every point of support two other yaks bore the tents of the party his followers were tall savage looking fellows with broad swarthy faces and their hair in short pigtails they wore the longsleeved cloak short trousers and boots all of thick woollen and felt caps on their heads each was armed with a long matchlock slung over his back with a moveable rest having two prongs like a fork and a hinge so as to fold up along the barrel when the prongs project behind the shoulders like antelope horns giving the uncouth warrior a droll appearance a dozen cartridges each in an iron case were slung round the waist and they also wore the long knife flint steel and iron tobaccopipe pouch and purse suspended to a leathern girdle  the night was fine but intensely cold and the vault of heaven was very dark and blazing with stars the sir was electrical and flash lightning illumined the sky this was the reflection of a storm that was not felt at dorjiling but which raged on the plains of india beyond the terai fully 120 miles and perhaps 150 south of our position no thunder was heard the thermometer fell to 5 degrees and that in the reflector to 35 degrees at sunrise it rose to 10 degrees and soon after 8 am to 33 degrees till this hour the humidity was great and a thin mist hung over the frozen surface of the rocky ground when this dispersed the air became very dry and the blackbulb thermometer in the sun rose 60 degrees above the temperature in the shade the light of the sun though sometimes intercepted by vapours aloft was very brilliant my black glass photometer shut out the suns disc at 10509 inches from the mean of four sets of observations taken between 7 and 10 am  this being the migrating season swallows flitted through the air finches larches and sparrows were hopping over the sterile soil seeking food though it was difficult to say what the geese an enormous quantity of waterfowl breed in tibet including many indian species that migrate no further north the natives collect their eggs for the markets at jigatzi giantchi and lhassa along the banks of the yarn river ramchoo and yarbru and dochen lakes amongst other birds the sara or great crane of india see turners tibet p 212 repairs to these enormous elevations to breed the fact of birds characteristic of the tropics dwelling for months in such climates is a very instructive one and should be borne in mind in our speculations upon the climate supposed to be indicated by the imbedded bones of birds which had roosted by the river cackled the wild ducks quacked and plumed themselves ouzels and waders screamed or chirped and all rejoiced as they prepared themselves for the last flight of the year to the valleys of the southern himalaya to the teesta and other rivers of the terai and plains of india  the dingpun paid his respects to us in the morning wearing besides his green cloak a white cap with a green glass button denoting his rank he informed us that he had written to his superior officer at kambajong explaining his motives for conducting us across the frontier and he drew from his breast a long letter written on daphne most of the paper used in tibet is as i have elsewhere noticed made from the bark of various species of daphneae and especially of edgeworthia gardneri and is imported from nepal and bhotan but the tibetans as mm huc and gabet correctly state manufacture a paper from the root of a small shrub this i have seen and it is of a much thicker texture and more durable than daphne paper dr thomson informs me that a species of astragalus is used in western tibet for this purpose the whole shrub which is dwarf being reduced to pulp paper whose ends were tied with floss silk with a large red seal this he pompously delivered with whispered orders to an attendant and sent him off he admired our clothes extremely all tibetans admire sad value english broadcloth beyond any of our products woollen articles are very familiar to them and warm clothing is one of the first requisites of life and then my percussion gun the first he had seen but above all he admired rum and water which he drank with intense relish leaving a mere sip for his comrades at the bottom of his little wooden cup which they emptied and afterwards licked clean and replaced in his breast for him we made a large basin full of very weak grog for his party who were all friendly and polite and having made us the unexpected offer of allowing us to rest ourselves for the day at yeumtso he left us and practised his men at firing at a mark but they were very indifferent shots  i ascended with campbell to the lake he had visited on the previous day about 600 or 800 feet above yeumtso and 17500 feet above the sea it is a mile and a half long and occupies a large depression between two rounded spurs being fed by glaciers from kinchinjhow the rocks of these spurs were all of red quartz and slates cut into broad terraces covered with a thick glacial talus of gneiss and granite in angular pebbles and evidently spread over the surface when the glacier now occupying the upper end of the lake extended over the valley  the ice on the cliffs and summit of kinchinjhow was much greener and clearer than that on the south face opposite palung and rows of immense icicles hung from the cliffs a conferva grew in the waters of the lake and short hard tufts of sedge on the banks but no other plants were to be seen brahminee geese teal and widgeon were swimming in the waters and a beetle elaphrus was coursing over the wet banks finches and other small birds were numerous eating the sedgeseeds and picking up the insects no view was obtained to the north owing to the height of the mountains on the north flank of the lachen  at noon the temperature rose to 525 degrees and the blackbulb to 1045 degrees whilst the northwest dusty wind was so dry that the dewpoint fell to 242 degrees   chapter xxiv  ascent of bhomtsoview of snowy mountainschumulariarun riverkianglah mountainsjigatzilhamadingcham province of tibetmisapplication of term plain of

afternoon we crossed the valley and ascended bhomtso fording the river whose temperature was 48 degrees some stupendous boulders of gneiss from kinchinjhow are deposited in a broad sandy track on the north bank by ancient glaciers which once crossed this valley from kinchinjhow  the ascent was alternately over steep rocky slopes and broad shelflike flats many more plants grew here than i had expected in inconspicuous scattered tufts besides those before mentioned there were fescuegrass festuca ovina of scotland a strongscented silky wormwood artemisia and round tufts of oxytropis chiliophylla a kind of astralagus that inhabits eastern and western tibet this alone was green it formed great circles on the ground the centre decaying and the annual shoots growing outwards and thus constantly enlarging the circle a woolly leontopodium androsace and some other plants assumed nearly the same mode of growth the rest of the vegetation consisted of a sedum nardostachys jatamansi meconopsis horridula a slender androsace gnaphalium stipa salvia draba pedicularis potentilla or sibbaldia gentiana and erigeron alpinus of scotland all these grow nearly up to 18000 feet the rocks were nearly vertical strata of quartz hornstone and conglomerate striking northwest and dipping southwest 80 degrees the broad top of the hill was also of quartz but covered with angular pebbles of the rocks transported from kinchinjhow some claystone fragments were stained red with oxide of iron and covered with parmelia miniata this minute lichen mentioned at chapter xxxii is the most arctic antarctic and alpine in the world often occurring so abundantly as to colour the rocks of an orange red this was the case at bhomtso and is so also in cockburn island in the antarctic ocean which it covers so profusely that the rocks look as if brightly painted see rosss voyage vol ii p 339 this with borrera another lichen which forms stringy masses blown along by the wind were the only plants and they are among the most alpine in the world  bhomtso is 18590 feet above the sea by barometer and 18305 by boilingpoint it presented an infinitely more extensive prospect than i had ventured to anticipate commanding all the most important sikkim north bhotan and tibetan mountains including kinchinjunga thirtyseven miles to the southwest and chumulari thirtynine miles southeast due south across the sandy valley of the lachen kinchinjhow reared its long wall of glaciers and rugged precipices 22000 feet high and under its cliffs lay the lake to which we had walked in the morning beyond kongra lama were the thlonok mountains where i had spent the month of june with kinchinjunga in the distance westward chomiomo rose abruptly from the rounded hills we were on to 22000 feet elevation ten miles distant to the east of kinchinjhow were the cholamoo lakes with the rugged mass of donkia stretching in cliffs of ice and snow continuously southwards to forked donkia which overhung momay samdong  a long sloping spur sweeps from the north of donkia first north and then west to bhomtso rising to a height of more than 20000 feet without snow over this spur the celebrated chumulari some doubt still hangs over the identity of this mountain chiefly owing to turners having neglected to observe his geographical positions i saw a much loftier mountain than this bearing from bhomtso north 87 degrees east and it was called chumulari by the tibetan sepoys but it does not answer to turners description of an isolated snowy peak such as he approached within three miles and though in the latitude he assigned to it is fully sixty miles to the east of his route a peak similar to the one he describes is seen from tonglo and sinchul see vol i chapters v and viii this is the one alluded to above and it is identified by both tibetans and lepchas at dorjiling as the true chumulari and was measured by colonel waugh who placed it in lat 27 degrees 49 minutes north long 89 degrees 18 minutes east the latter position though fifteen miles south of what turner gives it is probably correct as pemberton found that turner had put other places in bhotan twenty miles too far north moreover in saying that it is visible from purnea in the plains of bengal turner refers to kinchinjunga whose elevation was then unknown dr campbell bengal as soc jour 1848 describes chumulari from oral information as an isolated mountain encircled by twentyone goompas and perambulated by pilgrims in five days the lachoong phipun on the other hand who was a lama and well acquainted with the country affirmed that chumulari has many tops and cannot be perambulated but that detached peaks near it may be and that it is to a temple near one of these that pilgrims resort again the natives use these names very vaguely and as that of kinchinjunga is often applied equally to all or any part of the group of snows between the lachen and tambur rivers so may the term chumulari have been used vaguely to captain turner or to me i have been told that an isolated snowtopped venerated mountain rises about twenty miles south of the true chumulari and is called sakyakhang sakyas snowy mountain which may be that seen from dorjiling but i incline to consider campbells and waughs mountain as the one alluded to by turner and it is to it that i here refer as bearing north 115 degrees 30 minutes east from bhomtso peeps bearing southeast and from its isolated position and sharpness looking low and small it appeared quite near though thirtynine miles distant  northeast of chumulari and far beyond it are several meridional ranges of very much loftier snowy mountains which terminated the view of the snowy himalaya the distance embraced being fully 150 miles and perhaps much more of one of these eastern masses these are probably the ghassa mountains of turners narrative bearings which i took of one of the loftiest of them from the khasia mountains together with those from bhomtso would appear to place it in latitude 28 degrees 10 minutes and longitude 90 degrees and 200 miles from the former station and 90 degrees east of the latter its elevation from bhomtso angles is 24160 feet i presume i also saw chumulari from the khasia the most western peak seen thence being in the direction of that mountain captain r strachey has most kindly paid close attention to these bearings and distances and recalculated the distances and heights no confidence is however to be placed in the results of such minute angles taken from immense distances owing in part no doubt to extraordinary refraction the angles of the ghassa mountain taken from the khasia give it an elevation of 26500 feet which is very much over the truth and make that of chumulari still higher the distance from my position in the khasia being 210 miles from chumulari which is probably the utmost limit at which the human eye has ever discerned a terrestrial object i afterwards took bearings and angular heights from the khasia mountains in bengal upwards of 200 miles southeast of its position  turning to the northward a singular contrast in the view was presented the broad sandy valley of the arun lay a few miles off and perhaps 1500 feet below me low brown and red ridges 18000 to 19000 feet high of stony sloping mountains with rocky tops divided its feeders which appeared to be dry and to occupy flat sandy valleys for thirty miles north no mountain was above the level of the theodolite and not a particle of snow was to be seen beyond that rugged purpleflanked and snowytopped mountains girdled the horizon appearing no nearer than they did from the donkia pass and their angular heights and bearings being almost the same as from that point of view the nearer of these are said to form the kianglah chain the furthest i was told by different authorities are in the salt districts north of jigatzi  to the northeast was the lofty region traversed by turner on his route by the ramchoo lakes to teshoo loombo its elevation may be 17000 feet it is somewhat remarkable that turner nowhere alludes to difficulty of breathing and in one place only to headache p 209 when at these great elevations this is in a great measure accounted for by his having been constantly mounted i never suffered either in my breathing head or stomach when riding even when at 18300 feet above the sea beyond it a gorge led through rugged mountains by which i was told the painom river flows northwest to the yaru and at an immense distance to the northeast were the khamba mountains a long blue range which it is said divides the lhassan or u from the tsang or jigatzi province of tibet it appeared fully 100 miles off and was probably much more it bore from n 57 degrees e to n 70 degrees e and though so lofty as to be heavily snowed throughout was much below the horizonline of bhomtso it is crossed on the route from jigatzi and from sikkim to lhassa lhassa which lies northeast may be reached in ten days from this with relays of ponies many mountains are crossed where the breath is affected and few villages are passed after leaving giantchi the jhansi jeung of turners narrative see campbells routes from dorjiling to lhassa bengal as soc journal and is considered very lofty from affecting the breathing about twenty miles to the northeast are some curious red conical mountains said to be on the west side of the ramchoo lakes they were unsnowed and bore n 45 degrees 30 minutes e and n 60 degrees 30 minutes e a sparinglysnowed group bore n 26 degrees 30 minutes e and another n 79 degrees e the latter being probably that mentioned by turner as seen by him from near giantchi  but the mountains which appeared both the highest and the most distant on the northern landscape were those i described when at donkia as being north of nepal and beyond the arun river and the culminant peak of which bore n 55 degrees both dr campbell and i made repeated estimates of its height and distance by the eye comparing its size and snowlevel with those of the mountains near us and assuming 4000 to 5000 feet as the minimum height of its snowy cap this would give it an elevation of 23000 to 25000 feet an excellent telescope brought out no features on its flanks not visible to the naked eye and by the most careful levellings with the theodolite it was depressed more than 0 degrees 7 minutes below the horizon of bhomtso whence the distance must be above 100 miles  the transparency of the paleblue atmosphere of these lofty regions can hardly be described nor the clearness and precision with which the most distant objects are projected against the sky from having afterwards measured peaks 200 and 210 miles distant from the khasia mountains i feel sure that i underrated the estimates made at bhomtso and i have no hesitation in saying that the mean elevation of the sparinglysnowed were the snowlevel in dingcham as low as it is in sikkim the whole of tibet from donkia almost to the yarutsampu river would be everywhere intersected by glaciers and other impassable barriers of snow and ice for a breadth of fifty miles and the country would have no parallel for amount of snow beyond the polar circles it is impossible to conjecture what would have been the effects on the climate of northern india and central asia under these conditions when however we reflect upon the evidences of glacial phenomena that abound in all the himalayan valleys at and above 9000 feet elevation it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that such a state of things once existed and that at a comparatively very recent period watershed between the yaru and the arun will be found to be greater than that of the snowy himalaya south of it and to follow the chain running from donkia north of the arun along the kianglah mountains towards the nepal frontier at tingri maidan no part of that watershed perhaps rises so high as 24000 feet but its lowest elevation is probably nowhere under 18000 feet  this broad belt of lofty country north of the snowy himalaya is the dingcham province of tibet and runs along the frontier of sikkim bhotan and nepal it gives rise to all the himalayan rivers and its mean elevation is probably 15000 to 15500 feet its general appearance as seen from greater heights is that of a much less mountainous country than the snowy and wet himalayan regions this is because its mean elevation is so enormous that ranges of 20000 to 22000 feet appear low and insignificant upon it the absence of forest and other obstructions to the view the breadth and flatness of the valleys and the undulating character of the lower ranges that traverse its surface give it a comparatively level appearance and suggest the term maidan or plains to the tibetan when comparing his country with the complicated ridges of the deep sikkim valleys here one may travel for many miles without rising or falling 3000 feet yet never descending below 14000 feet partly because the flat winding valleys are followed in preference to exhausting ascents and partly because the passes are seldom more than that elevation above the valleys whereas in sikkim rises and descents of 6000 and even 9000 feet are common in passing from valley to valley sometimes in one days march  the swarthy races of dingcham have been elsewhere described they are an honest hospitable and very hardy people differing from the northern tibetans chiefly in colour and in invariably wearing the pigtail which mm huc and gabet assure us is not usual in lhassa amongst lhassan customs alluded to by these travellers is that of the women smearing their faces with a black pigment the object of which they affirm to be that they may render themselves odious to the male sex and thus avoid temptation the custom is common enough but the real object is to preserve the skin which the dry cold wind peels from the face the pigment is muttonfat blackened according to tchebu lama with catechu and other ingredients but i believe more frequently by the dirt of the face itself i fear i do not slander the tibetan damsels in saying that personal cleanliness and chastity are both lightly esteemed amongst them and as the lama naively remarked when questioned on the subject the tibetan women are not so different from those of other countries as to wish to conceal what charms they possess they are a pastoral race and campbell saw a flock of 400 hornless sheep grazing on short sedges carex and fescuegrass in the middle of october at 18000 feet above the sea an enormous ram attended the flock whose long hair hung down to the ground its back was painted red  there is neither tree nor shrub in this country and a very little wheat which seldom ripens barley turnips and radishes are i believe the only crops except occasionally peas other legumes cabbages etc are cultivated in the sheltered valleys of the yaru feeders where great heat is reflected from the rocks and there also stunted trees grow as willows walnuts poplars and perhaps ashes all of which however are said to be planted and scarce even at teshoo loombo and jigatzi digarchi jigatzi or shigatzi jong the fort of shigatzi is the capital of the tsang province and teshoo loombo is the neighbouring city of temples and monasteries the ecclesiastical capital of tibet and the abode of the grand teshoo lama or everliving boodh whether we estimate this man by the number of his devotees or the perfect sincerity of their worship he is without exception one of the most honoured beings living in the world i have assumed the elevation of jigatzi to be 1314000 feet using as data turners october mean temperature of teshoo loombo and the decrement for elevation of 400 feet to 1 degree fahr which my own observations indicate as an approximation to the truth humboldt asie centrale iii p 223 uses a much smaller multiplier and infers the elevation of teshoo loombo to be between 9500 and 10000 feet our data are far too imperfect to warrant any satisfactory conclusions on this interesting subject but the accounts i have received of the vegetation of the yaru valley at jigatzi seem to indicate an elevation of at least 13000 feet for the bed of that river of the elevation of lhassa itself we have no idea if mm huc and gabets statement of the rivers not being frozen there in march be correct the climate must be very different from what we suppose buckwheat is a rare crop and only a prostrate very hardy kind is grown clay teapots and pipkins are the most valuable exports to sikkim from the latter city after salt and soda jewels and woollen cloaks are also exported the latter especially from giantchi which is famous for its woollen fabrics and mart of ponies  of the yaru river at jigatzi which all affirm becomes the burrampooter in assam i have little information to add to turners description it is sixty miles north of bhomtso and i assume its elevation to be 1314000 feet the yaru which approaches the nepal frontier west of tingri and beyond the great mountain described at vol i chapter xi makes a sweep to the northward and turns south to jigatzi whence it makes another and greater bend to the north and again turning south flows west of lhassa receiving the kechoo river from that holy city from jigatzi it is said to be navigable to near lhassa by skin and plankbuilt boats thence it flows southeast to the assam frontier and while still in tibet is said to enter a warm climate where tea silk cotton and rice are grown of its course after entering the assam himalaya little is known and in answer to my enquiries why it had not been followed i was always told that the country through which it flowed was inhabited by tribes of savages who live on snakes and vermin and are fierce and warlike these are no doubt the singpho bor and borabor tribes who inhabit the mountains of upper assam a travelling mendicant was once sent to follow up the dihong to the burrampooter under the joint auspices of mr hodgson and major jenkins the commissioner of assam but the poor fellow was speared on the frontier by these savages the concurrent testimony of the assamese that the dihong is the yaru on its southern course to become the burrampooter renders this point as conclusively settled as any resting on mere oral evidence is likely to be it takes an immense bend to the northward after passing jigatzi and again turns south flowing to the west of lhassa and at some distance from that capital lhassa as all agree is at a much lower elevation than jigatzi and apricots whose ripe stones dr campbell procured for me and walnuts are said to ripen there and the dama or himalayan furze caragana is said to grow there the bactrian camel also thrives and breeds at lhassa together with a small variety of cow not the yak both signs of a much more temperate climate than jigatzi enjoys it is however a remarkable fact that there are two tame elephants near the latter city kept by the teshoo lama they were taken to jigatzi through bhotan by phari and i have been informed that they have become clothed with long hair owing to the cold of the climate but tchebu lama contradicted this adding that his countrymen were so credulous that they would believe blankets grew on the elephants backs if the lamas told them so  no village or house is seen throughout the extensive area over which the eye roams from bhomtso and the general character of the desolate landscape was similar to that which i have described as seen from donkia pass chapter xxii the wild ass this the equus hemionus of pallas the untameable kiang of tibet abounds in dingcham and we saw several it resembles the ass more than the horse from its size heavy head small limbs thin tail and the stripe over the shoulder the flesh is eaten and much liked the kianglah mountains are so named from their being a great resort of this creature it differs widely from the wild ass of persia sind and beloochistan but is undoubtedly the same as the siberian animal grazing with its foal on the sloping downs the hare bounding over the stony soil the antelope scouring the sandy flats and the fox stealing along to his burrow are all desert and tartarian types of the animal creation the shrill whistle of the marmot alone breaks the silence of the scene recalling the snows of lapland to the mind the kite and raven wheel through the air 1000 feet over head with as strong and steady a pinion as if that atmosphere possessed the same power of resistance that it does at the level of the sea still higher in the heavens long black vshaped trains of wild geese cleave the air shooting over the glaciercrowned top of kinchinjhow and winging their flight in one day perhaps from the yaru to the ganges over 500 miles of space and through 22000 feet of elevation one plant alone the yellow lichen borrera is found at this height and only as a visitor for tartarlike it emigrates over these lofty slopes and ridges blown about by the violent winds i found a small beetle on the very top i observed a small red acarus mite at this elevation both on donkia and kinchinjhow which reminds me that i found a species of the same genus at cockburn island in latitude 64 degrees south longitude 64 degrees 49 minutes west this genus hence inhabits a higher southern latitude than any other land animal attains probably blown up also for it was a flowerfeeder and seemed benumbed with cold  every night that we spent in tibet we enjoyed a magnificent display of sunbeams converging to the east and making a false sunset i detailed this phenomenon when seen from the kymore mountains and i repeatedly saw it again in the khasia but never in the sikkim himalaya whence i assume that it is most frequent in mountain plateaus as the sun set broad purple beams rose from a dark low leaden bank on the eastern horizon and spreading up to the zenith covered the intervening space they lasted through the twilight from fifteen to twenty minutes fading gradually into the blackness of night i looked in vain for the beautiful lancet beam of the zodiacal light its position was obscured by chomiomo  on the 18th of october we had another brilliant morning after a cold night the temperature having fallen to 4 degrees i took the altitude of yeumtso by carefully boiling two thermometers and the result was 16279 feet the barometrical observations giving 16808 feet i removed a thermometer sunk three feet in the gravelly soil which showed a temperature of 43 degrees it had risen to 435 degrees during the previous day which is 127 degrees above the mean temperature of the two days we camped here  our fires were made of dry yak droppings which soon burn out with a fierce flame and much black smoke they give a disagreeable taste to whatever is cooked with them  having sent the coolies forward to cholamoo lake we reascended bhomtso to verify my observations as on the previous occasion a violent dry northwest wind blew peeling the skin from our faces loading the air with grains of sand and rendering theodolite observations very uncertain besides injuring all my instruments and exposing them to great risk of breakage  the tibetan sepoys did not at all understand our ascending bhomtso a second time they ran after campbell who was ahead on a stout pony girding up their long garments bracing their matchlocks tight over their shoulders and gasping for breath at every step the long horns of their muskets bobbing up and down as they toiled amongst the rocks when i reached the top i found campbell seated behind a little stone wall which he had raised to keep off the violent wind and the uncouth warriors in a circle round him puzzled beyond measure at his admiration of the view my instruments perplexed them extremely and in crowding round me they broke my azimuth compass they left us to ourselves when the fire i made to boil the thermometers went out the wind being intensely cold i had given my barometer to one of campbells men to carry who not coming up the latter kindly went to search for him and found him on the ground quite knocked up and stupified by the cold and there if left alone he would have lain till overtaken by death  the barometer on the summit of bhomtso stood at 15548 inches the elevation of bhomtso worked by bessels tables and using corrected observations of the calcutta barometer for the lower station is 18590 feet the corresponding dewpoint 44 degrees 496 degrees below that of the air at the time of observation by oltmanns tables the elevation is 18540 feet the elevation by boiling water is 18305 the temperature between 1130 am and 230 pm fluctuated between 44 degrees and 56 degrees this was very high for so great an elevation and no doubt due to the power of the sun on the sterile soil and consequent radiated heat the tension of vapour was 0763 and the dewpoint was 58 degrees or 435 degrees below the temperature of the air such extraordinary dryness the weight of vapour in a cubic foot of air was no more than 087 of a grain and the saturationpoint 208 and consequent evaporation increased by the violent wind sufficiently accounts for the height of the snow line in further evidence of which i may add that a piece of ice or snow laid on the ground here does not melt but disappears by evaporation  the difference between the dry cold air of this elevation and that of the heated plains of india is very great during the driest winds of the terai in spring the temperature is 80 degrees to 90 degrees the tension of vapour is 400 to 500 with a dewpoint 22 degrees below the temperature and upwards of six grains of vapour are suspended in the cubic foot of air a thick haze obscures the heavens and clouds of dust rise high in the air here on the other hand probably owing to the rarity of the atmosphere and the low tension of its vapours the drought is accompanied by perfect transparency and the atmosphere is too attenuated to support the dust raised by the wind  we descended in the afternoon and on our way up the lachen valley examined a narrow gulley in a lofty red spur from kinchinjhow where black shales were in situ striking northeast and dipping northwest 45 degrees these shales were interposed between beds of yellow quartz conglomerate upon the latter of which rested a talus of earthy rocks angular fragments of which were strewed about opposite this spur but were not seen elsewhere  it became dark before we reached the cholamoo lake where we lost our way amongst glaciers moraines and marshes we expected to have seen the lights of the camp but were disappointed and as it was freezing hard we began to be anxious and shouted till the echos of our voices against the opposite bank were heard by tchebu lama who met us in great alarm for our safety our camp was pitched some way from the shore on a broad plain 16900 feet above the sea this which is about the level of the lake gives the lachen river a fall of about 1500 feet between its source and kongra lama or sixty feet per mile following its windings from kongra lama to tallum it is 140 feet per mile from tallum to singtam 160 feet and from singtam to the plains of india 50 feet per mile the total fall from cholamoo lake to its exit on the plains of india is eightyfive feet per mile its length following its windings is 195 miles upwards of double the direct distance a cold wind descended from donkia yet though more elevated than yeumtso the climate of cholamoo from being damper and misty was milder the minimum thermometer fell to 14 degrees  before starting for donkia pass on the following morning we visited some black rocks which rose from the flat to the east of the lake they proved to be of fossiliferous limestone the strata of which were much disturbed the strike appeared in one part northwest and the dip northeast 45 degrees a large fault passed east by north through the cliff and it was further cleft by joints running northwards the cliff was not 100 yards long and was about 70 thick its surface was shivered by frost into cubical masses and glacial boulders of gneiss lay on the top the limestone rock was chiefly a blue pisolite conglomerate with veins and crystals of white carbonate of lime seams of shale and iron pyrites a part was compact and blue very crystalline and full of encrinitic fossils and probably nummulites but all were too much altered for determination  this from its mineral characters appears to be the same limestone formation which occurs throughout the himalaya and western tibet but the fossils i collected are in too imperfect a state to warrant any conclusions on this subject its occurrence immediately to the northward of the snowy mountains and in such very small quantities are very remarkable facts the neighbouring rocks of donkia were gneiss with granite veins also striking northwest and dipping northeast 10 degrees as if they overlay the limestone but here as in all similar situations there was great confusion of the strata and variation in direction and strike  and here i may once for all confess that though i believe the general strike of the rocks on this frontier to be northwest and the dip northeast i am unable to affirm it positively for though i took every opportunity of studying the subject and devoted many hours to the careful measuring and recording of dips and strikes on both faces of kinchinjhow donkia bhomtso and kongra lama i am unable to reduce these to any intelligible system northwest is the prevalent strike in kumaon the northwest himalaya generally and throughout western tibet kashmir etc according to dr thomson  the coolies of dr campbells party were completely knocked up by the rarified air they had taken a whole day to march here from yeumtso scarcely six miles and could eat no food at night a lama of our party offered up prayers all diseases are attributed by the tibetans to the four elements who are propitiated accordingly in cases of severe illness the winds are invoked in cases of affections of the breathing fire in fevers and inflammations water in dropsy and diseases whereby the fluids are affected and the god of earth when solid organs are diseased as in livercomplaints rheumatism etc propitiatory offerings are made to the deities of these elements but never sacrifices to kinchinjhow for the recovery of a stout lepcha lad called nurko who showed no signs of animation and had all the symptoms of serous apoplexy the lama perched a saddle on a stone and burning incense before it scattered rice to the winds invoking kinchin donkia and all the neighbouring peaks a strong dose of calomel and jalap which we poured down the sick lads throat contributed materially to the success of these incantations  the tibetan sepoys were getting tired of our delays which so much favoured my operations but though showing signs of impatience and sulkiness they behaved well to the last taking the sick man to the top of the pass on their yaks and assisting all the party nothing however would induce them to cross into sikkim which they considered as companys territory  before proceeding to the pass i turned off to the east and reascended donkia to upwards of 19000 feet vainly hoping to get a more distant view and other bearings of the tibetan mountains the ascent was over enormous piles of loose rocks split by the frost and was extremely fatiguing i reached a peak overhanging a steep precipice at whose base were small lakes and glaciers from which flowed several sources of the lachen afterwards swelled by the great affluent from cholamoo lake a few rocks striking northeast and dipping northwest projected at the very summit with frozen snow amongst them beyond which the ice and precipices rendered it impossible to proceed but though exposed to the north there was no perpetual snow in the ordinary acceptation of the term and an arctic european lichen lecidea oreina grew on the top so faintly discolouring the rocks as hardly to be detected without a magnifyingglass  i descended obliquely down a very steep slope of 35 degrees over upwards of a thousand feet of debris the blocks on which were so loosely poised on one another that it was necessary to proceed with the utmost circumspection for i was alone and a false step would almost certainly have been followed by breaking a leg the alternate freezing and thawing of rain amongst these masses must produce a constant downward motion in the whole pile of debris which was upwards of 2000 feet high and may account for the otherwise unexplained phenomenon of continuous shoots of angular rocks reposing on very gentle slopes in other places may not the origin of the streams of quartz blocks that fill gently sloping broad valleys several miles long in the falkland islands be thus explained see darwins journal in murrays home and col lib the extraordinary shifting in the position of my thermometer left among the rocks of the donkia pass see chapter xxii and the mobile state of the slopes i descended on this occasion first suggested this explanation to me when in the falkland islands i was wholly unable to offer any explanation of the phenomenon there to which my attention had been drawn by mr darwins narrative  the north ascent to the donkia pass is by a path well selected amongst immense angular masses of rock and over vast piles of debris the strike on this the north face was again northeast and dip northwest i arrived at the top at 3 pm throughly fatigued and found my faithful lepcha lads cheytoong and bassebo nestling under a rock with my theodolite and barometers having been awaiting my arrival in the biting wind for three hours my pony stood there too the picture of patience and laden with minerals after repeating my observations i proceeded to momay samdong where i arrived after dusk i left a small bottle of brandy and some biscuits with the lads and it was well i did so for the pony knocked up before reaching momay and rather than leave my bags of stones they passed the night by the warm flank of the beast under a rock at 18000 feet elevation without other food fire or shelter  i found my companion encamped at momay on the spot i had occupied in september he had had the utmost difficulty in getting his coolies on as they threw down their light loads in despair and lying with their faces to the ground had to be roused from a lethargy that would soon have been followed by death  we rested for a day at momay and on the 20th attempted to ascend to the donkia glacier but were driven back by a heavy snowstorm the scenery on arriving here presented a wide difference to that we had left snow lying at 16500 feet whereas immediately to the north of the same mountain there was none at 19000 feet before leaving momay i sealed two small glass flasks containing the air of this elevation by closing with a spirit lamp a very fine capillary tube which formed the opening to each avoiding the possibility of heating the contents by the hand or otherwise the result of its analysis by mr muller who sent me the prepared flasks was that it contained 36538 per cent in volume of oxygen whereas his repeated analysis of the air of calcutta gives 21 per cent such a result is too anomalous to be considered satisfactory  i again visited the kinchinjhow glacier and hot springs the water had exactly the same temperature as in the previous month though the mean temperature of the air was 8 degrees or 9 degrees lower the minimum thermometer fell to 22 degrees being 10 degrees lower than it ever fell in september  we descended to yeumtong in a cold drizzle arriving by sunset we remained through the following day hoping to explore the lower glacier on the opposite side of the valley which however the weather entirely prevented i have before mentioned chapter xxiii that in descending in autumn from the drier and more sunny rearward sikkim valleys the vegetation is found to be most backward in the lowest and dampest regions on this occasion i found asters grasses polygonums and other plants that were withered brown and seeding at momay 14000 to 15000 feet at yeumtong 12000 feet green and unripe and 2000 feet lower still at lachoong the contrast was even more marked thus the short backward spring and summer of the arctic zone is overtaken by an early and forward seedtime and winter so far as regards the effects of mean temperature the warmer station is in autumn more backward than the colder this is everywhere obvious in the prevalent plants of each and is especially recognisable in the rhododendrons as the following table shows 16000 to 17000 feet r nivale flowers in july fruits in september2 months 13000 to 14000 feet r anthopogon flowers in june fruits in oct4 months 11000 to 12000 feet r campanulatum flowers in may fruits in nov8 months 8000 to 9000 feet r argenteum flowers in april fruits in dec8 months  and so it is with many species of compositae and umbelliferae and indeed of all natural orders some of which i have on the same day gathered in ripe fruit at 13000 to 14000 feet and found still in flower at 9000 to 10000 feet the brighter skies and more powerful and frequent solar radiation at the greater elevations account for this apparent inversion of the order of nature the distribution of the seasons at different elevations in the himalaya gives rise to some anomalies that have puzzled naturalists from the middle of october to that of may vegetation is torpid above 14000 feet and indeed almost uniformly covered with snow from november till the middle of april vegetation is also torpid above 10000 feet except that a few trees and bushes do not ripen all their seeds till december the three winter months december january and february are all but dead above 6000 feet the earliest appearance of spring at dorjiling 7000 feet being at the sudden accession of heat in march from may till august the vegetation at each elevation is in ascending order a month behind that below it 4000 feet being about equal to a month of summer weather in one sense i mean by this that the genera and natural orders and sometimes the species which flower at 8000 feet in may are not so forward at 12000 feet till june nor at 16000 feet till july after august however the reverse holds good then the vegetation is as forward at 16000 feet as at 8000 feet by the end of september most of the natural orders and genera have ripened their fruit in the upper zone though they have flowered as late as july whereas october is the fruiting month at 12000 and november below 10000 feet dr thomson does not consider that the more sunny climate of the loftier elevations sufficiently accounts for this and adds the stimulus of cold which must act by checking the vegetative organs and hastening maturation  i was disappointed at finding the rhododendron seeds still immature at yeumtong for i was doubtful whether the same kinds might be met with at the chola pass which i had yet to visit besides which their tardy maturation threatened to delay me for an indefinite period in the country viburnum and lonicera however were ripe and abundant the fruits of both are considered poisonous in europe but here the black berries of a species of the former called nalum are eatable and agreeable as are those of a gualtheria which are pale blue and called kalumbo except these and the cherry mentioned above there are no other autumnal fruits above 10000 feet brambles strange as it may appear do not ascend beyond that elevation in the sikkim himalaya though so abundant below it both in species and individuals and though so typical of northern europe  at lachoong we found all the yaks that had been grazing till the end of september at the higher elevations and the phipun presented our men with one of a gigantic size and proportionally old and tough the lepchas barbarously slaughtered it with arrows and feasted on the flesh and entrails singed and fried the skin and made soup of the bones leaving nothing but the horns and hoofs having a fine day they prepared some as jerked meat cutting it into thin strips which they dried on the rocks this called schatchew dried meat is a very common and favourite food in tibet i found it palatable but on the other hand the dried saddles of mutton of which they boast so much taste so strongly of tallow that i found it impossible to swallow a morsel of them raw dried split fish are abundantly cured without salt in tibet they are caught in the yaru and great lakes of ramchoo dobtah and yarbru and are chiefly carp and allied fish which attain a large size it is one of the most remarkable facts in the zoology of asia that no trout or salmon inhabits any of the rivers that debouche into the indian ocean the socalled himalayan trout is a species of carp this widely distributed natural order of fish salmonidae is however found in the oxus and in all the rivers of central asia that flow north and west and the salmo orientalis mclelland calcutta journ nat hist iii p 283 was caught by mr griffith journals p 404 in the bamean river north of the hindo koosh which flows into the oxus and whose waters are separated by one narrow mountain ridge from those of the feeders of the indus the central himalayan rivers often rise in tibet from lakes full of fish but have none at least during the rains in that rapid part of their course from 10000 to 14000 feet elevation below that fish abound but i believe invariably of different species from those found at the sources of the same rivers the nature of the tropical ocean into which all the himalayan rivers debouche is no doubt the proximate cause of the absence of salmonidae sir john richardson fishes of china seas etc in brit ass rep etc says that no species of the order has been found in the chinese or eastern asiatic seas  we staid two days at lachoong two of my lads being again laid up with fever one of them had been similarly attacked at the same place nearly two months before the other lad had been repeatedly ill since june and at all elevations both cases were returns of a fever caught in the low unhealthy valleys some months previously and excited by exposure and hardship  the vegetation at lachoong was still beautiful and the weather mild though snow had descended to 14000 feet on tunkra compositae were abundantly in flower apples in young fruit bushes of cotoneaster covered with scarlet berries and the brushwood silvery with the feathery heads of clematis  i here found that i had lost a thermometer for high temperatures owing to a hole in the bag in which cheytoong carried those of my instruments which were in constant use it had been last used at the hot springs of the kinchinjhow glacier and the poor lad was so concerned at his mishap that he came to me soon afterwards with his blanket on his back and a few handfuls of rice in a bag to make his salaam before setting out to search for it there was not now a single inhabitant between lachoong and that dreary spot and strongly against my wish he started without a companion three days afterwards he overtook us at keadom radiant with joy at having found the instrument he had gone up to the hot springs and vainly sought around them that evening then rather than lose the chance of a daylight search on his way back he had spent the cold october night in the hot water without fire or shelter at 16000 feet above the sea next morning his search was again fruitless and he was returning disconsolate when he descried the brass case glistening between two planks of the bridge crossing the river at momay over which torrent the instrument was suspended the lepchas have generally been considered timorous of evil spirits and especially averse to travelling at night even in company however little this gallant lad may have been given to superstition he was nevertheless a lepcha born in a warm region and had never faced the cold till he became my servant and it required a stout heart and an honest one to spend a night in so awful a solitude as that which reigns around the foot of the kinchinjhow glacier the fondness of natives for hot springs wherever they occur is very natural and has been noticed by humboldt pers narr iv 195 who states that on christianity being introduced into iceland the natives refused to be baptised in any but the water of the geysers i have mentioned at chapter xxii the uses to which the yeumtong hot springs are put and the custom of using artificial hot baths is noticed at vol i chapter xiii  the villagers at keadom where we slept on the 26th were busy cutting the crops of millet maize and amaranthus a girl who on my way down the previous month had observed my curiosity about a singular variety of the maize had preserved the heads on their ripening and now brought them to me the peaches were all gathered and though only half ripe were better than dorjiling produce a magnificent tree of bucklandia one of the most beautiful evergreens in sikkim grew near this village it had a trunk twentyone feet seven inches in girth at five feet from the ground and was unbranched for forty feet this superb tree is a great desideratum in our gardens i believe it would thrive in the warm west of england its wood is brown and not valuable as timber but the thick bright glossy evergreen foliage is particularly handsome and so is the form of the crown it is also interesting in a physiological point of view from the woody fibre being studded with those curious microscopic discs so characteristic of pines and which when occurring on fossil wood are considered conclusive as to the natural family to which such woods belong geologists should bear in mind that not only does the whole natural order to which bucklandia belongs possess this character but also various species of magnoliaceae found in india australia borneo and south america ferns and the beautiful airplant coelogyne wallichii grew on its branches with other orchids while clematis and stauntonia climbed the trunk such great names buckland staunton and wallich thus brought before the travellers notice never failed to excite lively and pleasing emotions it is the ignorant and unfeeling alone who can ridicule the association of the names of travellers and naturalists with those of animals and plants  we arrived at choongtam for the fourth time at noon and took up our quarters in a good house near the temple the autumn and winter flowering plants now prevailed here such as labiatae which are generally late at this elevation and grasses which though rare in the damp forest regions are so common on these slopes that i here gathered twentysix kinds i spent a day here in order to collect seeds of the superb rhododendrons these rhododendrons are now all flourishing at kew and elsewhere they are r dalhousiae arboreum maddeni edgeworthii aucklandii and virgatum which i had discovered in may growing on the hills behind the ascent was now difficult from the length of the wiry grass which rendered the slopes so slippery that it was impossible to ascend without holding on by the tussocks  a ragged tibetan mendicant phud was amusing the people he put on a black mask with cowrie shells for eyes and danced uncouth figures with a kind of heel and toe shuffle in excellent time to rude tibetan songs of his own for this he received ample alms which a little boy collected in a wallet these vagrants live well upon charity they bless curse and transact little affairs of all kinds up and down the valleys of sikkim and tibet this one dealt in red clay teapots sheep and puppies  we found meepo at choongtam i had given him leave when here last to go back to the rajah and to visit his wife and he had returned with instructions to conduct me to the chola and yakla passes in eastern sikkim these passes like that of tunkra chapter xxii lead over the chola range to that part of tibet which is interposed between sikkim and bhotan my road lay past the rajahs residence which we considered very fortunate as apparently affording campbell an opportunity of a conference with his highness for which both he and the tchebu lama were most anxious  on the way down the lachenlachoong we found the valley still flooded as described at chapters xviii and xxiii and the alders standing with their trunks twelve feet under water but the shingle dam was now dry and hard it would probably soften and be carried away by the first rains of the following year i left here the temperate flora of northern sikkim tropical forms commencing to appear of these the nettle tribe were most numerous in the woods a large grape with beautiful clusters of round purple berries was very fair eating it is not the common vine of europe which nevertheless is probably an himalayan plant the vitis indica the origin of the common grape being unknown it becomes a curious question to decide whether the himalayan vitis indica is the wild state of that plant an hypothesis strengthened by the fact of bacchus etc having come from the east  illustrationtibetan phud   at chakoong the temperature of the river which in may was 54 degrees was now 515 degrees at 3 pm we did not halt here but proceeded to namgah a very long and fatiguing march thence a short march took us to singtam which we reached on the 30th of october the road by which i had come up was for half the distance obliterated in most parts by landslips i took a number of dips and strikes of the micaceous rocks the strike of these was as often northeast as northwest it was ever varying and the strata were so disturbed as materially to increase the number and vast dimensions of the landslips but they were hard and dry and the leeches were gone  bad weather and campbells correspondence with the durbar who prevented all communication with the rajah detained us here two days after which we crossed to the teesta valley and continued along its east bank to tucheam 2000 feet above the river we obtained a magnificent view of the east face of kinchinjunga its tops bearing respectively n 62 degrees w and n 63 degrees w the south slope of the snowed portion in profile was 34 degrees and of the north 40 degrees but both appeared much steeper to the eye when unaided by an instrument  the great shrubby nettle urtica crenulata is common here this plant called mealumma attains fifteen feet in height it has broad glossy leaves and though apparently without stings is held in so great dread the stinging hairs are microscopic and confined to the young shoots leaf and flowerstalks leschenault de la tour describes being stung by this nettle on three fingers of his hand only at the calcutta botanical gardens and the subsequent sneezing and running at the nose followed by tetanic symptoms and two days suffering nor did the effects disappear for nine days it is a remarkable fact that the plant stings violently only at this season i frequently gathered it with impunity on subsequent occasions and suspected some inaccuracy in my observations but in silhet both dr thomson and i experienced the same effects in autumn endlicher lindleys vegetable kingdom attributes the causticity of nettlejuice to bicarbonate of ammonia which dr thomson and i ascertained was certainly not present in this species that i had difficulty in getting help to cut it down i gathered many specimens without allowing any part to touch my skin still the scentless effluvium was so powerful that mucous matter poured from my eyes and nose all the rest of the afternoon in such abundance that i had to hold my head over a basin for an hour the sting is very virulent producing inflammation and to punish a child with mealumma is the severest lepcha threat violent fevers and death have been said to ensue from its sting but this i very much doubt  illustrationtibetan implements teapot cup and brick of tea knife tobaccopipe across chopsticks pouch and flintandsteel

sikkim durbar dr campbell sending tchebu lama forward with letters to announce his approach a steep ascent through large trees of rhododendron arboreum led over a sharp spur of micaschist strike northwest and dip northeast beyond which the whole baylike valley of the ryott opened before us presenting one of the most lovely and fertile landscapes in sikkim it is ten miles long and three or four broad flanked by lofty mountains and its head girt by the beautiful snowy range of chola from which silvery rills descend through black pinewoods dividing innumerable converging cultivated spurs and uniting about 2000 feet below us in a profound gorge everywhere were scattered houses purple crops of buckwheat green fields of young wheat yellow millet broad green plantains and orange groves  we crossed spur after spur often under or over precipices about fifteen hundred feet above the river proceeding eastwards to the village of rangang whence we caught sight of the rajahs house it was an irregular low stone building of tibetan architecture with slanting walls and small windows high up under the broad thatched roof above which in the middle was a chineselooking square coppergilt canopy with projecting eaves and bells at the corners surmounted by a ball and square spire on either gable of the roof was a roundtopped cylinder of gilded copper something like a closed umbrella this is a very frequent and characteristic boodhist ornament and is represented in turners plate of the mausoleum of teshoo lama tibet plate xi indeed the rajahs canopy at tumloong is probably a copy of the upper part of the building there represented having been built by architects from teshoo loombo it was surrounded by chaits mendongs poles with banners and other religious erections and though beautifully situated on a flat terrace overlooking the valley we were much disappointed with its size and appearance  on the brow of the hill behind was the large red goompa of the tupgain lama the late heirapparent to the temporal and spiritual authority in sikkim and near it a nunnery called lagong the lady abbess of which is a daughter of the rajah who with the assistance of sisters keeps an enormous mani or prayingcylinder revolving perpetually to the prayer of om mani padmi hom on this side was a similar spur on which the gilded pinnacles and copper canopy of the phadong phadong means royal and this temple answers to a chapel royal for the rajah goompa gleamed through the trees at a considerable distance across the head of the valley was still a third goompa that of phenzong  we were met by a large party of armed lepchas dressed in blue and white striped kirtles broad loose scarlet jackets and the little bamboo wattle hat lined with talc and surmounted by a peacocks feather they escorted us to the village and then retired  we encamped a few hundred feet below the rajahs house and close by those of meepo and the tchebu lamas family who are among the oldest and most respectable of tibetan origin in sikkim the population on this the north side of the ryott consists principally of sikkim bhoteeas and tibetans while the opposite is peopled by lepchas crowds came to see us and many brought presents with which we were overwhelmed but we could not help remarking that our cordial greetings were wholly from the older families attached to the rajah and from the lamas none proceeded from the dewans relatives or friends nor therefore any in the name of the rajah himself or of the sikkim government  tchebu lama vainly used every endeavour to procure for us an audience with his highness who was surrounded by his councillors or amlah all of whom were adherents of the dewan who was in tibet my man meepo and the tchebu lama who were ordered to continue in official attendance upon us shrugged their shoulders but could suggest no remedy on the following morning campbell was visited by many parties amongst whom were the lamas family and that of the late dewan ilam sing who implored us to send again to announce our presence and not to dismiss at once the moonshie and his office it is usual in india for government officers when about to transact business to travel with a staff called office of native interpreters clerks etc of whom the chief is commonly called moonchie who had accompanied us for the purpose of a conference with the rajah their wishes were complied with and we waited till noon before proceeding  illustrationtchebu lama  a gay and animated scene was produced by the concourse of women dressed in their pretty striped and crossed cloaks who brought tokens of goodwill amongst them meepos wife appeared conspicuous from the large necklaces the lumps of amber forming these called poshea were larger than the fist they are procured in east tibet probably from birmah and amulets corals and silver filagree work with which her neck and shoulders were loaded she wore on her head a red tiara patuk bedizened with seed pearls and large turquoises and a gold fillet of filagree bosses united by a web of slender chains her long tails were elaborately plaited and woven with beads and her cloak hooked in front by a chain of broad silver links studded with turquoises white silk scarfs the emblem of peace and friendship were thrown over our hands by each party and rice eggs fowls kids goats and murwa beer poured in apace to the great delight of our servants  we returned two visits of ceremony one to meepos house a poor cottage to which we carried presents of chintz dresses for his two little girls who were busy teazing their hair with cylindrical combs formed of a single slender joint of bamboo slit all round halfway up into innumerable teeth our other visit was paid to the lamas family who inhabited a large house not far from the rajahs the lower story was an area enclosed by stone walls into which the cattle etc were driven an outside stone stair led to the upper story where we were received by the head of the family accompanied by a great concourse of lamas he conducted us to a beautiful little oratory at one end of the building fitted up like a square temple and lighted with latticed windows covered with brilliant and tasteful paintings by lhassan artists the beams of the ceiling were supported by octagonal columns painted red with broad capitals everywhere the lotus the mani and the chirki or wheel with three rays emblematic of the boodhist trinity were introduced om mani padmi hom in gilt letters adorned the projecting end of every beam a mythical animal with a dogs head and bloodred spot over the forehead was not uncommon in this chapel and is also seen in the sikkim temples and throughout tibet ermann in his siberian travels mentions it as occurring in the khampa lamas temple at maimao chin he conjectures it to have been the cyclops of the greeks which according to the homeric myth had a mark on the forehead instead of an eye the glory surrounding the heads of tibetan deities is also alluded to by ermann who recognises in it the nimbus of the ancients used to protect the heads of statues from the weather and from being soiled by birds and adds that the glory of the ancient masters in painting was no doubt introduced into the byzantine school from the boodhists and the chinese cloud messenger or winged dragon floated in azure and gold along the capitals and beams amongst scrolls and groups of flowers at one end was a sitting figure of gorucknath in lama robes surrounded by a glory with mitre and beads the right hand holding the dorje and the forefinger raised in prayer around was a good library of books more presents were brought here and tea served  illustrationclasp of a womans cloak  the route to chola pass which crosses the range of that name south of the chola peak 17320 feet at the head of this valley is across the ryott and then eastwards along a lofty ridge campbell started at noon and i waited behind with meepo who wished me to see the rajahs dwelling to which we therefore ascended but to my guides chagrin we were met and turned back by a scribe or clerk of the amlah we were followed by a messenger apologising and begging me to return but i had already descended 1000 feet and felt no inclination to reascend the hill especially as there did not appear to be anything worth seeing soon after i had overtaken campbell he was accosted by an excessively dirty fellow who desired him to return for a conference with the amlah this was of course declined but at the same time campbell expressed his readiness to receive the amlah at our halting place  the ryott flows in a very tropical gorge 2000 feet above the sea from the proximity of the snowy mountains its temperature was only 643 degrees thence the ascent is very steep to rungpo where we took up our quarters at a rest house at an height of 6008 feet this road is well kept and hence onwards is traversed yearly by the rajah on his way to his summer residence of choombi two marches beyond the chola pass whither he is taken to avoid the sikkim rains which are peculiarly disagreeable to tibetans rungpo commands a most beautiful view northwards across the valley of the royal residence temples goompas hamlets and cultivation scattered over spurs that emerge from the forest studded below with treeferns and plantains and backed by black pinewoods and snowy mountains in the evening the amlah arrived to confer with campbell at first there was a proposal of turning us out of the house in which there was plenty of room besides but as we declined to move except by his highnesss order they put up in houses close by  on the following morning they met us as we were departing for chola pass bringing large presents in the name of the rajah and excuses on their and his part for having paid us no respect at tumloong saying that it was not the custom to receive strangers till after they had rested a day that they were busy preparing a suitable reception etc this was all false and contrary to etiquette but there was no use in telling them so campbell spoke firmly and kindly to them and pointed out their incivility and the unfriendly tone of their whole conduct they then desired campbell to wait and discuss business affairs with them this was out of the question and he assured them that he was ever ready to do so with the rajah that he was now as he had informed his highness on his way with me to the chola and yakla passes and that we had for want of coolies left some loads behind us which if they were really friendly they would forward this they did and so we parted they contrary to expectation making no objection to campbells proceeding with me  a long march up a very steep narrow ridge took us by a good road to laghep a stone restinghouse alt 10475 feet on a very narrow flat i had abundance of occupation in gathering rhododendronseeds of which i procured twentyfour kinds these occurred in the following order in ascending commencing at 6000 feet1 r dalhousiae 2 r vaccinioides 3 r camelliaeflorwm 4 r arboreum above 8000 feet5 r argenteum 6 r falconeri 7 r barbatum 8 r campbelliae 9 r edgeworthii 10 r niveum 11 r

wightianum 23 r anthopogon 24 r setosum on this and the following day  a very remarkable plant which i had seen in flower in the lachen valley called loodooma by the bhoteeas and nomorchi by lepchas grew on the ridge at 7000 feet it bears a yellow fruit like short cucumbers full of a soft sweet milky pulp and large black seeds it belongs to a new genus this genus for which dr thomson and i in our flora indies have proposed the name decaisnea in honour of my friend professor j decaisne the eminent french botanist has several straight sticklike erect branches from the root which bear spreading pinnated leaves two feet long standing out horizontally the flowers are unisexual green and in racemes and the fruits of which two or three grow together are about four inches long and one in diameter all the other plants of the natural order to which it belongs are climbers allied to stauntonia of which two himalayan kinds produce similar but less agreeable edible fruits kolepot lepcha at laghep iris was abundant and a small bushy berberry b concinna with oval eatable berries the north wall of the house which was in a very exposed spot was quite bare while the south was completely clothed with moss and weeds  the rocks above laghep were gneiss below it micaschist striking northwest and dipping northeast at a high angle a beautiful yellow poppylike plant grew in clefts at 10000 feet it has flowered in england from seeds which i sent home and bears the name of cathcartia see botanical magazine for 1852 the name was given in honour of the memory of my friend the late j f cathcart esq of the bengal civil service this gentleman was devoted to the pursuit of botany and caused a magnificent series of drawings of dorjiling plants to be made by native artists during his residence there this collection is now deposited at kew through the liberality of his family and it is proposed to publish a selection from the plates as a tribute to his memory mr cathcart after the expiration of his indian service returned to europe and died at lausanne on his way to england  we continued on the following morning in an easterly direction up the same narrow steep ridge to a lofty eminence called phieunggoong alt 12422 feet from being covered with the phieung or small bamboo abies webbiana begins here and continues onwards but as on tonglo mainom and the other outer wetter sikkim ranges there is neither larch pinus excelsa abies smithiana or a brunoniana  hence we followed an oblique descent of 1500 feet to the bed of the rutto river through thick woods of pines and rhododendron hodgsoni which latter on our again ascending was succeeded by the various alpine kinds we halted at barfonchen alt 11233 feet a stonebut in the silverfir forest some yaks were grazing in the vicinity and from their herdsman we learnt that the dewan was at choombi on the road to yakla he had kept wholly out of the way during the summer directing every unfriendly action to be pursued towards myself and the government by the amlah consisting of his brothers and relatives whom he left at tumloong  the night was brilliant and starlight the minimum thermometer fell to 27 degrees a strong northeast wind blew down the valley and there was a thick hoarfrost with which the black yaks were drolly powdered the broad leaves of r hodgsoni were curled from the expansion of the frozen fluid in the layer of cells on the upper surface of the leaf which is exposed to the greatest cold of radiation the sun restores them a little but as winter advances they become irrecoverably cured and droop at the ends of the branches  we left barfonchen on the 7th november and ascended the river near which we put up a woodcock emerging from the woods at chumanako alt 12590 feet where there is another stone hut the mountains become bleak bare and stony and the rocks are all moutonneed by ancient glaciers at 13000 feet the ground was covered with ice and all the streams were frozen crossing several rocky ledges behind which were small lakes a gradual ascent led to the summit of the chola pass a broad low depression 14925 feet above the sea wholly bare of snow  campbell had preceded me and i found him conversing with some tibetans who told him that there was no road hence to yakla and that we should not be permitted to go to choombi as the chinese guard was posted in the neighbourhood he accompanied one of the tibetans to see the commandant whilst i remained taking observations the temperature was 33 degrees with a violent biting dry east wind the rocks were gneiss striking northeast and horizontal or dipping northwest the scanty vegetation consisted chiefly of grass and sibbaldia  in about an hour meepo and some of my people came up and asked for campbell for whom the tchebu lama was waiting below the lama had remained at rungpo endeavouring to put matters on a better footing with the amlah wishing to see the tibet guard myself i accompanied the two remaining tibetans down a steep valley with cliffs on either hand for several hundred feet when i was overtaken by some sikkim sepoys in red jackets who wanted to turn me back forcibly i was at a loss to understand their conduct and appealed to the tibetan sepoys who caused them to desist about 1000 feet down i found campbell with a body of about ninety tibetans a few of whom were armed with matchlocks and the rest with bows and arrows they were commanded by a dingpun a short swarthy man with a flatcrowned cap with flosssilk hanging all round and a green glass button in front he wore a loose scarlet jacket broadly edged with black velvet and having great brass buttons of the indian naval uniform his subaltern was similarly dressed but his buttons were those of the 44th bengal infantry the commandant having heard of our wish to go round by choombi told campbell that he had come purposely to inform him that there was no road that way to yakla he was very polite ordering his party to rise and salute me when i arrived and doing the same when we both left  on our return we were accompanied by the dingpun of the tibetans and a few of his people and were soon met by more sikkim sepoys who said they were sent from the durbar to bring campbell back to transact business they behaved very rudely and when still half a mile from the sikkim frontier jostled him and feigned to draw their knives and one of them pointed a spearheaded bow to his breast campbell defended himself with a stick and remonstrated with them on their rudeness and i who had nothing but a barometer in my hand called up the tibetans the dingpun came instantly and driving the sikkim people forward escorted us to the frontier where he took an inscribed board from the chait and showing us the great vermilion seal of the emperor of china or more probably of the lhassan authorities on one side and two small brown ones of the sikkim rajah on the other and giving us to understand that here his jurisdiction ceased he again saluted and left us  on descending i was surprised to meet the singtam soubah whom i had not seen since leaving tungu he was seated on a rock and i remarked that he looked ashy pale and haggard and that he salaamed to me only and not to campbell and that tchebu lama who was with him seemed very uncomfortable the soubah wanted campbell to stop for a conference which at such a time and in such a wind was impossible so he followed us to chumanako where we proposed to pass the night  a great party of sikkim bhoteeas had assembled here all strangers to me i certainly thought the concourse unusually large and the previous conduct to campbell strange rude and quite unintelligible especially before the tibetans but the bhoteeas were always a queer and often insolent people captain pemberton during his mission to bhotan was repeatedly treated with the utmost insolence by the officials in that country see griffiths journal my sirdar nimbo himself a native of bhotan saw a good deal of the embassy when there and told me many particulars as to the treatment to which it had been subjected and the consequent low estimation in which both the ambassadors themselves and the government whom they represented were held in bhotan whom i was long ago tired of trying to understand and they might have wanted to show off before their neighbours and such was the confidence with which my long travels amongst them had inspired me that the possibility of danger or violence never entered my head  we went into the hut and were resting ourselves on a log at one end of it when the evening being very cold the people crowded in on which campbell went out saying that we had better leave the hut to them and that he would see the tents pitched he had scarcely left when i heard him calling loudly to me hooker hooker the savages are murdering me i rushed to the door and caught sight of him striking out with his fists and struggling violently being tall and powerful he had already prostrated a few but a host of men bore him down and appeared to be trampling on him at the same moment i was myself seized by eight men who forced me back into the hut and down on the log where they held me in a sitting posture pressing me against the wall here i spent a few moments of agony as i heard my friends stifled cries grow fainter and fainter i struggled but little and that only at first for at least fiveandtwenty men crowded round and laid their hands upon me rendering any effort to move useless they were however neither angry nor violent and signed to me to keep quiet i retained my presence of mind and felt comfort in remembering that i saw no knives used by the party who fell on campbell and that if their intentions had been murderous an arrow would have been the more sure and less troublesome weapon it was evident that the whole animus was directed against campbell and though at first alarmed on my own account all the inferences which with the rapidity of lightning my mind involuntarily drew were favourable  after a few minutes three persons came into the hut and seated themselves opposite to me i only recognised two of them namely the singtam soubah pale trembling like a leaf and with great drops of sweat trickling from his greasy brow and the tchebu lama stolid but evidently under restraint and frightened the former ordered the men to leave hold of me and to stand guard on either side and in a violently agitated manner he endeavoured to explain that campbell was a prisoner by the orders of the rajah who was dissatisfied with his conduct as a government officer during the past twelve years and that he was to be taken to the durbar and confined till the supreme government at calcutta should confirm such articles as he should be compelled to subscribe to he also wanted to know from me how campbell would be likely to behave i refused to answer any questions till i should be informed why i was myself made prisoner on which he went away leaving me still guarded my own sirdar then explained that campbell had been knocked down tied hand and foot and taken to his tent and that all his coolies were also bound our captors claiming them as sikkimites and subjects of the rajah  shortly afterwards the three returned the soubah looking more spectral than ever and still more violently agitated and i thought i perceived that whatever were his plans he had failed in them he asked me what view the governorgeneral would take of this proceeding and receiving no answer he went off with the tchebu lama and left me with the third individual the latter looked steadily at me for some time and then asked if i did not know him i said i did not when he gave his name as dingpun tinli and i recognised in him one of the men whom the dewan had sent to conduct us to the top of mainom the previous year see vol i chapter xiii this opened my eyes a good deal for he was known to be a righthand man of the dewans and had within a few months been convicted of kidnapping two brahmin girls from nepal this act as i have mentioned at v i chapter xv was not only a violation of the british treaty but an outrage on the religion of nepal jung bahadoor demanded instant restitution which campbell effected thus incurring the dingpuns wrath who lost besides his prize a good deal of money which the escapade cost him and had vowed vengeance against campbell for the duty he performed in bringing him to punishment  i was soon asked to go to my tent which i found pitched close by they refused me permission to see my fellowprisoner or to be near him but allowed me to hang up my instruments and arrange my collections my guards were frequently changed during the night lepchas often taking a turn they repeatedly assured me that there was no complaint or illfeeling against me that the better classes in sikkim would be greatly ashamed of the whole affair that tchebu lama was equally a prisoner and that the grievances against campbell were of a political nature but what they were they did not know  the night was very cold thermometer 26 degrees and two inches of snow fell i took as many of my party as i could into my tent they having no shelter fit for such an elevation 12590 feet at this season through the connivance of some of the people i managed to correspond with campbell who afterwards gave me the following account of the treatment he had received he stated that on leaving the hut he had been met by meepo who told him the soubah had ordered his being turned out a crowd of sepoys then fell on him and brought him to the ground knocked him on the head trampled on him and pressed his neck down to his chest as he lay as if endeavouring to break it his feet were tied and his arms pinioned behind the wrist of the right hand being bound to the left arm above the elbow the cords were then doubled and he was violently shaken the singtam soubah directed all this which was performed chiefly by the dingpun tinli and jongpun sangabadoo this was the other man sent with us to mainom by the dewan in the previous december after this the soubah came to me as i have related and returning had campbell brought bound before him and asked him through tchebu lama if he would write from dictation the soubah was violent excited and nervous tchebu lama scared campbell answered that if they continued torturing him which was done by twisting the cords round his wrists by a bamboowrench he might say or do anything but that his government would not confirm any acts thus extorted the soubah became still more violent shook his bow in campbells face and drawing his hand significantly across his throat repeated his questions adding others enquiring why he had refused to receive the lassoo kajee as vakeel etc see chapter xviii  the soubahs people meanwhile gradually slunk away seeing which he left campbell who was taken to his tent  early next morning meepo was sent by the soubah to ask whether i would go to yakla pass or return to dorjiling and to say that the rajahs orders had been very strict that i was not to be molested and that i might proceed to whatever passes i wished to visit whilst campbell was to be taken back to the durbar to transact business i was obliged to call upon the soubah and dingpun to explain their conduct of the previous day which they declared arose from no illfeeling but simply from their fear of my interfering in campbells behalf they could not see what reason i had to complain so long as i was neither hurt nor bound i tried in vain to explain to them that they could not so play fast and loose with a british subject and insisted that if they really considered me free they should place me with campbell under whose protection i considered myself he being still the governorgenerals agent  much discussion followed this meepo urged me to go on to yakla and leave these bad people and the soubah and dingpun who had exceeded their orders in laying hands on me both wished me away my course was however clear as to the propriety of keeping as close to campbell as i was allowed so they reluctantly agreed to take me with him to the durbar  tchebu lama came to me soon afterwards looking as stolid as ever but with a gulping in his throat he alone was glad i was going with them and implored me to counsel campbell not to irritate the amlah by a refusal to accede to their dictates in which case his life might be the forfeit as to himself the opposite faction had now got the mastery there was nothing for it but to succumb and his throat would surely be cut i endeavoured to comfort him with the assurance that they dared not hurt campbell and that this conduct of a party of ruffians influenced by the dewan and their own private pique did not represent his rajahs feelings and wishes as he himself knew but the poor fellow was utterly unnerved and shaking hands warmly with his eyes full of tears he took his leave  we were summoned by the dingpun to march at 10 am i demanded an interview with campbell first which was refused but i felt myself pretty safe and insisting upon it he was brought to me he was sadly bruised about the head arms and wrists walked very lame and had a black eye to boot but was looking stout and confident  i may here mention that seizing the representative of a neighbouring power and confining him till he shall have become amenable to terms is a common practice along the tibet sikkim and bhotan frontiers it had been resorted to in 1847 by the bhotanese under the instructions of the paro pilo who waylaid the sikkim rajah when still in tibet on his return from jigatzi and beleagured him for two months endeavouring to bring him to their terms about some border dispute on this occasion the rajah applied to the british government for assistance which was refused and he was ultimately rescued by a tibetan force  in the present case the dewan issued orders that campbell was to be confined at tumloong till he himself should arrive there and the rajah was kept in ignorance of the affair the sepoys who met us on our approach to tumloong on the 3rd of november were i suspect originally sent for the purpose and i think that the amlah also had followed us to rungpo with the same object their own extreme timidity and the general goodfeeling in the country towards campbell prevented its execution before and as a last resource they selected the singtam soubah and dingpun tinli for the office as being personally hostile to him the dewan meanwhile being in tibet and knowing that we were about to visit the frontier for which i had full permission and escort sent up the tibetan guard hoping to embroil them in the affair in this he failed and it drew upon him the anger of the lhassan authorities in the following summer 1850 when the rajah dewan and soubah repaired to choombi the lhassan authorities sent a commissioner to inquire into the affair understanding that the dewan had attempted to embroil the tibetans in it the commissioner asked the rajah why he had committed such an outrage on the representative of the british government under whose protection he was thus losing his territory and bringing english troops so near the tibet frontier the rajah answered that he never did anything of the kind that he was old and infirm and unable to transact all his affairs that the mischief had arisen out of the acts and ignorance of others and finally begged the commissioner to investigate the whole affair and satisfy himself about it during the inquiry that followed the dewan threw all the blame on the tibetans who he said were alone implicated this assertion was easily disproved and on the conclusion of the inquiry the commissioner railed vehemently at the dewan sayingyou tried to put this business on the people of my country it is an abominable lie you did it yourselves and no one else the company is a great monarchy you insulted it and it has taken its revenge if you or any other tibetan ever again cause a rupture with the english you shall be taken with ropes round your necks to pekin there to undergo the just punishment of your offence under the sentence of the mighty emperor the soubah in endeavouring to extort the new treaty by force and the dingpun who had his own revenge to gratify exceeded their instructions in using violence towards campbell whom the dewan ordered should be simply taken and confined they were consequently disgraced long before we were released and the failure of the stratagem thrown upon their shoulders  during the march down to laghep campbell was treated by the dingpuns men with great rudeness i kept as near as i was allowed quietly gathering rhododendron seeds by the way at the campingground we were again separated at which i remonstrated with the dingpun also complaining of his peoples insolent behaviour towards their prisoner which he promised should be discontinued  the next day we reached rungpo where we halted for further instructions our tents were placed apart but we managed to correspond by stealth on the 10th of november we were conducted to tumloong a pony was brought for me but i refused it on seeing that campbell was treated with great indignity and obliged to follow at the tail of the mule ridden by the dingpun who thus marched him in triumph up to the village  i was taken to a house at phadong and my fellow traveller was confined in another at some distance to the eastward a stones throw below the rajahs and thrust into a little cagelike room i was soon visited by an old lama who assured me that we were both perfectly safe but that there were many grievances against campbell the soubah arrived shortly after bringing me compliments nominally in the rajahs name and a substantial present consisting of a large cow sheep fowls a brick of tea bags of rice flour butter eggs and a profusion of vegetables i refused to take them on the friendly terms on which they were brought and only accepted them as provisions during my detention i remonstrated again about our separation and warned the soubah of the inevitable consequence of this outrage upon the representative of a friendly power travelling under the authority of his own government unarmed and without escort he was greatly perplexed and assured me that campbells detention was only temporary because he had not given satisfaction to the rajah and as the latter could not get answers to his demands from calcutta in less than a month it was determined to keep him till then but to send me to dorjiling he returned in the evening to tell me that campbells men with the exception only of the ghorkas these people stood in far greater fear of the nepalese than of the english and the reason is obvious the former allow no infraction of their rights to pass unnoticed whereas we had permitted every article of our treaty to be contravened had been seized because they were runaway slaves from sikkim but that i need not alarm myself for mine should be untouched  the hut being small and intolerably dirty i pitched my tent close by and lived in it for seven days i was not guarded but so closely watched that i could not go out for the most trifling purpose except under surveillance they were evidently afraid of my escaping i was however treated with civility but forbidden to communicate either with campbell or with dorjiling  the soubah frequently visited me always protesting i was no prisoner that campbells seizure was a very trifling affair and the violence employed all a mistake he always brought presents and tried to sound me about the government at calcutta on the 12th he paid his last visit looking wofully dejected being out of favour at court and dismissed to his home he referred me to meepo for all future communications to the rajah and bade me a most cordial farewell which i regretted being unable to return with any show of kind feeling poor fellow he had staked his last and lost it when he undertook to seize the agent of the most powerful government in the east and to reduce him to the condition of a tool of the dewan despite the many obstructions he had placed in my way we had not fallen out since july we had been constant companions and though at issue never at enmity i had impeached him and my grievances had been forwarded to the rajah with a demand for his punishment but he never seemed to owe me a grudge for that knowing the rajahs impotence as compared with the power of the dewan whom he served and in common with all his party presuming on the unwillingness of the british government to punish  on the 13th of november i was hurriedly summoned by meepo to the phadong temple where i was interrogated by the amlah as the rajahs councillors in this instance the dewans adherents are called i found four china mats placed on a stone bench on one of which i was requested to seat myself the others being occupied by the dewans elder brother a younger brother of the gangtok kajee a man of some wealth and an old lama the conference took place in the open air and amongst an immense crowd of lamas men women and children  i took the initiative as i made a point of doing on all such occasions and demanded proper interpreters which were refused and the amlah began a rambling interrogatory in tibetan through my lepcha sirdar pakshok who spoke very little tibetan or hindostanee and my halfcaste servant who spoke as little english the dewans brother was very nervously counting his beads and never raised his eyes while i kept mine steadily upon him  he suggested most of the queries every one of which took several minutes as he was constantly interrupted by the kajee who was very fat and stupid the lama scarcely spoke and the bystanders never my connection with the indian government was first enquired into next they came to political matters upon which i declined entering but i gathered that their object was to oblige campbell to accept the lassoo kajee as vakeel to alter the slavery laws to draw a new boundary line with nepal to institute direct communication between themselves and the governorgeneral they were prompted to demand this by an unfortunate oversight that occurred at calcutta some years before vakeels from the sikkim durbar repaired to that capital and though unaccredited by the governorgenerals agent at dorjiling were in the absence of the governorgeneral received by the president of the council in open durbar the effect was of course to reduce the governorgenerals agent at dorjiling to a cipher and to engage that there should be no trade or communication between sikkim and india except through the dewan all of these subjects related to the terms of the original treaty between the rajah and the indian government they told me they had sent these proposals to the government through dorjiling these letters which concluded with a line stating that campbell was detained at tumloong till favourable answers should be received had arrived at dorjiling but being written in tibetan and containing matters into which no one but campbell could enter they were laid on one side till his return the interpreter did not read the last line which stated that dr campbell was detained till answers were received and the fact of our capture and imprisonment therefore remained unknown for several weeks but had received no acknowledgment from the latter place and they wanted to know the probable result at calcutta as the only answer i could give might irritate them i again declined giving any lastly they assured me that no blame was imputed to myself that on the contrary i had been travelling under the rajahs protection who rejoiced in my success that i might have visited yakla pass as i had intended doing but that preferring to accompany my friend they had allowed me to do so and that i might now either join him or continue to live in my tent of course i joyfully accepted the former proposal after being refused permission to send a letter to dorjiling except i would write in a character which they could read i asked if they had anything more to say and being answered in the negative i was taken by meepo to campbell heartily glad to end a parley which had lasted for an hour and a half  i found my friend in good health and spirits strictly guarded in a small thatched hut of bamboo wattle and clay the situation was pretty and commanded a view of the ryott valley and the snowy mountains there were some picturesque chaits hard by and a blacksmiths forge our walks were confined to a few steps in front of the hut and included a puddle and a spring of water we had one black room with a small window and a fire in the middle on a stone we slept in the narrow apartment behind it which was the cage in which campbell had been at first confined and which exactly admitted us both lying on the floor two or three sepoys occupied an adjoining room and had a peephole through the partitionwall  my gratification at our being placed together was damped by the seizure of all my faithful attendants except my own servant and one who was a nepalese the rest were bound and placed in the stocks and close confinement charged with being sikkim people who had no authority to take service in dorjiling on the contrary they were all registered as british subjects and had during my travels been recognised as such by the rajah and all his authorities three times the soubah and others had voluntarily assured me that my person and people were inviolate nor was there any cause for this outrage but the fear of their escaping with news to dorjiling and possibly a feeling of irritation amongst the authorities at the failure of their schemes meanwhile we were not allowed to write and we heard that the bag of letters which we had sent before our capture had been seized and burnt campbell greatly feared that they would threaten dorjiling with a night attack threats of sacking dorjiling had on several previous occasions been made by the dewan to the too great alarm of the inhabitants who were ignorant of the timid and pacific disposition of the lepchas and of the fact that there are not fifty muskets in the country nor twenty men able to use them on this occasion the threats were coupled with the report that we were murdered and that the rajah had asked for 50000 tibetan soldiers who were being marched twentyfive days journey over passes 16000 feet high and deep in snow and were coming to drive the english out of sikkim i need hardly observe that the tibetans who have repeatedly refused to interfere on this side the snows had no hand in the matter or that supposing they could collect that number of men in all tibet it would be impossible to feed them for a week there or in sikkim such reports unfortunately spread a panic in dorjiling the guards were called in from all the outposts and the ladies huddled into one house whilst the males stood on the defensive to the great amusement of the amlah at tumloong whose insolence to us increased proportionally as we heard that the lassoo kajee was stationed at namtchi with a party for that purpose and all communication cut off except through him  illustrationhorns of the showa stag cervus wallichii a native of choombi in tibet length of antler 4 feet 6 in    chapter xxvi  dr campbell is ordered

since his confinement dr campbell had been desired to attend the durbar for the purpose of transacting business but had refused to go except by compulsion considering that in the excited state of the authorities amongst whom there was not one person of responsibility or judgment his presence would not only be useless but he might be exposed to further insult or possibly violence  on the 15th of november we were informed that the dewan was on his way from tibet of this we were glad for knave as he was we had hitherto considered him to possess sense and understanding his agents were beginning to find out their mistake and summoned to council the principal lamas and kajees of the country who to a man repudiated the proceedings and refused to attend our captors were extremely anxious to induce us to write letters to dorjiling and sent spies of all kinds to offer us facilities for secret correspondence the simplicity and clumsiness with which these artifices were attempted would have been ludicrous under other circumstances while the threat of murdering campbell only alarmed us inasmuch as it came from people too stupid to be trusted we made out that all sikkim people were excluded from dorjiling and the amlah consequently could not conceal their anxiety to know what had befallen their letters to government  meanwhile we were but scantily fed and our imprisoned coolies got nothing at all our guards were supplied with a handful of rice or meal as the days allowance they were consequently grumbling the rajah has no standing army not even a bodyguard and these men were summoned to tumloong before our arrival they had no arms and received no pay but were fed when called out on duty there is no store for grain no bazaar or market in any part of the country each family growing little enough for its own wants and no more consequently sikkim could not stand on the defensive for a week the rajah receives his supply of grain in annual contributions from the peasantry who thus pay a rent in kind which varies from little to nothing according to the year etc he had also property of his own in the terai but the slender proceeds only enabled him to trade with tibet for tea etc and were daily reduced in number the supplies of rice from the terai beyond dorjiling were cut off by the interruption of communication and the authorities evidently could not hold us long at this rate we sent up complaints but of course received no answer  the dewan arrived in the afternoon in great state carried in an english chair given him by campbell some years before habited in a blue silk cloak lined with lambskin and wearing an enormous straw hat with a red tassel  and black velvet butterflies on the flapping brim he was accompanied by a household of women who were laden with ornaments and wore boots and sat astride on ponies many lamas were also with him one of whom wore a broad chineselike hat covered with polished copper foil half a dozen sepoys with matchlocks preceded him and on approaching tumloong bawled out his titles dignities etc as was formerly the custom in england  illustrationrajahs residence and the hut assigned to us arrival of the dewan  at dorjiling our seizure was still unknown our letters were brought to us but we were not allowed to answer them now that the dewan had arrived we hoped to come to a speedy explanation with him but he shammed sickness and sent no answer to our messages if indeed he received them our guards were reduced to one sepoy with a knife who was friendly and a dirty crosseyed fellow named thobasing who with the exception of tchebu lama was the only bhoteea about the durbar who could speak hindostanee and who did it very imperfectly he was our attendant and spy the most barefaced liar i ever met with even in the east and as cringing and obsequious when alone with us as he was to his masters on other occasions when he never failed to show off his authority over us in an offensive manner though he was the most disagreeable fellow we were ever thrown in contact with i do not think that he was therefore selected but solely from his possessing a few words of hindostanee and his presumed capability of playing the spy  the weather was generally drizzling or rainy and we were getting very tired of our captivity but i beguiled the time by carefully keeping my meteorological register during the thirty days spent at tumloong the temperature was mild and equable with much cloud and drizzle but little hard rain and we experienced violent thunderstorms followed by transient sunshine unlike 1848 the rains did not cease this year before the middle of december nor had there been one fine month since april the mean temperature computed from 150 observations was 502 degrees and from the maximum and minimum thermometer 496 degrees which is a fair approximation to the theoretical temperature calculated for the elevation and month and allows a fall of 1 degree for 320 feet of ascent the temperature during the spring from 50 observations varied during the day from 24 degrees to 58 degrees higher than that of the air the greatest differences occurring morning and evening the barometric tide amounted to 0091 between 950 am and 4 pm which is less than at the level of the plains of india and more than at any greater elevation than tumloong the air was always damp nearly saturated at night and the mean amount of humidity for ninetyeight observations taken during the day was only 0850 corresponding to a dewpoint of 496 degrees or 52 degrees below that of the air and by reducing many of my previous observations each morning we were awakened at daybreak by the prolonged echos of the conchs trumpets and cymbals beaten by the priests before the many temples in the valley wild and pleasing sounds often followed by  their choral chants after dark we sat over the fire generally in company with a little lepcha girl who was appointed to keep us in firewood and who sat watching our movements with childish curiosity dolly as we christened her was a quick child and a kind one intolerably dirty but very entertaining from her powers of mimicry she was fond of hearing me whistle airs and procured me a tibetan jewsharp this instrument which is common in tibet is identical with the european except that the tongue is produced behind the bow in a strong steel spike by which the instrument is held firmer to the mouth with which and coarse tobacco which i smoked out of a tibetan brass pipe i wiled away the dark evenings whilst my cheerful companion amused himself with an old harmonicon to the enchantment of dolly and our guards and neighbours  illustrationtibet pipe and tinderpouch with steel attached  the messengers from dorjiling were kept in utter ignorance of our confinement till their arrival at tumloong when they were crossquestioned and finally sent to us they gradually became too numerous there being only one apartment for ourselves and such of our servants as  were not imprisoned elsewhere some of them were frightened out of their senses and the state of abject fear and trembling in which one limboo arrived and continued for nearly a week was quite distressing it amounted to a complete prostration of bodily and mental powers the man trembled and started when spoken to or at any noise a cold sweat constantly bedewed his forehead and he continued in this state for eight days no kindness on campbells part could rouse him to give any intelligible account of his fears or their cause his companions said he had lost his goroo ie his charm which the priest gives him while yet a child and which he renews or gets resanctified as occasion requires to us the circumstance was extremely painful to every one except dolly who mimicked him in a manner that was irresistibly ludicrous whether he had been beaten or threatened we could not make out nor whether he had heard of some dark fate impending over ourselvesa suspicion which would force itself on our minds especially as thobasing had coolly suggested to the amlah the dispatching of campbell as the shortest way of getting out of the scrape we were also ignorant whether any steps were being taken at dorjiling for our release which we felt satisfied must follow any active measures against these bullying cowards though they themselves frequently warned us that we should be thrown into the teesta if any such were pursued  so long as our money lasted we bought food for the durbar had none to give and latterly my ever charitable companion fed our guards including dolly and thobasing in pity to their pinched condition several families sent us small presents especially that of the late estimable dewan ilamsing whose widow and daughters lived close by and never failed to express in secret their sympathy and good feeling  tchebu lamas and meepos families were equally forward in their desire to serve us but they were marked men and could only communicate by stealth  our coolies were released on the 18th more than half starved but the sirdars were still kept in chains or the stocks some were sent back to dorjiling and the british subjects billetted off amongst the villagers and variously employed by the dewan my lad cheytoong was set to collect the long leaves of a tupistra called purphiok which yield a sweet juice and were chopped up and mixed with tobacco for the dewans hookah  november 20ththe dewan we heard this day ignored all the late proceedings professing to be enraged with his brother and the amlah and refusing to meddle in the matter this was no doubt a pretence we had sent repeatedly for an explanation with himself or the rajah from which he excused himself on the plea of illhealth till this day when he apprized us that he would meet campbell and a cotton tent was pitched for the purpose  we went about noon and were received with great politeness and shaking of hands by the dewan the young gangtok kajee and the old monk who had been present at my examination at phadong tchebu lamas brother was also there as a member of the amlah lately taken into favour while tchebu himself acted as interpreter the dewan speaking only tibetan they all sat crosslegged on a bamboo bench on one side and we on chairs opposite them walnuts and sweetmeats were brought us and a small present in the rajahs name consisting of rice flour and butter  the dewan opened the conversation both in this and another conference which took place on the 22nd by requesting campbell to state his reasons for having desired these interviews neither he nor the amlah seemed to have the smallest idea of the nature and consequences of the acts they had committed and they therefore anxiously  sought information as to the view that would be taken of them by the british government they could not see why campbell should not transact business with them in his present condition and wanted him to be the medium of communication between themselves and calcutta the latter confined himself to pointing out his own views of the following subjects1 the seizing and imprisoning of the agent of a friendly power travelling unarmed and without escort under the formal protection of the rajah and with the authority of his own government 2 the aggravation of this act of the amlah by our present detention under the dewans authority 3 the chance of collision and the disastrous consequences of a war for which they had no preparation of any kind 4 the impossibility of the supreme government paying any attention to their letters so long as we were illegally detained  all this sank deep into the dewans heart he answered you have spoken truth and i will submit it all to the rajah but at the same time he urged that there was nothing dishonourable in the imprisonment and that the original violence being all a mistake it should be overlooked by both parties we parted on good terms and heard shortly after the second conference that our release was promised and arranged when a communication i need scarcely say that every step was taken at dorjiling for our release that the most anxious solicitude for our safety could suggest but the first communication to the rajah though it pointed out the heinous nature of his offence was through a natural fear of exasperating our captors couched in very moderate language the particulars of our seizure and the reasons for it and for our further detention were unknown at dorjiling or a very different line of policy would have been pursued from dorjiling changed their plans the dewan conveniently fell sick on the spot and we were thrown back again  in the meantime however we were allowed to write to our friends and to receive money and food of which  we stood in great need i transmitted a private account of the whole affair to the governorgeneral who was unfortunately at bombay but to whose prompt and vigorous measures we were finally indebted for our release his lordship expedited a despatch to the rajah such as the latter was accustomed to receive from nepal bhotan or lhassa and such as alone commands attention from these halfcivilized indochinese who measure power by the firmness of the tone adopted towards them and who whether in sikkim birmah siam bhotan or china have too long been accustomed to see every article of our treaties contravened with no worse consequences than a protest or a threat which is never carried into execution till some fatal step calls forth the dormant power of the british government we forget that all our concessions to these people are interpreted into weakness that they who cannot live on an amicable equality with one another cannot be expected to do so with us that all our talk of power and resources are mere boasts to habitual bullies so long as we do not exert ourselves in the correction of premeditated insults no government can be more tolerant more sincerely desirous of peace and more anxious to confine its sway within its own limits than that of india but it can only continue at peace by demanding respect and the punctilious enforcement of even the most trifling terms in the treaties it makes with indochinese  the end of the month arrived without bringing any prospect of our release whilst we were harassed by false reports of all kinds the dewan went on the 25th to a hot bath a few hundred feet down the hill he was led past our hut his burly frame tottering as if in great weakness but a more transparent fraud could not have been practised he was in fact lying on his oars pending further negotiations the amlah proposed that campbell should sign a bond granting immunity for all past offences on their part whilst they were to withdraw the letter of grievances against him the lamas cast horoscopes for the  future little presents continually arrived for us and the ranee sent me some tobacco and to campbell brown sugar and murwa beer the blacksmiths who had been ostentatiously making long knives at the forge hard by were dismissed troops were said to be arriving at dorjiling and a letter sternly demanding our release bad been received  the lamas of pemiongchi changachelling tassiding etc and the dewans enemies and tchebu lamas friends began to flock from all quarters to tumloong demanding audience of the rajah and our instant liberation the dewans game was evidently up but the timidity of his opponents his own craft and the habitual dilatoriness of all contributed to cause endless delays the young gangtok kajee tried to curry favour with us sending word that he was urging our release and adding that he had some capital ponies for us to see on our way to dorjiling many similar trifles showed that these people had not a conception of the nature of their position or of that of an officer of the british government  the tchebu lama visited us only once and then under surveillance he renewed his professions of good faith and we had every reason to know that he had suffered severely for his adherence to us and consistent repudiation of the amlahs conduct he was in great favour with his brother lamas but was not allowed to see the rajah who was said to trust to him alone of all his counsellors he told us that peremptory orders had arrived from calcutta for our release but that the amlah had replied that they would not acknowledge the despatch from its not bearing the governorgenerals great seal the countrypeople refusing to be saddled with the keep of our coolies they were sent to dorjiling in small parties charged to say that we were free and following them  the weather continued rainy and bad with occasionally a few hours of sunshine which however always rendered the ditch before our door offensive we were still prevented leaving the hot but as a great annual festival was going on we were less disagreeably watched campbell was very unwell and we had no medicine and as the dewan accustomed to such duplicity himself naturally took this for a ruse and refused to allow us to send to dorjiling for any we were more than ever convinced that his own sickness was simulated  on the 2nd and 3rd december we had further conferences with the dewan who said that we were to be taken to dorjiling in six days with two vakeels from the rajah the pemiongchi lama as the oldest and most venerated in sikkim attended and addressed campbell in a speech of great feeling and truth having heard he said of these unfortunate circumstances a few days ago he had come on feeble limbs and though upwards of seventy winters old as the representative of his holy brotherhood to tender advice to his rajah which he hoped would be followed since sikkim had been connected with the british rule it had experienced continued peace and protection whereas before they were in constant dread of their lives and properties which as well as their most sacred temples were violated by the nepalese and bhotanese he then dwelt upon campbells invariable kindness and good feeling and his exertions for the benefit of their country and for the cementing of friendship and hoped he would not let these untoward events induce an opposite course in future but that he would continue to exert his influence with the governorgeneral in their favour  the dewan listened attentively he was anxious and  perplexed and evidently losing his presence of mind he talked to us of lhassa and its gaieties dromedaries lamas and everything tibetan offered to sell us ponies cheap and altogether behaved in a most undignified manner ever and anon calling attention to his pretended sick leg which he nursed on his knee he gave us the acceptable news that the government at calcutta had sent up an officer to carry on campbells duties which had alarmed him exceedingly the rajah we were told was very angry at our seizure and detention he had no fault to find with the governorgenerals agent and hoped he would be continued as such in fact all the blame was thrown on the brothers of the dewan and of the gangtok kajee and more irresponsible stupid boors could not have been found on whom to lay it or who would have felt less inclined to commit such folly if it had not been put on them by the dewan on leaving white silk scarfs were thrown over our shoulders and we went away still doubtful after so many disappointments whether we should really be set at liberty at the stated period  although there was so much talk about our leaving our confinement continued as rigorous as ever the dewan curried favour in every other way sending us tibetan wares for purchase with absurd prices attached he being an arrant pedlar all the principal families waited on us desiring peace and friendship the coolies who had not been dismissed were allowed to run away except my bhotan sirdar nimbo against whom the dewan was inveterate the sikkim people are always at issue with the bhotanese nimbo was a runaway slave of the latter country who had been received into sikkim and retained there until he took up his quarters at dorjiling he however managed soon afterwards to break a great chain with which his legs were shackled and  marching at night eluded a hot pursuit and proceeded to the teesta swam the river and reached dorjiling in eight days arriving with a large iron ring on each leg and a link of several pounds weight attached to one  parting presents arrived from the rajah on the 7th consisting of ponies cloths silks woollens immense squares of butter tea and the usual et ceteras to the utter impoverishment of his stores these he offered to the two sahibs in token of his amity with the british government his desire for peace and deprecation of angry discussions the ranee sent silk purses fans and such tibetan paraphernalia with an equally amicable message that she was most anxious to avert the consequences of whatever complaints had gone forth against dr campbell who might depend on her strenuous exertions to persuade the rajah to do whatever he wished these friendly messages were probably evoked by the information that an english regiment with three guns was on its way to sikkim and that 300 of the bhaugulpore rangers had already arrived there the government of bengal sending another agent mr lushington the gentleman sent to conduct sikkim affairs during dr campbells detention to whom i shall ever feel grateful for his activity in our cause and his unremitting attention to every little arrangement that could alleviate the discomforts and anxieties of our position to dorjiling was also a contingency they had not anticipated having fully expected to get rid of any such obstacle to direct communication with the governorgeneral  a present from the whole population followed that of the ranee coupled with earnest entreaties that campbell would resume his position at dorjiling and on the following day forty coolies mustered to arrange the baggage before we left the ranee sent three rupees to buy a  yard of chale and some gloves accompanying them with a present of white silk etc for mrs campbell to whom the commission was intrusted a singular instance of the insouciant simplicity of these odd people  the 9th of december was a splendid and hot day one of the very few we had had during our captivity we left at noon descending the hill through an enormous crowd of people who brought farewell presents all wishing us well we were still under escort as prisoners of the dewan who was coolly marching a troop of forty unloaded mules and ponies and double that number of mens loads of merchandize purchased during the summer in tibet to trade with at dorjiling and the titalya fair his impudence or stupidity was thus quite inexplicable treating us as prisoners ignoring every demand of the authorities at dorjiling of the supreme council of calcutta and of the governorgeneral himself and at the same time acting as if he were to enter the british territories on the most friendly and advantageous footing for himself and his property and incurring so great an expense in all this as to prove that he was in earnest in thinking so  tchebu lama accompanied us but we were not allowed to converse with him we halted at the bottom of the valley where the dewan invited us to partake of tea from this place he gave us mules the tibet mules are often as fine as the spanish i rode one which had performed a journey from choombi to lhassa in fifteen days with a man and load or ponies to ride and we ascended to yankoong a village 3867 feet above the sea on the following day we crossed a high ridge from the ryott valley to that of the rungmi where we camped at tikbotang alt 3763 feet and on the 11th at gangtok sampoo a few miles lower down the same valley  we were now in the soubahship of the gangtok kajee a  member of the oldest and most wealthy family in sikkim he had from the first repudiated the late acts of the amlah in which his brother had taken part and had always been hostile to the dewan the latter conducted himself with disagreeable familiarity towards us and hauteur towards the people he was preceded by immense kettledrums carried on mens backs and great handbells which were beaten and rung on approaching villages on which occasions he changed his dress of skyblue for yellow silk robes worked with chinese dragons to the indignation of tchebu lama an amber robe in polite tibetan society being sacred to royalty and the lamas we everywhere perceived unequivocal symptoms of the dislike with which he was regarded cattle were driven away villages deserted and no one came to pay respects or bring presents except the kajees who were ordered to attend and his elder brother for whom he had usurped an estate near gangtok  on the 13th he marched us a few miles and then halted for a day at serriomsa alt 2820 feet at the bottom of a hot valley full of irrigated ricecrops and plantain and orangegroves here the gangtok kajee waited on us with a handsome present and informed us privately of his cordial hatred of the upstart dewan and hopes for his overthrow a demonstration of which we took no notice nothing would have been easier than for the gangtok kajee or any other respectable man in sikkim to have overthrown the dewan and his party but these people are intolerably apathetic and prefer being tyrannized over to the trouble of shaking off the yoke the dewans brother one of the amlah also sent a large present but was ashamed to appear another letter reached the dewan here directed to the rajah it was from the governorgeneral at bombay and had been sent across the country by special messengers  it demanded our instant release or his raj would be forfeited and declared that if a hair of our heads were touched his life should be the penalty  the rajah was also incessantly urging the dewan to hasten us onwards as free men to dorjiling but the latter took all remonstrances with assumed coolness exercised his ponies played at bow and arrow intruded on us at mealtimes to be invited to partake and loitered on the road changing garments and hats which he pestered us to buy nevertheless he was evidently becoming daily more nervous and agitated  from the rungmi valley we crossed on the 14th southward to that of runniok and descended to dikkeeling a large village of dhurma bhoteeas bhotanese which is much the most populous industrious and at the same time turbulent in sikkim it is 4950 feet above the sea and occupies many broad cultivated spurs facing the south this district once belonged to bhotan and was ceded to the sikkim rajah by the paro pilo the temporal sovereign in contradistinction to the dhurma rajah or spiritual sovereign of bhotan in consideration of some military services rendered by the former in driving off the tibetans who had usurped it for the authorities of lhassa since then the sikkim and bhotan people have repeatedly fallen out and dikkeeling has become a refuge for runaway bhotanese and kidnapping is constantly practised on this frontier  the dewan halted us here for three days for no assigned cause on the 16th letters arrived including a most kind and encouraging one from mr lushington who had taken charge of campbells office at dorjiling immediately after arriving the messenger was seized with violent vomitings and gripings we could not help suspecting poison especially as we were now amongst adherents of the dewan and the bhotanese are notorious for this crime only one means suggested itself for proving this and with campbells permission i sent my compliments to the dewan with a request for one of his hunting dogs to eat the vomit it was sent at once and performed its duty without any ill effects i must confess to having felt a malicious pleasure in the opportunity thus afforded of showing our jailor how little we trusted him feeling indignant at the idea that he should suppose he was making any way in our good opinion by his familiarities which we were not in circumstances to resist  the crafty fellow however outwitted me by inviting us to dine with him the same day and putting our stomachs and noses to a severe test our dinner was served in chinese fashion but most of the luxuries such as bechedemer were very old and bad we ate sometimes with chopsticks and at others with tibetan spoons knives and twopronged forks after the usual amount of messes served in oil and salt water sweets were brought and a strong spirit thobasing our filthy crosseyed spy was waiter and brought in every little dish with both hands and raised it to his greasy forehead making a sort of half bow previous to depositing it before us sometimes he undertook to praise its contents always adding that in tibet none but very great men indeed partook of such sumptuous fare thus he tried to please both us and the dewan who conducted himself with pompous hospitality showing off what he considered his elegant manners and graces our blood boiled within us at being so patronised by the squinting ruffian whose insolence and illwill had sorely aggravated the discomforts of our imprisonment  not content with giving us what he considered a magnificent dinner and it had cost him some trouble the  dewan produced a little bag from a doublelocked escritoire and took out three dinnerpills which he had received as a great favour from the rimbochay lama and which were a sovereign remedy for indigestion and all other ailments he handed one to each of us reserving the third for himself campbell refused his but there appeared no help for me after my groundless suspicion of poison and so i swallowed the pill with the best grace i could but in truth it was not poison i dreaded in its contents so much as being compounded of some very questionable materials such as the rimbochay lama blesses and dispenses far and wide to swallow such is a sanctifying work according to boodhist superstition and i believe there was nothing in the world save his ponies to which the dewan attached a greater value  to wind up the feast we had pipes of excellent mild yellow chinese tobacco called tseang made from nicotiana rustica which is cultivated in east tibet and in west china according to mm huc and gabet it resembles in flavour the finest syrian tobacco and is most agreeable when the smoke is passed through the nose the common tobacco of india nicotiana tabacum is much imported into tibet where it is called tamma probably a corruption of the persian toombac and is said to fetch the enormous price of 30 shillings per lb at lhassa which is sixty times its value in india rice at lhassa when cheap sells at 2 shillings for 5 lbs it is as i have elsewhere said all bought up for rations for the chinese soldiery  the bhotanese are more industrious than the lepchas and better husbandmen besides having superior crops of all ordinary grains they grow cotton hemp and flax the cotton is cleansed here as elsewhere with a simple gin the lepchas use no spinning wheel but a spindle and  distaff their loom which is tibetan is a very complicated one framed of bamboo it is worked by hand without beam treddle or shuttle  on the 18th we were marched three miles only to singdong alt 2116 feet and on the following day five miles farther to katong ghat alt 750 feet on the teesta river which we crossed with rafts and camped on the opposite bank a few miles above the junction of this river with the great rungeet the water which is seagreen in colour had a temperature of 535 degrees at 4 pm and 517 degrees the following morning its current was very powerful the rocks since leaving tunlloong had been generally micaceous striking northwest and dipping northeast the climate was hot and the vegetation on the banks tropical on the hills around lemonbushes kucheala lepcha were abundant growing apparently wild  the dewan was now getting into a very nervous and depressed state he was determined to keep up appearances before his followers but was himself almost servile to us he caused his men to make a parade of their arms as if to intimidate us and in descending narrow gullies we had several times the disagreeable surprise of finding some of his men at a sudden turn with drawn bows and arrows pointed towards us others gesticulated with their long knives and made fell swoops at soft plantainstems but these artifices were all as shallow as they were contemptible and a smile at such demonstrations was generally answered with another from the actors  from katong we ascended the steep east flank of tendong or mount ararat through forests of sal and longleaved pine to namten alt 4483 feet where we again halted two days the dingpun tinli lived near and  waited on us with a present which with all others that had been brought campbell received officially and transferred to the authorities at dorjiling  the dewan was thoroughly alarmed at the news here brought in that the rajahs present of yaks ponies etc which had been sent forward had been refused at dorjiling and equally so at the clamorous messages which reached him from all quarters demanding our liberation and at the desertion of some of his followers on hearing that large bodies of troops were assembling at dorjiling repudiated by his rajah and countrymen and paralysed between his dignity and his ponies which he now perceived would not be welcomed at the station and which were daily losing flesh looks and value in these hot valleys where there is no grass pasture he knew not what olivebranch to hold out to our government except ourselves whom he therefore clung to as hostages  on the 22nd of december he marched us eight miles further to cheadam on a bold spur 4653 feet high overlooking the great rungeet and facing dorjiling from which it was only twenty miles distant the white bungalows of our friends gladdened our eyes while the new barracks erecting for the daily arriving troops struck terror into the dewans heart the six sepoys these sepoys besides the loose red jacket and striped lepcha kirtle wore a very curious national black hat of felt with broad flaps turned up all round this is represented in the righthand figure a somewhat similar bat is worn by some classes of nepal soldiery who had marched valiantly beside us for twenty days carrying the muskets given to the rajah the year before by the governorgeneral now lowered their arms and vowed that if a red coat crossed the great rungeet they would throw down their guns and run away news arrived  that the bhotan inhabitants of dorjiling headed by my bold sirdar nimbo had arranged a night attack for our release an enterprise to which they were quite equal and in which they have had plenty of practice in their own misgoverned country watchfires gleamed amongst the bushes we were thrust into a doublyguarded house and bows and arrows were ostentatiously levelled so as to rake the doorway should we attempt to escape some of the ponies were sent back to dikkeeling though the dewan still clung to his merchandise and the feeble hope of traffic the confusion increased daily but though tchebu lama looked brisk and confident we were extremely anxious  scouts were hourly arriving from the road to the great rungeet and if our troops had advanced the dewan might have made away with us from pure fear  illustrationlepcha sepoys tibetan sepays in the background  in the forenoon he paid us a long visit and brought some flutes of which he gave me two very common ones of apricot wood from lhassa producing at the same time a beautiful one which i believe he intended for campbell but his avarice got the better and he commuted his gift into the offer of a tune and pitching it in a high key he went through a tibetan air that almost deafened us by its screech he tried bravely to maintain his equanimity but as we preserved a frigid civility and only spoke when addressed the tears would start from his eyes in the pauses of conversation in the evening he came again he was excessively agitated and covered with perspiration and thrust himself unceremoniously between us on the bench we occupied as his familiarity increased he put his arm round my neck and as he was armed with a small dagger i felt rather uneasy about his intentions but he ended by forcing on my acceptance a coin value threepence for he was in fact beside himself with terror  next morning campbell received a hint that this was a good opportunity for a vigorous remonstrance the dewan came with tchebu lama his own younger brother who was his pony driver and the lassoo kajee the latter had for two months placed himself in an attitude of hostility opposite dorjiling with a ragged company of followers but he now sought peace and friendship as much as the dewan the latter told us he was waiting for a reply to a letter addressed to mr lushington after which he would set us free campbell said as you appear to have made up your mind why not dismiss us at once he  answered that we should go the next day at all events here i came in and on hearing from campbell what had passed i added that he had better for his own sake let us go at once that the next day was our great and only annual poojah religious festival of christmas when we all met whereas he and his countrymen had dozens in the year as for me he knew i had no wife nor children nor any relation within thousands of miles and it mattered little where i was he was only bringing ruin on himself by his conduct to me as the governorgenerals friend but as regarded campbell the case was different his home was at dorjiling which was swarming with english soldiers all in a state of exasperation and if he did not let us depart before christmas he would find dorjiling too hot to hold him let him offer what reparation he might for the injuries he had done us i added we are all ready to godismiss us the dewan again turned to campbell who said i am quite ready order us ponies at once and send our luggage after us he then ordered the ponies and three men including meepo to attend us whereupon we walked out mounted and made off with all speed  we arrived at the cane bridge over the great rungeet at 4 pm and to our chagrin found it in the possession of a posse of ragged bhoteeas though there were thirty armed sepoys of our own at the guardhouse above at meepos order they cut the network of fine canes by which they had rendered the bridge impassable and we crossed the sepoys at the guardhouse turned out with their clashing arms and bright accoutrements and saluted to the sound of bugles scaring our three companions who ran back as fast as they could go we rode up that night to dorjiling and i arrived at 8 pm at hodgsons house  where i was taken for a ghost and received with shouts of welcome by my kind friend and his guest dr thomson who had been awaiting my arrival for upwards of a month  thus terminated our sikkim captivity and my last himalayan exploring journey which in a geographical point of view had answered my purposes beyond my most sanguine expectations though my collections had been in a great measure destroyed by so many untoward events it enabled me to survey the whole country and to execute a map of it and campbell had further gained that knowledge of its resources which the british government should all along have possessed as the protector of the rajah and his territories  it remains to say a few words of the events that succeeded our release in so far as they relate to my connection with them the dewan moved from cheadam to namtchi immediately opposite dorjiling where he remained throughout the winter the supreme government of bengal demanded of the rajah that he should deliver up the most notorious offenders and come himself to dorjiling on pain of an army marching to tumloong to enforce the demand a step which would have been easy as there were neither troops arms ammunition nor other means of resistance even had there been the inclination to stop us which was not the case the rajah would in all probability have delivered himself up at tumloong throwing himself on our mercy and the army would have sought the culprits in vain both the spirit and the power to capture them being wanting on the part of the people and their ruler  the rajah expressed his willingness but pleaded his inability to fulfil the demand whereupon the threat was  repeated and additional reinforcements were moved on to dorjiling the general officer in command at dinapore was ordered to dorjiling to conduct operations his skill and bravery had been proved during the progress of the nepal war so long ago as 1815 from the appearance of the country about dorjiling he was led to consider sikkim to be impracticable for a british army this was partly owing to the forestclad mountains and partly to the fear of tibetan troops coming to the rajahs aid and the nepalese jung bahadoor was at this time planning his visit to england and to his honour i must say that on hearing of our imprisonment he offered to the government at calcutta to release us with a handful of men this he would no doubt have easily effected but his offer was wisely declined for the nepalese as i have elsewhere stated want sikkim and bhotan too and we had undertaken the protection of the former country mainly to keep the nepalese out of it taking the opportunity to attack us with the latter we were in profound peace and we had a resident at their court and i have elsewhere shown the impossibility of a tibet invasion even if the chinese or lhassan authorities were inclined to interfere in the affairs of sikkim which they long ago formally declined doing in the case of aggressions of the nepalese and bhotanese the sikkim rajah being under british protection the general officer considered that our troops would have been cut to pieces if they entered the country and the late general sir charles napier has since given evidence to the same effect having been officially asked at the time whether i would guide a party into the country and having drawn up at the request of the general officer plans for the purpose and having given it as my opinion that it would not only have been feasible but easy to have marched a force in peace and safety to tumloong i feel it incumbent on me here to remark that i think general napier who never was in sikkim and wrote from many hundred miles distance must have misapprehended the state of the case whether an invasion of sikkim was either advisable or called for was a matter in which i had no concern nor do i offer an opinion as to the impregnability of the country if it were defended by natives otherwise a match for a british force and having the advantage of position i was not consulted with reference to any difference of opinion between the civil and military powers such as seems to have called for the expression of sir charles napiers opinion on this matter and which appears to be considerably overrated in his evidence  the general officer honoured me with his friendship at dorjiling and to mr lushington i am as i have elsewhere stated under great obligations for his personal consideration and kindness and vigorous measures during my detention on my release and return to dorjiling any interference on my part would have been meddling with what was not my concern i never saw nor wished to see a public document connected with the affair and have only given as many of the leading features of the case as i can vouch for and as were accessible to any other bystander  there were not wanting offers of leading a company of soldiers to tumloong rather than that the threat should have twice been made and then withdrawn but they were not accepted a large body of troops was however marched from dorjiling and encamped on the north bank of the great rungeet for some weeks but after that period they were recalled without any further demonstration the dewan remaining encamped the while on the namtchi hill not three hours march above them the simple lepchas daily brought our soldiers milk fowls and eggs and would have continued to do so had they proceeded to tumloong for i believe both rajah and people would have rejoiced at our occupation of the country  after the withdrawal of the troops the threat was modified into a seizure of the terai lands which the rajah had originally received as a free gift from the british and which were the only lucrative or fertile estates he possessed this was effected by four policemen taking possession of the treasury which contained exactly twelve shillings i believe and announcing to the villagers the confiscation of the territory to the british government in which they gladly acquiesced at the same time there was annexed to it the whole southern part of sikkim between the great rungeet and the plains of india and from nepal on the west to the bhotan frontier and the teesta river on the east thus confining the rajah to his mountains and cutting off all access to the plains except through the british territories to the inhabitants about 5000 souls this was a matter of congratulation for it only involved the payment of a small fixed tax in money to the treasury at dorjiling instead of a fluctuating one in kind with service to the rajah besides exempting them from further annoyance by the dewan at the present time the revenues of the tract thus acquired have doubled and will very soon be quadrupled every expense of our detention and of the moving of troops etc has been already repaid by it and for the future all will be clear profit and i am given to understand that this last year it has realized upwards of 30000 rupees 3000 pounds  dr campbell resumed his duties immediately afterwards and the newlyacquired districts were placed under his jurisdiction the rajah still begs hard for the renewal of old friendship and the restoration of his terai land or the annual grant of 300 pounds a year which he formerly received he has forbidden the culprits his court but can do no more the dewan disgraced and turned out of office is reduced to poverty and is deterred from entering tibet by the threat of being dragged to lhassa with a rope round his neck considering however his energy a rare quality in these countries i should not be surprised at his yet cutting a figure in bhotan if not in sikkim itself especially if at the rajahs death the british government should refuse to take the country under its protection the singtam soubah and the other culprits live disgraced at their homes tchebu lama has received a handsome reward and a grant of land at dorjiling where he resides and whence he sends me his salaams by every opportunity    chapter xxvii  leave dorjiling for calcuttajung bahadoordr falconer improvements in botanic gardenspalmetumvictoria amherstiaorchids

churrascenery and vegetation at foot of mountainscascades  i was chiefly occupied during january and february of 1850 in arranging and transmitting my collections to calcutta and completing my manuscripts maps and surveys my friend dr thomson having joined me here for the purpose of our spending a year in travelling and botanising together it became necessary to decide on the best field for our pursuits bhotan offered the most novelty but it was inaccessible to europeans and we therefore turned our thoughts to nepal and failing that to the khasia mountains  the better to expedite our arrangements i made a trip to calcutta in march where i expected to meet both lord dalhousie on his return from the straits of malacca and jung bahadoor the nepalese minister who was then en route as envoy to england i staid at government house where every assistance was afforded me towards obtaining the nepal rajahs permission to proceed through the himalaya from dorjiling to katmandu jung bahadoor received me with much courtesy and expressed his great desire to serve me but begged me to wait until his return from england as he could not be answerable for my personal safety when travelling during his absence and he referred to the permission he had formerly given me and such was never before accorded to any european in earnest of his disposition which was unaltered we therefore determined upon spending the season of 1850 in the khasia mountains in eastern bengal at the head of the great delta of the ganges and burrampooter  illustrationdr falconers residence calcutta botanic gardens from sir l peels grounds    i devoted a few days to the calcutta botanic gardens where i found my kind friend dr falconer established and very busy the destruction of most of the palms and of all the noble tropical features of the gardens during dr griffiths incumbency had necessitated the replanting of the greater part of the grounds the obliteration of old walks and the construction of new it was also necessary to fill up tanks whose waters by injudicious cuttings were destroying some of the most valuable parts of the land to drain many acres and to raise embankments to prevent the encroachments of the hoogly the latter being a work attended with great expense now cripples the resources of the garden library and other valuable adjuncts for the trees which were planted for the purpose having been felled and sold it became necessary to buy timber at an exorbitant price  the avenue of cycas trees cycas circinalis once the admiration of all visitors and which for beauty and singularity was unmatched in any tropical garden had been swept away by the same unsparing hand which had destroyed the teak mahogany clove nutmeg and cinnamon groves in 1847 when i first visited the establishment nothing was to be seen of its former beauty and grandeur but a few noble trees or graceful palms rearing their heads over a low ragged jungle or spreading their broad leaves or naked limbs over the forlorn hope of a botanical garden that consisted of open clay beds disposed in concentric circles and baking into brick under the fervid heat of a bengal sun  the rapidity of growth is so great in this climate that within eight months from the commencement of the improvements a great change had already taken place the grounds bore a parklike appearance broad shady walks had replaced the narrow winding paths that ran in distorted lines over the ground and a large palmetum or collection of tall and graceful palms of various kinds occupied several acres at one side of the garden whilst a still larger portion of ground was being appropriated to a picturesque assemblage of certain closely allied families of plants whose association promised to form a novel and attractive object of study to the botanist painter and landscape gardener this which the learned director called in scientific language a thamnoendogenarium consists of groups of all kinds of bamboos tufted growing palms rattan canes calami dracaenae plantains screwpines pandani and such genera of tropical monocotyledonous plants all are evergreens of most vivid hue some of which having slender trailing stems form magnificent masses others twine round one another and present impenetrable hillocks of green foliage whilst still others shoot out broad long wavy leaves from tufted roots and a fourth class is supported by aerial roots diverging on all sides and from all heights on the stems every branch of which is crowned with an enormous plume of grasslike leaves since i left india these improvements have been still further carried out and now in the spring of 1853 i read of five splendid victoria plants flowering at once with euryale ferox white blue and red waterlilies and white yellow and scarlet lotus rendering the tanks gorgeous sunk as their waters are in frames of green grass ornamented with clumps of nipa fruticans and phoenix paludosa  the great amherstia tree had been nearly killed by injudicious treatment and the baking of the soil above its roots this defect was remedied by sinking bamboo pipes four feet and a half in the earth and watering through thema plan first recommended by major mfarlane of tavoy some fine orchideae were in flower in the gardens but few of them fruit and those dendrobiums which bear axillary viviparous buds never do some of the orchids appear to be spread by birds amongst the trees but the different species of vanda are increasing so fast that there seems no doubt that this tribe of airplants grows freely from seed in a wild state though we generally fail to rear them in england  the great banyan tree ficus indica is still the pride and ornament of the garden dr falconer has ascertained satisfactorily that it is only seventyfive years old annual rings size etc afford no evidence in such a case but people were alive a few years ago who remembered well its site being occupied in 1782 by a kujoor datepalm out of whose crown the banyan sprouted and beneath which a fakir sat it is a remarkable fact that the banyan hardly ever vegetates on the ground but its figs are eaten by birds and the seeds deposited in the crowns of palms where they grow sending down roots that embrace and eventually kill the palm which decays away this tree is now eighty feet high and throws an area 300 feet had this tree been growing in 1849 over the great palmstove at kew only thirty feet of each end of that vast structure would have been uncovered its increase was proceeding so rapidly that by this time it could probably cover the whole larger banyans are common in bengal but few are so symmetrical in shape and height as the tree gets old it breaks up into separate masses the original trunk decaying and the props becoming separate trunks of the different portions in diameter into a dark cool shade the gigantic limbs spread out about ten feet above the ground and from neglect during dr wallichs absence there were on dr falconers arrival no more than eightynine descending roots or props there are now several hundreds and the growth of this grand mass of vegetation is proportionably stimulated and increased the props are induced to sprout by wet clay and moss tied to the branches beneath which a little pot of water is hung and after they have made some progress they are inclosed in bamboo tubes and so coaxed down to the ground they are mere slender whipcords before reaching the earth where they root remaining very lax for several months but gradually as they grow and swell to the size of cables they tighten and eventually become very tense this is a curious phenomenon and so rapid that it appears to be due to the rooting part mechanically dragging down the aerial the branch meanwhile continues to grow outwards and being supplied by its new support thickens beyond it whence the props always slant outwards from the ground towards the circumference of the tree  cycas trees abound in the gardens and though generally having only one or rarely two crowns they have sometimes sixteen and their stems are everywhere covered with leafy buds which are developed on any check being given to the growth of the plant as by the operation of transplantation which will cause as many as 300 buds to appear in the course of a few years on a trunk eight feet high  during my stay at the gardens dr falconer received a box of living plants packed in moss and transported in a frozen state by one of the ice ships from north america the ice from these ships is sold in the calcutta market for a penny a pound to great profit it has already proved an invaluable remedy in cases of inflammation and fever and has diminished mortality to a very appreciable extent they left in november and arriving in march i was present at the opening of the boxes and saw 391 plants the whole contents taken out in the most perfect state they were chiefly fruittrees apples pears peaches currants and gooseberries with beautiful plants of the venus flytrap dionaea muscipula more perfect success never attended an experiment the plants were in vigorous bud and the day after being released from their icy bonds the leaves sprouted and unfolded and they were packed in wards cases for immediate transport to the himalaya mountains  my visit to calcutta enabled me to compare my instruments with the standards at the observatory in which i was assisted by my friend capt thuillier to whose kind offices on this and many other occasions i am greatly indebted  i returned to dorjiling on the 17th of april and dr thomson and i commenced our arrangements for proceeding to the khasia mountains we started on the 1st of may and i bade adieu to dorjiling with no light heart for i was leaving the kindest and most disinterested friends i had ever made in a foreign land and a country whose mountains forests productions and people had all become endeared to me by many ties and associations the prospects of dorjiling itself are neither doubtful nor insignificant whether or not sikkim will fall again under the protection of britain the station must prosper and that very speedily i had seen both its native population and its european houses doubled in two years its salubrious climate its scenery and accessibility ensure it so rapid a further increase that it will become the most populous hillstation in india strong prejudices against a damp climate and the complaints of loungers and idlers who only seek pleasure together with a groundless fear of the natives have hitherto retarded its progress but its natural advantages will outweigh these and all other obstacles  i am aware that my opinion of the ultimate success of dorjiling is not shared by the general public of india and must be pardoned for considering their views in this matter shortsighted with regard to the disagreeables of its climate i can sufficiently appreciate them and shall be considered by the residents to have overestimated the amount and constancy of mist rain and humidity from the two seasons i spent there being exceptional in these respects whilst on the one hand i am willing to admit the probability of this i am informed that hardly a shower of rain has fallen this season between november 1852 and april 1853 and a very little snow in february only i may be allowed on the other to say that i have never visited any spot under the sun where i was not told that the season was exceptional and generally for the worse added to which there is no better and equally salubrious climate east of nepal accessible from calcutta  all climates are comparative and fixed residents naturally praise their own i have visited many latitudes and can truly say that i have found no two climates resembling each other and that all alike are complained of that of dorjiling is above the average in point of comfort and for perfect salubrity rivals any while in variety interest and grandeur the scenery is unequalled  from sikkim to the khasia mountains our course was by boat down the mahanuddy to the upper gangetic delta whose many branches we followed eastwards to the megna whence we ascended the soormah to the silhet district we arrived at kishengunj on the mahanuddy on the 3rd of may and were delayed two days for our boat which should have been waiting here to take us to berhampore on the ganges we were however hospitably received by mr perrys family  the approach of the rains was indicated by violent easterly storms of thunder lightning and rain the thermometer ranging from 70 degrees  to 85 degrees the country around kishengunj is flat and very barren it is composed of a deep sandy soil covered with a short turf now swarming with cockchafers water is found ten or twelve feet below the surface and may be supplied by underground streams from the himalaya distant fortyfive miles the river which at this season is low may be navigated up to titalya during the rains its bed averages 60 yards in width and is extremely tortuous the current is slight and though shallow the water is opaque we slowly descended to maldah where we arrived on the 11th the temperature both of the water and of the air increased rapidly to upwards of 90 degrees the former was always a few degrees cooler than the air by day and warmer by night the atmosphere became drier as we receded from the mountains  the boatmen always brought up by the shore at night and our progress was so slow that we could keep up with the boat when walking along the bank so long as the soil and riverbed continued sandy few bushes or herbs were to be found and it was difficult to collect a hundred kinds of plants in a day gradually however clumps of trees appeared with jujube bushes trophis acacia and buddleia a few fanpalms bamboos and jacktrees a shell anodon was the only one seen in the river which harboured few waterplants or birds and neither alligators nor porpoises ascend so high  on the 7th of may about eighty miles in a straight line from the foot of the himalaya we found the stratified sandy banks which had gradually risen to a height of thirteen feet replaced by the hard alluvial clay of the gangetic valley which underlies the sand the stream contracted and the features of its banks were materially improved by a jungle of tamarisk wormwood artemisia and white rosebushes rosa involucrata whilst mango trees became common with tamarinds banyan and figs date and caryota palms and rattan canes grew in the woods and parasitic orchids on the trees which were covered with a climbing fern acrosticum scandens so that we easily doubled our flora of the river banks before arriving at maldah  this once populous town is like berhampore now quite decayed since the decline of its silk and indigo trades the staple product called maldy a mixture of silk and cotton very durable and which washes well now forms its only trade and is exported through sikkim to the northwest provinces and tibet it is still famous for the size and excellence of its mangos which ripen late in may but this year the crop had been destroyed by the damp heats of spring the usual northwest dry winds not having prevailed  the ruins of the once famous city of gour a few miles distant are now covered with jungle and the buildings are fast disappearing owing to the bricks being carried away to be used elsewhere  below maldah the river gets broader and willow becomes common we found specimens of a planorbis in the mud of the stream and saw apparently a boring shell in the alluvium but could not land to examine it chalky masses of alligators droppings like coprolites are very common buried in the banks which become twenty feet high at the junction with the ganges where we arrived on the 14th the waters of this great river were nearly two degrees cooler than those of the mahanuddy  ramporebauleah is a large station on the north bank of the ganges whose stream is at this season fully a mile wide with a very slow current its banks are thirty feet above the water we were most kindly received by mr bell the collector of the district to whom we were greatly indebted for furthering us on our voyage boats being very difficult to procure we were however detained here from the 16th to the 19th i was fortunate in being able to compare my barometers with a firstrate standard instrument and in finding no appreciable alteration since leaving calcutta in the previous april the elevation of the station is 130 feet above the sea that of kishengunj i made 131 so that the gangetic valley is nearly a dead level for fully a hundred miles north beyond which it rises titalya 150 miles to the north being 360 feet and siligoree at the margin of the terai rather higher the river again falls more considerably than the land the mahanuddy at kishengunj being about twenty feet below the level of the plains or 110 above the sea whereas the ganges at rampore is probably not more than eighty feet even when the water is highest  the climate of rampore is marked by greater extremes than that of calcutta during our stay the temperature rose above 106 degrees and fell to 78 degrees at night the mean was 25 degrees higher than at calcutta which is 126 miles further south being at the head of the gangetic delta which points from the sunderbunds obliquely to the northwest it is much damper than any locality further west as is evidenced by two kinds of calamus palm abounding which do not ascend the ganges beyond monghyr advancing eastwards the dry northwest wind of the gangetic valley which blows here in occasional gusts is hardly felt and easterly winds rising after the sun or in other words following the heating of the open dry country blow down the great valley of the burrampooter or southeasterly ones come up from the bay of bengal the western head of the gangetic delta is thus placed in what are called the variables in naval phraseology but only so far as its superficial winds are concerned for its great atmospheric current always blows from the bay of bengal and flows over all northern india to the lofty regions of central asia  at rampore i found the temperature of the ground at three feet depth varied from 878 degrees to 898 degrees being considerably lower than that of the air 942 degrees whilst that of a fine ripening shaddock into which i plunged a thermometer bulb varied little from 81 degrees whether the sun shone on it or not from this place we made very slow progress southeastwards with a gentle current but against constant easterly winds and often violent gales and thunderstorms which obliged us to bring up under shelter of banks and islands of sand sometimes we sailed along the broad river whose opposite shores were rarely both visible at once and at others tracked the boat through narrow creeks that unite the many himalayan streams and form a network soon after leaving their mountain valleys  a few miles beyond pubna we passed from a narrow canal at once into the main stream of the burrampooter at jaffergunj our maps had led us to expect that it flowed fully seventy miles to the eastward in this latitude and we were surprised to hear that within the last twenty years the main body of that river had shifted its course thus far to the westward this alteration was not effected by the gradual working westwards of the main stream but by the old eastern channel so rapidly silting up as to be now unnavigable while the jummul which receives the teesta and which is laterally connected by branches with the burrampooter became consequently wider and deeper and eventually the principal stream  nothing can be more dreary and uninteresting than the scenery of this part of the delta the water is claycoloured and turbid always cooler than the air which again was 4 degrees or 5 degrees below that of calcutta with a damper atmosphere the banks are of stratified sand and mud hardly raised above the mean level of the country and consequently unlike those bordering most annually flooded rivers for here the material is so unstable that the current yearly changes its course a wiry grass sometimes feebly binds the loose soil on which there are neither houses nor cultivation  ascending the jummul now the main channel of the burrampooter for a few miles we turned off into a narrower channel sixty miles long which passes by dacca where we arrived on the 28th and where we were again detained for boats the demand for which is rapidly increasing with the extended cultivation of the sunderbunds and delta we stayed with mr atherton and botanised in the neighbourhood of the town which was once very extensive and is still large though not flourishing the population is mostly mahometan the site though beautiful and varied is unhealthy for europeans ruins of great moorish brick buildings still remain and a greek style of ornamenting the houses prevails to a remarkable degree  the manufacture of rings for the arms and ancles from conchshells imported from the malayan archipelago is still almost confined to dacca the shells are sawn across for this purpose by semicircular saws the hands and toes being both actively employed in the operation the introduction of circular saws has been attempted by some european gentlemen but steadily resisted by the natives despite their obvious advantages the dacca muslin manufacture which once employed thousands of hands is quite at an end so that it was with great difficulty that the specimens of these fabrics sent to the great exhibition of 1851 were procured the kind of cotton which is very short in the staple employed is now hardly grown and scarcely a loom exists which is fit for the finest fabrics the jewellers still excel in gold and silver filagree  pineapples plantains mangos and oranges abound in the dacca market betokening a better climate for tropical fruits than that of western bengal and we also saw the fruit of euryale ferox an indian waterlily with a small red flower covered everywhere with prickles and so closely allied to victoria regia as to be scarcely generically distinguishable from it it grows in the eastern sunderbunds and also in kashmir the discoverer of victoria called the latter euryale amazonica these interestiug plants are growing side by side in the new victoria house at kew the chinese species has been erroneously considered different from the indian one which is round soft pulpy and the size of a small orange it contains from eight to fifteen round black seeds as large as peas which are full of flour and are eaten roasted in india and china in which latter country the plant is said to have been in cultivation for upwards of 3000 years  the native vegetation is very similar to that of the hoogly except that the white rose is frequent here the fact of a plant of this genus being as common on the plains of bengal as a dogrose is in england and associated with cocoanuts palms mangos plantains and banyans has never yet attracted the attention of botanists though the species was described by roxburgh as a geographical fact it is of great importance for the rose is usually considered a northern genus and no kind but this inhabits a damp hot tropical climate even in mountainous countries situated near the equator as in the himalaya and andes wild roses are very rare and only found at great elevations whilst they are unknown in the southern hemisphere it is curious that this rose which is also a native of birma and the indian peninsula does not in this latitude grow west of the meridian of 87 degrees it is confined to the upper gangetic delta and inhabits a climate in which it would least of all be looked for  i made the elevation of dacca by barometer only seventytwo feet above the sea and the banks of the dallisary being high the level of its waters at this season is scarcely above that of the bay of bengal the mean temperature of the air was 8675 degrees during our stay or half a degree lower than calcutta at the same period  we pursued our voyage on the 30th of may to the old bed of the burrampooter an immense shallow sheet of water of which the eastern bank is for eighty miles occupied by the delta of the soormah this river rises on the munnipore frontier and flows through cachar silhet and the jheels of east bengal receiving the waters of the cachar jyntea khasia and garrow mountains which bound the assam valley to the south and of the tipperah hills which stretch parallel to them and divide the soormah valley from the bay of bengal the immense area thus drained by the soormah is hardly raised above the level of the sea and covers about 10000 square miles the anastomosing rivers that traverse it flow very gently and do not materially alter their course hence their banks gradually rise above the mean level of the surrounding country and on them the small villages are built surrounded by extensive ricefields that need no artificial irrigation at this season the general surface of the jheels is marshy but during the rains which are excessive on the neighbouring mountains they resemble an inland sea the water rising gradually to within a few inches of the floor of the huts as however it subsides as slowly in autumn it commits no devastation the communication is at all seasons by boats in the management of which the natives chiefly mahometans are expert  the want of trees and shrubs is the most remarkable feature of the jheels in which respect they differ from the sunderbunds though the other physical features of each are similar the level being exactly the same for this difference there is no apparent cause beyond the influence of the tide and sea atmosphere long grasses of tropical genera saccharum donax andropogon and rottboellia ten feet high form the bulk of the vegetation with occasional low bushes along the firmer banks of the natural canals that everywhere intersect the country amongst these the rattan cane calamus rose a laurel stravadium and fig are the most common while beautiful convolvuli throw their flowering shoots across the water  the soil which is sandy along the burrampooter is more muddy and clayey in the centre of the jheels with immense spongy accumulations of vegetable matter in the marshes through which we poked the boatstaves without finding bottom they were for the most part formed of decomposed grass roots with occasionally leaves but no quantity of moss or woody plants along the courses of the greater streams drift timber and various organic fragments are no doubt imbedded but as there is no current over the greater part of the flooded surface there can be little or no accumulation except perhaps of old canoes or of such vegetables as grow on the spot the waters are darkcoloured but clear and lucid even at their height  we proceeded up the burrampooter crossing it obliquely its banks were on the average five miles apart and formed of sand without clay and very little silt or mud the water was clear and brown like that of the jheels and very different from that of the jummul we thence turned eastwards into the delta of the soormah which we traversed in a northeasterly direction to the stream itself we often passed through very narrow channels where the grasses towered over the boats the boatmen steered in and out of them as they pleased and we were utterly at a loss to know how they guided themselves as they had neither compass nor map and there were few villages or landmarks and on climbing the mast we saw multitudes of other masts and sails peeing over the grassy marshes doing just the same as we did all that go up have the southwest wind in their favour and this helps them to their course but beyond this they have no other guide but that instinct which habit begets often we had to retreat from channels that promised to prove short cuts but which turned out to be blind alleys sometimes we sailed up broader streams of chesnutbrown water accompanied by fleets of boats repairing to the populous districts at the foot of the khasia for rice timber lime coal bamboos and long reeds for thatching all of which employ an inland navy throughout the year in their transport to calcutta  leeches and mosquitos were very troublesome the latter appearing in clouds at night during the day they were rarer but the species was the same a large crayfish was common but there were few birds and no animals to be seen  fiftyfour barometric observations taken at the level of the water on the voyage between dacca and the soormah and compared with calcutta showed a gradual rise of the mercury in proceeding eastwards for though the pressure at calcutta was 055 of an inch higher than at dacca it was 034 lower than on the soormah the mean difference between all these observations and the contemporaneous ones at calcutta was  003 in favour of calcutta and the temperature half a degree lower the dewpoint and humidity were nearly the same at both places this being the driest season of the year it is very probable that the mean level of the water at this part of the delta is not higher than that of the bay of bengal but as we advanced northwards towards the khasia and entered the soormah itself the atmospheric pressure increased further thus appearing to give the bed of that stream a depression of thirtyfive feet below the bay of bengal into which it flows this was no doubt the result of unequal atmospheric pressure at the two localities caused by the disturbance of the column of atmosphere by the khasia mountains for in december of the same year thirtyeight observations on the surface of the soormah made its bed fortysix feet above the bay of bengal whilst from twentythree observations on the megna the pressure only differed  0020 of an inch from that of the barometer at calcutta which is eighteen feet above the sealevel  these barometric levellings though far from satisfactory as compared with trigonometric are extremely interesting in the absence of the latter in a scientific point of view nothing has been done towards determining the levels of the land and waters of the great gangetic delta since rennells time yet no geodetical operation promises more valuable results in geography and physical geology than running three lines of level across its area from chittagong to calcutta from silhet to rampore and from calcutta to silhet the foot of the sikkim himalaya has i believe been connected with calcutta by the great trigonometrical survey but i am given to understand that the results are not published  my own barometric levellings would make the bed of the mahanuddy and ganges at the western extremity of the delta considerably higher than i should have expected considering how gentle the current is and that the season was that of low water if my observations are correct they probably indicate a diminished pressure which is not easily accounted for the lower portion of the atmospheric column at rampore being considerably drier and therefore heavier than at calcutta at the eastern extremity again towards silhet the atmosphere is much damper than at calcutta and the barometer should therefore have stood lower indicating a higher level of the waters than is the case  to the geologist the jheels and sunderbunds are a most instructive region as whatever may be the mean elevation of their waters a permanent depression of ten to fifteen feet would submerge an immense tract which the ganges burrampooter and soormah would soon cover with beds of silt and sand there would be extremely few shells in the beds thus formed the southern and northern divisions of which would present two very different floras and faunas and would in all probability be referred by future geologists to widely different epochs to the north beds of peat would be formed by grasses and in other parts temperate and tropical forms of plants and animals would be preserved in such equally balanced proportions as to confound the palaeontologist with the bones of the longsnouted alligator gangetic porpoise indian cow buffalo rhinoceros elephant tiger deer boar and a host of other animals he would meet with acorns of several species of oak pinecones and magnolia fruits rose seeds and cycas nuts with palm nuts screwpines and other tropical productions on the other hand the sunderbunds portion though containing also the bones of the tiger deer and buffalo would have none of the indian cow rhinoceros or elephant there would be different species of porpoise alligator and deer and none of the above mentioned plants cycas oak pine magnolia and rose which would be replaced by numerous others all distinct from those of the jheels and many of them indicative of the influence of salt water whose proximity from the rarity of seashells might not otherwise be suspected  illustrationview in the jheels  on the 1st of june we entered the soormah a full and muddy stream flowing west a quarter of a mile broad with banks of mud and clay twelve or fifteen feet high separating it from marshes and covered with betelnut and cocoanut palms figs and banyans many small villages were scattered along the banks each with a swarm of boats and rude kilns for burning the lime brought from the khasia mountains which is done with grass and bushes we ascended to chattuc against a gentle current arriving on the 9th  from this place the khasia mountains are seen as a long tabletopped range running east and west about 4000 to 5000 feet high with steep faces towards the jheels out of which they appear to rise abruptly though twelve miles distant large waterfalls are very clearly seen precipitating themselves over the cliffs into a bright green mass of foliage that seems to creep half way up their flanks the nearly horizontal arrangement of the strata is as conspicuous here as in the sandstone of the kymore hills in the soane valley which these mountains a good deal resemble but they are much higher and the climate is widely different large valleys enter the hills and are divided by hogbacked spurs and it is far within these valleys that the waterfalls and precipices occur but the nearer and further cliffs being thrown by perspective into one range they seem to rise out of the jheels so abruptly as to remind one of some precipitous island in the ocean  chattuc is mainly indebted for its existence to the late mr inglis who resided there for upwards of sixty years and opened a most important trade between the khasia and calcutta in oranges potatos coal lime and timber we were kindly received by his son whose bungalow occupies a knoll of which there are several which attracted our attention as being the only elevations fifty feet high which we had ascended since leaving the foot of the sikkim himalaya they rise as islets commonly called teela beng out of the jheels within twelve to twenty miles of the khasia they are chiefly formed of stratified gravel and sand and are always occupied by villages and large trees they seldom exceed sixty feet in height and increase in number and size as the hills are approached they are probably the remains of a deposit that was once spread uniformly along the foot of the mountains and they in all respects resemble those i have described as rising abruptly from the plains near titalya see vol i chapter xvii  the climate of chattuc is excessively damp and hot throughout the year but though sunk amid interminable swamps the place is perfectly healthy such indeed is the character of the climate throughout the jheels where fevers and agues are rare and though no situations can appear more malarious to the common observer than silhet and cachar they are in fact eminently salubrious these facts admit of no explanation in the present state of our knowledge of endemic diseases much may be attributed to the great amount and purity of the water the equability of the climate the absence of forests and of sudden changes from wet to dry but such facts afford no satisfactory explanation the water as i have above said is of a rich chesnutbrown in the narrow creeks of the jheels and is golden yellow by transmitted light owing no doubt as in bog water and that of dunghills to a vegetable extractive and probably the presence of carburetted hydrogen humboldt mentions this darkcoloured water as prevailing in some of the swamps of the cassiquares at the junction of the orinoco and amazon and gives much curious information on its accompanying features of animal and vegetable life  the rains generally commence in may they were unusually late this year though the almost daily gales and thunderstorms we experienced foretold their speedy arrival from may till october they are unremitting and the country is under water the soormah rising about fifty feet northeasterly winds prevail but they are a local current reflected from the khasia against which the southerly perennial tradewind impinges westerly winds are very rare but the dry northwest blasts of india have been known to traverse the delta and reach this meridian in one or two short hot dry puffs during march and april hoarfrost is unknown it however forms further south at the very mouth of the megna and is the effect of intense radiation when the thermometer in the shade falls to 45 degrees  china roses and tropical plants bignoniae asclepiadeae and convolvuli rendered mr inglis bungalow gay but little else will grow in the gardens pineapples are the best fruit and oranges from the foot of the khasia plantains ripen imperfectly and the mango is always acid attacked by grubs and having a flavour of turpentine the violent hailstorms of the vernal equinox cut both spring and cold season flowers and vegetables and the rains destroy all summer products the soil is a wet clay in which some european vegetables thrive well if planted in october or november we were shown marrowfat peas that had been grown for thirty years without degenerating in size but their flavour was poor  small long canoes paddled rapidly by two men were procured here whereby to ascend the narrow rivers that lead up to the foot of the mountains they each carry one passenger who lies along the bottom protected by a bamboo platted arched roof we started at night and early the next morning arrived at pundua pundua though an insignificant village surrounded by swamps has enjoyed an undue share of popularity as a botanical region before the geographical features of the country north of silhet were known the plants brought from those hills by native collectors were sent to the calcutta garden and thence to europe as from pundua hence silhet mountains and pundua mountains both very erroneous terms are constantly met with in botanical works and generally refer to plants growing in the khasia mountains where there is a dilapidated bungalow the inhabitants are employed in the debarkation of lime coal and potatos large fleets of boats crowded the narrow creeks some of the vessels being of several tons burden  elephants were kindly sent here for us by mr h inglis to take us to the foot of the mountains about three miles distant and relays of mules and ponies to ascend to churra where we were received with the greatest hospitality by that gentleman who entertained us till the end of june and procured us servants and collectors to his kind offices we were also indebted throughout our travels in the khasia for much information and for facilities and necessaries of all kinds things in which the traveller is more dependent on his fellow countrymen in india than in any other part of the world  we spent two days at pundua waiting for our great boats which drew several feet of water and collecting in the vicinity the old bungalow without windows and with the roof falling in was a most miserable shelter and whichever way we turned from the door a river or a swamp lay before us birds mosquitos leeches and large wasps swarmed also rats and sandflies a more pestilential hole cannot be conceived and yet people traverse this district and sleep here at all seasons of the year with impunity we did so ourselves in the month of june when the sikkim and all other terais are deadly we returned in september traversing the jheels and nullahs at the very foot of the hills during a short break of fine weather in the middle of the rains and we again slept here in november at the north foot of the khasia in the heavily timbered dry terai stretching for sixty miles to the burrampooter it is almost inevitable death for a european to sleep any time between the end of april and of november many have crossed that tract but not one without taking fever mr h inglis was the only survivor of a party of five and he was ill from the effects for upwards of two years after having been brought to deaths door by the first attack which came on within three weeks of his arrival at churra and by several relapses always exposed in the heat of the day to wet and fatigue and never having even a soupcon of fever ague or rheumatism this immunity does not however extend to the very foot of the hills as it is considered imprudent to sleep at this season in the bungalow of terrya only three miles off  the elevation of pundua bungalow is about forty feet above the sea and that of the waters surrounding it from ten to thirty according to the season in june the mean of the barometer readings at the bungalow was absolutely identical with that of the calcutta barometer in september it was 0016 inch lower and in november 0066 lower the mean annual temperature throughout the jheels is less than 2 degrees below that of calcutta  terrya bungalow lies at the very foot of the first rise of the mountains on the way we crossed many small streams upon the elephants and one large one by canoes the water in all was cool temperature in september 77 degrees to 80 degrees and in november 757 degrees and sparkling running rapidly over boulders and pebbles their banks of sandy clay were beautifully fringed with a willowlike laurel ehretia bushes bamboos palms bauhinia bombax and erythrina over which calamus palm rattan and various flowering plants climbed the rock at terrya is a nummulitic limestone worn into extensive caverns this formation is said to extend along the southern flank of the khasia garrow and jyntea mountains and to be associated with sandstone and coal it is extensively quarried in many places several thousand tons being annually shipped for calcutta and dacca it is succeeded by a horizontally stratified sandstone which is continued up to 4000 feet where it is overlain by coalbeds and then by limestone again  the subtropical scenery of the lower and outer sikkim himalaya though on a much more gigantic scale is not comparable in beauty and luxuriance with the really tropical vegetation induced by the hot damp and insular climate of these perennially humid mountains at the himalaya forests of gigantic trees many of them deciduous appear from a distance as masses of dark gray foliage clothing mountains 10000 feet high here the individual trees are smaller more varied in kind of a brilliant green and contrast with gray limestone and red sandstone rocks and silvery cataracts palms are more numerous here there are upwards of twenty kinds of palm in this district including chamaerops three species of areca two of wallichia arenga caryota three of phoenix plectocomia licuala and many species of calamus besides these there are several kinds of pandanus and the cycas pectinata the cultivated areca betelnut especially raising its graceful stem and feathery crown like an arrow shot down from heaven in luxuriance and beauty above the verdant slopes this difference is at once expressed to the indian botanist by defining the khasia flora as of malayan character by which is meant the prevalence of brilliant glossyleaved evergreen tribes of trees as euphorbiaceae and urticeae especially figs which abound in the hot gulleys where the property of their roots which inosculate and form natural grafts is taken advantage of in bridging streams and in constructing what are called living bridges of the most picturesque forms combretaceae oaks oranges garcinia gamboge diospyros figs jacks plantains and pandanus are more frequent here together with pinnated leaved leguminosae meliaceae vines and peppers and above all palms both climbing ones with pinnated shining leaves as calamus and plectocomia and erect ones with similar leaves as cultivated cocoanut areca and arenga and the broaderleaved wild betelnut and beautiful caryota or winepalm whose immense decompound leaves are twelve feet long laurels and wild nutmegs with henslowia itea etc were frequent in the forest with the usual prevalence of parasites mistleto epiphytical orchideae aeshynanthus ferns mosses and lycopodia and on the ground were rubiaceae scitamineae ferns acanthaceae beautiful balsams and herbaceous and shrubby nettles bamboos the natives enumerate about fourteen different kinds of bamboo of which we found five in flower belonging to three very distinct genera uspar uspet uspit usken uskong uktang usto silee namlang tirra and battooba are some of the names of bamboos vouched for by mr inglis as correctly spelt of other khasia names of plants wild plantains are called kairem and the cultivated kakesh the latter are considered so nourishing that they are given to newborn infants senteo is a flower in khas so a fruit ading a tree and te a leaf pandanus is kashelan plectocomia usmole licuala kuslow caryota kalaikatang wallichia kalainili areca waisola various calami are rhimet uriphin ureek hilla tindrio etc this list will serve as a specimen i might increase it materially but as i have elsewhere observed the value attached to the supposed definite application of native names to natural objects is greatly overrated and too much reliance on them has introduced a prodigious amount of confusion into scientific works and philological inquiries of many kinds are very abundant and these hills further differ remarkably from those of sikkim in the great number of species of grasses  the ascent was at first gradual along the sides of a sandstone spur at 2000 feet the slope suddenly became steep and rocky at 3000 feet tree vegetation disappeared and we opened a magnificent prospect of the upper scarped flank of the valley of moosmai which we were ascending with four or five beautiful cascades rolling over the table top of the hills broken into silvery foam as they leapt from ledge to ledge of the horizontally stratified precipice and throwing a veil of silver gauze over the gulf of emerald green vegetation 2000 feet below the views of the many cataracts of the first class that are thus precipitated over the bare tableland on which churra stands into the valleys on either side surpass anything of the kind that i have elsewhere seen though in many respects vividly recalling the scenery around rio de janeiro nor do i know any spot in the world more calculated to fascinate the naturalist who while appreciating the elements of which a landscape is composed is also keenly alive to the beauty and grandeur of tropical scenery  illustrationliving bridge formed by the aerial roots of the indiarubber and other kinds of figs  at the point where this view opens a bleak stony region commences bearing numberless plants of a temperate flora and of european genera at a comparatively low

village khas it was selected for a european station partly from the elevation and consequent healthiness of the spot and partly from its being on the high road from silhet to gowahatty on the burrampooter the capital of assam which is otherwise only accessible by ascending that river against both its current and the perennial east wind a rapid postal communication is hereby secured but the extreme unhealthiness of the northern foot of the mountains effectually precludes all other intercourse for nine months in the year  on the first opening up of the country the europeans were brought into sanguinary collision with the khasias who fought bravely with bows and arrows displaying a most bloodthirsty and cruel disposition this is indeed natural to them and murders continued very frequent as preludes to the most trifling robberies until the extreme penalty of our law was put in force even now some of the tributary rajahs are far from quiet under our rule and various parts of the country are not safe to travel in the garrows who occupy the western extremity of this range at the bend of the burrampooter are still in a savage state human sacrifices and polyandry are said to be frequent amongst them and their orgies are detestable happily we are hardly ever brought into collision with them except by their occasional depredations on the assam and khasia frontier their country is very unhealthy and is said to contain abundance of coal iron and lime  we seldom employed fewer than twelve or fourteen of the natives as collectors and when travelling from thirty to forty as coolies etc they are averse to rising early and are intolerably filthy in their persons though not so in their cottages which are very poor with broad grass roofs reaching nearly to the ground and usually encircled by bamboo fences the latter custom is not common in savage communities and perhaps indicates a dread of treachery the beams are of hewn wood they do not use saws often neatly carved and the doors turn on good wooden pivots they have no windows and the fire is made on the floor the utensils etc are placed on hanging shelves and in baskets  the khasia people are of the indochinese race they are short very stout and muscular with enormous calves and knees rather narrow eyes and little beard broad high cheekbones flat noses and open nostrils i believe that a few are tattooed the hair is gathered into a topknot and sometimes shaved off the forehead and temples a loose cotton shirt often striped blue and red without sleeves and bordered with long thread fringes is their principal garment it is gathered into a girdle of silver chains by people of rank a cotton robe is sometimes added with a large cotton turban or small skullcap the women wear a long cloth tied in a knot across the breast during festivals both men and women load themselves with silk robes fans peacocks feathers and gold and silver ornaments of great value procured from assam many of which are said to be extremely curious but i regret to say that i never saw any of them on these occasions spirits are drunk and dancing kept up all night the dance is described as a slow ungraceful motion the women being tightly swathed in cloths  all their materials are brought from assam the only articles in constant use of their own manufacture being a rude sword or knife with a wooden handle and a long narrow straight blade of iron and the baskets with headstraps like those used by the lepchas but much neater also a netted bag of pineapple fibre said to come from silhet which holds a claspknife comb flint steel and betelnut box they are much addicted to chewing pawn betelnut pepper leaves and lime all day long and their red saliva looks like blood on the paths besides the sword i have described they carry bows and arrows and rarely a lance and a bamboo wickerwork shield  we found the khasias to be sulky intractable fellows contrasting unpleasantly with the lepchas wanting in quickness frankness and desire to please and obtrusively independent in manner nevertheless we had a head man who was very much the reverse of this and whom we had never any cause to blame their language is i believe indochinese and monosyllabic it is disagreeably nasal and guttural and there are several dialects and accents in contiguous villages all inflections are made by prefixing syllables and when using the hindoo language the future is invariably substituted for the past tense they count up to a hundred and estimate distances by the number of mouthfuls of pawn they eat on the road  education has been attempted by missionaries with partial success and the natives are said to have shown themselves apt scholars marriage is a very loose tie amongst them and hardly any ceremony attends it we were informed that the husband does not take his wife home but enters her fathers household and is entertained there divorce and an exchange of wives is common and attended with no disgrace thus the son often forgets his fathers name and person before he grows up but becomes strongly attached to his mother the sisters son inherits both property and rank and the proprietors or rajahs offspring are consequently often reared in poverty and neglect the usual toy of the children is the bow and arrow with which they are seldom expert they are said also to spin pegtops like the english climb a greased pole and run round with a beam turning horizontally on an upright to which it is attached by a pivot  the khasias eat fowls and all meat especially pork potatos and vegetables dried and half putrid fish in abundance but they have an aversion to milk which is very remarkable as a great proportion of their country is admirably adapted for pasturage in this respect however they assimilate to the chinese and many indochinese nations who are indifferent to milk as are the sikkim people the bengalees hindoos and tibetans on the other hand consume immense quantities of milk they have no sheep and few goats or cattle the latter of which are kept for slaughter they have however plenty  of pigs and fowls eggs are most abundant but used for omens only and it is a common but disgusting occurrence to see large groups employed for hours in breaking them upon stones shouting and quarrelling surrounded by the mixture of yellow yolks and their red pawn saliva  the funeral ceremonies are the only ones of any importance and are often conducted with barbaric pomp and expense and rude stones of gigantic proportions are erected as monuments singly or in rows circles or supporting one another like those of stonehenge which they rival in dimensions and appearance the body is burned though seldom during the rains from the difficulty of obtaining a fire it is therefore preserved in honey which is abundant and good till the dry season a practice i have read of as prevailing among some tribes in the malay peninsula spirits are drunk on these occasions but the hill khasia is not addicted to drunkenness though some of the natives of the low valleys are very much so these ascend the rocky faces of the mountains by ladders to the churra markets and return loaded at night apparently all but too drunk to stand yet they never miss their footing in places which are most dangerous to persons unaccustomed to such situations  illustrationthe tableland and station of churra with the jheels course of the soormah river and tipperah hills in the extreme distance looking south  the khasias are superstitious but have no religion like the lepchas they believe in a supreme being and in deities of the grove cave and stream altercations are often decided by holding the disputants heads under water when the longest winded carries his point fining is a common punishment and death for grave offences the changes of the moon are accounted for by the theory that this orb who is a man monthly falls in love with his wifes mother who throws ashes in his face the sun is female and mr yule i am indebted to mr inglis for most of this information relating to the khasias which i have since found with much more that is curious and interesting in a paper by lieut yule in bengal asiat soc journal who is my authority says that the pleiades are called the henman as in italy the chickens also that they have names for the twelve months they do not divide their time by weeks but hold a market every four days these people are industrious and good cultivators of rice millet and legumes of many kinds potatoes were introduced amongst them about twenty years ago by mr inglis and they have increased so rapidly that the calcutta market is now supplied by their produce they keep bees in rude hives of logs of wood  the flat tableland on which churra poonji is placed is three miles long and two broad dipping abruptly in front and on both sides and rising behind towards the main range of which it is a spur the surface of this area is everywhere intersected by shallow rocky watercourses which are the natural drains for the deluge that annually visits it the western part is undulated and hilly the southern rises in rocky ridges of limestone and coal and the eastern is very flat and stony broken only by low isolated conical mounds  the scenery varies extremely at different parts of the surface towards the flat portion where the english reside the aspect is as bleak and inhospitable as can be imagined a thin stratum of marshy or sandy soil covers a tabular mass of cold red sandstone and there is not a tree and scarcely a shrub to be seen except occasional clumps of pandanus the low white bungalows are few in number and very scattered some of them being a mile asunder enclosed with stone walls and shrubs and a small white church disused on account of the damp stands lonely in the centre of all  the views from the margins of this plateau are magnificent 4000 feet below are baylike valleys carpetted as with green velvet from which rise tall palms treeferns with spreading crowns and rattans shooting their pointed heads surrounded with feathery foliage as with ostrich plumes far above the great trees beyond are the jheels looking like a broad shallow sea with the tide half out bounded in the blue distance by the lowhills of tipperah to the right and left are the scarped red rocks and roaring waterfalls shooting far over the cliffs and then arching their necks as they expand in feathery foam over which rainbows float forming and dissolving as the wind sways the curtains of spray from side to side  to the south of churra the lime and coal measures rise abruptly in flattopped craggy hills covered with brushwood and small trees similar hills are seen far westward across the intervening valleys in the garrow country rising in a series of steep isolated ranges 300 to 400 feet above the general level of the country and always skirting the south face of the mountains considerable caverns penetrate the limestone the broken surface of which rock presents many picturesque and beautiful spots like the same rocks in england  westward the plateau becomes very hilly bare and grassy with the streams broad and full but superficial and rocky precipitating themselves in low cascades over tabular masses of sandstone at mamloo their beds are deeper and full of brushwood and a splendid valley and amphitheatre of red cliffs and cascades rivalling those of moosmai chapter xxvii bursts suddenly into view mamloo is a large village on the top of a spur to the westward it is buried in a small forest particularly rich in plants and is defended by a stone wall behind the only road is tunnelled through the sandstone rock under the wall and the spur on either side dips precipitously so that the place is almost impregnable if properly defended a sanguinary conflict took place here between the british and the khasias which terminated in the latter being driven over the precipices beneath which many of them were shot the fanpalm chamaerops khasiana pakha khas grows on the cliffs near mamloo it may be seen on looking over the edge of the plateau its long curved trunk rising out of the naked rocks but its site is generally inaccessible this species is very closely allied to if not identical with p martiana of nepal which ascends to 8000 feet in the western himalaya where it is annually covered with snow it is not found in sikkim but an allied species occurs in affghanistan called p ritcheana the dwarf palm of southern europe is a fourth species while near it grows the saxifragis ciliaris of our english gardens a common plant in the northwest himalaya but extremely scarce in sikkim and the khasia mountains  illustrationmamloo cascades  the descent of the mamloo spur is by steps alternating with pebbly flats for 1500 feet to a saddle which connects the churra hills with those of lisouplang to the westward the rise is along a very steep narrow ridge to a broad long grassy hill 3500 feet high whence an extremely steep descent leads to the valley of the bogapanee and the great mart of chela which is at the embouchure of that river the transverse valley thus formed by the mamloo spur is full of orange groves whose brilliant green is particularly conspicuous from above at the saddle below mamloo are some jasper rocks which are the sandstone altered by basalt fossil shells are recorded to have been found by dr mlelland see a paper on the geology of the khasia mountains by dr mlelland in the bengal asiatic societys journal on some of the flats which he considers to be raised beaches but we sought in vain for any evidence of this theory beyond the pebbles whose rounding we attributed to the action of superficial streams  it is extremely difficult to give within the limits of this narrative any idea of the khasia flora which is in extent and number of fine plants the richest in india and probably in all asia we collected upwards of 2000 flowering plants within ten miles of the station of churra besides 150 ferns and a profusion of mosses lichens and fungi this extraordinary exuberance of species is not so much attributable to the elevation for the whole sikkim himalaya three times more elevated does not contain 500 more flowering plants and far fewer ferns etc but to the variety of exposures namely 1 the jheels 2 the tropical jungles both in deep hot and wet valleys and on drier slopes 3 the rocks 4 the bleak tablelands and stony soils 5 the moorlike uplands naked and exposed where many species and genera appear at 5000 to 6000 feet which are not found on the outer ranges of sikkim under 10000 as thalictrum anemone primrose cowslip tofieldia yew pine saxifrage delphinium pedicularis in fact strange as it may appear owing to this last cause the temperate flora descends fully 4000 feet lower in the latitude of khasia 25 degrees n than in that of sikkim 27 degrees n though the former is two degrees nearer the equator  the pandanus alone forms a conspicuous feature in the immediate vicinity of churra while the small woods about mamloo moosmai and the coalpits are composed of symplocos laurels brambles and jasmines mixed with small oaks and photinia and many tropical genera of trees and shrubs  orchideae are perhaps the largest natural order in the khasia where fully 250 kinds grow chiefly on trees and rocks but many are terrestrial inhabiting damp woods and grassy slopes i doubt whether in any other part of the globe the species of orchids outnumber those of any other natural order or form so large a proportion of the flora balsams are next in relative abundance about twentyfive both tropical and temperate kinds of great beauty and variety in colour form and size of blossom palms amount to fourteen of which the chamaerops and arenga are the only genera not found in sikkim of bamboos there are also fifteen and of other grasses 150 which is an immense proportion considering that the indian flora including those of ceylon kashmir and all the himalaya hardly contains 400 scitamineae also are abundant and extremely beautiful we collected thirtyseven kinds  no rhododendron grows at churra but several species occur a little further north there is but one pine p khasiana besides the yew and two podocarpi and that is only found in the drier interior regions singular to say it is a species not seen in the himalaya or elsewhere but very nearly allied to pinua longifolia conebearing pines with long leaves like the common scotch fir are found in asia and as far south as the equator in borneo and also inhabit arracan the malay peninsula sumatra and south china it is a very remarkable fact that no gymnospermous tree inhabits the peninsula of india not even the genus podocarpus which includes most of the tropical gymnosperms and is technically coniferous and has glandular woody fibre though like the yew it bears berries two species of this genus are found in the khasia and one advances as far west as nepal the absence of oaks and of the above genera podocarpus and pinus is one of the most characteristic differences between the botany of the east and west shores of the bay of bengal though more closely resembling the scotch fir than that tree does  the natural orders whose rarity is most noticeable are cruciferae represented by only three kinds and caryophylleae of ranunculaceae there are six or seven species of clematis two of anemone one delphinium three of thalictrum and two ranunculi compsitae and leguminosae are far more numerous than in sikkim  the climate of khasia is remarkable for the excessive rainfall attention was first drawn to this by mr yule who stated that in the month of august 1841 264 inches fell or twentytwo feet and that during five successive days thirty inches fell in every twentyfour hours dr thomson and i also recorded thirty inches in one day and night and during the seven months of our stay upwards of 500 inches fell so that the total annual fall perhaps greatly exceeded 600 inches or fifty feet which has been registered in succeeding years from april 1849 to april 1850 502 inches fortytwo feet fell this unparalleled amount is attributable to the abruptness of the mountains which face the bay of bengal from which they are separated by 200 miles of jheels and sunderbunds  this fall is very local at silhet not thirty miles further south it is under 100 inches at gowahatty north of the khasia in assam it is about 80 and even on the hills twenty miles inland from churra itself the fall is reduced to 200 at the churra station the distribution of the rain is very local my gauges though registering the same amount when placed beside a good one in the station when removed half a mile received a widely different quantity though the different gauges gave nearly the same mean amount at the end of each whole month  the direct effect of this deluge is to raise the little streams about churra fourteen feet in as many hours and to inundate the whole flat from which however the natural drainage is so complete as to render a tract which in such a climate and latitude should be clothed with exuberant forest so sterile that no tree finds support and there is no soil for cultivation of any kind whatsoever not even of rice owing however to the hardness of the horizontally stratified sandstone the streams have not cut deep channels nor have the cataracts worked far back into the cliffs the limestone alone seems to suffer and the turbid streams from it prove how rapidly it is becoming denuded the great mounds of angular gravel on the churra flat are perhaps the remains of an extensive deposit fifty feet thick elsewhere washed away by these rains and i have remarked traces of the same over many slopes of the hills around  the mean temperature of churra elev 4000 feet is about 66 degrees or 16 degrees below that of calcutta which allowing for 22 degrees of northing gives 1 degree of temperature to every 290 to 300 feet of ascent in summer the thermometer often rises to 88 degrees and 90 degrees and in the winter owing to the intense radiation hoarfrost is frequent such a climate is no less inimical to the cultivation of plants than is the wretched soil of this we saw marked instances in the gardens of two of the resident officers lieutenants raban and cave to whom we were indebted for the greatest kindness and hospitality these gentlemen are indefatigable horticulturists and took a zealous interest in our pursuits accompanying us in our excursions enriching our collections in many ways and keeping an eye to them and to our plantdriers during our absence from the station in their gardens the soil had to be brought from a considerable distance and dressed copiously with vegetable matter bamboo clumps were planted for shelter within walls and native shrubs rhododendrons etc introduced many orchideae throve well on the branches of the stunted trees which they had planted and some superb kinds of hedychium in the ground but a very few english garden plants throve in the flowerbeds even in pots and frames geraniums etc would rot from the rarity of sunshine which is as prejudicial as the damp and exposure still many wild shrubs of great interest and beauty flourished and some european ones succeeded with skill and management as geraniums salvia petunia nasturtium chrysanthemum kennedya rubicunda maurandya and fuchsia the daisy seed sent from england as double came up very poor and single dahlias do not thrive nor double balsams now they have erected small but airy greenhouses and sunlight is the only desideratum  at the end of june we started for the northern or assam face of the mountains the road runs between the extensive and populous native village or poonji on the left and a deep valley on the right and commands a beautiful view of more waterfalls beyond this it ascends steeply and the sandstone on the road itself is curiously divided into parallelograms like hollow bricks i have seen similar bricks in the sandstones of the coaldistricts of yorkshire they are very puzzling and are probably due to some very obscure crystalline action analogous to jointing and cleavage enclosing irregularly shaped nodules while in other places it looks as if it had been run or fused spherical concretions of sand coloured concentrically by infiltration are common in it which have been regarded as seeds shells etc it also contained spheres of iron pyrites the general appearance of much of this rock is as if it had been bored by teredines ship worms but i never detected any trace of fossils it is often beautifully ripplemarked and in some places much honeycombed and full of shales and narrow seams of coal resting on a white underclay full of rootfibres like those of stigmaria  at about 5000 feet the country is very open and bare the ridges being so uniform and flattopped that the broad valleys they divide are hidden till their precipitous edges are reached and the eye wanders far east and west over a desolate level grassy country unbroken save by the curious flattopped hills i have described as belonging to the limestone formation which lie to the southwest these features continue for eight miles when a sudden descent of 600 or 700 feet leads into the valley of the kalapanee black water river where there is a very dark and damp bungalow which proved a very great accommodation to us it may be of use to the future botanist in this country to mention a small wood on the right of this road near the village of surureem as an excellent botanical station the trees are chiefly rhododendron arboreum figs oaks laurels magnolias and chestnuts on whose limbs are a profusion of orchideae and amongst which a rattan palm occurs  lailangkot is another village full of iron forges from a height near which a splendid view is obtained over the churra flat a few old and very stunted shrubs of laurel and symplocos grow on its bleak surface and these are often sunk from one to three feet in a well in the horizontally stratified sandstone i could only account for this by supposing it to arise from the drip from the trees and if so it is a wonderful instance of the wearing effects of water and of the great age which small bushes sometimes attain  the vegetation is more alpine at kalapanee elevation 5300 feet benthamia kadsura stauntonia illicium actinidia helwingia corylopsis and berberryall japan and chinese and most of them dorjiling generaappear here with the english yew two rhododendrons and bucklandia there are no large trees but a bright green jungle of small ones and bushes many of which are very rare and curious luculia pinceana makes a gorgeous show here in october  the sandstone to the east of kalapanee is capped by some beds forty feet thick of conglomerate worn into cliffs these are the remains of a very extensive horizontally stratified formation now all but entirely denuded in the valley itself the sandstone alternates with alum shales which rest on a bed of quartz conglomerate and the latter on black greenstone in the bed of the river whose waters are beautifully clear are hornstone rocks dipping northeast and striking northwest beyond the kalapanee the road ascends about 600 feet and is well quarried in hard greenstone and passing through a narrow gap of conglomerate rock formed of rolled masses of greenstone and sandstone united by a white and yellow cement enters a shallow wild and beautiful valley through which it runs for several miles the hills on either side are of greenstone capped by tabular sandstone immense masses of which have been precipitated on the floor of the valley producing a singularly wild and picturesque scene in the gloom of the evening it is not difficult for a fertile imagination to fancy castles and cities cresting the heights above hydrangea grows here with ivy mussoenda pyrua willow viburnum parnassia anemone leycesteria formosa neillia rubus astilbe rose panax apple bucklandia daphne pepper scindapsus pierix holly lilium giganteum kalang tatti khas camellia elaeocarpus buddleia etc large bees nests hang from the rocks  there is some cultivation here of potatoes and of rhysicosia vestita a beautiful purpleflowered leguminous plant with small tuberous roots beyond this a high ridge is gained above the valley of the bogapanee the largest river in the khasia from this the bhotan himalaya may be seen in clear weather at the astonishing distance of from 160 to 200 miles the vegetation here suddenly assumes a different aspect from the quantity of stunted firtrees clothing the north side of the valley which rises very steeply 1000 feet above the river quite unaccountably however not one grows on the south face a new oak also appears abundantly it has leaves like the english whose gnarled habit it also assumes  the descent is very steep and carried down a slope of greenstone this greenstone decomposes into a thick bed of red clay it is much intersected by fissures or cleavage planes at all angles whose surfaces are covered with a shining polished superficial layer like the fissures in the cleavage planes of the gneiss granite of kinchinjhow whose adjacent surfaces are coated with a glassy waved layer of hornblende this polishing of the surfaces is generally attributed to their having been in contact and rubbed together an explanation which is wholly unsatisfactory to me no such motion could take place in cleavage planes which often intersect and were it to occur it would not produce two polished surfaces of an interposed layer of a softer mineral it is more probably due to metamorphic action the road then follows a clear affluent of the bogapanee and afterwards winds along the margin of that river which is a rapid turbulent stream very muddy and hence contrasting remarkably with the kalapanee it derives its mud from the decomposition of granite which is washed by the natives for iron and in which rock it rises to the eastward thick beds of slate crop out by the roadside strike northeast and dip northwest and are continued along the bed of the river passing into conglomerates chert purple slates and crystalline sandstones with pebbles and angular masses of schist many of these rocks are much crumpled others quite flat and they are overlaid by soft variegated gneiss which is continued alternately with the slates to the top of the hills on the opposite side  small trees of hornbeam grow near the river with rhus xanthoxylon vaccinium gualtheria and spiraea while many beautiful ferns mosses and orchids cover the rocks an elegant iron suspension bridge is thrown across the stream from a rock matted with tufts of little parasitic orchideae crossing it we came on many pinetrees these had fiveyears old cones on them as well as those of all succeeding years they bear male flowers in autumn which impregnate the cones formed the previous year thus the cones formed in the spring of 1850 are fertilised in the following autumn and do not ripen their seeds till the second following autumn that of 1852  a very steep ascent leads to the bungalow of moflong on a broad bleak hilltop near the axis of the range alt 6062 feet here there is a village and some cultivation surrounded by hedges of erythrina pieris viburnum pyres colquhounia and corylopsis amongst which grew an autumnflowering larkspur with most foetid flowers there is a wood a mile to the west of the bungalow worth visiting by the botanist besides yew oak sabia and camellia it contains olea euonymus and sphaerocarya a small tree that bears a green pearshaped sweet fruit with a large stone it is pleasant but leaves a disagreeable taste in the mouth on the grassy flats an astragalus occurs and roscoea purpurea tofieldia and various other fine plants are common the rocks are much contorted slates and gneiss strike northeast and dip southeast in a deep gulley to the northward greenstone appears with black basalt and jasper the latter apparently altered gneiss beyond this the rocks strike the opposite way but are much disturbed  we passed the end of june here and experienced the same violent weather thunder lightning gales and rain which prevailed during every midsummer i spent in india a great deal of coix jobs tears is cultivated about moflong it is of a dull greenish purple and though planted in drills and carefully hoed and weeded is a very ragged crop the shell of the cultivated sort is soft and the kernel is sweet whereas the wild coix is so hard that it cannot be broken by the teeth each plant branches two or three times from the base and from seven to nine plants grow in each square yard of soil the produce is small not above thirty or forty fold  from a hill behind moflong bungalow on which are some stone altars a most superb view is obtained of the bhotan himalaya to the northward their snowy peaks stretching in a broken series from north 17 degrees east to north 35 degrees west all are below the horizon of the spectator though from 17000 to 20000 feet above his level the finest view in the khasia mountains and perhaps a more extensive one than has ever before been described is that from chillong hill the culminant point of the range about six miles northeast from moflong bungalow this hill 6660 feet above the sea rises from an undulating grassy country covered with scattered trees and occasional clumps of wood the whole scenery about being parklike and as little like that of india at so low an elevation as it is possible to be  i visited chillong in october with lieutenant cave starting from churra and reaching the bungalow two miles from its top the same night with two relays of ponies which he had kindly provided we were unfortunate in not obtaining a brilliant view of the snowy mountains their tops being partially clouded but the coup doeil was superb northward beyond the rolling khasia hills lay the whole assam valley seventy miles broad with the burrampooter winding through it fifty miles distant reduced to a thread beyond this banks of hazy vapour obscured all but the dark range of the lower himalaya crested by peaks of frosted silver at the immense distance of from 100 to 220 miles from chillong all are below the horizon of the observer yet so false is perspective that they seem high in the air the mountains occupy sixty degrees of the horizon and stretch over upwards of 250 miles comprising the greatest extent of snow visible from any point with which i am acquainted  westward from chillong the most distant garrow hills visible are about forty miles off and eastward those of cachar which are loftier are about seventy miles to the south the view is limited by the tipperah hills which where nearest are 100 miles distant while to the southwest lies the sealike gangetic delta whose horizon lifted by refraction must be fully 120 the extent of this view is therefore upwards of 340 miles in one direction and the visible horizon of the observer encircles an area of fully thirty thousand square miles which is greater than that of ireland  scarletflowered rhododendron bushes cover the north side of chillong these skirt a wood of prickly bamboo in which occur fig laurel aralia boemeria smilax toddalia wild cinnamon and three kinds of oak whilst the south is grassy and quite bare and except some good orchideae on the trees there is little to reward the botanist the rocks appeared to be sandstone at the summit but micaceous gneiss all around  continuing northward from moflong the road after five miles dips into a very broad and shallow flatfloored valley fully a mile across which resembles a lakebed it is bounded by low hills and is called lantentannia and is bare of aught but long grass and herbs amongst these are the large groundsel senecio dipsacus ophelia and campanula on its south flank the micaceous slates strike northeast and dip northwest and on the top repose beds a foot in thickness of angular waterworn gravel indicating an ancient waterlevel 400 feet above the floor of the valley other smaller lakebeds in the lateral valleys are equally evident  a beautiful blueflowered clitoria creeps over the path with the groundraspberry of dorjiling from the top a sudden descent of 400 feet leads to another broad flat valley called syong elevation 5725 feet in which is a good bungalow surrounded by hedges of prinsepia utilis a common northwest himalayan plant only found at 8000 feet in sikkim the valley is grassy but otherwise bare beyond this the road passes over low rocky hills wooded on their north or sheltered flanks only dividing flatfloored valleys a red sandy gneiss is the prevalent rock but boulders of syenite are scattered about extensive moors elevation 6000 feet succeed covered with stunted pines brake and tufts of harsh grasses these are principally andropogon and brachypodium amongst which grow yellow corydalis thalictrum anemone parnassia prunella strawberry eupatorium hypericum willow a polygonum like bistorta osmunda regalis and another species lycopodium alpinum a senecio like jacobaea thistles gnaphalium gentians iris paris sanguisorba and agrimonia  near the dengshipoong river which flows in a narrow valley is a low dome of gneiss altered by syenite the prevalent dip is uniformly southeast and the strike northeast and detached boulders of syenite become more frequent resting on a red gneiss full of black garnets till the descent to the valley of myrung one of the most beautiful spots in the khasia and a favourite resort having an excellent bungalow which commands a superb view of the himalaya it is 5650 feet above the sea and is placed on the north flank of a very shallow marshy valley two miles broad and full of rice cultivation as are the flat heads of all the little valleys that lead into it there is a guard here of light infantry and a little garden boasting a gardener and some teaplants so that we had vegetables during our four visits to the place on two of which occasions we stayed some days  from kalapanee to myrung a distance of thirtytwo miles the road does not vary 500 feet above or below the mean level of 5700 feet and the physical features are the same throughout of broad flatfloored steepsided valleys divided by bleak grassy tolerably leveltopped bills beyond myrung the khasia mountains slope to the southward in rolling looselywooded hills but the spurs do not dip suddenly till beyond nunklow eight miles further north  on the south side of the myrung valley is nungbree wood a dense jungle occupying like all the other woods the steep north exposure of the hill many good plants grow in it including some gigantic balanophorae pyrola and monotropa the bungalow stands on soft contorted decomposing gneiss which is still the prevalent rock striking northeast on the hills to the east of it enormous hard blocks lie fully exposed and are piled on one another as if so disposed by glacial action and it is difficult to account for them by denudation though their surface scales and similar blocks are scattered around myrung exactly similar to the syenite blocks of nunklow and the granite ones of nonkreem to be described hereafter and which are undoubtedly due to the process of weathering a great mass of fleshcoloured crystalline granite rises in the centre of the valley to the east of the road it is fissured in various directions and the surface scales concentrically it is obscurely stratified in some parts and appears to be half granite and half gneiss in mineralogical character  we twice visited a very remarkable hill called kollong which rises as a dome of granite 5400 feet high ten or twelve miles southwest of myrung and conspicuous from all directions the path to it turns off from that to nunklow and strikes westerly along the shallow valley of monai in which is a village and much rice and other cultivation near this there is a large square stockade formed of tall bamboos placed close together very like a new zealand pa indeed the whole country hereabouts much recalls the grassy clay hills marshy valleys and bushy ridges of the bay of islands the hills on either side are sometimes dotted with pinewoods sometimes conical and bare with small clumps of pines on the summit only while in other places are broad tracts containing nothing but young trees resembling plantations but which i am assured are not planted on the other hand however mr yule states that the natives do plant firtrees especially near the iron forges which give employment to all the people of monai  all the streams rise in flat marshy depressions amongst the hills with which the whole country is covered and both these features together with the flat clay marshes into which the rivers expand are very suggestive of tidal action rock is hardly anywhere seen except in the immediate vicinity of kollong where are many scattered boulders of finegrained gneiss of which are made the broad stone slabs placed as seats and the other erections of this singular people we repeatedly remarked cones of earth clay and pebbles about twelve feet high upon the hills which appeared to be artificial but of which the natives could give no explanation wild apple and birch are common trees but there is little jungle except in the hollows and on the north slopes of the higher hills coarse long grass with bushes of labiate and composite plants are the prevalent features  kollong rock is a steep dome of red granite this granite is highly crystalline and does not scale or flake nor is its surface polished accessible from the north and east but almost perpendicular to the southward where the slope is 80 degrees for 600 feet the elevation is 400 feet above the mean level of the surrounding ridges and 700 above the bottom of the valleys the south or steepest side is encumbered with enormous detached blocks while the north is clothed with a dense forest containing red treerhododendrons and oaks on its skirts grew a white bushy rhododendron which we found nowhere else the hard granite of the top was covered with matted mosses lichens lycopodiums and ferns amongst which were many curious and beautiful airplants eria coelogyne wallichii maculata and elata cymbidium dendrobium sunipia some of them flowering profusely and though freely exposed to the sun and wind dews and frosts rain and droughts they were all fresh bright green and strong under very different treatment from that to which they are exposed in the damp unhealthy steamy orchidhouses of our english gardens a wild onion was most abundant all over the top of the hill with hymenopogon vaccinium ophiopogon anisadenia commelyna didymocarpus remusatia hedychium grass and small bamboos and a good many other plants many of the lichens were of european kinds but the mosses except bryum argenteum and ferns were different a small staphylinus which swarmed under the sods was the only insect i remarked  illustrationkollong rock  the view from the top is very extensive to the northward but not elsewhere it commands the assam valley and the himalaya and the billowy range of undulating grassy khasia mountains few houses were visible but the curling smoke from the valleys betrayed their lurkingplaces whilst the tinkling sound of the hammers from the distant forges on all sides was singularly musical and pleasing they fell on the ear like bells upon the wind each ring being exquisitely melodious and chiming harmoniously with the others the solitude and beauty of the scenery and the emotions excited by the music of chimes tended to tranquillise our minds wearied by the fatigues of travel and the excitement of pursuits that required unremitting attention and we rested for some time our imaginations wandering to fardistant scenes brought vividly to our minds by these familiar sounds    chapter xxix  view of himalaya from the khasiagreat masses of

vegetationgeology of khasiasandstonecoallimegneissgreenstonetidal actionstrike of rockscomparison with rajmahal hills and the himalaya  the snowy himalaya was not visible during our first stay at myrung from the 5th to the 10th of july but on three subsequent occasions viz 27th and 28th of july 13th to 17th october and 22nd to 25th october we saw these magnificent mountains and repeatedly took angular heights and bearings of the principal peaks the range as seen from the khasia does not form a continuous line of snowy mountains but the loftiest eminences are conspicuously grouped into masses whose position is probably between the great rivers which rise far beyond them and flow through bhotan this arrangement indicates that relation of the rivers to the masses of snow which i have dwelt upon in the appendix  and further tends to prove that the snowy mountains seen from the southward are not on the axis of a mountain chain and do not even indicate its position but that they are lofty meridional spurs which projecting southward catch the moist vapours become more deeply snowed and protect the dry loftier regions behind  the most conspicuous group of snows seen from the khasia bears nne from myrung and consists of three beautiful mountains with widespreading snowy shoulders these are distant reckoning from west to east respectively 164 170 and 172 miles from myrung and subtend angles of  0 degrees 4 minutes 0 seconds0 degrees 1 minute 30 seconds and0 degrees 2 minutes 28 seconds these angles were taken both at sunrise and sunset and with an excellent theodolite and were repeated after two considerable intervals the telescopes were reversed after each observation and every precaution used to insure accuracy nevertheless the mean of one set of observations of angular height often varied 1 degree from that of another set this is probably much due to atmospheric refraction whose effect and amount it is impossible to estimate accurately in such cases here the objects are not only viewed through 160 miles of atmosphere but through belts from between 6000 to 20000 feet of vertical height varying in humidity and transparency at different parts of the interval if we divide this column of atmosphere into sections parallel to those of latitude we have first a belt fifteen miles broad hanging over the khasia 2000 to 4000 feet above the sea beyond it a second belt seventy miles broad hangs over the assam valley which is hardly 300 feet above the level of the sea and thirdly the northern part of the column which reposes on 60 to 100 miles of the bhotan lower himalaya each of these belts has probably a different refractive power from nunklow 940 feet lower than myrung they appear higher the western peak rising 14 degrees 35 minutes above the horizon whilst from moflong 32 miles further south and elevation 6062 feet the same is sunk 2 degrees below the horizon my computations make this western mountain upwards of 24000 feet high but according to col wilcoxs angles taken from the assam valley it is only 21600 the others being respectively 20720 and 21475 captain thuillier the deputy surveyor general agrees with me in considering that colonel wilcoxs altitudes are probably much  underestimated as those of other himalayan peaks to the westward were by the old surveyors it is further evident that these mountains have as far as can be estimated by angles fully 68000 feet of snow on them which would not be the case were the loftiest only 21600 feet high  it is singular that to the eastward of this group no snowy mountains are seen and the lower himalaya also dip suddenly this depression is no doubt partly due to perspective but as there is no such sudden disappearance of the chain to the westward where peaks are seen 35 degrees to the west of north it is far more probable that the valley of the soobansiri river which rises in tibet far behind these peaks is broad and open as is that of the dihong still farther east which we have every reason to believe is the tibetan yaru or burrampooter  supposing then the eastern group to indicate the mountain mass separating the soobansiri from the monass river no other mountains conspicuous for altitude or dimension rise between nne and north where there is another immense group this though within 120 miles of myrung is below its horizon and scarcely above that of nunklow which is still nearer to it and cannot therefore attain any great elevation  far to the westward again is a very lofty peaked mountain bearing nnw which subtends an angle of3 minutes 30 seconds from myrung and 6 minutes 0 seconds from nunklow the angles of this seem to indicate its being either chumulari or that great peak which i saw due east from bbomtso top and which i then estimated at ninety miles off and 23500 feet high from the khasia angles its latitude and longitude are 28 degrees 6 minutes and 89 degrees 30 minutes its elevation 27000 feet and its distance from myrung 200 miles i need hardly add  that neither the position nor the elevation computed from such data is worthy of confidence  further still to the extreme west is an immense low hogbacked mass of snow with a small peak on it this bears northwest both from myrung and nunklow subtending an angle of25 minutes from the former and17 minutes from the latter station it is in all probability chumulari 210 miles distant from nunklow donkia if seen would be distant 230 miles from the same spot in the khasia and kinchinjunga 260 possibly they are visible by refraction from chillong though even further from it  the distance from myrung to nunklow is ten miles along an excellent road the descent is at first sudden beyond which the country is undulating interspersed with jungle of low trees chiefly oaks and marshes with much rice cultivation grasses are exceedingly numerous we gathered fifty kinds besides twenty cyperaceae four were cultivated namely sugarcane rice coix and maize most of the others were not so well suited to pasturage as those of higher localities dwarf phoenix palm occurs by the roadside at 5000 feet elevation  gneiss with garnets highly inclined was the prevalent rock striking northeast and scattered boulders of syenite became very frequent in one place the latter rock is seen bursting through the gneiss which is slaty and very crystalline at the junction  nunklow is placed at the northern extremity of a broad spur that overhangs the valley of the burrampooter river thirty miles distant the descent from it is very rapid and beyond it none of the many spurs thrown out by the khasia attain more than 1000 feet elevation hence though the range does not present so abrupt a  face to the burrampooter as it does to the jheels nunklow is considered as on the brink of its north slope the elevation of the bungalow is 4688 feet and the climate being hot it swarms with mosquitos fleas and rats it commands a superb view to the north of the himalayan snows of the burrampooter and intervening malarious terai forest and to the south of the undulating khasia with kollong rock bearing southwest all the hills between this and myrung look from nunklow better wooded than they do from myrung in consequence of the slopes exposed to the south being bare of forest  a thousand feet below the bungalow a tropical forest begins of figs birch horsechestnut oak nutmeg cedrela engelhardtia artocarpeae and elaeocarpus in the gullies and tall pines on the dry slopes which are continued down to the very bottom of the valley in which flows the borpanee a broad and rapid river that descends from chillong and winds round the base of the nunklow spur many of the pines are eighty feet high and three or four in diameter but none form gigantic trees the quantity of balsams in the wet ravines is very great and treeferns of several kinds are common  the borpanee is about forty yards wide and is spanned by an elegant iron suspensionbridge that is clamped to the gneiss rock strike northeast dip northwest on either bank beneath is a series of cascades none high but all of great beauty from the broken masses of rocks and picturesque scenery on either side we frequently botanised up and down the river with great success many curious plants grow on its stony and rocky banks and amongst them rhododendron formosum at the low elevation of 2000 feet a most splendid fern dipteris wallichii is abundant with the dwarf phoenix palm and cycas pectinata  wild animals are very abundant here though extremely rare on the higher part of the khasia range tigers however and bears ascend to nunklow we saw troops of wild dogs kuleam khas deer and immense quantities of the droppings of the wild elephant an animal considered in assam dangerous to meet whereas in other parts of india it is not dreaded till provoked there is however no quadruped that varies more in its native state than this the ceylon kind differs from the indian in the larger size and short tusks and an experienced judge at calcutta will tell at once whether the newly caught elephant is from assam silhet cuttack nepal or chittagong some of the differences in size roundness of shoulders and back quantity of hair length of limb and shape of head are very marked and their dispositions are equally various  the lowest rocks seen are at a considerable distance down the borpanee they are friable sandstones that strike uniformly with the gneiss from the bridge upwards the rocks are all gneiss alternating with chert and quartz the nunklow spur is covered with enormous rounded blocks of syenite reposing on clay or on one another these do not descend the hill and are the remains of an extensive formation which we could only find in situ at one spot on the road to myrung see earlier but which must have been of immense thickness the tendency of many volcanic rocks to decompose in spheres is very well known it is conspicuous in the black basalts north of edinburgh but i do not know any instance equal to this of nunklow for the extent of decomposition and dimensions of the resulting spheres one block within ten yards of the bungalow door was fifteen feet long six high and eight broad it appeared half buried and was rapidly decomposing from the action of the rain close by to the westward in walking amongst the masses we  were reminded of a moraine of most gigantic sized blocks one which i measured was forty feet long and eleven above the ground its edges were rounded and its surface flaked off in pieces a foot broad and a quarter of an inch thick trees and brushwood often conceal the spaces between these fragments and afford dens for bears and leopards into which man cannot follow them  sitting in the cool evenings on one of these great blocks and watching the himalayan glaciers glowing with the rays of sunset appearing to change in form and dimensions with the falling shadows it was impossible to refrain from speculating on the possibility of these great boulders heaped on the himalayanward face of the khasia range having been transported hither by ice at some former period especially as the mont blanc granite in crossing the lake of geneva to the jura must have performed a hardly less wonderful ice journey but this hypothesis is clearly untenable and unparalleled in our experience as the results appear if attributed to denudation and weathering alone we are yet compelled to refer them to these causes the further we travel and the longer we study the more positive becomes the conviction that the part played by these great agents in sculpturing the surface of our planet is as yet but half recognised  we returned on the 7th of august to churra where we employed ourselves during the rest of the month in collecting and studying the plants of the neighbourhood we hired a large and good bungalow in which three immense coal fires this coal is excellent for many purposes we found it generally used by the assam steamers and were informed on board that in which we traversed the sunderbunds some months afterwards that her furnaces consumed 729 lbs per hour whereas the consumption of english coal was 800 lbs of burdwan coal 8401bs and of assam 900 lbs were kept up for drying plants and papers and fifteen men were always employed some in changing and some in collecting from morning till night the coal was procured within a mile of our door and cost about six shillings a month it was of the finest quality and gave great heat and few ashes torrents of rain descended almost daily twelve inches in as many hours being frequently registered and we remarked that it was impossible to judge of the quantity by estimation an apparent deluge sometimes proving much less in amount than much lighter but steadier falls hence the greatest fall is probably that in which the drops are moderately large very close together and which pass through a saturated atmosphere the temperature of the rain here and elsewhere in india was always a degree or two below that of the air  though the temperature in august rose to 75 degrees we never felt a fire oppressive owing to the constant damp and absence of sun the latter when it broke through the clouds shone powerfully raising the thermometer 20 degrees and 30 degrees in as many minutes on such occasions hot blasts of damp wind ascend the valleys and impinge suddenly against different houses on the flat giving rise to extraordinary differences between the mean daily temperatures of places not half a mile apart  on the 4th of september we started for the village of chela which lies west from churra at the embouchure of the bogapanee on the jheels the path runs by mamloo and down the spur to the jasper hill see chapter xxviii the vegetation all along is very tropical and pepper ginger maize and betel palm are cultivated around small cottages which are only distinguishable in the forest by their yellow thatch of dry calamus rattan leaves from jasper hill a very steep ridge leads to another called lisouplang which is hardly so high as mamloo the rocks are the same sandstone with fragments of coal and remains of the limestone formation capping it  hot gusts of wind blow up the valleys alternating with clouds and mists and it is curious to watch the effects of the latter in stilling the voices of insects cicadas and birds common crows and vultures haunt the villages but these and all other large birds are very rare in the khasia a very few hawks are occasionally seen also sparrows and kingfishers and i once heard a cuckoo pheasants are sometimes shot but we never saw any kites become numerous after the rains and are regarded as a sign of their cessation more remarkable than the rarity of birds is the absence of all animals except domestic rats as a more suitable country for hares and rabbits could not be found reptiles and especially colubridae are very common in the khasia mountains and i procured sixteen species and many specimens the natives repeatedly assured us that these were all harmless and dr gray who has kindly examined all my snakes informs me of the remarkable fact alluded to in a note in chapter xviii that whereas none of these are poisonous four out of the eleven species which i found in sikkim are so one of the khasia blindworms a new species belongs to a truly american genus ophisaurus a fact as important as is that of the sikkim skink and agama being also american forms  arundina a beautiful purple grassyleaved orchid was abundantly in flower on the hilltop and the great white swallowtailed moth saturnia atlas was extremely common with tropical butterflies and other insects the curious leafinsect mantis was very abundant on the orange trees on the leaves of which the natives believe  it to feed nor indeed could we persuade some of our friends that its thin sharp jaws are unsuited for masticating leaves and that these and its prehensile feet indicate its predacious nature added to which its singular resemblance to a leaf is no less a provision against its being discovered by its enemies than an aid in deceiving its prey  we descended rapidly for many miles through beautiful rocky woods with villages nestling amongst groves of banana and trellised climbers and from the brow of a hill looked down upon a slope covered with vegetation and huts which formed the mart of chela and below which the bogapanee flowed in a deep gorge the view was a very striking one owing to the steepness of the valley below our feet the roofs alone of the cottages were visible from which ascended the sounds and smells of a dense native population and to which there appeared to be no way of descending the opposite side rose precipitously in lofty tabletopped mountains and the river was studded with canoes  the descent was fully 800 feet on a slope averaging 25 degrees to 35 degrees the cottages were placed close together each within a little bamboo enclosure eight to ten yards deep and no two were on the same level each was built against a perpendicular wall which supported a cutting in the bank behind and a similar wall descended in front of it forming the back of the compartment in which the cottage next below it was erected the houses were often raised on platforms and some had balconies in front which overhung the cottage below all were mere hovels of wattle or mud with very highpitched roofs stone tanks resembling fonts urns coffins and sarcophagi were placed near the better houses and blocks of stone were scattered everywhere  we descended from hovel to hovel alternately along the gravelled flat of each enclosure and perpendicularly down steps cut in the sandstone or let into the walls i counted 800 houses from the river and there must be many more the inhabitants are bengalees and khasias and perhaps amount to 3000 or 4000 but this is a very vague estimate  illustrationchela village  we lodged in a curious house consisting of one apartment twenty feet long and five high raised thirty feet upon bamboos the walls were of platted bamboo matting fastened to strong wooden beams and one side opened on a balcony that overhung the river the entrance was an oval aperture reached by a ladder and closed by foldingdoors that turned on wooden pivots  the roof was supported by tressels of great thickness and like the rest of the woodwork was morticed no nails being used throughout the building the floor was of split bamboos laid side by side  we ascended the bogapanee in canoes each formed of a hollowed trunk fifty feet long and four broad we could not however proceed far on account of the rapids the rocks in its bed are limestone but a great bluff cliff of sandy conglomerate strike eastsoutheast and dip southsouthwest 70 degrees several hundred feet high rises on the east bank close above the village above which occurs amygdaloidal basalt the pebbles in the river which was seventy yards broad and turbid were of slate basalt sandstone and syenite on the opposite bank were sandstones overlain by limestone both dipping to the southward  beautiful palms especially caryota urens by far the handsomest in india and groves of betelnut bordered the river with oranges lemons and citrons intermixed with feathery bamboos horizontallybranched acacias oaks with pale red young leaves and deep green foliaged figs prickly rattans and plectocomia climbed amongst these their enormous plumes of foliage upborne by the matted branches of the trees and their arrowy tops shooting high above the forest  after staying three days at chela we descended the stream in canoes shooting over pebbly rapids and amongst rocks of limestone waterworn into fantastic shapes till we at last found ourselves gliding gently along the still canals of the jheels many of these rapids are so far artificial that they are enclosed by gravel banks six feet high which by confining the waters give them depth but chela being hardly above the level of the sea their fall is  very trifling we proceeded across the jheels the common waterplants of the jheels are vallisneria serrata damasonium 2 myriophylla 2 villarsiae trapa blue white purple and scarlet waterlilies hydrilla utricularia limnophila azolla salvinia ceratopteris and floating grasses to chattuc and then north again to pundua and so to churra  having pretty well exhausted the botany of churra dr thomson and i started on the 13th of september for the eastern part of the khasia and jyntea mountains on the kalapanee road the peaviolet crotalaria occulta was very common by the roadside and smelt deliciously of violets the english name suggests the appearance of the flower for which and for its fragrance it is well worth cultivation which we followed we passed crowds of market people laden with dried fish in a halfputrid state which scented the air for many yards they were chiefly carp caught and dried at the foot of the hills large parties were bringing down baskets of birdcherries cinnamonbark iron pine planks firewood and potatoes of these the birdcherries like damsons are made into an excellent preserve by the english residents who also make capital cherrybrandy of them the trade in cinnamon is of recent introduction and is much encouraged by the inglis family to whose exertions these people are so greatly indebted the cinnamon is the peeled bark of a small species of cinnamomum allied to that of ceylon and though inferior in flavour and mucilaginous like cassia finds a ready market at calcutta it has been used to adulterate the ceylon cinnamon and an extensive fraud was attempted by some europeans at calcutta who sent boxes of this with a top layer of the genuine to england the smell of the cinnamon loads was as fragrant as that of the fish was offensive  the road from kalapanee bungalow strikes off northeasterly and rounds the head of the deep valley to the east of churra it then crosses the headwaters of the  kalapanee river still a clear stream the bed of which is comparatively superficial the rocks consist of a little basalt and much sandstone striking east by north and dipping north by west the bogapanee is next reached flowing in a shallow valley about 200 feet below the general level of the hills which are grassy and treeless the river the fall of this river between this elevation which may be considered that of its source and chela is about 5500 feet is thirty yards across shallow and turbid its bed is granite and beyond it scattered stunted pines are met with a tree which seems to avoid the sandstone in the evening we arrived at nonkreem a large village in a broad marshy valley where we procured accommodation with some difficulty the people being by no means civil and the rajah sing manuk holding himself independent of the british government  atmospheric denudation and weathering have produced remarkable effects on the lower part of the nonkreem valley which is blocked up by a pinecrested hill 200 feet high entirely formed of round blocks of granite heaped up so as to resemble an old moraine but like the nunklow boulders these are not arranged as if by glacial action the granite is micaceous and usually very soft decomposing into a coarse reddish sand that colours the bogapanee to procure the ironsand which is disseminated through it the natives conduct water over the beds of granite sand and as the lighter particles are washed away the remainder is removed to troughs where the separation of the ore is completed the smelting is very rudely carried on in charcoal fires blown by enormous doubleaction bellows worked by two persons who stand on the machine raising the flaps with their hands and expanding them with their feet as shown in the cut further on  there is neither furnace nor flux used in the reduction the fire is kindled on one aide of an upright stone like the headstone of a grave with a small arched hole close to the ground near this hole the bellows are suspended and a bamboo tube from each of its compartments meets in a larger one by which the draught is directed under the hole in the stone to the fire the ore is run into lumps as large as two fists with a rugged surface these lumps are afterwards cleft nearly in two to show their purity  illustrationnonkreem village  the scenery about nonkreem village is extremely picturesque and we procured many good plants on the rocks which were covered with the purpleflowered orchid coelogyne wallichii the country is everywhere intersected  with trenches for ironwashing and some large marshes were dammed up for the same purpose in these we found some beautiful balsams hypericum and parnassia also a diminutive waterlily the flower of which is no larger than a halfcrown it proves to be the nymphaea pygmaea of china and siberiaa remarkable fact in the geographical distribution of plants  illustrationbellows  from nonkreem we proceeded easterly to pomrang leaving chillong hill on the north and again crossing the begapanee beyond which the sandstone appeared strike  northeast and dip northwest 60 degrees the soil was poor in the extreme not an inhabitant or tree was to be seen throughout the grassy landscape and hardly a bush save an occasional rhododendron dwarf oak or pieris barely a few inches high  at pomrang we took up our quarters in an excellent empty bungalow built by mr stainforth judge of silhet who kindly allowed us the use of it its elevation was 5143 feet and it occupied the eastern extremity of a lofty spur that overhangs the deep firclad valley of the oongkot dividing khasia from jyntea the climate of pomrang is so much cooler and less rainy than at churra that this place is more eligible for a station but the soil is quite impracticable there is an occasional scarcity of water the pasture is wholly unsuited for cattle or sheep and the distance from the plains is too great  a beautiful view extends eastwards to the low jyntea hills backed by the blue mountains of cachar over the deep valley in front to the northward a few peaks of the himalaya are seen and westward is chillong we staid here till the 23rd september and then proceeded southeastward to mooshye the path descends into the valley of the oongkot passing the village of pomrang and then through woods of pine gordonia and oak the latter closely resembling the english and infested with galls the slopes are extensively cultivated with black awnless unirrigated rice and poor crops of coix protected from the birds by scarecrows of lines stretched across the fields bearing tassels and tufts of fern shaken by boys this fern proved to be a very curious and interesting genus which is only known to occur elsewhere at hongkong in china and has been called bowringia after the eminent dr bowring  we crossed the river podostemom grew on the stones at the bottom it is a remarkable waterplant resembling a liverwort in its mode of growth several species occur at different elevations in the khasia and appear only in autumn when they often carpet the bottom of the streams with green in spring and summer no traces of them are seen and it is difficult to conceive what becomes of the seeds in the interval and how these which are well known and have no apparent provision for the purpose attach themselves to the smooth rocks at the bottom of the torrents all the kinds flower and ripen their seeds under water the stamens and pistil being protected by the closed flower from the wet this genus does not inhabit the sikkim rivers probably owing to the great changes of temperature to which these are subject twice proceeding southwest to mooshye a village placed on an isolated flattopped and very steepsided hill 4863 feet above the sea and perhaps 3500 above the oongkot which winds round its base a very steep path led up slate rocks to the top which was of sandstone where there is a stockaded guardhouse once occupied by british troops of which we took possession a labiate plant mesona wallichiana grew on the ascent whose bruised leaves smelt as strongly of patchouli as do those of the plant producing that perfume to which it is closely allied the pogostemon patchouli has been said to occur in these parts of india but we never met with it and doubt the accuracy of the statement it is a native of the malay peninsula whence the leaves are imported into bengal and so to europe  the summit commands a fine view northward of some himalayan peaks and southwards of the broad valley of the oongkot which is level and bounded by steep and precipitous hills with flat tops on the 25th we left mooshye for amwee in jyntea which lies to the southeast we descended by steps cut in the sandstone and fording the oongkot climbed the hills on its east side along the grassy tops of which we continued at an elevation of 4000 feet marshy flats intersect the hills to which wild elephants sometimes ascend doing much damage to the rice  crops we crossed a stream by a bridge formed of one gigantic block of sandstone 20 feet long close to the village which is a wretched one and is considered unhealthy it stands on the high road from jynteapore at the foot of the hills to the southward to assam the only road that crosses the mountains east of that from churra to nunklow  illustrationold bridge at amwee  though so much lower this country from the barrenness of the soil is more thinly inhabited than the khasia the pitcherplant nepenthes grows on stony and grassy hills about amwee and crawls along the ground its pitchers seldom contain insects in the wild state nor can we suggest any special function for the wonderful organ it possesses  about eight miles south of the village is a stream crossed by a bridge half of which is formed of slabs of stone of which one is twentyone feet long seven broad and two feet three and a half inches thick supported on piers and the rest is a well turned arch such as i have not  seen elsewhere among the hill tribes of india it is fast crumbling away and is covered with tropical plants and a beautiful whiteflowered orchis diplomeris apostasia also grew in this gulley with a small arundina some beautiful species of sonerila and argostemma the neighbourhood was very rich in plants grew in the mossy crevices of its stones  from amwee our route lay northeast across the jyntea hills to joowye the hillcapital of the district the path gradually ascended dipping into valleys scooped out in the horizontal sandstone down to the basalt and boulders of the same rock were scattered about fields of rice occupy the bottoms of these valleys in which were placed gigantic images of men dressed in rags and armed with bows and arrows to scare away the wild elephants slate rocks succeed the sandstone strike northeast dip northwest and with them pines and birch appear clothing the deep flanks of the mintadoong valley which we crossed  the situation of joowye is extremely beautiful it occupies the broken wooded slope of a large open flat valley dotted with pines and consists of an immense number of low thatched cottages scattered amongst groves of bamboo and fields of plantain tobacco yams sugarcane maize and rice surrounded by hedges of bamboo colquhounia and erythrina narrow steep lanes lead amongst these shaded with oak birch podocarpus camellia and araliaceae the larger trees being covered with orchids climbing palms pothos scindapsus pepper and gnetum while masses of beautiful red and violet balsams grew under every hedge and rock the latter was of sandstone overlying highly inclined schists and afforded magnificent blocks for the natives to rear on end or make seats of some erect stones  on a hill at the entrance are immensely large and surround a clump of fine fig and banyan trees in some tanks we found hydropeltis an american and australian plant allied to nymphaea mr griffith first detected it here and afterwards in bhotan these being the only known habitats for it in the old world it grows with typha acorus calamus sweet flag vallisneria potamogeton sparganium and other european waterplants  we procured a good house after many delays for the people were far from obliging it was a clean very long cottage with low thatched eaves almost touching the ground and was surrounded by a high bamboo paling that enclosed outhouses built on a wellswept floor of beaten earth within the woodwork was carved in curious patterns and was particularly well fitted the old lady to whom it belonged got tired of us before two days were over and first tried to smoke us out by a large fire of green wood at that end of the cottage which she retained and afterwards by inviting guests to a supper with whom she kept up a racket all night her son a tall sulky fellow came to receive the usual gratuity on our departure which we made large to show we bore no illwill he however behaved so scornfully pretending to despise it that i had no choice but to pocket it again a proceeding which was received with shouts of laughter at his expense from a large crowd of bystanders  on the 30th of september we proceeded northeast from joowye to nurtiung crossing the watershed of the jyntea range which is granitic and scarcely raised above the mean level of the hills it is about 4500 feet elevation to the north the descent is at first rather abrupt for 500 feet to a considerable stream beyond which is the village of nurtiung the country gradually declines hence to the northeast in grassy hills  which to the east become higher and more wooded to the west the khasia are seen and several himalayan peaks to the north  the ascent to the village from the river is by steps cut in a narrow cleft of the schist rocks to a flat elevated 4178 feet above the sea we here procured a cottage and found the people remarkably civil the general appearance is the same as at joowye but there are here extensive and very unhealthy marshes whose evil effects we experienced in having the misfortune to lose one of our servants by fever except pines there are few large trees but the quantity of species of perennial woody plants contributing to form the jungles is quite extraordinary i enumerated 140 of which 60 were trees or large shrubs above twenty feet high one of these was the hamamelis chinensis a plant hitherto only known as a native of china this the bowringia and the little nymphaea are three out of many remarkable instances of our approach to the eastern asiatic flora  from nurtiung we walked to the borpanee river sixteen or twenty miles to the northeast not the river of that name below nunklow returning the same night a most fatiguing journey in so hot and damp a climate the path lay for the greatest part of the way over grassy hills of micaschist with boulders of granite and afterwards of syenite like those of nunklow the descent to the river is through noble woods of spreading oaks we collected upwards of fifteen kinds of oak and chesnut in these and the khasia mountains many are magnificent trees with excellent wood while others are inferior as timber chesnuts magnolias and tall pines the vegetation is very tropical and with the exception of there being no sal it resembles that of the dry hills of the sikkim terai the borpanee is  forty yards broad and turbid its bed which is of basalt is 2454 feet above the sea it is crossed by a raft pulled to and fro by canes  nurtiung contains a most remarkable collection of those sepulchral and other monuments which form so curious a feature in the scenery of these mountains and in the habits of their savage population they are all placed in a fine grove of trees occupying a hollow where several acres are covered with gigantic generally circular slabs of stone from ten to twentyfive feet broad supported five feet above the ground upon other blocks for the most part they are buried in brushwood of nettles and shrubs but in one place there is an open area of fifty yards encircled by them each with a gigantic headstone behind it of the latter the tallest was nearly thirty feet high six broad and two feet eight inches in thickness and must have been sunk at least five feet and perhaps much more in the ground the flat slabs were generally of slate or hornstone but many of them and all the larger ones were of syenitic granite split by heat and cold water with great art they are erected by dint of sheer brute strength the lever being the only aid large blocks of syenite were scattered amongst these wonderful erections  splendid trees of bombax fig and banyan overshadowed them the largest banyan had a trunk five feet in diameter clear of the buttresses and numerous small trees of celtic grew out of it and an immense flowering tuft of vanda caerulea the rarest and most beautiful of indian orchids flourished on one of its limbs a small plantain with austere woolly scarlet fruit bearing ripe seeds was planted in this sacred grove where trees of the most tropical genera grew mixed with the pine birch myrica and viburnum  the nurtiung stonehenge is no doubt in part religious as the grove suggests and also designed for cremation the bodies being burnt on the altars in the khasia these upright stones are generally raised simply as memorials of great events or of men whose ashes are not necessarily though frequently buried or deposited in hollow stone sarcophagi near them and sometimes in an urn placed inside a sarcophagus or under horizontal slabs  illustrationstones at nurtiung  the usual arrangement is a row of five seven or more erect oblong blocks with round heads the highest being placed in the middle on which are often wooden discs and cones more rarely pyramids are built broad slabs for seats are also common by the wayside mr yule who first drew attention to these monuments mentions one thirtytwo feet by fifteen and two in thickness and states that the sarcophagi which however are rare formed of four slabs resemble a drawing in bells circassia and descriptions in irby and mangles travels in syria he adds that many villages derive their names from these stones mau signifying stone thus mausmai is the stone of oath because as his native informant said there was war between churra and mausmai and when they made peace they swore to it and placed a stone as a witness forcibly recalling the stone jacob set up for a pillar and other passages in the old testament mamloo is the stone of salt eating salt from a swords point being the khasia form of oath mauflong is the grassy stone etc notes on the khasia mountains and people by lieutenant h yule bengal engineers analogous combinations occur in the south of england and in brittany etc where similar structures are found thus maen man or men is the socalled druidical name for a stony whence penmaenmawr for the hill of the big stone maenhayr for the standing stones of brittany and dolmen °the tablestone for a cromlech returning from this grove we crossed a stream by a single squared block twentyeight feet long five broad and two thick of gray syenitic granite with large crystals of felspar  we left nurtiung on the 4th of october and walked to pomrang a very long and fatiguing days work the route descends northwest of the village and turns due east along bare grassy hills of micaschist and slate strike east and west and dip north near the village of lernai oak woods are passed in which vanda coerulea grows in profusion waving its panicles of azure flowers in the wind as this beautiful orchid is at present attracting great attention from its high price beauty and difficulty of culture i shall point out how totally at variance with its native habits is the cultivation thought necessary for it in england we collected seven mens loads of this superb plant for the royal gardens at kew but owing to unavoidable accidents and difficulties few specimens reached england alive a gentleman who sent his gardener with us to be shown the locality was more successful he sent one mans load to england on commission and though it arrived in a very poor state it sold for 300 pounds the individual plants fetching prices varying from 3 pounds to 10 pounds had all arrived alive they would have cleared 1000 pounds an active collector with the facilities i possessed might easily clear from 2000 pounds to 3000 pounds in one season by the sale of khasia orchids the  dry grassy hills which it inhabits are elevated 3000 to 4000 feet the trees are small gnarled and very sparingly leafy so that the vanda which grows on their limbs is fully exposed to sun rain and wind there is no moss or lichen on the branches with the vanda whose roots sprawl over the dry rough bark the atmosphere is on the whole humid and extremely so during the rains but there is no damp heat or stagnation of the air and at the flowering season the temperature ranges between 60 degrees and 80 degrees there is much sunshine and both air and bark are dry during the day in july and august during the rains the temperature is a little higher than above but in winter it falls much lower and hoarfrost forms on the ground now this winters cold summers heat and autumns drought and above all this constant free exposure to fresh air and the winds of heaven are what of all things we avoid exposing our orchids to in england it is under these conditions however that all the finer indian orchideae grow of which we found dendrobium farmeri dalhousianum devonianum etc with vanda coerulea whilst the most beautiful species of coelogyne cymbidium bolbophyllum and cypripedium inhabit cool climates at elevations above 4000 feet in khasia and as high as 6000 to 7000 in sikkim  on the following day we turned out our vanda to dress the specimens for travelling and preserve the flowers for botanical purposes of the latter we had 360 panicles each composed of from six to twentyone broad paleblue  tesselated flowers three and a half to four inches across and they formed three piles on the floor of the verandah each a yard high what would we not have given to have been able to transport a single panicle to a chiswick fete  on the 10th of october we sent twentyfour strong mountaineers to churra laden with the collections of the previous month whilst we returned to nonkreem and crossing the shoulder of chillong passed through the village of moleem in a northwest direction to the syong bungalow from this we again crossed the range to nunklow and the borpanee and returned by moflong and the kalapanee to churra during the latter part of the month  in november the vegetation above 4000 feet turns wintry and brown the weather becomes chilly and though the cold is never great hoarfrost forms at churra and water freezes at moflong we prepared to leave as these signs of winter advanced we had collected upwards of 2500 species and for the last few weeks all our diligence and that of our collectors had failed to be rewarded by a single novelty we however procured many species in fruit and made a collection of upwards of 300 kinds of woods many of very curious structure as however we projected a trip to cachar before quitting the neighbourhood we retained our collectors giving orders for them to meet us at chattuc on our way down the soormah in december with their collections which amounted to 200 mens loads and for the conveyance of which to calcutta mr inglis procured us boats  before dismissing the subject of the khasia mountains it will be well to give a slight sketch of their prominent geographical features in connection with their geology the general geological characters of the chain may be summed up in a few words the nucleus or axis is of  highly inclined stratified metamorphic rocks through which the granite has been protruded and the basalt and syenite afterwards injected after extensive denudations of these the sandstone coal and limestone were successively deposited these are altered and displaced along the southern edge of the range by black amygdaloidal trap and have in their turn been extensively denuded and it is this last operation that has sculptured the range and given the mountains their present aspect for the same gneisses slates and basalts in other countries present rugged peaks domes or cones and there is nothing in their composition or arrangement here that explains the tabular or rounded outline they assume or the uniform level of the spurs into which they rise or the curious steep sides and flat floors of the valleys which drain them  all these peculiarities of outline are the result of denudation of the specific action of which agent we are very ignorant the remarkable difference between the steep cliffs on the south face of the range and the rounded outline of the hills on the northern slopes may be explained on the supposition that when the khasia was partially submerged the assam valley was a broad bay or gulf and that while the churra cliffs were exposed to the full sweep of the ocean the nunklow shore was washed by a more tranquil sea  the broad flat marshy heads of all the streams in the central and northern parts of the chain and the rounded hills that separate them indicate the levelling action of a tidal sea acting on a low flat shore since our return to england we have been much struck with the similarity in contour of the essex and suffolk coasts and with the fact that the tidal coast sculpturing of this surface is preserved in the very centre of high suffolk twenty to thirty miles distant from the sea in rounded outlines and broad flat marshy valleyswhilst the steep flatfloored valleys of the southern watershed may be attributed to the scouring action of higher tides on a boisterous rocky coast these views are confirmed by an examination of the east shores of the bay of bengal and particularly by a comparison of the features of the country about silhet now nearly 280 miles distant from the sea with those of the chittagong coast with which they are identical  the geological features of the khasia are in many respects so similar to those of the vindhya kymore behar and rajmahal mountains that they have been considered by some observers as an eastern prolongation of that great chain from which they are geographically separated by the delta of the ganges and burrampooter the general contour of the mountains and of their sandstone cliffs is the same and the association of this rock with coal and lime is a marked point of similarity there is however this difference between them that the coalshales of khasia and limestone of behar are nonfossiliferous while the lime of khasia and the coalshales of behar contain fossils  the prevalent northeast strike of the gneiss is the same in both differing from the himalaya where the stratified rocks generally strike northwest the nummulites of the limestone are the only known means we have of forming an approximate estimate of the age of the khasia coal which is the most interesting feature in the geology of the range these fossils have been examined by mm archiac and jules haines description des animaux fossiles des indes orientales p 178 these species are nummulites scabra lamarck n obtusa sowerby n lucasana deshayes and n beaumonti darch and haines who have pronounced the species collected by dr thomson and myself to be the same as those found in the nummulite rocks of northwest

at pundua crossed the jheels to the soormah which we ascended to silhet thence we continued our voyage 120 miles up the river in canoes to silchar the capital of the district of cachar the boats were such as i described at chattuc and though it was impossible to sit upright in them they were paddled with great swiftness the river at silhet is 200 yards broad it is muddy and flows with a gentle current of two to three miles an hour between banks six to twelve feet high as we glided up its stream villages became rarer and eminences more frequent in the jheels the people are a tall bold athletic mahometan race who live much on the water and cultivate rice sesamum and radishes with betelpepper in thatched enclosures as in sikkim maize and sugar are rarer bamboos abound and four palms borassus areca cocoanut and caryota are planted but there are no datepalms  the teelas or hillocks are the haunts of wild boars tigers and elephants but not of the rhinoceros they are 80 to 200 feet high of horizontally stratified gravel and sand slates and clay conglomerates with a slaglike honeycombed sandstone they are covered with oaks figs heretiera and bamboos and besides a multitude of common bengal plants there are some which though generally considered mountain or cold country genera here descend to the level of the sea such are kadsura rubus camellia and sabia aerides and saccolabia are the common orchids and rattancanes and pandani render the jungles impenetrable  a very long sedge scleria grows by the water and is used for thatching boatloads of it are collected for the calcutta market for which also were destined many immense rafts of bamboo 100 feet long the people fish much using square and triangular dropnets stretched upon bamboos and rude basketwork weirs that retain the fish as the river falls near the villages we saw fragments of pottery three feet below the surface of the ground shewing that the bank which is higher than the surrounding country increases from the annual overflow  about seventy miles up the river the mountains on the north which are east of jyntea rise 4000 feet high in forestclad ranges like those of sikkim swamps extend from the river to their base and penetrate their valleys which are extremely malarious these forests are frequented by timbercutters who fell jarool lagerstroemia reginae a magnificent tree with red wood which though soft is durable under water and therefore in universal use for boatbuilding the toon is also cut with red sandalwood adenanthera pavonina also nageesa there is much dispute amongst oriental scholars about the word nageesa the bombay philologists refer it to a species of garcinia whilst the pundits on the calcutta side of india consider it to be mesua ferrea throughout our travels in india we were struck with the undue reliance placed on native names of plants and information of all kinds and the pertinacity with which each linguist adhered to his own crotchet as to the application of terms to natural objects and their pronunciation it is a very prevalent but erroneous impression that savage and halfcivilised people have an accurate knowledge of objects of natural history and a uniform nomenclature for them mesua ferrea which is highly valued for its weight strength and durability aquilaria agallocha the eaglewood a tree yielding uggur oil is also much sought for its fragrant wood which is carried to silhet and azmerigunj where it is broken up and distilled neither teak sissoo sal nor other dipterocarpi are found in these forests  porpoises and both the long and the shortnosed alligator ascend the soormah for 120 miles being found beyond silchar which place we reached on the 22nd and were most hospitably received by colonel lister the political agent commanding the silhet light infantry who was inspecting the cookie levy a corps of hillnatives which had lately been enrolled  the station is a small one and stands about forty feet above the river which however rises half that height in the rains long low spurs of tertiary rocks stretch from the tipperah hills for many miles north through the swampy jheels to the river and there are also hills on the opposite or north side but detached from the cookie hills as the lofty blue range twelve miles north of the soormah is called all these mountains swarm with tigers wild buffalos and boars which also infest the long grass of the jheels  the elevation of the house we occupied at silchar was 116 feet above the sea the bank it stood on was of clay with soft rocks of conglomerate which often assume the appearance of a brown sandy slag  during the first birmese war colonel lister was sent with a force up to this remote corner of bengal when the country was an uninhabited jungle so full of tigers that not a day passed without one or more of his grass or woodcutters being carried off now thousands of acres are cultivated with rice and during our stay we did not see a tiger the quantity of land brought into cultivation in this part of bengal and indeed throughout the gangetic delta has probably been doubled during the last twenty years and speaks volumes for the state of the peasant under the indian companys sway as compared with his former condition the silchar rice is of admirable quality and much is imported to silhet the jheels not producing grain enough for the consumption of the people though silchar grows enough for ten times its population there was actually a famine six weeks before our arrival the demand from silhet being so great  the villages of cachar are peopled by mahometans munniporees nagas and cookies the cacharies themselves being a poor and peaceful jungle tribe confined to the mountains north of the soormah the munniporees the munnipore valley has never been explored by any naturalist its mountains are said to be pineclad and to rise 8000 feet above the level of the sea the rajah is much harassed by the birmese and is a dependant of the british who are in the very frequent dilemma of supporting on the throne a sovereign opposed by a strong faction of his countrymen and who has very dubious claims to his position during our stay at silchar the supposed rightful rajah was prevailing over the usurper a battle had been fought on the hills on the frontier and two bodies floated past our bungalow pierced with arrows are emigrants from the kingdom of that name which lies beyond the british possessions and borders on assam and birmah low ranges of forestclad mountains at the head of the soormah separate it from silchar with which it is coterminous the two chief towns being seven marches apart to the southeast of silchar are interminable jungles peopled by the cookies a wild indochinese tribe who live in a state of constant warfare and possess the whole hillcountry from this southward to beyond chittagong two years ago they invaded and ravaged cachar carrying many of the inhabitants into slavery and so frightening the people that land previously worth six rupees a biggah is now reduced to one and a half colonel lister was sent with a strong party to rescue the captives and marched for many days through their country without disturbing man or beast penetrating deep forests of gigantic trees and tall bamboos never seeing the sun above or aught to the right and left save an occasional clearance and a deserted village the incursion however had its effects and the better inclined near the frontier have since come forward and been enrolled as the cookie levy  the munnipore emigrants are industrious settlers for a time but never remain long in one place their religion is hindoo and they keep up a considerable trade with their own country whence they import a large breed of buffalos ponies silks and cotton cloths dyed with arnotto bixa and universally used for turbans they use bamboo blowingtubes and arrows for shooting birds make excellent shields of rhinoceros hide imported from assam and play at hockey on horseback like the western tibetans a fine black varnish from the fruit of holigarna longifolia is imported from munnipore as is another made from sesuvium anacardium markingnut and a remarkable black pigment resembling that from melanorhoea usitatissima which is white when fresh and requires to be kept under water this turns of a beautiful black colour when applied to a surface owing according to sir d brewster to the fresh varnish consisting of a congeries of minute organised particles which disperse the rays of light in all directions the organic structure is destroyed when the varnish dries and the rays of light are consequently transmitted  one fine moonlight night we went to see a munnipore dance a large circular area was thatched with plantain leaves growing on their trunks which were stuck in the ground and round the enclosure was a border neatly cut from the white leafsheaths of the same tree a double enclosure of bamboo similarly ornamented left an inner circle for the performers and an outer for the spectators the whole was lighted with oil lamps and chinese paper lanterns the musicians sat on one side with cymbals tomtoms and flutes and sang choruses  the performances began by a coppercoloured cupid entering and calling the virgins with a flute these appeared from a greenroom to the number of thirty or forty of all ages and sizes each had her hair dressed in a topknot and her head covered with a veil a scarlet petticoat loaded with tinsel concealed her naked feet and over this was a short red kirtle and an enormous white shawl was swathed round the body from the armpits to the waist a broad belt passed over the right shoulder and under the left arm to which hung gold and silver chains corals etc with tinsel and small mirrors sewed on everywhere the arms and hands were bare and decorated with bangles and rings  many of the women were extremely tall great stature being common amongst the munniporees they commenced with a prostration to cupid around whom they danced very slowly with the arms stretched out and the hands in motion at each step the free foot was swung backwards and forwards cupid then chose a partner and standing in the middle went through the same motions a compliment the women acknowledged by curtseying and whirling round making a sort of cheese with their petticoats which however were too heavy to inflate properly  the nagas are another people found on this frontier chiefly on the hills to the north they are a wild coppercoloured uncouth jungle tribe who have proved troublesome on the assam frontier their features are more tartar than those of the munniporees especially amongst the old men they bury their dead under the threshold of their cottages the men are all but naked and stick plumes of hornbills feathers in their hair which is bound with strips of bamboo tufts of small feathers are passed through their ears and worn as shoulder lappets a short blue cotton cloth with a fringe of tinsel and tufts of goats hair dyed red is passed over the loins in front only they also wear brass armlets and necklaces of cowries coral amber ivory and boars teeth the women draw a fringed blue cloth tightly across the breast and wear a checked or striped petticoat they are less ornamented than the men and are pleasing looking their hair is straight and cut short over the eyebrows  the naga dances are very different from those of the munniporees being quick and performed in excellent time to harmonious music the figures are regular like quadrilles and countrydances the men hold their knives erect during the performance the women extend their arms only when turning partners and then their hands are not given but the palms are held opposite the step is a sort of polka and balancez very graceful and lively a bar of music is always played first and at the end the spectators applaud with two short shouts their ear for music and the nature of their dance are as tibetan as their countenances and different from those of the indochinese tribes of the frontier  we had the pleasure of meeting lieutenant raban at silchar and of making several excursions in the neighbourhood with him for which colonel lister here as at churra afforded us every facility of elephants and men had we had time it was our intention to have visited munnipore but we were anxious to proceed to chittagong i however made a three days excursion to the frontier about thirty miles distant proceeding along the north bank of the soormah on the way my elephant got bogged in crossing a deep muddy stream this is sometimes an alarming position as should the animal become terrified he will seize his rider or pad or any other object except his driver to place under his knees to prevent his sinking in this instance the driver in great alarm ordered me off and i had to flounder out through the black mud the elephant remained fast all night and was released next morning by men with ropes  the country continued a grassy level with marshes and rice cultivation to the first range of hills beyond which the river is unnavigable there also a forest commences of oaks figs and the common trees of east bengal the road hence was a good one cut by sepoys across the dividing ranges the first of which is not 500 feet high on the ascent bamboos abound of the kind called tuldah or dulloah which has long very thinwalled joints it attains no great size but is remarkably gregarious on the east side of the range the road runs through soft shales and beds of clay and conglomerates descending to a broad valley covered with gigantic scattered timbertrees of jarool acacia diospyros urticeae and bauhiniae rearing their enormous trunks above the bamboo jungle immense rattancanes wound through the forest and in the gullies were groves of two kinds of treefern two of areca wallichia palm screwpine and dracaena wild rice grew abundantly in the marshes with tall grasses and cardiopteris a remarkable plant of unknown affinity see brown and bennett flora java it is found in the assam valley and chittagong covered the trees for upwards of sixty feet like hops with a mass of palegreen foliage and dry white glistening seedvessels this forest differed from those of the silhet and khasia mountains especially in the abundance of bamboo jungle which is i believe the prevalent feature of the low hills in birmah ava and munnipore also in the gigantic size of the rattans larger palms and different forest trees and in the scanty undergrowth of herbs and bushes i only saw however the skirts of the forest the mountains further east which i am told rise several thousand feet in limestone cliffs are doubtless richer in herbaceous plants  the climate of cachar partakes of that of the jheels in its damp equable character during our stay the weather was fine and dense fogs formed in the morning the mean maximum was 80 degrees minimum 584 degrees the temperature does not rise above 90 degrees in summer nor sink below 45 degrees or 50 degrees in january fortyseven comparative observations with calcutta showed the mean temperature to be 18 degrees lower at silchar and the air damper the saturation point being at calcutta 03791 at silchar 04379  the annual rainfall in 1850 was 11160 inches according to a register kindly given me by captain verner there are few mosquitos which is one of the most curious facts in the geographical distribution of these capricious bloodsuckers for the locality is surrounded by swamps and they swarm at silhet and on the river lower down both on the passage up and down we were tormented in our canoes by them for eighty or ninety miles above silhet and thence onwards to cachar we were free  on the 30th of november we were preparing for our return to silhet and our canoes were loading when we were surprised by a loud rushing noise and saw a high wave coming down the river swamping every boat that remained on its banks whilst most of those that pushed out into the stream escaped with a violent rocking it was caused by a slip of the bank three quarters of a mile up the stream of no great size but which propagated a high wave this appeared to move on at about the rate of a mile in three or four minutes giving plenty of time for our boatmen to push out from the land on hearing the shouts of those first overtaken by the calamity but they were too timid and consequently one of our canoes full of papers instruments and clothes was swamped happily our dried collections were not embarked and the hot sun repaired much of the damage  we left in the evening of the 2nd of december and proceeded to silhet where we were kindly received by mr stainforth the district judge silhet the capital of the district of the same name is a large mahometan town occupying a slightly raised part of the jheels where many of the teelas seem joined together by beds of gravel and sand in the rains it is surrounded by water and all communication with other parts is by boats in winter jynteapore and pundua may be reached by land crossing creeks innumerable on the way mr stainforths house like those of most of the other europeans occupies the top of one of the teelas 150 feet high and is surrounded by fine spreading oaks it is not generally known that oaks are often very tropical plants not only abounding at low elevations in the mountains but descending in abundance to the level of the sea though unknown in ceylon the peninsula of india tropical africa or south america they abound in the hot valleys of the eastern himalaya east bengal malay peninsula and indian islands where perhaps more species grow than in any other part of the world such facts as this disturb our preconceived notions of the geographical distribution of the most familiar tribes of plants and throw great doubt on the conclusions which fossil plants are supposed to indicate garcinia and diospyros trees the rock of which the hill is composed is a slaglike ochreous sandstone covered in most places with a shrubbery of roseflowered melastoma and some peculiar plants gelonium adelia moacurra linostoma justicia trophis connarus ixora congea dalhousiea grewia myrsine buttneria and on the shady exposures a calamus briedelia and various ferns  broad flat valleys divide the hills and are beautifully clothed with a bright green jungle of small palms and many kinds of ferns in sandy places blueflowered burmannia hypoxis and other pretty tropical annuals expand their blossoms with an inconspicuous stylidium a plant belonging to a small natural family whose limits are so confined to new holland that this is almost the only kind that does not grow in that continent where the ground is swampy dwarf pandanus abounds with the gigantic nettle urtica crenulata mealumma of sikkim see chapter xxiv  the most interesting botanical ramble about silhet is to the treefern groves on the path to jynteapore following the bottoms of shallow valleys between the teelas and along clear streams up whose beds we waded for some miles under an arching canopy of tropical shrubs trees and climbers tall grasses screwpines and aroideae in the narrower parts of the valleys the treeferns are numerous on the slopes rearing their slender brown trunks forty feet high with feathery crowns of foliage through which the sunbeams trembled on the broad shining foliage of the tropical herbage below  silhet though hot and damp is remarkably healthy and does not differ materially in temperature from silchar though it is more equable and humid during our stay of five days the mean maximum temperature was 74 degrees minimum 648 degrees that of thirtytwo observations compared with calcutta show that silhet is only 17 degrees cooler though mr stainforths house is upwards of 2 degrees further north and 160 feet more elevated a thermometer sunk two feet seven inches stood at 735 degrees the relative saturationpoints were calcutta 633 silhet 821 it derives some interest from having been first brought into notice by the enterprise of one of the lindsays of balcarres at a time when the pioneers of commerce in india encountered great hardships and much personal danger mr lindsay a writer in the service of the east india company established a factory at silhet and commenced the lime trade with calcutta for an account of the early settlement of silhet see lives of the lindsays by lord lindsay reaping an enormous fortune himself and laying the foundation of that prosperity amongst the people which has been much advanced by the exertions of the inglis family and has steadily progressed under the protecting rule of the indian government  from silhet we took large boats to navigate the burrampooter and megna to their embouchure in the bay of bengal at noacolly a distance of 250 miles whence we were to proceed across the head of the bay to chittagong about 100 miles farther we left on the 7th of december and arrived at chattuc on the 9th where we met our khasia collectors with large loads of plants and paid them off the river was now low and presented a busy scene from the numerous trading boats being confined to its fewer and deeper channels long grasses and sedges arundo saccharum and scleria were cut and stacked along the waters edge in huge brown piles for export and thatching  on the 13th december we entered the broad stream of the megna rice is cultivated along the mud flats left by the annual floods and the banks are lower and less defined than in the soormah and support no long grasses or bushes enormous islets of living watergrasses oplismenus stagninus and other plants floated past and birds became more numerous especially martins and egrets the sun was hot but the weather otherwise cool and pleasant the mean temperature was nearly that of calcutta 697 degrees but the atmosphere was more humid the riverwater was greenish and a little cooler 738 degrees than that of the soormah 743 degrees which was brown and muddy the barometer on the soormah stood 0028 inch higher than that of calcutta on the mean of thirtyeight observations whereas on the megna the pressure was 0010 higher as calcutta is eighteen feet above the level of the bay of bengal this shows that the megna which has no perceptible current is at the level of the sea and that either the soormah is upwards of thirty feet above that level or that the atmospheric pressure there and at this season is less than at calcutta which as i have hinted at chapter xxvii is probably the case  on the 14th we passed the dacca river below which the megna is several miles wide and there is an appearance of tide from masses of purple salvinia a floating plant allied to ferns being thrown up on the beach like seaweed still lower down the vegetation of the sunderbunds commences there is a narrow beach and behind it a mud bank several feet high supporting a luxuriant green jungle of palms borassus and phoenix immense figtrees covered with calami and tall betelpalms clothed with the most elegant drapery of arostichum scandens a climbing fern with pendulous fronds  towards the embouchure the banks rise ten feet high the river expands into a muddy sea and a long swell rolls in to the disquiet of our freshwater boatmen low islands of sand and mud stretch along the horizon which together with the ships distorted by extraordinary refraction flicker as if seen through smoke mud is the all prevalent feature and though the water is not salt we do not observe in these broad deltas that amount of animal life birds fish alligators and porpoises that teems in the narrow creeks of the western sunderbunds  we landed in a canallike creek at tuktacolly colly signifies a muddy creek such as intersect the delta on the 17th and walked to noacolly over a flat of hard mud or dried silt covered with turf of cynodon dactylon we were hospitably received by dr baker a gentleman who has resided here for twentythree years and who communicated to us much interesting information respecting the features of the gangetic delta  noacolly is a station for collecting the revenue and preventing the manufacture of salt which with opium are the only monopolies now in the hands of the east india company the salt itself is imported from arracan ceylon and even europe and is stored in great wooden buildings here and elsewhere the ground being impregnated with salt the illicit manufacture by evaporation is not easily checked but whereas the average number of cases brought to justice used to be twenty and thirty in a week they are now reduced to two or three it is remarkable that though the soil yields such an abundance of this mineral the water of the megna at noacolly is only brackish and it is therefore to repeated inundations and surface evaporations that the salt is due fresh water is found at a very few feet depth everywhere but it is not good  when it is considered how comparatively narrow the seaboard of the delta is the amount of difference in the physical features of the several parts will appear most extraordinary i have stated that the difference between the northern and southern halves of the delta is so great that were all depressed and their contents fossilised the geologist who examined each by itself would hardly recognise the two parts as belonging to one epoch and the difference between the east and west halves of the lower delta is equally remarkable  the total breadth of the delta is 260 miles from chittagong to the mouth of the hoogly divided longitudinally by the megna all to the west of that river presents a luxuriant vegetation while to the east is a bare muddy expanse with no trees or shrubs but what are planted on the west coast the tides rise twelve or thirteen feet on the east from forty to eighty on the west the water is salt enough for mangroves to grow for fifty miles up the hoogly on the east the sea coast is too fresh for that plant for ten miles south of chittagong on the west fifty inches is the cuttack fall of rain on the east 90 to 120 at noacolly and chittagong and 200 at arracan the east coast is annually visited by earthquakes which are rare on the west and lastly the majority of the great trees and shrubs carried down from the cuttack and orissa forests and deposited on the west coast of the delta are not only different in species but in natural order from those that the fenny and chittagong rivers bring down from the jungles the cuttack forests are composed of teak sal sissoo ebony pentaptera buchanania and other trees of a dry soil and that require a dry season alternating with a wet one these are unknown in the chittagong forests which have jarool lagerstroemia mesua dipterocarpi nutmegs oaks of several kinds and many other trees not known in the cuttack forests and all typical of a perennially humid atmosphere  we were glad to find at noacolly that our observations on the progression westwards of the burrampooter see chapter xxvii were confirmed by the fact that the megna also is gradually moving in that direction leaving much dry land on the noacolly side and forming islands opposite that coast whilst it encroaches on the sunderbunds and is cutting away the islands in that direction this advance of the fresh waters amongst the sunderbunds is destructive to the vegetation of the latter which requires salt and if the megna continues its slow course westwards the obliteration of thousands of square miles of a very peculiar flora and the extinction of many species of plants and animals that exist nowhere else may ensue in ordinary cases these plants etc would take up their abode on the east coast as they were driven from the west but such might not be the case in this delta for the sweeping tides of the east coast prevent any such vegetation establishing itself there and the mud which the eastern rivers carry down becomes a caking dry soil unsuited to the germination of seeds  on our arrival at calcutta in the following february dr falconer showed us specimens of very modern peat dug out of the banks of the hoogly a few feet below the surface of the soil in which were seeds of the euryale ferox this peat dr falconer also found to contain bones of birds and fish seeds of cucumis madraspatana and another cucurbitaceous plant leaves of saccharum sara and ficus cordifolia specks of some glistening substance were scattered through the mass apparently incipient carbonisation of the peat this plant is not now known to be found nearer than dacca sixty miles northeast see chapter xxvii and indicates a very different state of the surface at calcutta at the date of its deposition than that which exists now and also shows that the estuary was then much fresher  the main land of noacolly is gradually extending seawards and has advanced four miles within twentythree years this seems sufficiently accounted for by the recession of the megna the elevation of the surface of the land is caused by the overwhelming tides and southwest hurricanes in may and october these extend thirty miles north and south of chittagong and carry the waters of the megna and fenny back over the land in a series of tremendous waves that cover islands of many hundred acres and roll three miles on to the main land on these occasions the average earthy deposit of silt separated by micaceous sand is an eighth of an inch for every tide but in october 1848 these tides covered sundeep island deposited six inches on its level surface and filled ditches several feet deep these deposits become baked by a tropical sun and resist to a considerable degree denudation by rain whether any further rise is caused by elevation from below is doubtful there is no direct evidence of it though slight earthquakes annually occur and even when they have not been felt the water of tanks has been seen to oscillate for threequarters of an hour without intermission from no discernible cause the natives are familiar with this phenomenon of which dr baker remembers two instances one in the cold season of 18345 the other in that of 18301 the earthquakes do not affect any particular month nor are they accompanied by any meteorological phenomena  noacolly is considered a healthy spot which is not the case with the sunderbund stations west of the megna the climate is uniformly hot but the thermometer never rises above 90 degrees nor sinks below 45 degrees at this temperature hoarfrost will form on straw and ice on water placed in porous pans indicating a powerful radiation the winds are northwest and north in the cold season from november to march drawing round to west in the afternoons northwest winds and heavy hailstorms are frequent from march to may when violent gales set in from the southward the rains commence in june with easterly and southerly winds and the temperature from 82 degrees to 84 degrees may and october are the hottest months the rains cease in the end of october on the 8th of november in 1849 and 12th of november in 1850 the latest epoch ever remembered there is no land or sea breeze along any part of the coast during our stay we found the mean temperature for twelve observations to be precisely that of calcutta but the humidity was more and the pressure 0040 lower we left noacolly on the 19th for chittagong the state of the tide obliging us to go on board in the night the distance is only 100 miles but the passage is considered dangerous at this time during the springtides and we were therefore provided with a large vessel and an experienced crew the great object in this navigation is to keep afloat and to make progress towards the top of the tide and during its flood and to ground during the ebb in creeks where the bore tidal wave is not violent for where the channels are broad and open the height and force of this wave rolls the largest coasting craft over and swamps them  our boatmen pushed out at 3 in the morning and brought up at 5 in a narrow muddy creek on the island of sidhee the waters retired along channels scooped several fathoms deep in black mud leaving our vessel aground six or seven feet below the top of the bank and soon afterwards there was no water to be seen as far as the eye could reach all was a glistening oozy mud except the bleak level surfaces of the islands on which neither shrub nor tree grew soon after 2 pm a white line was seen on the low black horizon which was the tidewave advancing at the rate of five miles an hour with a hollow roar it bore back the mud that was gradually slipping along the gentle slope and we were afloat an hour after at night we grounded again opposite the mouth of the fenny  by moonlight the scene was oppressively solemn on all sides the gurgling waters kept up a peculiar sound that filled the air with sullen murmurs the moonbeams slept upon the slimy surface of the mud and made the dismal landscape more ghastly still silence followed the ebb broken occasionally by the wild whistle of a bird like the curlew of which a few wheeled through the air till the harsh roar of the bore was heard to which the sailors seemed to waken by instinct the waters then closed in on every side and the far end of the reflected moonbeam was broken into flashing light that approached and soon danced beside the boat  we much regretted not being able to obtain any more accurate data than i have given as to the height of the tide at the mouth of the fenny but where the ebb sometimes retires twenty miles from highwater mark it is obviously impossible to plant any tidegauge  on the 21st we were ashore at daylight on the chittagong coast far north of the station and were greeted by the sight of hills on the horizon we were lying fully twenty feet below highwater mark and the tide was out for several miles to the westward the bank was covered with flocks of white geese feeding on short grass upon what appeared to be detached islets on the surface of the mud these islets which are often an acre in extent are composed of stratified mud they have perpendicular sides several feet high and convex surfaces owing to the tide washing away the earth from under their sides and they were further slipping seawards along the gently sloping mudbeach few or no shells or seaweed were to be seen nor is it possible to imagine a more lifeless sea than these muddy coasts present  we were three days and nights on this short voyage without losing sight of mud or land i observed the barometer whenever the boat was on the shore and found the mean of six readings all reduced to the same level to be identical with that at calcutta these being all taken at elevations lower than that of the calcutta observatory show either a diminished atmospheric pressure or that the mean level of highwater is not the same on the east and west coasts of the bay of bengal this is quite possible considering the widely different direction of the tides and currents on each and that the waters may be banked up as it were in the narrow channels of the western sunderbunds the temperature of the air was the same as at calcutta but the atmosphere was damper the water was always a degree warmer than the air  we arrived at chittagong on the 23rd of december and became the guests of mr sconce judge of the district and of mr lautour to both of whom we were greatly indebted for their hospitality and generous assistance in every way  chittagong is a large town of mahometans and mugs a birmese tribe who inhabit many parts of the malay peninsula and the coast to the northward of it the town stands on the north shore of an extensive delta formed by rivers from the lofty mountains separating this district from birma these mountains are fine objects on the horizon rising 4000 to 8000 feet they are forestclad and inhabited by turbulent races who are coterminous with the cookies of the cachar and tipperah forests if indeed they be not the same people the mountains abound with the splendid timbertrees of the cachar forests but like these are said to want teak sal and sissoo they have besides many others magnificent gurjun trees dipterocarpi the monarchs of the forests of these coasts  the natives of chittagong are excellent shipbuilders and active traders and export much rice and timber to madras and calcutta the town is large and beautifully situated interspersed with trees and tanks the hills resemble those of silhet and are covered with a similar vegetation on these the european houses are built the climate is very healthy which is not remarkable considering how closely it approximates in character to that of silhet and other places in eastern bengal but very extraordinary if it be compared with arracan only 200 miles further south which is extremely unhealthy the prominent difference between the physical features of chittagong and arracan is the presence of mangrove swamps at the latter place for which the water is too fresh at the former  the hills about the station are not more than 150 or 200 feet high and are formed of stratified gravel sand and clay that often becomes nodular and is interstratified with slaglike iron clay fossil wood is found and some of the old buildings about chittagong contain nummulitic limestone probably imported from silhet or the peninsula of india with which countries there is no such trade now the views are beautiful of the blue mountains forty to fifty miles distant and the manyarmed river covered with sails winding amongst groves of cocoanuts areca palm and yellow rice fields good european houses surmount all the eminences surrounded by trees of acacia and caesalpinia in the hollows are native huts amidst vegetation of every hue glossy green garciniae and figs broad plantains feathery cassia and acacias dark mesua redpurple terminalia leafless scarletflowered bombax and grey casuarina this which is almost exclusively an australian genus is not indigenous at chittagong to it belongs an extraaustralian species common in the malay islands and found wild as far north as arracan seaward the tide leaves immense flats called churs which stretch for many miles on either side the offing  we accompanied mr sconce to a bungalow which he has built at the telegraph station at the south head of the harbour its situation on a hill 100 feet above the sea is exposed and at this season the seabreeze was invigorating and even cold as it blew through the matwalls of the bungalow the mean temperature of the two days 29th and 30th we spent at this bungalow was 665 degrees that of calcutta being 676 degrees the air was damp and the barometer 0144 lower at the flagstaff hill but it fell and rose with the calcutta instrument to the south undulating dunes stretch along the coast covered with low bushes of which a redflowered melastoma is the most prevalent melastoma jasmine calamus aegle marmelos adelia memecylon ixora limostoma congea climbing coesalpinia and many other plants and along their bases large trees of amoora gaurea figs mesua and micromelon and is considered a species of rhododendron by many of the residents the flats along the beach are several miles broad intersected with tidal creeks and covered with short grass while below highwater mark all is mud coated with green conferva there are no leafy seaweeds or mangroves nor any seaside shrub but dilivaria ilicifolia animal life is extremely rare and a cardiumlike shell and small crab are found sparingly  coffee has been cultivated at chittagong with great success it is said to have been introduced by sir w jones and mr sconce has a small plantation from which his table is well supplied both assam and chinese teas flourish but chinamen are wanted to cure the leaves black pepper succeeds admirably as do cinnamon arrowroot and ginger  early in january we accompanied mr lautour on an excursion to the north following a valley separated from the coast by a range of wooded hills 1000 feet high for several marches the bottom of this valley was broad flat and full of villages at sidhee about twentyfive miles from chittagong it contracts and spurs from the hills on either flank project into the middle they are 200 to 300 feet high formed of red clay and covered with brushwood at kajeekehath the most northern point we reached we were quite amongst these hills and in an extremely picturesque country intersected by long winding flat valleys that join one another some are full of copsewood while others present the most beautiful parklike scenery and a third class expand into grassy marshes or lakebeds with wooded islets rising out of them the hillsides are clothed with low jungle above which tower magnificent gurjun trees woodoil the whole contour of this country is that of a low bay whose coast is raised above the sea and over which a high tide once swept for ages  the elevation of hazarikehath is not 100 feet above the level of the sea it is about ten miles west of the mouth of the fenny from which it is separated by hills 1000 feet high its river falls into that at chittagong thirty miles south large myrtaceous trees eugenia are common and show a tendency to the malayan flora which is further demonstrated by the abundance of gurjun dipterocarpus turbinatus this is the most superb tree we met with in the indian forests we saw several species but this is the only common one here it is conspicuous for its gigantic size and for the straightness and graceful form of its tall unbranched pale grey trunk and small symmetrical crown many individuals were upwards of 200 feet high and fifteen in girth its leaves are broad glossy and beautiful the flowers then falling are not conspicuous the wood is hard closegrained and durable and a fragrant oil exudes from the trunk which is extremely valuable as pitch and varnish etc besides being a good medicine the natives procure it by cutting transverse holes in the trunk pointing downwards and lighting fires in them which causes the oil to flow the other trees of these dry forests are many oaks henslowia gordonia engelhardtia duabanga adelia byttneria bradleia and large trees of pongamia whose seeds yield a useful oil  illustrationgurjun tree  on the 8th of january we experienced a sharp earthquake preceded by a dull thumping sound it lasted about twenty seconds and seemed to come up from the southward the water of a tank by which we were seated was smartly agitated the same shock was felt at mymensing and at dacca 110 miles northwest of this earthquakes are extremely common and sometimes violent at chittagong and doubtless belong to the volcanic forces of the malayan peninsula  we crossed the dividing ridge of the littoral range on the 9th and descended to seetakoond bungalow on the high road from chittagong to comilla the forests at the foot of the range were very extensive and swarmed with large red ants that proved very irritating they build immense pendulous nests of dead and living leaves at the ends of the branches of trees and mat them with a white web tigers leopards wild dogs and boars are numerous as are snipes pheasants peacocks and junglefowl the latter waking the morn with their shrill crows and in strange association with them common english woodcock is occasionally found  the trees are of little value except the gurjun and kistooma a species of bradleia which was stacked extensively being used for building purposes the papaw the papaw tree is said to have the curious property of rendering tough meat tender when hung under its leaves or touched with the juice this hastening the process of decay with this fact wellknown in the west indies i never found a person in the east acquainted is abundantly cultivated and its great gourdlike fruit is eaten called papita or chinaman the flavour is that of a bad melon and a white juice exudes from the rind the hodgsonia heteroclita trichosanthes of roxburgh a magnificent cucurbitaceous climber grows in these forests it is the same species as the sikkim one see chapter xviii the long stem bleeds copiously when cut and like almost all woody climbers is full of large vessels the juice does not however exude from these great tubes which hold air but from the close woody fibres a climbing apocyneous plant grows in these forests the milk of which flows in a continuous stream resembling caoutchouc it is probably the urceola elastica which yields indianrubber  the subject of bleeding is involved in great obscurity and the systematic examination of the motions in the juices of tropical climbers by resident observers offers a fertile field to the naturalist i have often remarked that if a climbing stem in which the circulation is vigorous be cut across it bleeds freely from both ends and most copiously from the lower if it be turned downwards but that if a truncheon be severed there will be no flow from either of its extremities this is the case with all the indian wateryjuiced climbers at whatever season they may be cut when however the circulation in the plant is feeble neither end of a simple cut will bleed much but if a truncheon be taken from it both the extremities will  the ascent of the hills which are densely wooded was along spurs and over knolls of clay the rocks were sandy and slaty dip northeast 60 degrees the road was good but always through bamboo jungle and it wound amongst the low spurs so that there was no defined crest or top of the pass which is about 800 feet high there were no tall palms treeferns or plantains no hymenophylla or lycopodia and altogether the forest was smaller and poorer in plants than we had expected the only palms except a few rattans were two kinds of wallichia  from the summit we obtained a very extensive and singular view at our feet was a broad low grassy alluvial plain intersected by creeks bounding a black expanse of mud which the tide being out appeared to stretch almost continuously to sundeep island thirty miles distant while beyond the blue hills of tipperah rose on the northwest horizon the rocks yielded a dry poor soil on which grew dwarf phoenix and cycaspalm cycas circinalis or pectinata  descending we rode several miles along an excellent road that runs to tipperah and stopped at the bungalow of seetakoond twentyfive miles north of chittagong the west flank of the range which we had crossed is much steeper than the east often precipitous and presents the appearance of a seaworn cliff towards the bay of bengal near seetakoond which is on the plain a hill on the range bearing the same name rises 1136 feet high and being damper and more luxuriantly wooded we were anxious to explore it and therefore spent some days at the bungalow fields of poppy and sun crotalaria juncea formed most beautiful crops the latter grows from four to six feet high and bears masses of laburnumlike flowers while the poppy fields resembled a carpet of darkgreen velvet sprinkled with white stars or as i have elsewhere remarked a green lake studded with waterlilies  the road to the top of seetakoond leads along a most beautiful valley and then winds up a cliff that is in many places almost precipitous the ascent being partly by steps cut in the rock of which there are 560 the mountain is very sacred and there is a large brahmin temple on its flank and near the base a perpetual flame bursts out of the rock this we were anxious to examine and were extremely disappointed to find it a small vertical hole in a slaty rock with a lateral one below for a draught and that it is daily supplied by pious pilgrims and brahmins with such enormous quantities of ghee liquid butter that it is to all intents and purposes an artificial lamp no trace of natural phenomena being discoverable  illustrationseetakund hill  on the dry but wooded west face of the mountain grows falconeria a curious euphorbiaceous tree with an acrid milky juice that affects the eyes when the wood is cut beautiful cycas palms are also common with terminalia bignonia sterculia dwarf phoenix palm and gurjun trees the east slope of the mountain is damper and much more densely wooded we there found two wild species of nutmeg trees whose wood is full of a brown acrid oil seven palms treeferns and many other kinds of ferns several kinds of oak dracaena and figs the top is 1136 feet above the sea and commands an extensive view to all points of the compass but the forests in which the ashy bark of the gurjun trees is conspicuous and the beautiful valley on the west are the only attractive features  the weather on the east side of the range differs at this season remarkably from that on the west where the vicinity of the sea keeps the atmosphere more humid and warm and at the same time prevents the formation of the dense fogs that hang over the valleys to the eastward every morning at sunrise we found the mean temperature at the bungalow from january 9th till the 13th to be 702 degrees  we embarked again at chittagong on the 16th of january at 10 pm for calcutta in a very large vessel rowed by twelve men we made wretchedly slow progress for the reasons mentioned earlier being for four days within sight of chittagong on the 20th we only reached sidhee and thence made a stretch to hattiah an island which may be said to be moving bodily to the westward the megna annually cutting many acres from the east side and the tidewave depositing mud on the west the surface is flat and raised four feet above mean highwater level the tide rises about 14 feet up the bank and then retires for miles the total rise and fall is however much less here than in the fenny higher up the gulf the turf is composed of cynodon and a fimbristylis and the earth being impregnated with salt supports different kinds of chenopodium two kinds of tamarisk and a thorny cassia and exoecaria are the only shrubs on the eastern islands on the central ones a few dwarf mangroves appear with the hollyleaved dilivaria dwarf screwpine pandanus a shrub of compositae and a curious fern a variety of aristichum aureum towards the northern end of hattiah talipot cocoanut and datepalms appear  on the 22nd we entered the sunderbunds rowing amongst narrow channels where the tide rises but a few feet the banks were covered with a luxuriant vegetation chiefly of small trees above which rose stately palms on the 25th we were overtaken by a steamer from assam a novel sight to us and a very strange one in these creeks which in some places seemed hardly broad enough for it to pass through we jumped on board in haste leaving our boat and luggage to follow us she had left dacca two days before and this being the dry season the route to calcutta which is but sixty miles in a straight line involved a detour of three hundred  from the masts of the steamer we obtained an excellent coupdoeil of the sunderbunds its swamps clothed with verdure and intersected by innumerable inosculating channels with banks a foot or so high the amount of tide which never exceeds ten feet diminishes in proceeding westwards into the heart of these swamps and the epoch direction and duration of the ebb and flow vary so much in every canal that at times after stemming a powerful current we found ourselves without materially changing our course suddenly swept along with a favouring stream this is owing to the complex ramifications of the creeks the flow of whose waters is materially influenced by the most trifling accidents of direction  receding from the megna the water became saltier and nipa fruticans appeared throwing up pale yellowgreen tufts of feathery leaves from a short thick creeping stem and bearing at the base of the leaves its great head of nuts of which millions were floating on the waters and vegetating in the mud marks of tigers were very frequent and the footprints of deer wild boars and enormous crocodiles these reptiles were extremely common and glided down the mud banks on the approach of the steamer leaving between the footmarks a deep groove in the mud made by their tail the phoenix paludosa a dwarf slenderstemmed datepalm from six to eight feet high is the allprevalent feature covering the whole landscape with a carpet of feathery fronds of the liveliest green the species is eminently gregarious more so than any other indian palm and presents so dense a mass of foliage that when seen from above the stems are wholly hidden sonneratia heritiera littoralis and careya form small gnarled trees on the banks with deep shining greenleaved species of carallia rhizophora and other mangroves occasionally the gigantic reedmace typha elephantina is seen and tufts of tall reeds arundo  the water is very turbid and only ten to twenty feet deep which we were assured by the captain was not increased during the rains it is loaded with vegetable matter but the banks are always muddy and we never saw any peat dense fogs prevented our progress in the morning and we always anchored at dusk we did not see a village or house in the heart of the sunderbunds though such do occur but we saw canoes with fishermen who use the tame otter in fishing and the banks were covered with piles of firewood stacked for the calcutta market as we approached the hoogly the water became very salt and clear the nipa fruits were still most abundant floating out to sea but no more of the plant itself was seen as the channels became broader sandflats appeared with old salt factories and clumps of planted casuarina  on the 28th of january we passed saugor island and entered the hoogly steamed past diamond harbour and landed at the botanic garden ghat where we received a hearty welcome from dr falconer ten days later we bade farewell to india reaching england on the 25th of march 1851   appendix a  meteorological observations in behar and in the valleys of the soane and ganges  most of the instruments which i employed were constructed by mr newman and with considerable care they were in general accurate and always extremely well guarded and put up in the most portable form and that least likely to incur damage they were further frequently carefully compared by myself these are points to which too little attention is paid by makers and by travellers in selecting instruments and their cases this remark applies particularly to portable barometers of which i had five at various times although there are obvious defects in the system of adjustment and in the method of obtaining the temperature of the mercury i found that these instruments invariably worked well and were less liable to derangement and fracture than any i ever used the best proof i can give of this is that i preserved three uninjured during nearly all my excursions left two in india and brought a third home myself that had accompanied me almost throughout my journey  in very dry climates these and all other barometers are apt to leak from the contraction of the boxwood plug through which the tube passes into the cistern this must in portable barometers in very dry weather be kept moist with a sponge a small iron bottle of pure mercury to supply leakage should be supplied with every barometer as also a turnscrew the vernier plate and scale should be screwed not soldered on the metal sheath as if an escape occurs in the barometercase the solder is acted upon at once a table of corrections for capacity and capillarity should accompany every instrument and simple directions etc in cases of trifling derangement and alteration of neutral point  the observations for temperature were taken with every precaution to avoid radiation and the thermometers were constantly compared with a standard and the errors allowed for the maximum thermometer with a steel index i found to be extremely liable to derangement and very difficult to readjust negrettis maximum thermometer was not known to me during my journey the spirit minimum thermometers again are easily set to rights when out of order but in every one of six or seven which i took to india by several makers the zero point receded the error in some increasing annually even to6 degrees in two years this seems due to a vaporisation of the spirit within the tube i have seen a thermometer of this description in india of which the spirit seemed to have retired wholly into the bulb and which i was assured had never been injured in wetbulb observations distilled water or rain or snow water was used but i never found the result to differ from that obtained by any running fresh water except such as was polluted to the taste and eye  the hours of observation selected were at first sunrise 9 am 3 pm sunset and 9 pm according to the instructions issued to the antarctic expedition by the royal society in sikkim however i generally adopted the hours appointed at the surveyor generals office calcutta viz sunrise 9h 50m am noon 2h 40m pm 4 pm and sunset to which i added a 10 pm observation besides many at intermediate hours as often as possible of these the 9h 50m am and 4 pm have been experimentally proved to be those of the maximum and minimum of atmospheric pressure at the level of the sea in india and i did not find any great or marked deviation from this at any height to which i attained though at 15000 or 16000 feet the morning maximum may occur rather earlier  the observations for nocturnal terrestrial radiation were made by freely suspending thermometers with naked bulbs or by laying them on white cotton wool or flannel also by means of a thermometer placed in the focus of a silvered parabolic reflector i did not find that the reflector possessed any decided advantage over the white cotton the means of a number of observations taken by each approximated closely but the difference between individual observations often amounted to 2 degrees  observations again indicative of the radiation from grass whether dewed or dry are not strictly comparable not only does the power of radiation vary with the species but much more with the luxuriance and length of the blades with the situation whether on a plane surface or raised and with the subjacent soil of the great effect of the soil i had frequent instances similar tufts of the same species of grass radiating more powerfully on the dry sandy bed of the soane than on the alluvium on its banks the exposure being equal in both instances experiments for the surfacetemperature of the soil itself are least satisfactory of anyadjoining localities being no less affected by the nature than by the state of disintegration of the surface and by the amount of vegetation in proximity to the instrument  the power of the suns rays in india is so considerable and protracted through so long a period of the day that i did not find the temperature of springs or of running water even of large deep rivers so constant as was to be expected  the temperature of the earth was taken by sinking a brass tube a yard long in the soil  a thermometer with the bulb blackened affords the only means the traveller can generally compass of measuring the power of the suns rays it should be screened or put in a blackened box or laid on black wool  a good photometer being still a desideratum i had recourse to the old wedge of coloured glass of an uniform neutral tint the distance between whose extremes or between transparency and total opacity was one foot a moveable arm carrying a brass plate with a slit and a vernier enables the observer to read off at the vanishing point of the suns limb to one fivehundredth of an inch i generally took the mean of five readings as one and the mean of five of these again i regarded as one observation but i place little dependence upon the results the causes of error are quite obvious as far as the effects of the suns light on vegetation are concerned i am inclined to think that it is of more importance to register the number of hours or rather of parts of each hour that the sun shines and its clearness during the time to secure valuable results this should be done repeatedly and the strength of the rays by the blackbulb thermometer registered at each hour the few actinometer observations will be found in another part of the appendix  the dewpoint has been calculated from the wetbulb by dr apjohns formula or where the depression of the barometer is considerable by that as modified by colonel boileau journal of asiatic society no 147 1844 p135 the saturationpoint was obtained by dividing the tension at the dewpoint by that at the ordinary temperature and the weight of vapour by daniells formula  the following summary of meteorological observations is alluded to at vol i chapter i   itableland of birbhoom and behar from taldanga to dunwah average elevation 1135 feet  it is evident from these observations that compared with calcutta the dryness of the atmosphere is the most remarkable feature of this tableland the temperature not being high and to this combined with the sterility of the soil over a great part of the surface must be attributed the want of a vigorous vegetation though so favourably exposed to the influence of nocturnal radiation the amount of the latter is small the maximum depression of a thermometer laid on grass never exceeded 10 degrees and averaged 7 degrees whereas the average depression of the dewpoint at the same hour amounted to 25 degrees in the morning of course no dew was deposited even in the clearest starlight night

occasion and that at night the dewpoint was as low as 115 degrees with a temperature of 66 degrees a depression rarely equalled at so low a temperature this phenomenon was transient and caused by the passage of a current of air loaded with dust whose particles possibly absorbed the atmospheric humidity from a comparison of the night and morning observations of thermometers laid on grass the earth and freely exposed it appears that the grass parts with its heat much more rapidly than the earth but that still the effect of radiation is slight lowering its temperature but 2 degrees below that of the freely exposed thermometer  as compared with the climate of calcutta these hills present a remarkable contrast considering their proximity in position and moderate elevation  the difference of temperature between calcutta and birbhoom deduced from the sunrise morning and afternoon observations amounts to 4 degrees which if the mean height of the hills where crossed by the road be called 1135 feet will be equal to a fall of one degree for every 288 feet  in the dampness of its atmosphere calcutta contrasts very remarkably with these hills the dewpoint on the hoogly averaging 513 degrees and on these hills 38 degrees the corresponding saturationpoints being 0559 and 0380  the difference between sunrise forenoon and afternoon dewpoints at calcutta and on the hills is 136 degrees at each observation but the atmosphere at calcutta is relatively drier in the afternoon than that of the hills the difference between the calcutta sunrise and afternoon saturationpoint being 0449 and that between the hill sunrise and afternoon 0190 the march of the dewpoint is thus the same in both instances but owing to the much higher temperature of calcutta and the greatly increased tension of the vapour there the relative humidity varies greatly during the day  in other words the atmosphere of calcutta is loaded with moisture in the early morning of this season and is relatively dry in the afternoon in the hills again it is scarcely more humid at sunrise than at 3 pm that this dryness of the hills is partly due to elevation appears from the disproportionately moister state of the atmosphere below the dunwah pass    ii abstract of the meteorological observations taken in the soane valley mean elevation 422 feet  the difference in mean temperature partly owing to the suns more northerly declination amounts to 25 degrees of increase in the soane valley above that of the hills the range of the thermometer from day to day was considerably greater on the hills though fewer observations were there recorded it amounted to 172 degrees on the hills and only 128 degrees in the valley the range from the maximum to the minimum of each day amounts to the same in both above 20 degrees the extreme variations in temperature too coincide within 14 degrees  the hygrometric state of the atmosphere of the valley differs most decidedly from that of the hills in the valley dew is constantly formed which is owing to the amount of moisture in the air for nocturnal radiation is more powerful on the hills the sunrise and 9 pm observations in the valley give a mean depression of the dewpoint below the air of 123 degrees and those at the upper level of 212 degrees with no dew on the hills and a copious deposit in the valley the corresponding state of the atmosphere as to saturation is 0480 on the hills and 0626 in the valley  the vegetation of the soane valley is exposed to a less extreme temperature than that of the hills the difference between solar and nocturnal radiation amounting here only to 805 degrees and on the hills to 965 degrees there is no material difference in the power of the suns rays at the upper and lower levels as expressed by the blackbulb thermometer the average rise of which above one placed in the shade amounted to 48 degrees in both cases and the maximum occurred about 11 am the decrease of the power of the suns rays in the afternoon is much the most rapid in the valley coinciding with a greater reduction of the elasticity of vapour and of humidity in the atmosphere  the photometer observations show a greater degree of suns light on the hills than below but there is not at either station a decided relation between the indications of this instrument and the blackbulb thermometer from observations taken elsewhere i am inclined to attribute the excess of solar light on the hills to their elevation for at a far greater elevation i have met with much stronger solar light in a very damp atmosphere than i ever experienced in the drier plains of india in a damp climate the greatest intensity may be expected in the forenoon when the vapour is diffused near the earths surface in the afternoon the lower strata of atmosphere are drier but the vapour is condensed into clouds aloft which more effectually obstruct the suns rays on the birbhoom and behar hills where the amount of vapour is so small that the afternoon is but little drier than the forenoon there is little difference between the solar light at each time in the soane valley again where a great deal of humidity is removed from the earths surface and suspended aloft the obstruction of the suns light is very marked   dunwah to soane river and up soane to tura february 1019th  hour                               sunrise  9 am  3 pm  9 pm

great decrease in the tension of the vapour from 9 am to 3 pm is the effect of the great violence of the northwest winds  from the few days observations taken on the kymore hills the temperature of their flat tops appeared 5 degrees higher than that of the soane valley which is 500 feet below their mean level i can account for this anomaly only on the supposition that the thick bed of alluvium freely exposed to the sun not clothed with jungle absorbs the suns rays and parts with its heat slowly this is indicated by the increase of temperature being due to the night and morning observations which are 31 degrees and 85 degrees higher here than below whilst the 9 am and 3 pm temperatures are half a degree lower  the variations of temperature too are all much less in amount as are those of the state of the atmosphere as to moisture though the climate is rather damper  on the subject of terrestrial radiation the paucity of the observations precludes my dwelling between 9 pm and sunrise the following morning i found the earth to have lost but 65 degrees of heat whereas a mean of nine observations at the same hours in the valley below indicated a loss of 12 degrees  though the mean temperature deduced from the few days i spent on this part of the kymore is so much above that of the upper soane valley which it bounds i do not suppose that the whole hilly range partakes of this increase when the alluvium does not cover the rock as at rotas and many other places especially along the southern and eastern ridges of the ghats the nights are considerably cooler than on the banks of the soane and at rotas itself which rises almost perpendicularly from the river and is exposed to no such radiation of heat from a heated soil as shahgunj is i found the temperature considerably below that of akbarpore on the soane which however is much sheltered by an amphitheatre of rocks   v mirzapore on the ganges  during the few days spent at mirzapore i was surprised to find the temperature of the day cooler by nearly 4 degrees than that of the hills above or of the upper part of the soane valley while the nights on the other hand were decidedly warmer the dewpoint was even lower in proportion 76 degrees and the climate consequently drier the following is an abstract of the observations taken at mr hamiltons house on the banks of the ganges below  it is remarkable that nocturnal radiation as registered at sunrise is much more powerful at mirzapore than on the more exposed kymore plateau the depression of the thermometer freely exposed being 3 degrees greater that laid on bare earth 6 degrees and that on the grass 14 degrees greater on the banks of the ganges  during my passage down the ganges the rise of the dewpoint was very steady the maximum occurring at the lowest point on the river bhaugulpore which as compared with mirzapore showed an increase of 8 degrees in temperature and of 306 degrees in the rise of the dewpoint the saturationpoint at mirzakore was 331 and at the corresponding hours at bhaugulpore 742  mirzapore elev 362 feet march 9th to 13th 1848  hour                               sunrise  9 am  3 pm  9 pm temperature   mean

indebted to the kindness of the able chemist and naturalist mentioned above will be highly valued both by those who are interested in the many curious physiological questions involved in the association of the most obscure forms of vegetable life with the remarkable phenomena of mineral springs or in the exquisitely beautiful microscopic structure of the lower algae which has thrown so much light upon a branch of natural history whose domain like that of astronomy lies to a great extent beyond the reach of the unassisted eyejdh  1 mineral water soorujkoond behar vol i chap ii

the bottle was opened the saline matter in solution was considerably less than in the soorujkoond water but like that consisted of chloride of sodium and sulphate of soda its alkaline character suggests the probability of its containing carbonate of soda but none was detected  the rocks decomposed by the waters of the spring consist of granite impregnated with sulphate of alumina it appears that in this case the sulphurous waters of yeumtong became impregnated in the air with sulphuric acid which decomposed the felspar i have in my journal particularly alluded to the garnets an aluminous mineral being thus entirely decomposedjdh and united with its alumina i found traces only of potash in the salt  sulphuretted hydrogen waters appear to give origin to sulphuric acid when the water

fungi of the himalayas by the rev m j berkeley ma  it is not my intention in the present appendix to give specific characters or even accurately determined specific names to the different objects within its scope which have come under investigation as collected by dr hooker and dr thomson to do so would require far more time than i have at present been able to devote to the subject for though every species has been examined microscopically either by myself or mr broome and working sketches secured at the same time the specific determination of fresh water algae from herbarium specimens is a matter which requires a very long and accurate comparison of samples from every available locality and in the case of such genera as zygnema tyndaridea and conferva is after all not a very satisfactory process  the object in view is merely to give some general notion of the forms which presented themselves in the vast districts visited by the abovementioned botanists comprising localities of the greatest possible difference as regards both temperature and elevation but more especially in the hotsprings which occur in two distant parts of the himalayas and in behar and these again under very different degrees of elevation and of extrinsic temperature  the algae from lower localities are but few in number and some of these of very common forms we have for instance from the ganges opposite bijnour a batrachospermum and conferva crispata the former purple below with specimens of chantransia exactly as they might occur in the thames the conferva or more properly cladophora which occurs also under various forms at higher elevations as in the neighbourhood of simla and iskardo swarms with little parasites but of common or uninteresting species in the bijnour specimens these consist of common forms of synedra meridion circulare and a cymbella on others from dacca there are about three species of synedra two of these appear to be s vaucheriae and s inaequalis a minute navicula and gomphonema curvatum nothing in fact can well be more european one splendid alga however occurs at fitcoree in behar on the banks of nullahs which are dry in hot weather forming a purple fleece of coarse woolly hairs which are singularly compressed and of extreme beauty under the microscope from the crystalline green of the articulated string which threads the bright red investing sheath this curious alga calls to mind in its colouring caenocoleus smithii figured in english botany t 2940 but it has not the common sheath of that alga and is on a far larger scale one or two other allied forms or species occur in east nepal to which i purpose giving together with the behar plant the generic name of erythronema from the soane river also is an interesting alga belonging to the curious genus thwaitesia in which the division of the endochrome in the fertile cells into four distinct masses sometimes entirely free is beautifully marked in some cases indeed instead of the ordinary spores the whole moss is broken up into numerous bodies as in the fertile joints of ulothrix and probably as in that case the resultant corpuscles are endowed with active motion in silhet again is a magnificent zygnema allied to z nitidum with large oval spores about 1285 part of an inch long and a dark golden brown colour and containing a spiral green endochrome  leaving however the lower parts of india i shall first take the species which occur in khasia sikkim eastern nepal and the adjoining parts of tibet  in the hot valleys of the gtreat rungeet at an elevation of about 2000 feet we have the erythronema but under a slightly different form at nunklow at about the same height in khasia again at twice that elevation in eastern nepal at 12000 and finally at momay reaching up to 16000 feet in water highly impregnated with oxide of iron at 4000 feet in sikkim a leptothrix occurred in great abundance coloured with the oxide exactly as is the case with algae which grow in iron springs in europe at elevations between 5000 and 7000 feet several european forms occur consisting of ulothrix zygnema oscillatoria lyngbya sphaerozyga scytonema conferva and cladophora the species may indeed not be identical with european species but they are all more or less closely allied to wellknown hydrophytes one very interesting form however either belonging to the genus zygnema or possibly constituting a distinct genus occurs in streams at 5000 feet in sikkim consisting of highly gelatinous threads of the normal structure of the zygnema but forming a reticulated mass the threads adhere to each other laterally containing only a single spiral endochrome and the articulations are very long amongst the threads are mixed those of some species of tyndaridea there is also a curious hormosiphon at a height of 7000 feet forming anastomosing gelatinous masses a fine new species of lyngbya extends up as high as 11000 feet at 13000 feet occurs either some simple conferva or zygnema it is doubtful which from the condition of the specimens and at the same elevation in the nearly dry bed of the stream which flows from the larger lake at momay amongst flat cakes consisting of felspathic silt from the glaciers above and the debris of algae and abounding in diatomaceae some threads of a zygnema at 17000 feet an oscillatoria attached or adherent to zannichellia and finally on the bare ground at 18000 feet on the donkia mountains an obscure species of caenocoleus on the surface of the glaciers at kinchinjhow on silt there is a curious palmella apparently quite distinct from any european form  amongst the greater part of the algae from 4000 feet to 18000 feet various diatomaceae occur which will be best noticed in a tabular form as follows the specific name within brackets merely indicating the species to which they bear most resemblance  himantidium soleirolii           4000 to 7000 ft  sikkim odontidium hiemale forma minor  5000 to 7000 ft  sikkim epithemia n

             momay odontidium hiemale                                 kinchinjhow   we now turn to those portions of tibet or the neighbouring regions explored by dr thomson and captain strachey the principal feature in the algology is the great prevalence of species of zygnema and tyndaridea which occur under a variety of forms sometimes with very thick gelatinous coats in not a single instance however is there the slightest tendency to produce fructification conferva crispata again as mentioned above occurs in several localities and in one locality a beautiful unbranched conferva with torulose articulations at iskardo dr thomson gathered a very gelatinous species of draparnaldia or more properly a stygeoclonium if we may judge from a little conglomeration of cells which appeared amongst the threads a tetraspora in piti an obscure tolypothrix and one or two oscillatoriae remarkable for their interrupted mode of growth complete the list of algae with the exception of one to be mentioned presently as also of diatomaceae and of the species of nostoc and hormosiphon which occurred in great profusion and under several forms sometimes attaining a very large size several inches across especially in the districts of le and piti and where the soil or waters were impregnated with saline matters it is well known that some species of nostoc form an article of food in china and one was used for that purpose in a late arctic expedition as reported by dr sutherland but it does not seem that any use is made of them in tibet though probably all the large species would form tolerable articles of food and certainly from their chemical composition prove very nutritious one species is mentioned by dr thomson as floating without any attachment in the shallow water of the pools scattered over the plains on the parang river separated only by a ridge of mountains from piti broad and foliaceous and scarcely different from the common nostoc which occurs in all parts of the globe i must not however neglect to record a very singular new genus in which the young threads have the characters of tyndaridea but after a time little swellings occur on their sides in which a distinct endochrome is formed extending backwards into the parent endochrome separated from it by a well defined membrane and producing either by repeated pullulation a compound mass like that of calothrix or simply giving rise to a forked thread in the latter case however there is no external swelling but a lateral endochrome is formed which as it grows makes its way through an aperture whose sides are regularly inflected i have given to this curious production the name of cladozygia thomsoni  the whole of the above algae occurred at heights varying from 10000 to 15500 feet as in the southern himalayan algae the specimens were infested with many diatomaceae amongst which the moat conspicuous were various cymbellae and epithemiae the following is a list of the species observed      cymbella gastroides        gracilis        ehrenbergii                    and three others     odontidium hiemale          mesodon          n sp     epithemia  n sp     synedra arcus       tenuis       aequalis     denticula obtusa     gomphonema abbreviatum     meridion circulare  there is very little identity between this list and that before given from the southern himalayas as is the case also with the other algae till the species however have been more completely studied a very accurate comparison cannot be made  in both instances the species which grow in hot springs have been reserved in order to make their comparison more easy i shall begin in an inverse order with those of the springs of pugha in tibet which attain a temperature of 174 degrees two confervae only occur in the specimens which have been preserved viz an oscillatoria allied to that which i have called o interrupta and a true conferva extremely delicate with very long articulations singularly swollen at the commissures the diatomaceae are      odontidium hiemale          mesodon          n sp same as at piti on conferva     denticula obtusa     navicula     cymbella three species     epithemia  scarcely any one of these except the navicula is peculiar to the locality a fragment apparently of some closterium the only one which i have met with in the collection accompanies one of the specimens  the hot springs of momay temp 110 degrees at 16000 feet produce a golden brown caenocoleus representing a small form of c cirrhosus and a very delicate sphaerozyga an anabaina and tolypothrix and at 17000 feet a delicate green conferva with long even articulations with the latter is an odontidium allied to or identical with o turgidulum and with the former a fine species of epithemia resembling in form but not in marking e faba e zebra a fine navicula perhaps the same with n major and fragilaria virescens mr thomas brightwell finds in a portion of the same specimen epithemia alpestris surirella splendida s linearis smith pinnularia viridis smith navicula lanceolata and himantidium arcus in mud from one of the momay springs a i detected epithemia broomeii ns and two small naviculae and in the spring c two species of epithemia somewhat like e faba but different from that mentioned above  the hot springs of soorujkoond of the vegetation of which very numerous specimens have been preserved are extremely poor in species in the springs themselves and on their banks at temperatures varying from 80 degrees to 158 degrees at which point vegetation entirely ceases a minute leptothrix abounds everywhere varying a little in the regularity of the threads in different specimens but scarcely presenting two species between 84 degrees and 112 degrees there is an imperfect zygnema with very long articulations and where the green scum passes into brown there is sometimes an oscillatoria of a very minute stellate scytonema probably in an imperfect state epithemia ocellata also contributes often to produce the tint an anabaina occurs at a temperature of 125 degrees but the same species was found also in the stream from the springs where the water had become cold as was also the case with the zygnema  the diatomaceae consisted of      epithemia broomeii n s           thermalis n sp     epithemia inaequalis n sp     navicula beharensis n sp  the vegetation in the three sets of springs was very different as regards the confervae taking the word in its older sense the species in the three are quite different and even in respect of genera there is little identity but amongst the diatomaceae there is no striking difference except in those of the behar springs where three out of the four did not occur elsewhere in the pugha and momay springs the species were either identical with or nearly allied to those found in neighbouring localities where the water did not exceed the ordinary temperature a longer examination will doubtless detect more numerous forms but those which appear on a first examination are sure to give a pretty correct general notion of the vegetation the species are certainly less numerous than i had expected or than might be supposed from the vegetation of those european hot springs which have been most investigated  in conclusion i shall beg to add a few words on the fungi of the himalayas so far as they have at present been investigated as regards these there is a marked difference as might be anticipated from the nature of the climates between those parts of tibet investigated by dr thomson and the more southern regions the fungi found by dr thomson were but few in number and for the most part of very ordinary forms differing but little from the produce of an european wood some however grow to a very large size as for instance polyporus fomentarius on poplars near iskardo exceeding in dimensions anything which this species exhibits in europe a very fine aecidium also infests the fir trees abies smithiana a figure of which has been given in the gardeners chronicle 1852 p 627 under the name of aecidium thomsoni this is allied to the hexenbesen of the german forests but is a finer species and quite distinct polyporus oblectans geaster limbatus geaster mammosus erysiphe taurica a boletus infested with sepedonium mycophilum scleroderma verrucosum an aecidium and a uromyces both on mulgedium tataricum about halfadozen agarics one at an altitude of 16000 feet above the nubra river a lycoperdon and morchella semilibera which is eaten in kashmir and exported when dry to the plains of india make up the list of fungi  the region of sikkim is perhaps the most productive in fleshy fungi of any in the world both as regards numbers and species and eastern nepal and khasia yield also an abundant harvest the forms are for the most part european though the species are scarcely ever quite identical the dimensions of many are truly gigantic and many species afford abundant food to the natives mixed with european forms a few more decidedly tropical occur and amongst those of east nepal is a lentinus which has the curious property of staining every thing which touches it of a deep rhubarb yellow and is not exceeded in magnificence by any tropical species the polypori are often identical with those of java ceylon and the philippine isles and the curious trichocoma paradoxum which was first found by junghuhn in java and very recently by dr harvey in ceylon occurs abundantly on the decayed trunks of laurels as it does in south carolina the curious genus mitremyces also is scattered here and there though not under the american form but that which occurs in java though hymenomycetes are so abundant the discomycetes and ascomycetes are comparatively rare and very few species indeed of sphoeria were gathered one curious matter is that amongst the very extensive collections which have been made there is scarcely a single new genus the species moreover in sikkim are quite different except in the case of some more or less cosmopolite species from those of eastern nepal and khasia scarcely a single lactarius or cortinarius for instance occurs in sikkim though there are several in khasia the genus boletus through the whole district assumes the most magnificent forms which are generally very different from anything in europe    appendix c the tables referred to at v i chapter ii as under appendix c will be found under appendix a  on the soils of sikkim  there is little variety in the soil throughout sikkim and as far as vegetation is concerned it may be divided into vegetable mould and stiff clayeach as they usually occur remarkably characteristic in composition of such soils bogearth is very rare nor did i find peat at any elevation  the clay is uniformly of great tenacity and is i believe wholly due to the effect of the atmosphere on crumbling gneiss and other rocks it makes excellent bricks is tenacious seldom friable and sometimes accumulated in beds fourteen feet thick although more generally only about two feet in certain localities beds or narrow seams of pure felspathic clay and layers of vegetable matter occur in it probably wholly due to local causes an analysis of that near dorjiling gives about 30 per cent of alumina the rest being silica and a fraction of oxide of iron lime is wholly unknown as a constituent of the soil and only occasionally seen as a stalactitic deposit from a few springs  a layer of vegetable earth almost invariably covers the clay to the depth of from three to twelve or fourteen inches it is a very rich black mould held in its position on the slopes of the hills by the dense vegetation and accumulated on the banks of small streams to a depth at times of three and four feet the following is an analysis of an average

on the east bank of the soane river  lat 24 degrees 52 minutes n long 84 degrees 22 minutes e alt 345 feet  the following appearances are as noted in my journal at the time they so entirely resembled auroral beams that i had no hesitation in pronouncing them at the time to be such this opinion has however been dissented from by some meteorologists who consider that certain facts connected with the geographical distribution of auroras if i may use the term are opposed to it i am well aware of the force of these arguments which i shall not attempt to controvert but for the information of those who may be interested in the matter i may remark that i am very familiar with the aurora borealis in the northern temperate zone and during the antarctic expedition was in the habit of recording in the logbook the appearance presented by the aurora australis the late mr williams mr haddon and mr theobald who were also witnesses of the appearances on this occasion considered it a brilliant display of the aurora  feb 14th 9 pmbax corr 29751 temp 62 degrees dp 410 degrees calm sky clear moon threequarters full and bright  observed about thirty lancet beams rising in the northwest from a low luminous arch whose extremes bore w 20 degrees s and n 50 degrees e altitude of upper limb of arch 20 degrees of the lower 8 degrees the beams crossed the zenith and converged towards s 15 degrees e the extremity of the largest was forked and extended to 25 degrees above the horizon in the se by s quarter the extremity of the centre one bore s 50 degrees e and was 45 degrees above the horizon the western beams approached nearest the southern horizon all the beams moved and flashed slowly occasionally splitting and forking fading and brightening they were brightly defined though the milky way and zodiacal light could not be discerned and the stars and planets though clearly discernible were very pale  at 10 pm the luminous appearance was more diffused upper limb of the arch less defined no beams crossed the zenith but occasionally beams appeared there and faded away  between 10 and 11 the beams continued to move and replace one another as usual in auroras but disappeared from the southeast quarter and became broader in the northern hemisphere the longest beams were near the north and northeast horizon  at halfpast 10 a dark belt 4 degrees broad appeared in the luminous arch bearing from n 55 degrees w to n 10 degrees w its upper limb was 10 degrees above the horizon it then gradually dilated and thus appeared to break up the arch this appeared to be the commencement of the dispersion of the phenomenon  at 1050 pm the dark band had increased so much in breadth that the arch was broken up in the northwest and no beams appeared there eighteen linear beams rose from the eastern part of the arch and bore from north to n 20 degrees e  towards 11 pm the dark band appeared to have replaced the luminous arch the beams were all but gone a few fragments appearing in the ne a southerly wind sprang up and a diffused light extended along the horizon  at midnight i saw two faint beams to the northeast and two well defined parallel ones in the southwest   appendix e  physical geography of the sikkim himalaya east nepal and adjacent provinces of tibet  sikkim is included in a section of the himalaya about sixty miles broad from east to west where it is bounded respectively by the mountain states of bhotan and nepal its southern limits are easily defined for the mountains rise abruptly from the plains of bengal as spurs of 6000 to 10000 feet high densely clothed with forest to their summits the northern and northeastern frontier of sikkim is beyond the region of much rain and is not a natural but a political line drawn between that country and tibet sikkim lies nearly due north of calcutta and only four hundred miles from the bay of bengal its latitude being 26 degrees 40 minutes to 28 degrees n and longitude 88 degrees to 89 degrees e  the main features of sikkim are kinchinjunga the loftiest hitherto measured mountain which lies to its northwest and rises 28178 feet above the level of the sea and the teesta river which flows throughout the length of the country and has a course of upwards of ninety miles in a straight line almost all the sources of the teesta are included in sikkim and except some comparatively insignificant streams draining the outermost ranges there are no rivers in this country but itself and its feeders which occupy the largest of the himalayan valleys between the tambur in east nepal and the machoo in western bhotan  an immense spur sixty miles long stretches south from kinchin to the plains of india it is called singalelah and separates sikkim from east nepal the waters from its west flank flow into the tambur and those from the east into the great rungeet a feeder of the teesta between these two latter rivers is a second spur from kinchinjunga terminating in tendong  the eastern boundary of sikkim separating it from bhotan is formed for the greater part by the chola range which stretches south from the immense mountain of donkia 23176 feet high situated fifty miles ene of kinchinjunga where the frontier approaches the plains of india the boundary line follows the course of the teesta and of the rinkpo one of its feeders flowing from the chola range this range is much more lofty than that of singalelah and the drainage from its eastern flank is into the machoo river the upper part of whose course is in tibet and the lower in bhotan  the donkia mountain though 4000 feet lower than kinchin is the culminant point of a much more extensive and elevated mountain mass it throws off an immense spur from its northwest face which runs west and then southwest to kinchin forming the watershed of all the remote sources of the teesta this spur has a mean elevation of 18000 to 19000 feet and several of its peaks of which chomiomo is one rise much higher the northern boundary of sikkim is not drawn along this but runs due west from donkia following a shorter but stupendous spur called kinchinjhow whence it crosses the teesta to chomiomo and is continued onwards to kinchinjunga  though the great spur connecting donkia with kinchin is in tibet and bounds the waters that flow directly south into the teesta it is far from the true himalayan axis for the rivers that rise on its northern slope do not run into the valley of the tsampu or tibetan burrampooter but into the arun of nepal which rises to the north of donkia and flows southwest for many miles in tibet before entering nepal and flowing south to the ganges  sikkim thus circumscribed consists of a mass of mountainous spurs forestclad up to 12000 feet there are no flat valleys or plains in the whole country no lakes or precipices of any consequence below that elevation and few or no bare slopes though the latter are uniformly steep the aspect of sikkim can only be understood by a reference to its climate and vegetation and i shall therefore take these together and endeavour by connecting these phenomena to give an intelligible view of the main features of the whole country this i did with reference especially to the cultivation of rhododendrons in a paper which the horticultural society of london did me the honour of printing quarterly journ of hort soc vol vii p 82  the greater part of the country between sikkim and the sea is a dead level occupied by the delta of the ganges and burrampooter above which the slope is so gradual to the base of the mountains that the surface of the plain from which the himalayas immediately rise is only 300 feet above the sea the most obvious effect of this position is that the prevailing southerly wind reaches the first range of hills loaded with vapour the same current when deflected easterly to bhotan or westerly to nepal and the northwest himalaya is intercepted and drained of much moisture by the khasia and garrow mountains south of assam and the burrampooter in the former case and the rajmahal hills south of the ganges in the latter sikkim is hence the dampest region of the whole himalaya  viewed from a distance on the plains of india sikkim presents the appearancecommon to all mountainous countriesof consecutive parallel ridges running east and west these are all wooded and backed by a beautiful range of snowy peaks with occasional breaks in the foremost ranges through which the rivers debouch any view of the himalaya especially at a sufficient distance for the remote snowy peaks to be seen overtopping the outer ridges is however rare from the constant deposition of vapours over the forestclad ranges during the greater part of the year and the haziness of the dry atmosphere of the plains in the winter months at the end of the rains when the southeast monsoon has ceased to blow with constancy views are obtained sometimes from a distance of nearly two hundred miles from the plains the highest peaks subtend so small an angle that they appear like white specks very low on the horizon tipping the black lower and outer wooded ranges which always rise out of a belt of haze and from the density probably of the lower strata of atmosphere are never seen to rest on the visible horizon the remarkable lowness on the horizon of the whole stupendous mass is always a disappointing feature to the new comer who expects to see dazzling peaks towering in the air approaching nearer the snowy mountains sink behind the wooded ones long before the latter have assumed gigantic proportions and when they do so they appear a sombre lurid greygreen mass of vegetation with no brightness or variation of colour there is no break in this forest caused by rock precipices or cultivation some spurs project nearer and some valleys appear to retire further into the heart of the foremost great chain that shuts out all the country beyond  from dorjiling the appearance of parallel ridges is found to be deceptive and due to the inosculating spurs of long tortuous ranges that ran north and south throughout the whole length of sikkim dividing deep wooded valleys which form the beds of large rivers the snowy peaks here look like a long east and west range of mountains at an average distance of thirty or forty miles advancing into the country this appearance proves equally deceptive and the snowy range is resolved into isolated peaks situated on the meridional ridges their snowclad spurs projecting east and west cross one another and being uniformly white appear to connect the peaks into one grand unbroken range the rivers instead of having their origin in the snowy mountains rise far beyond them many of their sources are upwards of one hundred miles in a straight line from the plains in a very curious country loftier by far in mean elevation than the meridional ridges which run south from it yet comparatively bare of snow this rearward part of the mountain region is tibet where all the sikkim nepal and bhotan rivers rise as small streams increasing in size as they receive the drainage from the snowed parts of the ridges that bound them in their courses their banks between 8000 and 14000 feet are generally clothed with rhododendrons sometimes to the almost total exclusion of other woody vegetation especially near the snowy mountainsa cool temperature and great humidity being the most favourable conditions for the luxuriant growth of this genus  the source of this humidity is the southerly or sea wind which blows steadily from may till october in sikkim and prevails throughout the rest of the year if not as the monsoon properly so called as a current from the moist atmosphere above the gangetic delta this rushes north to the rarefied regions of sikkim up the great valleys and does not appear materially disturbed by the north west wind which blows during the afternoons of the winter months over the plains and along the flanks of the outer range and is a dry surface current due to the diurnal heating of the soil when it is considered that this wind after passing lofty mountains on the outer range has to traverse eighty or one hundred miles of alps before it has watered all the forest region it will be evident that its moisture must be expended before it reaches tibet  let the figures in the accompanying woodcut the one on the true scale the other with the heights exaggerated represent two of these long meridional ridges from the watershed to the plains of india following in this instance the course of the teesta river from its source at 19000 feet to where it debouches from the himalaya at 300 the lower rugged outline represents one meridional ridge with all its most prominent peaks whether exactly or not on the line of section the upper represents the parallel ridge of singalelah dep of greater mean elevation further west introduced to show the maximum elevation of the sikkim mountains kinchinjunga 28178 feet being represented on it a deep valley is interposed between these two ridges with a feeder of the teesta in it the great rungeet which runs south from kinchin and turning west enters the teesta at r the position of the bed of the teesta river is indicated by a dotted line from its source at t to the plains at s of dorjiling on the north flank of the outer range by d of the first point where perpetual snow is met with by p and of the first indications of a tibetan climate by c  illustrationsection of the sikkim himalaya along the course of the teesta river  a warm current of air loaded with vapour will deposit the bulk of its moisture on the ridge of sinchul which rises above dorjiling d and is 8500 feet high passing on little will be precipitated on e whose elevation is the same as that of sinchul but much at f 11000 feet where the current being further cooled has less capacity for holding vapour and is further exhausted when it ascends to p 15000 feet it is sufficiently cooled to deposit snow in the winter and spring months more of which falling than can be melted during the summer it becomes perennial at the top of ginchin very little falls and it is doubtful if the southerly current ever reaches that prodigiously elevated isolated summit the amount of surface above 20000 feet is however too limited and broken into isolated peaks to drain the already nearly exhausted current whose condensed vapours roll along in fog beyond the parallel of kinchin are dissipated during the day over the arid mountains of tibet and deposited at night on the cooled surface of the earth  other phenomena of no less importance than the distribution of vapour and more or less depending on it are the duration and amount of solar and terrestrial radiation towards d the sun is rarely seen during the rainy season as well from the constant presence of nimbi aloft as from fog on the surface of the ground an absence of both light and heat is the result south of the parallel of kinchin and at c low fogs prevail at the same season but do not intercept either the same amount of light or heat whilst at t there is much sunshine and bright light during the night again there is no terrestrial radiation between s and p the rain either continues to pourin some months with increased violenceor the saturated atmosphere is condensed into a thick white mist which hangs over the redundant vegetation a bright starlight night is almost unknown in the summer months at 6000 to 10000 feet but is frequent in december and january and at intervals between october and may when however vegetation is little affected by the cold of nocturnal radiation in the regions north of kinchin starlight nights are more frequent and the cold produced by radiation at 14000 feet is often severe towards the end of the rains in september still the amount of clear weather during the night is small the fog clears off for an hour or two at sunset as the wind falls but the returning cold north current again chills the air soon afterwards and rolling masses of vapour are hence flying overhead or sweeping the surface of the earth throughout the summer nights in the tibetan regions on the other hand bright nights and even sharp frosts prevail throughout the warmest months  referring again to the cut it must be borne in mind that neither of the two meridional ridges runs in a straight line but that they wind or zigzag as all mountain ranges do that spurs from each ridge are given off from either flank alternately and that the origin of a spur on one side answers to the source of a river ie the head of a valley on the other these rivers are feeders of the main stream the teesta and run at more or less of an angle to the latter the spurs from the east flank of one ridge cross at their ends those from the west flank of another and thus transverse valleys are formed presenting many modifications of climate with regard to exposure temperature and humidity  the roads from the plains of india to the watershed in tibet always cross these lateral spurs the main ridge is too winding and rugged and too lofty for habitation throughout the greater part of its length while the riverchannel is always very winding unhealthy for the greater part of the year below 4000 feet and often narrow gorgelike and rocky the villages are always placed above the unhealthy regions on the lateral spurs which the traveller repeatedly crosses throughout every days march for these spurs give off lesser ones and these again others of a third degree whence the country is cut up into as many spurs ridges and ranges as there are rills streams and rivers amongst the mountains  though the direction of the main atmospheric current is to the north it is in reality seldom felt to be so except the observer be on the very exposed mountain tops or watch the motions of the upper strata of atmosphere lower currents of air rush up both the main and lateral valleys throughout the day and from the sinuosities in the beds of the rivers and the generally transverse directions of their feeders the current often becomes an east or west one in the branch valleys draining to the north the wind still ascends it is in short an ascending warm moist current whatever course be pursued by the valleys it follows  the sides of each valley are hence equally supplied with moisture though local circumstances render the soil on one or the other flank more or less humid and favourable to a luxuriant vegetation such differences are a drier soil on the north side with a too free exposure to the sun at low elevations where its rays however transient rapidly dry the ground and where the rains though very heavy are of shorter duration and where owing to the capacity of the heated air for retaining moisture day fogs are comparatively rare in the northern parts of sikkim again some of the lateral valleys are so placed that the moist wind strikes the side facing the south and keeps it very humid whilst the returning cold current from the neighbouring tibetan mountains impinges against the side facing the north which is hence more bare of vegetation an infinite number of local peculiarities will suggest themselves to any one conversant with physical geography as causing unequal local distribution of light heat and moisture in the different valleys of so irregular a country namely the amount of slope and its power of retaining moisture and soil the composition and hardness of the rocks their dip and strike the protection of some valleys by lofty snowed ridges and the free southern exposures of others at great elevations  the position and elevation of the perpetual snow it appears to me as i have asserted in the pages of my journal that the limit of perpetual snow is laid down too low in all mountain regions and that accumulations in hollows and the descent of glacial ice mask the phenomenon more effectually than is generally allowed in this work i define the limit as is customary in general terms only as being that where the accumulations are very great and whence they are continuous upwards on gentle slopes all perpetual snow however becomes ice and as such obeys the laws of glacial motion moving as a viscous fluid whence it follows that the lower edge of a snowbed placed on a slope is in one sense the termination of a glacier and indicates a position below that where all the snow that falls melts i am well aware that it is impossible to define the limit required with any approach to accuracy steep and broken surfaces with favourable exposures to the sun or moist winds are bare much above places where snow lies throughout the year but the occurrence of a gentle slope free of snow and covered with plants cannot but indicate a point below that of perpetual snow such is the case with the jardin on the mer de glace whose elevation is 9500 feet whereas that of perpetual snow is considered by professor j forbes our best authority to be 8500 feet though limited in area girdled by glaciers presenting a very gentle slope to the east and screened by surrounding mountains from a considerable proportion of the suns rays the jardin is clear for fully three months of the year of all but sporadic falls of snow that never lie long and so are similar spots placed higher on the neighbouring slopes which facts are quite at variance with the supposition that the perpetual snowline is below that point in the mont blanc alps on the monte rosa alps again dr thomson and i gathered plants in flower above 12000 feet on the steep face of the weissthor pass and at 10938 feet on the top of st theodule but in the former case the rocks are too steep for any snow to lie they are exposed to the southeast and overhang a gorge 8000 feet deep up which no doubt warm currents ascend while at st theodule the plants were growing on a slope which though gentle is black and stony and exposed to warm ascending currents as on the weissthor and i do not consider either of these as evidences of the limit of perpetual snow being higher than their position vary with those of the individual ranges and their exposure to the south wind the expression that the perpetual snow lies lower and deeper on the southern slopes of the himalayan mountains than on the northern conveys a false impression it is better to say that the snow lies deeper and lower on the southern faces of the individual mountains and spurs that form the snowy himalaya the axis itself of the chain is generally far north of the position of the spurs that catch all the snow and has comparatively very little snow on it most of what there is lying upon north exposures  a reference to the woodcut will show that the same circumstances which affect the distribution of moisture and vegetation determine the position amount and duration of the snow the principal fall will occur as before shown where the meridional range first attains a sufficiently great elevation and the air becomes consequently cooled below 32 degrees this is at a little above 14000 feet sporadic falls occurring even in summer at that elevation these however melt immediately and the copious winter falls also are dissipated before june as the depth of rainfall diminishes in advancing north to the higher parts of the meridional ranges so does that of the snowfall the permanence of the snow again depends on1 the depth of the accumulation 2 the mean temperature of the spot 3 the melting power of the suns rays 4 the prevalence and strength of evaporating winds now at 14000 feet though the accumulation is immense the amount melted by the suns rays is trifling and there are no evaporating winds but the mean temperature is so high and the corroding powers of the rain which falls abundantly throughout summer and of the warm and humid ascending currents are so great that the snow is not perennial at 15500 feet again it becomes perennial and its permanence at this low elevation at p is much favoured by the accumulation and detention of fogs over the rank vegetation which prevails from s nearly to p and by the lofty mountains beyond it which shield it from the returning dry currents from the north in proceeding north all the circumstances that tend to the dispersion of the snow increase whilst the fall diminishes at p the deposition is enormous and the snowline low16000 feet whilst at t little falls and the limit of perpetual snow is 19000 and 20000 feet hence the anomaly that the snowline ascends in advancing north to the coldest himalayan regions the position of the greatest peaks and of the greatest mass of perpetual snow being generally assumed as indicating a ridge and watershed travellers arguing from single mountains alone on the meridional ridges have at one time supported and at another denied the assertion that the snow lies longer and deeper on the north than on the south slope of the himalayan ridge  the great accumulation of snow at 15000 feet in the parallel of p exercises a decided influence on the vegetation the alpine rhododendrons hardly reach 14000 feet in the broad valleys and roundheaded spurs of the mountains of the tunkra and chola passes whilst the same species ascend to 16000 and one to 17000 feet at t beyond the latter point again the great aridity of the climate prevents their growth and in tibet there are generally none even as low as 12000 and 14000 feet glaciers again descend to 15000 feet in the tortuous gorges which immediately debouch from the snows of kinchinjunga but no plants grow on the debris they carry down nor is there any sward of grass or herbage at their base the atmosphere immediately around being chilled by enormous accumulations of snow and the summer sun rarely warming the soil at t again the glaciers do not descend below 16000 feet but a greensward of vegetation creeps up to their bases dwarf rhododendrons cover the moraines and herbs grow on the patches of earth carried down by the latter which are thawed by the more frequent sunshine and by the radiation of heat from the unsnowed flanks of the valleys down which these icestreams pour  looking eastward or westward on the map of india we perceive that the phenomenon of perpetual snow is regulated by the same laws from the longitude of upper assam in 95 degrees e to that of kashmir in 75 degrees e the lowest limit of perpetual snow is 15500 to 16000 feet and a shrubby vegetation affects the most humid localities near it at 12000 to 14000 feet receding from the plains of india and penetrating the mountains the climate becomes drier the snowline rises and vegetation diminishes whether the elevation of the land increases or decreases plants reaching 17000 and 18000 feet and the snowline 20000 feet to mention extreme cases the snowlevel of sikkim in 27 degrees 30 minutes is at 16000 feet whereas in latitude 35 degrees 30 minutes dr thomson found the snow line 20000 feet on the mountains near the karakoram pass and vegetation up to 18500 feetfeatures i found to be common also to sikkim in latitude 28 degrees  the himalaya north of nepal and thence eastward to the bend of the yarutsampu or tibetan burrampooter has for its geographical limits the plains of india to the south and the bed of the yaru to the north all between these limits is a mountain mass to which tibet though so often erroneously called a plain the only true account of the general features of eastern tibet is to be found in mm huc and gabets travels their description agrees with dr thomsons account of western tibet and with my experience of the parts to the north of sikkim and the information i everywhere obtained the socalled plains are the flat floors of the valleys and the terraces on the margins of the rivers which all flow between stupendous mountains the term maidan so often applied to tibet by the natives implies not a plain like that of india but simply an open dry treeless country in contrast to the densely wooded wet regions of the snowy himalaya south of tibet forms no exception the waters from the north side of this chain flow into the tsampu and those from the south side into the burrampooter of assam and the ganges the line however tortuous dividing the heads of these waters is the watershed and the only guide we have to the axis of the himalaya this has never been crossed by europeans except by captain turners embassy in 1798 and captain bogles in 1779 both of which reached the yaru river in the account published by captain turner the summit of the watershed is not rigorously defined and the boundary of tibet and bhotan is sometimes erroneously taken for it the boundary being at that point a southern spur of chumulari between donkia and chumulari lies a portion of tibet including the upper part of the course of the machoo river bounded on the east by bhotan and on the west by sikkim see chapter xxii turner when crossing the simonang pass descended westwards into the valley of the machoo and was still on the indian watershed eastwards from the sources of the tsampu the watershed of the himalaya seems to follow a very winding course and to be everywhere to the north of the snowy peaks seen from the plains of india it is by a line through these snowy peaks that the axis of the himalaya is represented in all our maps because they seem from the plains to be situated on an east and west ridge instead of being placed on subsidiary meridional ridges as explained above it is also across or along the subsidiary ridges that the boundary line between the tibetan provinces and those of nepal sikkim and bhotan is usually drawn because the enormous accumulations of snow form a more efficient natural barrier than the greater height of the less snowed central part of the chain beyond them  though however our maps draw the axis through the snowy peaks they also make the rivers to rise beyond the latter on the northern slopes as it were and to flow southwards through gaps in the axis such a feature is only reconcilable with the hypothesis of the chain being double as the cordillera of peru and chili is said to be geographically and which in a geological sense it no doubt is but to the cordillera the himalaya offers no parallel the results of dr thomsons study of the northwest himalaya and tibet and my own of the northeast extreme of sikkim and tibet first gave me an insight into the true structure of this chain donkia mountain is the culminant point of an immensely elevated mass of mountains of greater mean height than a similarly extensive area around kinchin junga it comprises chumulari and many other mountains much above 20000 feet though none equalling kinchinjunga junnoo and kubra the great lakes of ramchoo and cholamoo are placed on it and the rivers rising on it flow in various directions the painomchoo northwest into the yaru the arun west to nepal the teesta south west through sikkim the machoo south and the pachoo southeast through bhotan all these rivers have their sources far beyond the great snowed mountains the arun most conspicuously of all flowing completely at the back or north of kinchinjunga those that flow southwards break through no chain nor do they meet any contraction as they pass the snowy parts of the mountains which bound the valleys in which they flow but are bound by uniform ranges of lofty mountains which become more snowy as they approach the plains of india these valleys however gradually contract as they descend being less open in sikkim and nepal than in tibet though there bounded by rugged mountains which from being so bare of snow and of vegetation do not give the same impression of height as the isolated sharper peaks which rise out of a dense forest and on which the snow limit is 4000 or 5000 feet lower  the fact of the bottom of the river valleys being flatter towards the watershed is connected with that of their fall being less rapid at that part of their course this is the consequence of the great extent in breadth of the most elevated portion of the chain if we select the teesta as an example and measure its fall at three points of its course we shall find the results very different from its principal source at lake cholamoo it descends from 17000 to 15000 feet with a fall of 60 feet to the mile from 15000 to 12000 feet the fall is 140 feet to the mile in the third part of its course it descends from 12000 to 5000 feet with a fall of 160 feet to the mile and in the lower part the descent is from 5000 feet to the plains of india at 300 feet giving a fall of 50 feet to the mile there is however no marked limit to these divisions its valley gradually contracts and its course gradually becomes more rapid it is worthy of notice that the fall is at its maximum through that part of its valley of which the flanks are the most loaded with snow where the old moraines are very conspicuous and where the present accumulations from landslips etc are the most extensive it is not my intention to discuss here the geological bearings of this curious question but i may state that as the humidity of the climate of the middle region of the rivercourse tends to increase the fall in a given space so i believe the dryness of the climate of the loftier country has the opposite effect by preserving those accumulations which have raised the floors of the valleys and rendered them level  with reference to kinchinjunga these facts are of importance as showing that mere elevation is in physical geography of secondary importance that lofty mountain rises from a spur of the great range of donkia and is quite removed from the watershed or axis of the himalaya the rivers which drain its northern and southern flanks alike flowing to the ganges were the himalaya to be depressed 18000 feet kubra junnoo pundim etc would form a small cluster of rocky islands 1000 to 7000 feet high grouped near kinchinjunga itself a cape 10000 feet high which would be connected by a low marrow neck with an extensive and mountainous tract of land to its northeast the latter being represented by donkia to the north of kinchin a deep bay or inlet would occupy the present valley of the arun and would be bounded on the north by the axis of the himalaya which would form a continuous tract of land beyond it since writing the above i have seen professor j forbess beautiful work on the glaciers of norway it fully justifies a comparison of the himalaya to norway which has long been a familiar subject of theoretical enquiry with dr thomson and myself the deep narrow valleys of sikkim admirably represent the norwegian fiords the lofty rugged snowy mountains those more or less submerged islands of the norwegian coast the broad rearward watershed or axis of the chain with its lakes is the same in both and the yarutsampu occupies the relative position of the baltic  along the whole chain of the himalaya east of kumaon there are i have no doubt a succession of such lofty masses as donkia giving off stupendous spurs such as that on which kinchin forms so conspicuous a feature in support of this view we find every river rising far beyond the snowy peaks which are separated by continuously unsnowed ranges placed between the great white masses that these spurs present to the observer from the south at vol i chapter viii i have particularly called attention to the fact that west of kinchinjunga there is no continuation of a snowy himalaya as it is commonly called so between donkia and chumulari there is no perpetual snow and the valley of the machoo is very broad open and comparatively flat from the khasia mountains southeast of sikkim many of these groups or spurs were seen by dr thomson and myself at various distances 80 to 210 miles and these groups were between the courses of the great rivers the soobansiri monass and pachoo all east of sikkim other masses seen from the gangetic valley probably thus mark the relative positions of the arun cosi gunduk and gogra rivers  another mass like that of chumulari and donkia is that around the mansarowar lakes so ably surveyed by the brothers captains r and h strachey which is evidently the centre of the himalaya from it the gogra sutlej indus and yaru rivers all flow to the indian side of asia and from it spring four chains two of which are better known than the others these are1 the eastern himalaya whose axis runs north of nepal sikkim and bhotan to the bend of the yaru the valley of which it divides from the plains of india 2 the northwest himalaya which separates the valley of the indus from the plains of india behind these and probably parallel to them lie two other chains 3 the kouenlun or karakoram chain dividing the indus from the yarkand river 4 the chain north of the yaru of which nothing is known all the waters from the two first of these chains flow into the indian ocean as do those from the south faces of the third and fourth those from the north side of the kouenlun and of the chain north of the yaru flow into the great valley of lake lhop which may once have been continuous with the amoor river the chinese assert that lake lhop once drained into the hoangho the statement is curious and capable of confirmation when central asia shall have been explored  for this view of the physical geography of the western himalaya and central asia i am indebted to dr thomson it is more consonant with nature and with what we know of the geography of the country and of the nature of mountain chains than that of the illustrious humboldt who divides central asia by four parallel chains united by two meridional ones one at each extremity of the mountain district it follows in continuation and conclusion of our view that the mountain mass of pamir or bolor between the sources of the oxus and those of the yarkand river may be regarded as a centre from which spring the three greatest mountain systems of asia these are1 a great chain which runs in a northeasterly direction as far as behrings straits separating all the rivers of siberia from those which flow into the pacific ocean 2 the hindoo koosh continued through persia and armenia into taurus and 3 the muztagh or karakorum which probably extends due east into china south of the hoangho but which is broken up north of mansarowar into the chains which have been already enumerated     appendix f  on the climate of sikkim  the meteorology of sikkim as of every part of the himalayan range is a subject of growing interest and importance as it becomes yearly more necessary for the government to afford increased facilities for a residence in the mountains to europeans in search of health or of a salubrious climate for their families or for themselves on retirement from the exhausting service of the plains i was therefore surprised to find no further register of the weather at dorjiling than an insufficient one of the rainfall kept by the medical officer in charge of the station who in this as in all similar cases the government of india has gone to an immense expense and entailed a heavy duty upon its stationary medical officers in supplying them with sometimes admirable but more often very inaccurate meteorological instruments and requiring that daily registers be made and transmitted to calcutta in no case have i found it to be in the officers power to carry out this object he has never time seldom the necessary knowledge and experience and far too often no inclination the majority of the observations are in most cases left to personal native or other servants and the laborious results i have examined are too frequently worthless has neither the time nor the opportunity to give even the minimum of required attention to the subject of meteorology this defect has been in a measure remedied by dr chapman who kept a twelvemonths register in 1837 with instruments carefully compared with calcutta standards by the late james prinsep esq one of the most accomplished men in literature and science that india ever saw  the annual means of temperature rainfall etc vary greatly in the himalaya and apparently slight local causes produce such great differences of temperature and humidity that one years observations taken at one spot however full and accurate they may be are insufficient this is remarkably the case in sikkim where the rainfall is great and where the difference between those of two consecutive years is often greater than the whole annual london fall my own meteorological observations necessarily form but a broken series but they were made with the best instruments and with a view to obtaining results that should be comparable inter se and with those of calcutta when away from dorjiling too in the interior of sikkim i had the advantage of mr mullers services in taking observations at hours agreed upon previous to my leaving and these were of the greatest importance both for calculating elevations and for ascertaining the differences of temperature humidity diurnal atmospheric tide and rainfall all of which vary with the elevation and the distance from the plains of india  mr hodgsons house proved a most favourable spot for an observatory being placed on the top of the dorjiling spur with its broad verandah facing the north in which i protected the instruments from radiation this is a most important point generally wholly neglected in india where i have usually seen the thermometer hung in good shade but exposed to reflected heat from walls gravel walks or dry earth i am accustomed from experience to view all extreme temperatures with great suspicion on this and other accounts it is very seldom that the temperature of the free shaded air rises much above 100 degrees except during hot winds when the lower stratum only of atmosphere often loaded with hot particles of sand sweeps over the surface of a soil scorched by the direct rays of the sun and wind broad grassplots and a gravel walk surrounded the house and large trees were scattered about on three sides the ground sloped away while to the north the spur gently rose behind  throughout the greater part of the year the prevailing wind is from the southeast and comes laden with moisture from the bay of bengal it rises at sunrise and its vapours are early condensed on the forests of sinchul billowy clouds rapidly succeed small patches of vapour which rolling over to the north side of the mountain are carried northwest over a broad intervening valley to dorjiling there they bank on the east side of the spur and this being partially clear of wood the accumulation is slow and always first upon the clumps of trees very generally by 9 am the whole eastern sky from the top of dorjiling ridge is enveloped in a dense fog while the whole western exposure enjoys sunshine for an hour or two later at 7 or 8 am very small patches are seen to collect on tonglo which gradually dilate and coalesce but do not shroud the mountain for some hours generally not before 11 am or noon before that time however masses of mist have been rolling over dorjiling ridge to the westward and gradually filling up the valleys so that by noon or 1 pm every object is in cloud towards sunset it falls calm when the mist rises first from sinchul or if a southeast wind sets in from tonglo first  the temperature is more uniform at mr hodgsons bungalow which is on the top of the dorjiling ridge than on either of its flanks this is very much because a good deal of wood is left upon it whose cool foliage attracts and condenses the mists its mean temperature is lower by nearly 25 degrees than that of mr mullers and dr campbells houses both situated on the slopes 400 feet below this i ascertained by numerous comparative observations of the temperature of the air and by burying thermometers in the earth it is chiefly to be accounted for by the more frequent sunshine at the lower stations the power of the sun often raising the thermometer in shade to 80 degrees at mr mullers whereas during the summer i spent at mr hodgsons it never rose much above 70 degrees attaining that height very seldom and for a very short period only the nights again are uniformly and equally cloudy at both stations so that there is no corresponding cold of nocturnal radiation to reduce the temperature  the mean decrease of temperature due to elevation i have stated appendix i to be about 1 degree for every 300 feet of ascent according to which law mr hodgsons should not be more than 15 degrees° colder than mr mullers these facts prove how difficult it is to choose unexceptionable sites for meteorological observatories in mountainous countries discrepancies of so great an amount being due to local causes which as in this case are perhaps transient for should the top of the spur be wholly cleared of timber its temperature would be materially raised at the expense probably of a deficiency of water at certain seasons great inequalities of temperature are also produced by ascending currents of heated air from the great rungeet valley which affect certain parts of the station only and these raise the thermometer 10 degrees even when the sun is clouded above what it indicates at other places of equal elevation  the mean temperature of dorjiling elev 7430 feet is very nearly 50 degrees or 2 degrees higher than that of london and 26 degrees below that of calcutta 78 degrees prinsep in as soc journ jan 1832 p 30 or 785 degrees in the latest published tables daniells met essays vol ii p 341 which allowing 1 degree of diminution of temperature for every degree of latitude leaves 1 degree due to every 300 feet of ascent above calcutta to the height of dorjiling agreeably to my own observations this diminution is not the same for greater heights as i shall have occasion to show in a separate chapter of this appendix on the decrement of heat with elevation  a remarkable uniformity of temperature prevails throughout the year at dorjiling there being only 22 degrees difference between the mean temperatures of the hottest and coldest months whilst in london with a lower mean temperature the equivalent difference is 27 degrees at 11000 feet this difference is equal to that of london in more elevated regions it is still greater the climate becoming excessive at 15000 feet where the difference amounts to 30 degrees at least this is contrary to the conclusions of all meteorologists who have studied the climate of the alps and is entirely due to the local disturbances which i have so often dwelt upon and principally to the unequal distribution of moisture in the loftier rearward regions and the aridity of tibet professor james forbes states ed phil trans v xiv p 4891 that the decrement of temperature with altitude is most rapid in summer this as i shall hereafter show is not the case in the himalaya chiefly because the warm south moist wind then prevails 2 that the annual range of temperature diminishes with the elevation this too is not the case in sikkim because of the barer surface and more cloudless skies of the rearward loftier regions 3 that the diurnal range of temperature diminishes with the height that this is not the cane follows from the same cause 4 that radiation is least in winter this is negatived by the influence of the summer rains the accompanying table is the result of an attempt to approximate to the mean temperatures and ranges of the thermometer at various elevations  altitude             11000 feet   15000 feet   19000 feet mean shade             409          298          198 mean warmest month     500          400          320 mean coldest month     240          110           00 mean daily range

apply which i exceedingly doubt to heights above 19000 feet 2 degrees would be the mean annual temperature of the summit of kinchinjunga altitude 28178 feet the loftiest known spot on the globe this is a degree or two higher than the temperature of the poles of greatest cold on the earths surface and about the temperature of spitzbergen and melville island  the upper limit of phenogamic vegetation coincides with a mean temperature of 30 degrees on the south flank of kinchinjunga and of 22 degrees in tibet in both cases annuals and perennialrooted herbaceous plants are to be found at elevations corresponding to these mean temperatures and often at higher elevations in sheltered localities i have assumed the decrease of temperature for a corresponding amount of elevation to be gradually less in ascending 1 degree320 feet at 6000 to 10000 feet 1 degree400 feet at 14000 to 18000 feet my observations appear to prove this but i do not regard them as conclusive supposing them to be so i attribute it to a combination of various causes especially to the increased elevation and yet unsnowed condition of the mass of land elevated above 16000 feet and consequent radiation of heat also to the greater amount of sunshine there and to the less dense mists which obstruct the suns rays at all elevations in corroboration of this i may mention that the decrease of temperature with elevation is much less in summer than in winter 1 degree of fahr being equivalent to only 250 feet in january between 7000 and 13000 feet and to upwards of 400 feet in july again at dorjiling 7430 feet the temperature hardly ever rises above 70 degrees in the summer months yet it often rises even higher in tibet at 12000 to 14000 feet on the other hand the winters and the winter nights especially are disproportionately cold at great heights the thermometer falling upwards of 40 degrees below the dorjiling temperature at an elevation only 6000 feet higher  the diurnal distribution of temperature is equally and similarly affected by the presence of vapour at different altitudes the lower and outer ranges of 6000 to 10000 feet first receive the diurnal charge of vapourloaded southerly winds those beyond them get more of the suns rays and the rearward ones more still though the summer days of the northern localities are warmer than their elevation would indicate the nights are not proportionally cold for the light mist of 14000 feet which replaces the dense fog of 7000 feet effectually obstructs nocturnal radiation though it is less an obstacle to solar radiation clear nights be it observed are as rare at momay 15300 feet as at dorjiling the nights if windy being rainy or if calm cold currents descend from the mountains condensing the moist vapours of the valleys whose narrow floors are at sunrise bathed in mist at all elevations in sikkim the rise and dispersion of these dense mists and their collection and recondensation on the mountains in the morning is one of the most magnificent phenomena of the himalaya when viewed from a proper elevation it commences as soon as the sun appears on the horizon  the mean daily range of the thermometer at 7000 feet is 13 degrees in cleared spots but considerably less in wooded and certainly onethird less in the forest itself at calcutta which has almost an insular climate it amounts to 17 degrees at delhi which has a continental one to 246 degrees and in london to 175 degrees at 11000 feet it amounts to about 20 degrees and at 15000 feet to 27 degrees these values vary widely in the different months being much less in the summer or rainy months the following is probably a fair approximation  at 7000 feet it amounts to 89 degrees in aug and sept and 17 degrees in dec at 11000 feet it amounts to 12 degrees in aug and sept and 30 degrees in dec at 15000 feet it amounts to 15 degrees in aug and sept and 40 degrees in dec at london it amounts to 20 degrees in aug and sept and 10 degrees in dec  the distribution of temperature throughout the day and year varies less at dorjiling than in most mountainous countries owing to the prevailing moisture the effect of which is analogous to that of a circumambient ocean to an island the difference being that in the case of the island the bulk of water maintains an uniform temperature in that of dorjiling the quantity of vapour acts directly by interfering with terrestrial and solarradiation and indirectly by nurturing a luxuriant vegetation the result in the latter case is a climate remarkable for its equability and similar in many features to that of new zealand southwest chili fuegia and the damp west coasts of scotland and ireland and other countries exposed to moist sea winds  the mean temperature of the year at dorjiling as taken by maxima and minima thermometers the mean of several of the months thus deduced often varies a good deal from the truth owing to the unequal diurnal distribution of heat a very few minutes sunshine raises the temperature l0 degrees or 15 degrees above the mean of the day which excessive heat usually transient the maximum thermometer registers and consequently gives too high a mean by dr chapman is nearly the same as that of march and october january the coldest month is more than 134 degrees colder than the mean of the year but the hottest month is only 83 degrees warmer than the same mean at calcutta the months vary less from the mean at delhi more and in london the distribution is wholly different there being no rains to modify the summer heat july is 13 degrees hotter and january 14 degrees colder than the mean of the year  this distribution of the seasons has a most important effect upon vegetation to which sufficient attention has not been paid by cultivators of alpine indian plants in the first place though english winters are cold enough for such the summers are too hot and dry and in the second place the great accession of temperature causing the buds to burst in spring occurs in the himalaya in march when the temperature at 7000 feet rises 8 degrees above that of february raising the radiating thermometer always above the freezing point whence the young leaves are never injured by night frost in england the corresponding rise is only 3 degrees and there is no such accession of temperature till may which is 8 degrees warmer than april hence the young foliage of many himalayan plants is cut off by night frosts in english gardens early in the season of which abies webbiana is a conspicuous example  the greatest heat of the day occurs at dorjiling about noon owing to the prevalent cloud especially during the rainy months when the sun shines only in the mornings if at all and the clouds accumulate as the day advances according to hourly observations of my own it occurred in july at noon in august at 1 pm and in september the most rainy month there was only fourtenths of a degree difference between the means of noon 1 pm and 2 pm but i must refer to the abstracts at the end of this chapter for evidence of this and of the wonderful uniformity of temperature during the rainy months in the drier season again after september the greatest heat occurs between 2 and 3 pm in calcutta the hottest hour is about 245 pm throughout the year and in england also about 3 pm  the hour whose temperature coincides with the mean of the day necessarily varies with the distribution of cloud and sunshine it is usually about 7 am and 7 pm whereas in calcutta the same coincidence occurs at a little before 10 am and in england at about 8 am  next to the temperature of the air observations on that of the earth are perhaps of the greatest value both from their application to horticulture and from the approximation they afford to the mean temperature of the week or month in which they are taken these form the subject of a separate chapter  nocturnal and solar radiation the one causing the formation of dew and hoarfrost when the air in the shade is above freezing end killing plants by the rapid abstraction of heat from all their surfaces which are exposed to the clear sky and the other scorching the skin and tender plants during the day are now familiar phenomena and particularly engaged my attention during my whole indian journey two phenomena particularly obstruct radiation in sikkimthe clouds and fog from the end of may till october and the haze from february till may two months alone are usually clear one before and one after the rains when the air though still humid is transparent the haze has never been fully explained though a wellknown phenomenon on the plains of india at the foot of the hills it begins generally in the forenoon of the cold season with the rise of the west wind and in february especially obscures the suns disc by noon frequently it lasts throughout the twentyfour hours and is usually accompanied by great dryness of the atmosphere it gradually diminishes in ascending and have never experienced it at 10000 feet at 7000 however it very often in april obscures the snowy ranges 30 miles off which are bright and defined at sunrise and either pale away or become of a lurid yellowred according to the density of this haze till they disappear at 10 am i believe it always accompanies a southwest wind which is a deflected current of the northwest and dry atmosphere in sikkim  the observations for solar radiation were taken with a blackbulb thermometer and also with actinometers but the value of the data afforded by the latter not being fixed or comparative i shall give the results in a separate section see appendix k from a multitude of desultory observations i conclude that at 7400 feet 1257 degrees or  67 degrees above the temperature of the air is the average maximum effect of the suns rays on a blackbulb thermometer from the mean of very many observations i find that 10 degrees is the average difference at the level of the sea in india between two similar thermometers with spherical bulbs halfinch diam the one of black and the other of plain glass and both being equally exposed to the suns rays throughout the year amounting rarely to  70 degrees and  80 degrees in the summer months but more frequently in the winter or spring these results though greatly above what are obtained at calcutta are not much if at all above what may be observed on the plains of india this effect is much increased with the elevation at 10000 feet in december at 9 am i saw the mercury mount to 132 degrees with a difl of  94 degrees whilst the temperature of shaded snow hard by was 22 degrees at 13100 feet in january at 9 am it has stood at 98 degrees diff  682 degrees and at 10 am at 114 degrees diff  814 degrees whilst the radiating thermometer on the snow had fallen at sunrise to 07 degree in december at 13500 feet i have seen it 110 degrees diff  84 degrees at 11 am 11500 feet 122 degrees diff  82 degrees this is but a small selection from many instances of the extraordinary power of solar radiation in the coldest months at great elevations  nocturnal and terrestrial radiation are even more difficult phenomena for the traveller to estimate than solar radiation the danger of exposing instruments at night being always great in wild countries i most frequently used a thermometer graduated on the glass and placed in the focus of a parabolic reflector and a similar one laid upon white cotton snow radiates the most powerfully of any substance i have tried in one instance at 13000 feet in january the thermometer on snow fell to 02 degree which was 108 degrees below the temperature at the time the grass showing 67 degrees and on another occasion to l2 degrees when the air at the time before sunrise was 212 degrees the difference therefore being 20 degrees i have frequently made this observation and always with a similar result it may account for the great injury plants sustain from a thin covering of ice on their foliage even when the temperature is but little below the freezingpoint and found no material difference in the mean of many observations of each though often 1 degree to 2 degrees in individual ones avoiding radiation from surrounding objects is very difficult especially in wooded countries i have also tried the radiating power of grass and the earth the temperature of the latter is generally less and that of the former greater than the thermometer exposed on cotton or in the reflector but much depends on the surface of the herbage and soil  the power of terrestrial like that of solar radiation increases with the elevation but not in an equal proportion at 7400 feet the mean of all my observations shows a temperature of 354 degrees during the rains 3 degrees to 4 degrees is the mean maximum but the nights being almost invariably cloudy it is scarcely on one night out of six that there is any radiation from october to december the amount is greater  10 degrees to 12 and from january till may greater still being as much as 15 degrees during the winter months the effect of radiation is often felt throughout the clear days dew forming abundantly at 4000 to 8000 feet in the shaded bottoms of narrow valleys into which the sun does not penetrate till 10 am and from which it disappears at 3 pm i have seen the thermometer in the reflector fall 12 degrees at 10 am in a shaded valley this often produces an anomalous effect causing the temperature in the shade to fall after sunrise for the mists which condense in the bottom of the valleys after midnight disperse after sunrise but long before reached by the sun and powerful radiation ensues lowering the surrounding temperature a fall of 1 degree to  2 degrees after sunrise of air in the shade is hence common in valleys in november and december such is the explanation which i have offered of this phenomenon in the hort soc journal on thinking over the matter since i have speculated upon the probability of this fall of temperature being due to the absorption of heat that must become latent on the dispersion of the dense masses of white fog that choke the valleys at sunrise the excessive radiation of the winter months often gives rise to a curious phenomenon it causes the formation of copious dew on the blanket of the travellers bed which radiates heat to the tent roof and this inside either an open or a closed tent i have experienced this at various elevations from 6000 to 16000 feet whether the minimum temperature be as high as 50 degrees or but little above zero the effect is the same except that hoarfrost or ice forms in the latter case another remarkable effect of nocturnal radiation is the curl of the alpine rhododendron leaves in november which is probably due to the freezing and consequent expansion of the water in the upper strata of cells exposed to the sky the first curl is generally repaired by the ensuing days sun but after two or three nights the leaves become permanently curled and remain so till they fall in the following spring  i have said that the nocturnal radiation in the english spring months is the great obstacle to the cultivation of many himalayan plants but it is not therefore to be inferred that there is no similar amount of radiation in the himalaya for on the contrary in april its amount is much greater than in england frequently equalling 13 degrees of difference and i have seen 16 degrees at 7500 feet but the minimum temperature at the time is 51 degrees and the absolute amount of cold therefore immaterial the mean minimum of london is 38 degrees and when lowered 55 degrees by radiation the consequent cold is very considerable mr daniell in his admirable essay on the climate of london mentions 17 degrees as the maximum effect of nocturnal radiation ever observed by him i have registered 16 degrees in april at dorjiling nearly as much at 6000 feet in february twice 13 degrees and once 142 degrees in september at 15500 feet and 10 degrees in october at 16800 feet nearly 13 degrees in january at 7000 feet 145 degrees in february at that elevation and on several occasions 147 degrees at 10000 feet in november  the annual rainfall at dorjiling averages 120 inches or 10 feet but varies from 100 to 130 in different years this is fully three times the amount of the average english fall the general ideas on the subject of the english rainfall are so very vague that i may be pardoned for reminding my readers that in 1852 the year of extraordinary rain the amounts varied from 285 inches in essex to 50 inches at cirencester and 675 average of five years at plympton st marys and 1025 at holme on the dart and yet not onefourth of what is experienced on the khasia hills in eastern bengal where fifty feet of rain falls the greater proportion descends between june and september as much as thirty inches sometimes falling in one month from november to february inclusive the months are comparatively dry march and october are characterised by violent storms at the equinoxes with thunder destructive lightning and hail  the raingauge takes no account of the enormous deposition from mists and fogs these keep the atmosphere in a state of moisture the amount of which i have estimated at 088 as the saturationpoint at dorjiling 083 being that of london in july the dampest month the saturationpoint is 097 and in december owing to the dryness of the air on the neighbouring plains of india whence dry blasts pass over sikkim the mean saturationpoint of the month sometimes falls as low as 069  the dewpoint is on the average of the year 493 degrees or 3 degrees below the mean temperature of the air in the dampest month july the mean dewpoint is only eighttenths of a degree below the temperature whilst in december it sinks 10 degrees below it in london the dewpoint is on the average 56 degrees below the temperature none of the english months are so wet as those of sikkim but none are so dry as the sikkim december sometimes is   on the weight of the atmosphere in sikkim and its effects on the human frame  of all the phenomena of climate the weight of the atmosphere is the most remarkable for its elusion of direct observation when unaided by instruments at the level of the sea a man of ordinary bulk and stature is pressed upon by a superincumbent weight of 30000 pounds or 135 tons an inch fall or rise in the barometer shows that this load is lightened or increased sometimes in a few hours by nearly 1000 pounds and no notice is taken of it except by the meteorologist or by the speculative physician seeking the subtle causes of epidemic and endemic complaints at dorjiling 7400 feet this load is reduced to less than 2500 pounds with no appreciable result whatever on the frame however suddenly it be transported to that elevation and the observation of my own habits convinced me that i took the same amount of meat drink sleep exercise and work not only without inconvenience but without the slightest perception of my altered circumstances on ascending to 14000 feet owing to the diminished supply of oxygen exercise brings on vertigo and headache ascending higher still lassitude and tension across the forehead ensue with retching and a sense of weight dragging down the stomach probably due to dilatation of the air contained in that organ such are the all but invariable effects of high elevations varying with most persons according to the suddenness and steepness of the ascent the amount and duration of exertion and the length of time previously passed at great heights after having lived for some weeks at 15300 feet i have thence ascended several times to 18500 and once above 19000 feet without any sensations but lassitude and quickness of pulse i have in a note to vol ii chapter xxiii stated that i never experienced in my own person nor saw in others bleeding at the ears nose lips or eyelids but in these instances it required great caution to avoid painful symptoms residing at 15300 feet however my functions were wholly undisturbed nor could i detect any quickness of pulse or of respiration when the body was at rest below 17000 feet at that elevation after resting a party of eight men for an hour the average of their and my pulses was above 100 degrees both before and after eating in one case it was 120 degrees in none below 80 degrees  not only is the frame of a transient visitor unaffected when at rest by the pressure being reduced from 30000 to 13000 pounds but the tibetan born and constantly residing at upwards of 14000 feet differs in no respect that can be attributed to diminished pressure from the native of the level of the sea the averaged duration of life and the amount of food and exercise is the same eighty years are rarely reached by either the tibetan too however inured to cold and great elevations still suffers when he crosses passes 18000 or 19000 feet high and apparently neither more nor less than i did  liebig remarks in his animal chemistry that in an equal number of respirations for the following note i am indebted to my friend c muller esq of patna  according to sir h davy a man consumes 45504 cubic inches of oxygen in twentyfour hours necessitating the inspiration of 147520 cubic inches of atmospheric airat pressure 23 inches and temp 60 degrees this volume of atmospheric air dry would weigh 3513875 grainsat pressure 30 in temp 80° it would weigh 4399763 gr  the amount of oxygen in atmospheric air is 2332 per cent by weight the oxygen then in 147520 cubic inches of dry air at pressure 23 in temp 80 degrees weighs 819435 gr and at pressure 30 in temp 80 degrees it weighs 1026025 gr  hence the absolute quantity of oxygen in a given volume of atmospheric air when the pressure is 23 in and the temp 60 degrees is 2014 per cent less than when the pressure is 30 in and the temp 80 degrees  when the air at pressure 23 in temp 60 degrees is saturated with moisture the proportion of dry air and aqueous vapour in 100 cubic inches is as follows     dry air    97173     vapour   2827  at pressure 30 in temp 80 degrees the proportions are     dry air    96133     vapour      3867  the effect of aqueous vapour in the air on the amount of oxygen available for consumption is very trifling and it must not be forgotten that aqueous vapour supplies oxygen to the system as well as atmospheric air we consume a larger amount of oxygen at the level of the sea than on a mountain and it can be shown that under ordinary circumstances at dorjiling 2014 per cent less is inhaled than on the plains of india yet the chest cannot expand so as to inspire more at once nor is the respiration appreciably quickened by either of which means nature would be enabled to make up the deficiency it is true that it is difficult to count ones own respirations but the average is considered in a healthy man to be eighteen in a minute in my own case it is sixteen an acceleration of which by three or four could not have been overlooked in the repeated trials i made at dorjiling and still less the eight additional inhalations required at 15000 feet to make up for the deficiency of oxygen in the air of that elevation  it has long been surmised that an alpine vegetation may owe some of its peculiarities to the diminished atmospheric pressure and that the latter being a condition which the gardener cannot supply he can never successfully cultivate such plants in general i know of no foundation for this hypothesis many plants natives of the level of the sea in other parts of the world and some even of the hot plains of bengal ascend to 12000 and even 15000 feet on the himalaya unaffected by the diminished pressure any number of species from low countries may be cultivated and some have been for ages at 10000 to 14000 feet without change it is the same with the lower animals innumerable instances may with ease be adduced of pressure alone inducing no appreciable change whilst there is absence of proof to the contrary the phenomena that accompany diminished pressure are the real obstacles to the cultivation of alpine plants of which cold and the excessive climate are perhaps the most formidable plants that grow in localities marked by sudden extremes of heat and cold are always very variable in stature habit and foliage in a state of nature we say the plants accommodate themselves to these changes and so they do within certain limits but for one that survives of all the seeds that germinate in these inhospitable localities thousands die in our gardens we can neither imitate the conditions of an alpine climate nor offer others suited to the plants of such climates  the mean height of the barometer at mr hodgsons was 23010 but varied 0161 between july when it was lowest and october when it was highest following the monthly rise and fall of calcutta as to period but not as to amount or amplitude for the mercury at calcutta stands in july upwards of half an inch 0555 prinsep lower than it does in december  the diurnal tide of atmosphere is as constant as to the time of its ebb and flow at dorjiling as at calcutta and a number of very careful observations made with special reference to this object between the level of the plains of india and 17000 feet would indicate that there is no very material deviation from this at any elevation in sikkim these times are very nearly 950 am and about 10 pm for the maxima the 950 am very constantly and the 10 pm with more uncertainty and 4 am and 4 pm for the minima the afternoon ebb being most true to its time except during the rains  at 950 am the barometer is at its highest and falls till 4 pm when it stands on the average of the year 0074 of an inch lower during the same period the calcutta fall is upwards of onetenth of an inch 0121 prinsep  it has been proved that at considerable elevations in europe the hours of periodic ebb and flow differ materially from those which prevail at the level of the sea but this is certainly not the case in the sikkim himalaya  the amplitude decreases in amount from 0100 at the foot of the hills to 0074 at 7000 feet and the mean of 132 selected unexceptionable observations taken at nine stations between 8000 and 15500 feet at 950 am and 4 pm gives an average fall of 0056 of an inch a result which is confirmed by interpolation from numerous horary observations at these and many other elevations where i could observe at the critical hours  that the calcutta amplitude is not exceptionally great is shewn by the register kept at different places in the gangetic valley and plains of india between saharunpore and the bay of bengal i have seen apparently trustworthy records of seven calcutta berampore benares nagpore moozufferpore delhi and saharunpore such and find that in all it amounts to between 0084 and 0120 inch the mean of the whole being 0101 of an inch  the amplitude is greatest 0088 in the spring months march april and may both at dorjiling and calcutta it is least at both in june and july 0027 at dorjiling and rises again in autumn to 082 in september  the horary oscillations also are as remarkably uniform at all elevations as the period of ebb and flow the mercury falls slowly from 950 am when it is at its highest till noon then rapidly till 3 pm and slowly again till 4 pm after which there is little change until sunset it rises rapidly between 7 and 9 pm and a little more till 10 pm thence till 4 am the fall is inconsiderable and the great rise occurs between 7 and 9 am  it is well known that these fluctuations of the barometer are due to the expansion and contraction by heat and moisture of the column of atmosphere that presses on the mercury in the cistern of the instrument were the air dry the effect would be a single rise and fall this law for which we are indebted to professor dove has been clearly explained by colonel sabine in the appendix to his translation of humboldts cosmos vol i p 457 the barometer would stand highest at the hottest of the twentyfour hours and lowest at the coldest and such is the case in arid continental regions which are perennially dry that such would also be the case at calcutta and throughout the himalaya of sikkim is theoretically selfevident and proved by my horary observations taken during the rainy months of 1848 an inspection of these at the end of this section where a column contains the pressure of dry air shows but one maximum of pressure which occurs at the coldest time of the twentyfour hours early in the morning and one minimum in the afternoon in the table of mean temperatures of the months also appended to this section will also be found a column allowing the pressure of dry air whence it will be seen that there is but one maximum of the pressure of dry air occurring at the coldest season in december and one minimum in july the effect of the vapour is the same on the annual as upon the diurnal march of the pressure producing a double maximum and minimum in the year in one case and in the twentyfour hours in the other  i append a meteorological register of the separate months but at the same time must remind the reader that it does not pretend to strict accuracy it is founded upon observations made at dorjiling by dr chapman in the year 1837 for pressure temperature and wetbulb only the other data and some modifications of the above are supplied from observations of my own those for terrestrial and nocturnal radiation are accurate as far as they go that is to say they are absolute temperatures taken by myself which may i believe be recorded in any year but much higher are no doubt often to be obtained the dewpoints and saturations are generally calculated from the mean of two day observations 10 am and 4 pm of the wetbulb thermometer together with the minimum or are taken from observations of daniells hygrometer and as i find the mean of the temperature of 10 am 4 pm and the minimum to coincide within a few tenths with the mean temperature of the whole day i assume that the mean of the wetbulb observations of the same hours will give a near approach to that of the twentyfour hours the climate of dorjiling station has been in some degree altered by extensive clearances of forest which render it more variable more exposed to night frosts and strong sunheat and to drought the drying up of small streams being one direct consequence my own observations were taken at mr hodgsons house elevated 7430 feet the position of which i have indicated at the commencement of this section where the differences of climate due to local causes are sufficiently indicated to show that in no two spots could similar meteorological results be obtained at mr hodgsons for instance the uniformity of temperature and humidity is infinitely more remarkable than at dr chapmans possibly from my guarding more effectually against radiation and from the greater forests about mr hodgsons house i have not however ventured to interfere with the temperature columns on this account  dorjiling meteorological register                              jan   feb   mar   apr    may   june pressure of atmosphere

humidity and absolute amount of vapour contained in the atmosphere at different elevations in the sikkim himalaya  my observations for temperature and wetbulb being for the most part desultory taken at different dates and under very different conditions of exposure etc it is obvious that those at one station are hardly if at all comparative with those of another and i have therefore selected only such as were taken at the same date and hour with others taken at the calcutta observatory or as can easily be reduced which thus afford a standard however defective in many respects for a comparison i need hardly remind my reader that the vapourcharged wind of sikkim is the southerly one which blows over calcutta that in its passage northwards to sikkim in the summer months it traverses the heated plains at the foot of the himalaya and ascending that range it discharges the greater part of its moisture 120 to 140 inches annually over the outer himalayan ranges at elevations of 4000 to 8000 feet the cooling effect of the uniform covering of forest on the sikkim ranges is particularly favourable to this deposition but the slope of the mountains being gradual the ascending currents are not arrested and cooled so suddenly as in the khasia mountains where the discharge is consequently much greater the heating of the atmosphere too over the dry plains at the foot of the outer range increases farther its capacity for the retention of vapour and also tends to render the rainfall less sudden and violent than on the khasia where the south wind blows over the cool expanse of the jheels it will be seen from the following observations that in sikkim the relative humidity of the atmosphere remains pretty constantly very high in the summer months and at all elevations except in the rearward valleys and even there a humid atmosphere prevails up to 14000 feet everywhere within the influence of the snowy mountains the uniformly high temperature which prevails throughout the summer even at elevations of 17000 and 18000 feet is no doubt proximately due to the evolution of heat during the condensation of these vapours it will be seen by the pages of my journal that continued sunshine and the consequent heating of the soil is almost unknown during the summer at any elevation on the outer or southward ranges of dorjiling but the sunk thermometer proves that in advancing northward into the heart of the mountains and ascending the suns effect is increased the temperature of the earth becoming in summer considerably higher than that of the air with regard to the observations themselves they may be depended upon as comparable with those of calcutta the instruments having been carefully compared and the cases of interpolation being few the number of observations taken at each station is recorded in a separate column where only one is thus recorded it is not to be regarded as a single reading but the mean of several taken during an hour or longer period i have rejected all solitary observations even when accompanied by others at calcutta and sundry that were for obvious reasons likely to mislead where many observations were taken at one place i have divided them into sets corresponding to the hours at which alone the calcutta temperature and wetbulb thermometer are recorded sunrise 950 am noon 240 pm 4 pm and sunset in order that meteorologists may apply them to the solution of other questions relating to the distribution of heat and moisture the dorjiling observations and those in the immediate neighbourhood of that station appeared to me sufficiently numerous to render it worth while classing them in months and keeping them in a series by themselves the tensions of vapour are worked from the wetbulb readings by apjohns formula and tables corrected for the height of the barometer at the time the observations except where otherwise noted are taken by myself   series i observations made at or near dorjiling  january

is hence evident from nearly 1000 comparative observations that the atmosphere is relatively more humid at dorjiling than at calcutta throughout the year as the southerly current to which alone is due all the moisture of sikkim traverses 200 miles of land and discharges from sixty to eighty inches of rain before arriving at dorjiling it follows that the whole atmospheric column is relatively drier over the himalaya than over calcutta that the absolute amount of vapour in short is less than it would otherwise be at the elevation of dorjiling though the relative humidity is so great a glance at the table at the end of this section appears to confirm this for it is there shown that at the base of the himalaya at an elevation of only 250 feet higher than calcutta the absolute amount of vapour is less and of relative humidity greater than at calcutta   series iiobservations at various stations and elevations in the himalaya of east nepal and sikkim  elevation 735 to 2000 feet

results must be considered highly satisfactory they prove that the relative humidity of the atmospheric column remains pretty constant throughout all elevations except when these are in a tibetan climate and when above 18000 feet elevations which i attained in fine weather only up to 12000 feet this constant humidity is very marked the observations made at greater elevations were almost invariably to the north or leeward of the great snowy peaks and consequently in a drier climate and there it will be seen that these proportions are occasionally inverted and in tibet itself a degree of relative dryness is encountered such as is never equalled on the plains of eastern bengal or the gangetic delta whether an isolated peak rising near calcutta to the elevation of 19000 feet would present similar results to the above is not proven by these observations but as the relative humidity is the same at all elevations on the outermost ranges of sikkim which attain 10000 feet and as these rise from the plains like steep islands out of the ocean it may be presumed that the effects of elevation would be the same in both cases  the first effect of this humid wind is to clothe sikkim with forests that make it moister still and however difficult it is to separate cause from effect in such cases as those of the reciprocal action of humidity on vegetation and vegetation on humidity it is necessary for the observer to consider the one as the effect of the other there is no doubt that but for the humidity of the region the sikkim himalaya would not present the uniform clothing of forest that it does and on the other hand that but for this vegetation the relative humidity would not be so great balloon ascents and observations on small mountainous islands therefore offer the best means of solving such questions of these the results of ballooning under mr welshs intrepid and skilful pioneering see phil trans for 1853 have proved most satisfactory though from the time for observation being short and from the interference of belts of vapour some anomalies have not been eliminated islands again are still more exposed to local influences which may be easily eliminated in a long series of observations i think that were two islands as different in their physical characters as st helena and ascension selected for comparative observations at various elevations the laws that regulate the distribution of humidity in the upper regions might be deduced without difficulty they are advantageous sites from differing remarkably in their humidity owing partly to the indestructible nature of its component rock a glassy basalt the lower parts of ascension have never yielded to the corroding effects of the moist sea air which surrounds it which has decomposed the upper part into a deep bed of clay hence ascension does not support a native tree or even shrub two feet high st helena on the other hand which can hardly be considered more favourably situated for humidity was clothed with a redundant vegetation when discovered and trees and treeferns types of humidity still spread over its loftiest summits here the humidity vegetation and mineral and mechanical composition reciprocate their influences  the great amount of relative humidity registered at 6000 to 8000 feet arises from most of the observations having been made on the outer range where the atmosphere is surcharged the majority of those at 10000 to 12000 feet which also give a disproportionate amount of humidity were registered at the zemu and thlonok rivers where the narrowness of the valleys the proximity of great snowy peaks and the rank luxuriance of the vegetation all favour a humid atmosphere  i would have added the relative rainfall to the above but this is so very local a phenomenon and my observations were so repeatedly deranged by having to camp in forests and by local obstacles of all kinds that i have suppressed them their general results i have given in appendix f  i here add a few observations taken on the plains at the foot of the sikkim himalaya during the spring months   comparison between temperature and humidity of the sikkim terai and

commence the belt of sandy and grassy land along the himalaya though only 35 degrees north of calcutta is at least 6 degrees or 7 degrees colder and always more humid relatively though there is absolutely less moisture suspended in the air after the rains commence i believe that this is in a great measure inverted the plains becoming excessively heated and the temperature being higher than at calcutta this indeed follows from the well known fact that the summer heat increases greatly in advancing northwest from the bay of bengal to the transsutledge regions it is admirably expressed in the maps of doves great work on the distribution of heat on the surface of the globe   appendix h  on the temperature of the soil at various elevations  these observations were taken by burying a brass tube two feet six inches to three feet deep in exposed soil and sinking in it by a string or tied to a slip of wood a thermometer whose bulb was well padded with wool this after a few hours rest indicates the temperature of the soil such a tube and thermometer i usually caused to be sunk wherever i halted if even for one night except during the height of the rains which are so heavy that they communicate to the earth a temperature considerably above that of the air  the results proved that the temperature of the soil at dorjiling varies with that of the month from 46 degrees to 622 degrees but is hardly affected by the diurnal variation except in extreme cases in summer throughout the rains may to october the temperature is that of the month which is imparted by the rain to the depth of eleven feet during heavy continued falls of six to twelve inches a day on which occasions i have seen the buried thermometer indicating a temperature above the mean of the month again in the winter months december and january it stands 5 degrees above the monthly mean in november and february 4 degrees to 5 degrees in march a few degrees below the mean temperature of the month and in october above it april and may being sunny it stands above their mean june to september a little below the mean temperature of each respectively  the temperature of the soil is affected by1 the exposure of the surface 2 the nature of the soil 3 its permeability by rain and the presence of underground springs 4 the suns declination 5 the elevation above the sea and consequently the heating power of the suns rays and 6 the amount of cloud and sunshine  the appended observations though taken at sixtyseven places are far from being sufficient to supply data for the exact estimation of the effects of the sun on the soil at any elevation or locality they however indicate with tolerable certainty the main features of this phenomenon and these are in entire conformity with more ample series obtained elsewhere the result which at first sight appears the most anomalous is that the mean temperature of the soil at two or three feet depth is almost throughout the year in india above that of the surrounding atmosphere this has been also ascertained to be the case in england by several observers and the carefully conducted observations of mr robert thompson at the horticultural societys gardens at chiswick show that the temperature of the soil at that place is on the mean of six years at the depth of one foot 1 degree above that of the air and at two feet 15 degrees during the winter months the soil is considerably l degree to 3 degrees warmer than the air and during summer the soil is a fraction of a degree cooler than the air  in india the suns declination being greater these effects are much exaggerated the soil on the plains being in winter sometimes 9 degrees hotter than the air and at considerable elevations in the himalaya very much more than that in summer also the temperature of the soil seldom falls below that of the air except where copious rainfalls communicate a low temperature or where forests interfere with the suns rays  at considerable elevations these effects are so greatly increased that it is extremely probable that at certain localities the mean temperature of the soil may be even 10 degrees warmer than that of the air thus at jongri elevation 13194 feet the soil in january was 345 degrees or 192 degrees above the mean temperature of the month immediately before the ground became covered with snow for the remainder of the winter during the three succeeding months therefore the temperature of the soil probably does not fall below that of the snow whilst the mean temperature of the air in january may be estimated at about 20 degrees february 22 degrees march 30 degrees and april 35 degrees if again we assume the temperature of the soil of jongri to be that of other sikkim localities between 10000 and 14000 feet we may assume the soil to be warmer by 10 degrees in july see tungu observations by 8 degrees or 9 degrees in september see yeumtong by l0 degrees in october see tungu and by 7 degrees to l0 degrees in november see wallanchoon and nanki these temperatures however vary extremely according to exposure and amount of sunshine and i should expect that the greatest differences would be found in the sunny climate of tibet where the suns heat is most powerful were nocturnal or terrestrial radiation as constant and powerful as solar the effects of the latter would be neutralised but such is not the case at any elevation in sikkim  this accumulated heat in the upper strata of soil must have a very powerful effect upon vegetation preventing the delicate rootlets of shrubs from becoming frozen and preserving vitality in the more fleshy roots such as those of the large rhubarbs and small orchids whose spongy cellular tissues would no doubt be ruptured by severe frosts to the burrowing rodents the hares marmots and rats which abound at 15000 to 17000 feet in tibet this phenomenon is even more conspicuously important for were the soil in winter to acquire the mean temperature of the air it would take very long to heat after the melting of the snow and indeed the latter phenomenon would be greatly retarded the rapid development of vegetation after the disappearance of the snow is no doubt also proximately due to the heat of the soil quite as much as to the increased strength of the suns direct rays in lofty regions  i have given in the column following that containing the temperature of the sunk thermometer first the extreme temperatures of the air recorded during the time the instrument was sunk and in the next following the mean temperature of the air during the same period so far as i

muller  observations for temperature of air taken at the observatory    appendix i  on the decrement of temperature in ascending the sikkim himalaya mountains and khasia mountains  i have selected as many of my observations for temperature of the sir as appeared to be trustworthy and which also were taken contemporaneously with others at calcutta and i have compared them with the calcutta observations in order to find the ratio of decrement of heat to an increase of elevation the results of several sets of observations are grouped together but show so great an amount of discrepancy that it is evident that a long series of months and the selection of several stations are necessary in a mountain country to arrive at any accurate results even at the stations where the most numerous and the most trustworthy observations were recorded the results of different months differ extremely and with regard to the other stations where few observations were taken each one is affected differently from another at the same level with it by the presence or proximity of forest by exposure to the east or west to ascending or descending currents in the valleys and to cloud or sunshine other and still more important modifying influences are to be traced to the monthly variations in the amount of humidity in the air and the strength of its currents to radiation and to the evolution of heat which accompanies condensation raising the temperature of elevated regions during the rainy season the proximity of large masses of snow has not the influence i should have expected in lowering the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere partly no doubt because of the more rapid condensation of vapours which it effects and partly because of the free circulation of the currents around it the difference between the temperatures of adjacent grassy and naked or rocky spots on the other hand is very great indeed the former soon becoming powerfully heated in lofty regions where the suns rays pass through a rarefied atmosphere and the rocks especially radiating much of the heat thus accumulated for long after sunset in various parts of my journals i have alluded to other disturbing causes which being all more or leas familiar to meteorologists i need not recapitulate here their combined effects raise all the summer temperatures above what they should theoretically be  in taking calcutta as a standard of comparison i have been guided by two circumstances first the necessity of selecting a spot where observations were regularly and accurately made and secondly the being able to satisfy myself by a comparison of my instruments that the results should be so far strictly comparable  i have allowed 1 degree fahr for every degree in latitude intervening between sikkim and calcutta as the probable ratio of diminution of temperature so far as my observations made in east bengal and in various parts of the gangetic delta afford a means of solving this question this is a near approximation to the truth the spring observations however which i have made at the foot of the sikkim himalaya would indicate a much more rapid decrement the mean temperature of titalya and other parts of the plains south of the forests between march and may being certainly 6 degrees9 degrees lower than calcutta this period however is marked by northwest and northeast winds and by a strong haze which prevents the suns rays from impinging on the soil with any effect during the southerly winds the same region is probably hotter than calcutta there being but scanty

 mean 383 ft   the great elevation of the temperature in the lowest elevations is accounted for by the heating of the valleys wherein these observations were taken and especially of the rocks on their floors the increase with the elevation of the three succeeding sets arises from the fact that the loftier regions are far within the mountain region and are less forest clad and more sunny than the outer himalaya  a considerable number of observations were taken during this journey at night when none are recorded at calcutta but which are comparable with contemporaneous observations taken by mr muller at dorjiling these being all taken during the three most rainy months when the temperature varies but very little during the whole twentyfour hours i expected satisfactory results but they

seem to indicate that up to an elevation of 7500 feet the temperature diminishes rather more than 1 degree fahr for every 300 feet of ascent or thereabouts that this decrement is much leas in the summer than in the winter months and i may add that it is less by day than by night there is much discrepancy between the results obtained at greater or less elevations than 7000 feet but a careful study of these which i have arranged in every possible way leads me to the conclusion that the proportion map be roughly indicated thus  1 degree300 feet for elevations from   1000 to   8000 feet 1

observations it indicates a considerably higher temperature of the atmosphere and is probably attributable to the evolution of heat during extraordinary rainfall and to the formation of the surface which is a very undulating tableland and everywhere traversed by broad deep valleys with very steep often precipitous flanks these get heated by the powerful sun and from them powerful currents ascend the scanty covering of herbage too over a great amount of the surface and the consequent radiation of heat from the earth must have a sensible influence on the mean temperature of the summer months   appendix j  on the measurement of altitudes by the boilingpoint thermometer  the use of the boilingpoint thermometer for the determination of elevations in mountainous countries appearing to me to be much underrated i have collected the observations which i was enabled to take and compared their results with barometrical ones  i had always three boilingpoint thermometers in use and for several months five the instruments were constructed by newman dollond troughton and simms and jones and though all in one sense good instruments differed much from one another and from the truth mr welsh has had the kindness to compare the three best instruments with the standards at the kew observatory at various temperatures between 180 degrees and the boilingpoint from which comparison it appears that an error of l5 degrees may be found at some parts of the scale of instruments most confidently vouched for by admirable makers dollonds thermometer which dr thomson had used throughout his extensive west tibetan journeys deviated but little from the truth at all ordinary temperatures all were so far good that the errors which were almost entirely attributable to carelessness in the adjustments were constant or increased at a constant ratio throughout all parts of the scale so that the results of the different instruments have after correction proved strictly comparable  the kettle used was a copper one supplied by newman with free escape for the steam it answered perfectly for all but very high elevations indeed where from the water boiling at very low temperatures the metal of the kettle and consequently of the thermometer often got heated above the temperature of the boiling water  i found that no confidence could be placed in observations taken at great elevations by plunging the thermometer in open vessels of boiling water however large or deep the abstraction of heat from the surface being so rapid that the water though boiling below and hence bubbling above is not uniformly of the same temperature throughout  in the himalaya i invariably used distilled or snow or rainwater but often as i have tried common riverwater for comparison i never found that it made any difference in the temperature of the boilingpoint even the mineralspring water at yeumtong and the detrituscharged glacial streams gave no difference and i am hence satisfied that no objection can be urged against river waters of ordinary purity  on several occasions i found anomalous rises and falls in the column of mercury for which i could not account except theoretically by assuming breaks in the column which i failed to detect on lifting the instrument out of the water at other times i observed that the column remained for several minutes stationary below the true temperature of the boiling water and then suddenly rose to it these are no doubt instrumental defects which i only mention as being sources of error against which the observer must be on the watch they can only be guarded against by the use of two instruments  with regard to the formula employed for deducing the altitude from a boilingpoint observation the same corrections are to a great extent necessary as with barometric observations if no account is taken of the probable state of atmospheric pressure at the level of the sea at or near the place of observation for the hour of the day and month of the year or for the latitude it is obvious that errors of 600 to 1000 feet may be accumulated i have elsewhere stated that the pressure at calcutta varies nearly one inch 1000 feet between july and january that the daily tide amounts to onetenth of an inch 100 feet that the multiplier for temperature is too great in the hot season and too small in the cold and i have experimentally proved that more accuracy is to be obtained in measuring heights in sikkim by assuming the observed calcutta pressure and temperature to accord with that of the level of the sea in the latitude of sikkim than by employing a theoretical pressure and temperature for the lower station  in the following observations the tables i used were those printed by lieutenantcolonel boileau for the east india companys magnetic observatory at simla which are based upon regnaults table of the elastic force of vapour the mean height of the barometrical column is assumed from bessels formula to be 29924 at temp 32 degrees in lat 45 degrees which differing only 002 from the barometric height corresponding to 212 degrees fahrenheit as determined experimentally by regnault gives 29921 as the pressure corresponding to 212 degrees at the level of the sea  the approximate height in feet corresponding to each degree of the boilingpoint is derived from oltmanns tables the multipliers for the mean temperature of the strata of atmosphere passed through are computed for every degree fahrenheit by the formula for expansion usually employed and given in bailys astronomical tables and biots astronomie physique  for practical purposes it may be assumed that the traveller in countries where boilingpoint observations are most desired has never the advantage of a contemporaneous boilingpoint observation at a lower station the approximate difference in height is hence in most cases deduced from the assumption that the boilingpoint temperature at the level of the sea at the place of observation is 212 degrees and that the corresponding temperature of the air at the level of the sea is hotter by one degree for every 330 feet of difference in elevation as however the temperature of boiling water at the level of the sea varies at calcutta between july and january almost from 2107 degrees to 2126 degrees i always took the calcutta barometer observation at the day and hour of my boilingpoint observation and corrected my approximate height by as many feet as correspond to the difference between the observed height of the barometer at calcutta and 29921 this correction was almost invariably always normally subtractive in the summer often amounting to upwards of 400 feet it was additive in winter and towards the equinoxes it was very trifling  for practical purposes i found it sufficient to assume the calcutta temperature of the air at the day and hour of observation to be that of the level of the sea at the place of observation and to take out the multiplier from the mean of this and of the temperature at the upper station as however 330 feet is a near approach to what i have shown appendix i to be the mean equivalent of 1 degree for all elevations between 6000 and 18000 feet and as the majority of my observations were taken between these elevations it results that the mean of all the multipliers employed in sikkim for fortyfour observations amounts to 651 degrees fahrenheit using the calcutta and upper station observations and 653 degrees on the assumption of a fall of 1 degree for every 330 feet to show however how great an error may accrue in individual cases from using the formula of 1 degree to 330 i may mention that on one occasion being at an elevation of 12000 feet with a temperature of the air of 70 degrees the error amounted to upwards of 220 feet and as the same temperature may be recorded at much greater elevations it follows that in such cases the formula should not be employed without modification  a multitude of smaller errors arising from anomalies in the distribution of temperature will be apparent on consulting my observations on the temperature at various elevations in sikkim practically these are unavoidable i have also calculated all my observations according to professor j forbess formula of 1 degree difference of temperature of boilingwater being the equivalent of 550 feet at all elevations see ed phil trans vol xv p 405 the formula is certainly not applicable to the sikkim himalaya on the contrary my observations show that the formula employed for boileaus tables gives at all ordinary elevations so very close an approach to accuracy on the mean of many observations that no material improvement in its construction is to be anticipated  at elevations below 4000 feet elevations calculated from the boilingpoint are not to be depended on and dr thomson remarked the same in northwest india above 17000 feet also the observations are hazardous except good shelter and a very steady fire is obtainable owing to the heating of the metal above that of the water at all other elevations a mean error of 100 feet is on the average what is to be expected in ordinary cases for the elevation of great mountain masses and continuously elevated areas i conceive that the results are as good as barometrical ones for the general purposes of botanical geography the boilingpoint thermometer supersedes the barometer in point of practical utility for under every advantage the transport of a glass tube full of mercury nearly three feet long and cased in metal is a great drawback to the unrestrained motion of the traveller  in the khasia mountains i found from the mean of twelve stations and twentythree observations the multiplier as derived from the mean of the temperature at the upper station and at calcutta to be 752 degrees and as deduced from the formula to be 731 degrees here however the equivalent in feet for 1 degree temp is in summer very high being 1 degree385 feet see appendix i the mean of all the elevations worked by the boilingpoint is upwards of 140 feet below those worked by the barometer  the following observations are selected as having at the time been considered trustworthy owing to the care with which they were taken their repetition in several cases and the presumed accuracy of the barometrical or trigonometrical elevation with which they are compared a small correction for the humidity of the air might have been introduced with advantage but as in most barometrical observations the calculations proceed on the assumption that the column of air is in a mean state of saturation as the climate of the upper station was always very moist and as most of the observations were taken during the rains this correction would be always additive and would never exceed sixty feet  it must be borne in mind that the comparative results given below afford by no means a fair idea of the accuracy to be obtained by the boilingpoint some of the differences in elevation are probably due to the barometer in other cases i may have read off the scale wrong for however simple it seems to read off an instrument those practically acquainted with their use know well how some errors almost become chronic how with a certain familiar instrument the chance of error is very great at one particular part of the scale and how confusing it is to read off through steam alternately from several instruments whose scales are of different dimensions are differently divided and differently lettered such causes of error are constitutional in individual observers again these observations are selected without any reference to other considerations but what i have stated above the worst have been put in with the best had i been dependent on the boilingpoint for determining my elevations i should have observed it oftener or at stated periods whenever in camp worked the greater elevations from the intermediate ones as well as from calcutta and resorted to every system of interpolation even the following observations would be amended considerably were i to have deduced the elevation by observations of the boilingpoint at my camp and added the height of my camp either from the boilingpoint observations there or by barometer but i thought it better to select the most independent method of observation and to make the level of the sea at calcutta the only datum for a

for the computations such observations alone were selected as were comparable with contemporaneous ones taken at the calcutta observatory or as could by interpolation be reduced to these with considerable accuracy the calcutta temperatures have been assumed as those of the level of the sea and eighteen feet have been added for the height of the calcutta observatory above the sea i have introduced two standards of comparison where attainable namely 1 a few trigonometrical data chiefly of positions around dorjiling measured by lieutenantcolonel waugh the surveyorgeneral also a few measured by mr muller and myself in which we can put full confidence and 2 a number of elevations in sikkim and east nepal computed by simultaneous barometer observations taken by mr muller at dorjiling as the dorjiling barometer was in bad repair i do not place so much confidence in these comparisons as in those with calcutta the coincidence however between the mean of all the elevations computed by each method is very remarkable the difference amounting to only thirty feet in ninetythree elevations the excess being in favour of those worked by dorjiling as the dorjiling observations were generally taken at night or early in the morning when the temperature is below the mean of the day this excess in the resulting elevations would appear to prove that the temperature correction derived from assuming the calcutta observations to correspond with eighteen feet above the level of the sea at sikkim has not practically given rise to much error  i have not added the boilingpoint observations which afford a further means of testing the accuracy of the barometric computations and which will be found in section j of this appendix  the elevation of jillapahar is given as computed by observations taken in different months and at different hours of the day from which there will be seen that owing to the low temperature of sunrise in the one case and of january and october in the others the result for these times is always lowest  moat of the computations have been made by means of oltmanns tables as drawn up by lieutenantcolonel boileau and printed at the magnetic observatory simla very many were worked also by bessells tables in taylors scientific memoirs which however i found to give rather too high a result on the averages and i have therefore rejected most of them except in cases of great elevation and of remarkable humidity or dryness when the mean saturation point is an element that should not be disregarded in the computation to these the letter b is
