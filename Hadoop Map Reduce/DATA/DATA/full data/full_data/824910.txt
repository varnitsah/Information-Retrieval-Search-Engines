824910	the adventure of the devils foot   by  sir arthur conan doyle     in recording from time to time some of the curious experiences and interesting recollections which i associate with my long and intimate friendship with mr sherlock holmes i have continually been faced by difficulties caused by his own aversion to publicity  to his sombre and cynical spirit all popular applause was always abhorrent and nothing amused him more at the end of a successful case than to hand over the actual exposure to some orthodox official and to listen with a mocking smile to the general chorus of misplaced congratulation  it was indeed this attitude upon the part of my friend and certainly not any lack of interesting material which has caused me of late years to lay very few of my records before the public  my participation in some of his adventures was always a privilege which entailed discretion and reticence upon me  it was then with considerable surprise that i received a telegram from holmes last tuesdayhe has never been known to write where a telegram would servein the following terms  why not tell them of the cornish horrorstrangest case i have handled  i have no idea what backward sweep of memory had brought the matter fresh to his mind or what freak had caused him to desire that i should recount it but i hasten before another cancelling telegram may arrive to hunt out the notes which give me the exact details of the case and to lay the narrative before my readers  it was then in the spring of the year 1897 that holmess iron constitution showed some symptoms of giving way in the face of constant hard work of a most exacting kind aggravated perhaps by occasional indiscretions of his own  in march of that year dr moore agar of harley street whose dramatic introduction to holmes i may some day recount gave positive injunctions that the famous private agent lay aside all his cases and surrender himself to complete rest if he wished to avert an absolute breakdown  the state of his health was not a matter in which he himself took the faintest interest for his mental detachment was absolute but he was induced at last on the threat of being permanently disqualified from work to give himself a complete change of scene and air  thus it was that in the early spring of that year we found ourselves together in a small cottage near poldhu bay at the further extremity of the cornish peninsula  it was a singular spot and one peculiarly well suited to the grim humour of my patient  from the windows of our little whitewashed house which stood high upon a grassy headland we looked down upon the whole sinister semicircle of mounts bay that old death trap of sailing vessels with its fringe of black cliffs and surgeswept reefs on which innumerable seamen have met their end  with a northerly breeze it lies placid and sheltered inviting the stormtossed craft to tack into it for rest and protection  then come the sudden swirl round of the wind the blistering gale from the southwest the dragging anchor the lee shore and the last battle in the creaming breakers  the wise mariner stands far out from that evil place  on the land side our surroundings were as sombre as on the sea it was a country of rolling moors lonely and duncolored with an occasional church tower to mark the site of some oldworld village  in every direction upon these moors there were traces of some vanished race which had passed utterly away and left as its sole record strange monuments of stone irregular mounds which contained the burned ashes of the dead and curious earthworks which hinted at prehistoric strife the glamour and mystery of the place with its sinister atmosphere of forgotten nations appealed to the imagination of my friend and he spent much of his time in long walks and solitary meditations upon the moor the ancient cornish language had also arrested his attention and he had i remember conceived the idea that it was akin to the chaldean and had been largely derived from the phoenician traders in tin  he had received a consignment of books upon philology and was settling down to develop this thesis when suddenly to my sorrow and to his unfeigned delight we found ourselves even in that land of dreams plunged into a problem at our very doors which was more intense more engrossing and infinitely more mysterious than any of those which had driven us from london  our simple life and peaceful healthy routine were violently interrupted and we were precipitated into the midst of a series of events which caused the utmost excitement not only in cornwall but throughout the whole west of england many of my readers may retain some recollection of what was called at the time the cornish horror though a most imperfect account of the matter reached the london press now after thirteen years i will give the true details of this inconceivable affair to the public  i have said that scattered towers marked the villages which dotted this part of cornwall  the nearest of these was the hamlet of tredannick wollas where the cottages of a couple of hundred inhabitants clustered round an ancient mossgrown church  the vicar of the parish mr roundhay was something of an archaeologist and as such holmes had made his acquaintance he was a middleaged man portly and affable with a considerable fund of local lore  at his invitation we had taken tea at the vicarage and had come to know also mr mortimer tregennis an independent gentleman who increased the clergymans scanty resources by taking rooms in his large straggling house  the vicar being a bachelor was glad to come to such an arrangement though he had little in common with his lodger who was a thin dark spectacled man with a stoop which gave the impression of actual physical deformity  i remember that during our short visit we found the vicar garrulous but his lodger strangely reticent a sadfaced introspective man sitting with averted eyes brooding apparently upon his own affairs  these were the two men who entered abruptly into our little sittingroom on tuesday march the 16th shortly after our breakfast hour as we were smoking together preparatory to our daily excursion upon the moors  mr holmes said the vicar in an agitated voice the most extraordinary and tragic affair has occurred during the night it is the most unheardof business  we can only regard it as a special providence that you should chance to be here at the time for in all england you are the one man we need  i glared at the intrusive vicar with no very friendly eyes but holmes took his pipe from his lips and sat up in his chair like an old hound who hears the viewhalloa  he waved his hand to the sofa and our palpitating visitor with his agitated companion sat side by side upon it  mr mortimer tregennis was more selfcontained than the clergyman but the twitching of his thin hands and the brightness of his dark eyes showed that they shared a common emotion  shall i speak or you he asked of the vicar  well as you seem to have made the discovery whatever it may be and the vicar to have had it secondhand perhaps you had better do the speaking said holmes  i glanced at the hastily clad clergyman with the formally dressed lodger seated beside him and was amused at the surprise which holmess simple deduction had brought to their faces  perhaps i had best say a few words first said the vicar and then you can judge if you will listen to the details from mr tregennis or whether we should not hasten at once to the scene of this mysterious affair  i may explain then that our friend here spent last evening in the company of his two brothers owen and george and of his sister brenda at their house of tredannick wartha which is near the old stone cross upon the moor  he left them shortly after ten oclock playing cards round the diningroom table in excellent health and spirits this morning being an early riser he walked in that direction before breakfast and was overtaken by the carriage of dr richards who explained that he had just been sent for on a most urgent call to tredannick wartha  mr mortimer tregennis naturally went with him  when he arrived at tredannick wartha he found an extraordinary state of things  his two brothers and his sister were seated round the table exactly as he had left them the cards still spread in front of them and the candles burned down to their sockets  the sister lay back stonedead in her chair while the two brothers sat on each side of her laughing shouting and singing the senses stricken clean out of them all three of them the dead woman and the two demented men retained upon their faces an expression of the utmost horrora convulsion of terror which was dreadful to look upon  there was no sign of the presence of anyone in the house except mrs porter the old cook and housekeeper who declared that she had slept deeply and heard no sound during the night  nothing had been stolen or disarranged and there is absolutely no explanation of what the horror can be which has frightened a woman to death and two strong men out of their senses there is the situation mr holmes in a nutshell and if you can help us to clear it up you will have done a great work  i had hoped that in some way i could coax my companion back into the quiet which had been the object of our journey but one glance at his intense face and contracted eyebrows told me how vain was now the expectation  he sat for some little time in silence absorbed in the strange drama which had broken in upon our peace  i will look into this matter he said at last  on the face of it it would appear to be a case of a very exceptional nature have you been there yourself mr roundhay  no mr holmes  mr tregennis brought back the account to the vicarage and i at once hurried over with him to consult you  how far is it to the house where this singular tragedy occurred  about a mile inland  then we shall walk over together  but before we start i must ask you a few questions mr mortimer tregennis  the other had been silent all this time but i had observed that his more controlled excitement was even greater than the obtrusive emotion of the clergyman  he sat with a pale drawn face his anxious gaze fixed upon holmes and his thin hands clasped convulsively together his pale lips quivered as he listened to the dreadful experience which had befallen his family and his dark eyes seemed to reflect something of the horror of the scene  ask what you like mr holmes said he eagerly  it is a bad thing to speak of but i will answer you the truth  tell me about last night  well mr holmes i supped there as the vicar has said and my elder brother george proposed a game of whist afterwards  we sat down about nine oclock  it was a quarterpast ten when i moved to go  i left them all round the table as merry as could be  who let you out  mrs porter had gone to bed so i let myself out  i shut the hall door behind me  the window of the room in which they sat was closed but the blind was not drawn down  there was no change in door or window this morning or any reason to think that any stranger had been to the house  yet there they sat driven clean mad with terror and brenda lying dead of fright with her head hanging over the arm of the chair  ill never get the sight of that room out of my mind so long as i live  the facts as you state them are certainly most remarkable said holmes  i take it that you have no theory yourself which can in any way account for them  its devilish mr holmes devilish cried mortimer tregennis it is not of this world  something has come into that room which has dashed the light of reason from their minds  what human contrivance could do that  i fear said holmes that if the matter is beyond humanity it is certainly beyond me  yet we must exhaust all natural explanations before we fall back upon such a theory as this  as to yourself mr tregennis i take it you were divided in some way from your family since they lived together and you had rooms apart  that is so mr holmes though the matter is past and done with we were a family of tinminers at redruth but we sold our venture to a company and so retired with enough to keep us  i wont deny that there was some feeling about the division of the money and it stood between us for a time but it was all forgiven and forgotten and we were the best of friends together  looking back at the evening which you spent together does anything stand out in your memory as throwing any possible light upon the tragedy  think carefully mr tregennis for any clue which can help me  there is nothing at all sir  your people were in their usual spirits  never better  were they nervous people  did they ever show any apprehension of coming danger  nothing of the kind  you have nothing to add then which could assist me  mortimer tregennis considered earnestly for a moment  there is one thing occurs to me said he at last  as we sat at the table my back was to the window and my brother george he being my partner at cards was facing it  i saw him once look hard over my shoulder so i turned round and looked also  the blind was up and the window shut but i could just make out the bushes on the lawn and it seemed to me for a moment that i saw something moving among them  i couldnt even say if it was man or animal but i just thought there was something there  when i asked him what he was looking at he told me that he had the same feeling  that is all that i can say  did you not investigate  no the matter passed as unimportant  you left them then without any premonition of evil  none at all  i am not clear how you came to hear the news so early this morning  i am an early riser and generally take a walk before breakfast this morning i had hardly started when the doctor in his carriage overtook me  he told me that old mrs porter had sent a boy down with an urgent message  i sprang in beside him and we drove on when we got there we looked into that dreadful room  the candles and the fire must have burned out hours before and they had been sitting there in the dark until dawn had broken  the doctor said brenda must have been dead at least six hours  there were no signs of violence  she just lay across the arm of the chair with that look on her face  george and owen were singing snatches of songs and gibbering like two great apes  oh it was awful to see  i couldnt stand it and the doctor was as white as a sheet  indeed he fell into a chair in a sort of faint and we nearly had him on our hands as well  remarkablemost remarkable said holmes rising and taking his hat i think perhaps we had better go down to tredannick wartha without further delay  i confess that i have seldom known a case which at first sight presented a more singular problem   our proceedings of that first morning did little to advance the investigation  it was marked however at the outset by an incident which left the most sinister impression upon my mind the approach to the spot at which the tragedy occurred is down a narrow winding country lane  while we made our way along it we heard the rattle of a carriage coming towards us and stood aside to let it pass  as it drove by us i caught a glimpse through the closed window of a horribly contorted grinning face glaring out at us  those staring eyes and gnashing teeth flashed past us like a dreadful vision  my brothers cried mortimer tregennis white to his lips they are taking them to helston  we looked with horror after the black carriage lumbering upon its way then we turned our steps towards this illomened house in which they had met their strange fate  it was a large and bright dwelling rather a villa than a cottage with a considerable garden which was already in that cornish air well filled with spring flowers  towards this garden the window of the sittingroom fronted and from it according to mortimer tregennis must have come that thing of evil which had by sheer horror in a single instant blasted their minds  holmes walked slowly and thoughtfully among the flowerplots and along the path before we entered the porch so absorbed was he in his thoughts i remember that he stumbled over the wateringpot upset its contents and deluged both our feet and the garden path  inside the house we were met by the elderly cornish housekeeper mrs porter who with the aid of a young girl looked after the wants of the family  she readily answered all holmess questions  she had heard nothing in the night  her employers had all been in excellent spirits lately and she had never known them more cheerful and prosperous  she had fainted with horror upon entering the room in the morning and seeing that dreadful company round the table she had when she recovered thrown open the window to let the morning air in and had run down to the lane whence she sent a farmlad for the doctor  the lady was on her bed upstairs if we cared to see her it took four strong men to get the brothers into the asylum carriage she would not herself stay in the house another day and was starting that very afternoon to rejoin her family at st ives  we ascended the stairs and viewed the body  miss brenda tregennis had been a very beautiful girl though now verging upon middle age  her dark clearcut face was handsome even in death but there still lingered upon it something of that convulsion of horror which had been her last human emotion  from her bedroom we descended to the sittingroom where this strange tragedy had actually occurred  the charred ashes of the overnight fire lay in the grate  on the table were the four guttered and burnedout candles with the cards scattered over its surface  the chairs had been moved back against the walls but all else was as it had been the night before  holmes paced with light swift steps about the room he sat in the various chairs drawing them up and reconstructing their positions  he tested how much of the garden was visible he examined the floor the ceiling and the fireplace but never once did i see that sudden brightening of his eyes and tightening of his lips which would have told me that he saw some gleam of light in this utter darkness  why a fire he asked once  had they always a fire in this small room on a spring evening  mortimer tregennis explained that the night was cold and damp for that reason after his arrival the fire was lit  what are you going to do now mr holmes he asked  my friend smiled and laid his hand upon my arm  i think watson that i shall resume that course of tobaccopoisoning which you have so often and so justly condemned said he  with your permission gentlemen we will now return to our cottage for i am not aware that any new factor is likely to come to our notice here  i will turn the facts over in my mind mr tregennis and should anything occur to me i will certainly communicate with you and the vicar  in the meantime i wish you both goodmorning  it was not until long after we were back in poldhu cottage that holmes broke his complete and absorbed silence  he sat coiled in his armchair his haggard and ascetic face hardly visible amid the blue swirl of his tobacco smoke his black brows drawn down his forehead contracted his eyes vacant and far away  finally he laid down his pipe and sprang to his feet  it wont do watson said he with a laugh  let us walk along the cliffs together and search for flint arrows  we are more likely to find them than clues to this problem  to let the brain work without sufficient material is like racing an engine  it racks itself to pieces  the sea air sunshine and patience watsonall else will come  now let us calmly define our position watson he continued as we skirted the cliffs together  let us get a firm grip of the very little which we do know so that when fresh facts arise we may be ready to fit them into their places  i take it in the first place that neither of us is prepared to admit diabolical intrusions into the affairs of men  let us begin by ruling that entirely out of our minds very good  there remain three persons who have been grievously stricken by some conscious or unconscious human agency  that is firm ground  now when did this occur  evidently assuming his narrative to be true it was immediately after mr mortimer tregennis had left the room  that is a very important point  the presumption is that it was within a few minutes afterwards  the cards still lay upon the table it was already past their usual hour for bed  yet they had not changed their position or pushed back their chairs  i repeat then that the occurrence was immediately after his departure and not later than eleven oclock last night  our next obvious step is to check so far as we can the movements of mortimer tregennis after he left the room  in this there is no difficulty and they seem to be above suspicion knowing my methods as you do you were of course conscious of the somewhat clumsy waterpot expedient by which i obtained a clearer impress of his foot than might otherwise have been possible  the wet sandy path took it admirably last night was also wet you will remember and it was not difficulthaving obtained a sample printto pick out his track among others and to follow his movements  he appears to have walked away swiftly in the direction of the vicarage  if then mortimer tregennis disappeared from the scene and yet some outside person affected the cardplayers how can we reconstruct that person and how was such an impression of horror conveyed  mrs porter may be eliminated  she is evidently harmless  is there any evidence that someone crept up to the garden window and in some manner produced so terrific an effect that he drove those who saw it out of their senses  the only suggestion in this direction comes from mortimer tregennis himself who says that his brother spoke about some movement in the garden  that is certainly remarkable as the night was rainy cloudy and dark  anyone who had the design to alarm these people would be compelled to place his very face against the glass before he could be seen  there is a threefoot flowerborder outside this window but no indication of a footmark  it is difficult to imagine then how an outsider could have made so terrible an impression upon the company nor have we found any possible motive for so strange and elaborate an attempt  you perceive our difficulties watson  they are only too clear i answered with conviction  and yet with a little more material we may prove that they are not insurmountable said holmes  i fancy that among your extensive archives watson you may find some which were nearly as obscure meanwhile we shall put the case aside until more accurate data are available and devote the rest of our morning to the pursuit of neolithic man  i may have commented upon my friends power of mental detachment but never have i wondered at it more than upon that spring morning in cornwall when for two hours he discoursed upon celts arrowheads and shards as lightly as if no sinister mystery were waiting for his solution  it was not until we had returned in the afternoon to our cottage that we found a visitor awaiting us who soon brought our minds back to the matter in hand  neither of us needed to be told who that visitor was  the huge body the craggy and deeply seamed face with the fierce eyes and hawklike nose the grizzled hair which nearly brushed our cottage ceiling the beardgolden at the fringes and white near the lips save for the nicotine stain from his perpetual cigarall these were as well known in london as in africa and could only be associated with the tremendous personality of dr leon sterndale the great lionhunter and explorer  we had heard of his presence in the district and had once or twice caught sight of his tall figure upon the moorland paths he made no advances to us however nor would we have dreamed of doing so to him as it was well known that it was his love of seclusion which caused him to spend the greater part of the intervals between his journeys in a small bungalow buried in the lonely wood of beauchamp arriance  here amid his books and his maps he lived an absolutely lonely life attending to his own simple wants and paying little apparent heed to the affairs of his neighbours  it was a surprise to me therefore to hear him asking holmes in an eager voice whether he had made any advance in his reconstruction of this mysterious episode  the county police are utterly at fault said he but perhaps your wider experience has suggested some conceivable explanation  my only claim to being taken into your confidence is that during my many residences here i have come to know this family of tregennis very wellindeed upon my cornish mothers side i could call them cousinsand their strange fate has naturally been a great shock to me  i may tell you that i had got as far as plymouth upon my way to africa but the news reached me this morning and i came straight back again to help in the inquiry  holmes raised his eyebrows  did you lose your boat through it  i will take the next  dear me that is friendship indeed  i tell you they were relatives  quite socousins of your mother  was your baggage aboard the ship  some of it but the main part at the hotel  i see  but surely this event could not have found its way into the plymouth morning papers  no sir i had a telegram  might i ask from whom  a shadow passed over the gaunt face of the explorer  you are very inquisitive mr holmes  it is my business  with an effort dr sterndale recovered his ruffled composure  i have no objection to telling you he said  it was mr roundhay the vicar who sent me the telegram which recalled me  thank you said holmes  i may say in answer to your original question that i have not cleared my mind entirely on the subject of this case but that i have every hope of reaching some conclusion  it would be premature to say more  perhaps you would not mind telling me if your suspicions point in any particular direction  no i can hardly answer that  then i have wasted my time and need not prolong my visit  the famous doctor strode out of our cottage in considerable illhumour and within five minutes holmes had followed him  i saw him no more until the evening when he returned with a slow step and haggard face which assured me that he had made no great progress with his investigation he glanced at a telegram which awaited him and threw it into the grate  from the plymouth hotel watson he said  i learned the name of it from the vicar and i wired to make certain that dr leon sterndales account was true  it appears that he did indeed spend last night there and that he has actually allowed some of his baggage to go on to africa while he returned to be present at this investigation  what do you make of that watson  he is deeply interested  deeply interestedyes  there is a thread here which we had not yet grasped and which might lead us through the tangle  cheer up watson for i am very sure that our material has not yet all come to hand when it does we may soon leave our difficulties behind us  little did i think how soon the words of holmes would be realized or how strange and sinister would be that new development which opened up an entirely fresh line of investigation  i was shaving at my window in the morning when i heard the rattle of hoofs and looking up saw a dogcart coming at a gallop down the road  it pulled up at our door and our friend the vicar sprang from it and rushed up our garden path holmes was already dressed and we hastened down to meet him  our visitor was so excited that he could hardly articulate but at last in gasps and bursts his tragic story came out of him  we are devilridden mr holmes  my poor parish is devilridden he cried  satan himself is loose in it  we are given over into his hands  he danced about in his agitation a ludicrous object if it were not for his ashy face and startled eyes  finally he shot out his terrible news  mr mortimer tregennis died during the night and with exactly the same symptoms as the rest of his family  holmes sprang to his feet all energy in an instant  can you fit us both into your dogcart  yes i can  then watson we will postpone our breakfast  mr roundhay we are entirely at your disposal  hurryhurry before things get disarranged  the lodger occupied two rooms at the vicarage which were in an angle by themselves the one above the other  below was a large sittingroom above his bedroom  they looked out upon a croquet lawn which came up to the windows  we had arrived before the doctor or the police so that everything was absolutely undisturbed  let me describe exactly the scene as we saw it upon that misty march morning  it has left an impression which can never be effaced from my mind  the atmosphere of the room was of a horrible and depressing stuffiness the servant who had first entered had thrown up the window or it would have been even more intolerable  this might partly be due to the fact that a lamp stood flaring and smoking on the centre table  beside it sat the dead man leaning back in his chair his thin beard projecting his spectacles pushed up on to his forehead and his lean dark face turned towards the window and twisted into the same distortion of terror which had marked the features of his dead sister  his limbs were convulsed and his fingers contorted as though he had died in a very paroxysm of fear  he was fully clothed though there were signs that his dressing had been done in a hurry  we had already learned that his bed had been slept in and that the tragic end had come to him in the early morning  one realized the redhot energy which underlay holmess phlegmatic exterior when one saw the sudden change which came over him from the moment that he entered the fatal apartment  in an instant he was tense and alert his eyes shining his face set his limbs quivering with eager activity  he was out on the lawn in through the window round the room and up into the bedroom for all the world like a dashing foxhound drawing a cover  in the bedroom he made a rapid cast around and ended by throwing open the window which appeared to give him some fresh cause for excitement for he leaned out of it with loud ejaculations of interest and delight  then he rushed down the stair out through the open window threw himself upon his face on the lawn sprang up and into the room once more all with the energy of the hunter who is at the very heels of his quarry  the lamp which was an ordinary standard he examined with minute care making certain measurements upon its bowl  he carefully scrutinized with his lens the talc shield which covered the top of the chimney and scraped off some ashes which adhered to its upper surface putting some of them into an envelope which he placed in his pocketbook  finally just as the doctor and the official police put in an appearance he beckoned to the vicar and we all three went out upon the lawn  i am glad to say that my investigation has not been entirely barren he remarked  i cannot remain to discuss the matter with the police but i should be exceedingly obliged mr roundhay if you would give the inspector my compliments and direct his attention to the bedroom window and to the sittingroom lamp  each is suggestive and together they are almost conclusive  if the police would desire further information i shall be happy to see any of them at the cottage  and now watson i think that perhaps we shall be better employed elsewhere  it may be that the police resented the intrusion of an amateur or that they imagined themselves to be upon some hopeful line of investigation but it is certain that we heard nothing from them for the next two days  during this time holmes spent some of his time smoking and dreaming in the cottage but a greater portion in country walks which he undertook alone returning after many hours without remark as to where he had been  one experiment served to show me the line of his investigation  he had bought a lamp which was the duplicate of the one which had burned in the room of mortimer tregennis on the morning of the tragedy  this he filled with the same oil as that used at the vicarage and he carefully timed the period which it would take to be exhausted another experiment which he made was of a more unpleasant nature and one which i am not likely ever to forget  you will remember watson he remarked one afternoon that there is a single common point of resemblance in the varying reports which have reached us  this concerns the effect of the atmosphere of the room in each case upon those who had first entered it  you will recollect that mortimer tregennis in describing the episode of his last visit to his brothers house remarked that the doctor on entering the room fell into a chair you had forgotten  well i can answer for it that it was so now you will remember also that mrs porter the housekeeper told us that she herself fainted upon entering the room and had afterwards opened the window  in the second casethat of mortimer tregennis himselfyou cannot have forgotten the horrible stuffiness of the room when we arrived though the servant had thrown open the window  that servant i found upon inquiry was so ill that she had gone to her bed you will admit watson that these facts are very suggestive  in each case there is evidence of a poisonous atmosphere  in each case also there is combustion going on in the roomin the one case a fire in the other a lamp  the fire was needed but the lamp was litas a comparison of the oil consumed will showlong after it was broad daylight  why  surely because there is some connection between three thingsthe burning the stuffy atmosphere and finally the madness or death of those unfortunate people  that is clear is it not  it would appear so  at least we may accept it as a working hypothesis  we will suppose then that something was burned in each case which produced an atmosphere causing strange toxic effects  very good in the first instancethat of the tregennis familythis substance was placed in the fire  now the window was shut but the fire would naturally carry fumes to some extent up the chimney  hence one would expect the effects of the poison to be less than in the second case where there was less escape for the vapour  the result seems to indicate that it was so since in the first case only the woman who had presumably the more sensitive organism was killed the others exhibiting that temporary or permanent lunacy which is evidently the first effect of the drug  in the second case the result was complete  the facts therefore seem to bear out the theory of a poison which worked by combustion  with this train of reasoning in my head i naturally looked about in mortimer tregenniss room to find some remains of this substance  the obvious place to look was the talc shelf or smokeguard of the lamp there sure enough i perceived a number of flaky ashes and round the edges a fringe of brownish powder which had not yet been consumed half of this i took as you saw and i placed it in an envelope  why half holmes  it is not for me my dear watson to stand in the way of the official police force  i leave them all the evidence which i found  the poison still remained upon the talc had they the wit to find it  now watson we will light our lamp we will however take the precaution to open our window to avoid the premature decease of two deserving members of society and you will seat yourself near that open window in an armchair unless like a sensible man you determine to have nothing to do with the affair  oh you will see it out will you  i thought i knew my watson  this chair i will place opposite yours so that we may be the same distance from the poison and face to face  the door we will leave ajar  each is now in a position to watch the other and to bring the experiment to an end should the symptoms seem alarming  is that all clear  well then i take our powderor what remains of itfrom the envelope and i lay it above the burning lamp  so  now watson let us sit down and await developments  they were not long in coming  i had hardly settled in my chair before i was conscious of a thick musky odour subtle and nauseous  at the very first whiff of it my brain and my imagination were beyond all control  a thick black cloud swirled before my eyes and my mind told me that in this cloud unseen as yet but about to spring out upon my appalled senses lurked all that was vaguely horrible all that was monstrous and inconceivably wicked in the universe  vague shapes swirled and swam amid the dark cloudbank each a menace and a warning of something coming the advent of some unspeakable dweller upon the threshold whose very shadow would blast my soul  a freezing horror took possession of me  i felt that my hair was rising that my eyes were protruding that my mouth was opened and my tongue like leather the turmoil within my brain was such that something must surely snap i tried to scream and was vaguely aware of some hoarse croak which was my own voice but distant and detached from myself  at the same moment in some effort of escape i broke through that cloud of despair and had a glimpse of holmess face white rigid and drawn with horrorthe very look which i had seen upon the features of the dead  it was that vision which gave me an instant of sanity and of strength  i dashed from my chair threw my arms round holmes and together we lurched through the door and an instant afterwards had thrown ourselves down upon the grass plot and were lying side by side conscious only of the glorious sunshine which was bursting its way through the hellish cloud of terror which had girt us in slowly it rose from our souls like the mists from a landscape until peace and reason had returned and we were sitting upon the grass wiping our clammy foreheads and looking with apprehension at each other to mark the last traces of that terrific experience which we had undergone  upon my word watson said holmes at last with an unsteady voice i owe you both my thanks and an apology  it was an unjustifiable experiment even for ones self and doubly so for a friend  i am really very sorry  you know i answered with some emotion for i have never seen so much of holmess heart before that it is my greatest joy and privilege to help you  he relapsed at once into the halfhumorous halfcynical vein which was his habitual attitude to those about him  it would be superfluous to drive us mad my dear watson said he  a candid observer would certainly declare that we were so already before we embarked upon so wild an experiment  i confess that i never imagined that the effect could be so sudden and so severe  he dashed into the cottage and reappearing with the burning lamp held at full arms length he threw it among a bank of brambles we must give the room a little time to clear  i take it watson that you have no longer a shadow of a doubt as to how these tragedies were produced  none whatever  but the cause remains as obscure as before  come into the arbour here and let us discuss it together  that villainous stuff seems still to linger round my throat  i think we must admit that all the evidence points to this man mortimer tregennis having been the criminal in the first tragedy though he was the victim in the second one  we must remember in the first place that there is some story of a family quarrel followed by a reconciliation  how bitter that quarrel may have been or how hollow the reconciliation we cannot tell   when i think of mortimer tregennis with the foxy face and the small shrewd beady eyes behind the spectacles he is not a man whom i should judge to be of a particularly forgiving disposition well in the next place you will remember that this idea of someone moving in the garden which took our attention for a moment from the real cause of the tragedy emanated from him  he had a motive in misleading us  finally if he did not throw the substance into the fire at the moment of leaving the room who did do so  the affair happened immediately after his departure had anyone else come in the family would certainly have risen from the table  besides in peaceful cornwall visitors did not arrive after ten oclock at night  we may take it then that all the evidence points to mortimer tregennis as the culprit  then his own death was suicide  well watson it is on the face of it a not impossible supposition the man who had the guilt upon his soul of having brought such a fate upon his own family might well be driven by remorse to inflict it upon himself  there are however some cogent reasons against it fortunately there is one man in england who knows all about it and i have made arrangements by which we shall hear the facts this afternoon from his own lips ah he is a little before his time  perhaps you would kindly step this way dr leon sterndale we have been conducing a chemical experiment indoors which has left our little room hardly fit for the reception of so distinguished a visitor  i had heard the click of the garden gate and now the majestic figure of the great african explorer appeared upon the path  he turned in some surprise towards the rustic arbour in which we sat  you sent for me mr holmes  i had your note about an hour ago and i have come though i really do not know why i should obey your summons  perhaps we can clear the point up before we separate said holmes meanwhile i am much obliged to you for your courteous acquiescence you will excuse this informal reception in the open air but my friend watson and i have nearly furnished an additional chapter to what the papers call the cornish horror and we prefer a clear atmosphere for the present  perhaps since the matters which we have to discuss will affect you personally in a very intimate fashion it is as well that we should talk where there can be no eavesdropping  the explorer took his cigar from his lips and gazed sternly at my companion  i am at a loss to know sir he said what you can have to speak about which affects me personally in a very intimate fashion  the killing of mortimer tregennis said holmes  for a moment i wished that i were armed  sterndales fierce face turned to a dusky red his eyes glared and the knotted passionate veins started out in his forehead while he sprang forward with clenched hands towards my companion  then he stopped and with a violent effort he resumed a cold rigid calmness which was perhaps more suggestive of danger than his hotheaded outburst  i have lived so long among savages and beyond the law said he that i have got into the way of being a law to myself  you would do well mr holmes not to forget it for i have no desire to do you an injury  nor have i any desire to do you an injury dr sterndale surely the clearest proof of it is that knowing what i know i have sent for you and not for the police  sterndale sat down with a gasp overawed for perhaps the first time in his adventurous life  there was a calm assurance of power in holmess manner which could not be withstood  our visitor stammered for a moment his great hands opening and shutting in his agitation  what do you mean he asked at last  if this is bluff upon your part mr holmes you have chosen a bad man for your experiment let us have no more beating about the bush  what do you mean  i will tell you said holmes and the reason why i tell you is that i hope frankness may beget frankness  what my next step may be will depend entirely upon the nature of your own defence  my defence  yes sir  my defence against what  against the charge of killing mortimer tregennis  sterndale mopped his forehead with his handkerchief  upon my word you are getting on said he  do all your successes depend upon this prodigious power of bluff  the bluff said holmes sternly is upon your side dr leon sterndale and not upon mine  as a proof i will tell you some of the facts upon which my conclusions are based  of your return from plymouth allowing much of your property to go on to africa i will say nothing save that it first informed me that you were one of the factors which had to be taken into account in reconstructing this drama  i came back  i have heard your reasons and regard them as unconvincing and inadequate  we will pass that  you came down here to ask me whom i suspected  i refused to answer you you then went to the vicarage waited outside it for some time and finally returned to your cottage  how do you know that  i followed you  i saw no one  that is what you may expect to see when i follow you  you spent a restless night at your cottage and you formed certain plans which in the early morning you proceeded to put into execution leaving your door just as day was breaking you filled your pocket with some reddish gravel that was lying heaped beside your gate  sterndale gave a violent start and looked at holmes in amazement  you then walked swiftly for the mile which separated you from the vicarage  you were wearing i may remark the same pair of ribbed tennis shoes which are at the present moment upon your feet  at the vicarage you passed through the orchard and the side hedge coming out under the window of the lodger tregennis it was now daylight but the household was not yet stirring  you drew some of the gravel from your pocket and you threw it up at the window above you  sterndale sprang to his feet  i believe that you are the devil himself he cried  holmes smiled at the compliment  it took two or possibly three handfuls before the lodger came to the window  you beckoned him to come down  he dressed hurriedly and descended to his sittingroom you entered by the window  there was an interviewa short oneduring which you walked up and down the room  then you passed out and closed the window standing on the lawn outside smoking a cigar and watching what occurred finally after the death of tregennis you withdrew as you had come  now dr sterndale how do you justify such conduct and what were the motives for your actions  if you prevaricate or trifle with me i give you my assurance that the matter will pass out of my hands forever  our visitors face had turned ashen gray as he listened to the words of his accuser  now he sat for some time in thought with his face sunk in his hands  then with a sudden impulsive gesture he plucked a photograph from his breastpocket and threw it on the rustic table before us  that is why i have done it said he  it showed the bust and face of a very beautiful woman  holmes stooped over it  brenda tregennis said he  yes brenda tregennis repeated our visitor  for years i have loved her  for years she has loved me  there is the secret of that cornish seclusion which people have marvelled at  it has brought me close to the one thing on earth that was dear to me i could not marry her for i have a wife who has left me for years and yet whom by the deplorable laws of england i could not divorce  for years brenda waited  for years i waited  and this is what we have waited for  a terrible sob shook his great frame and he clutched his throat under his brindled beard  then with an effort he mastered himself and spoke on  the vicar knew  he was in our confidence  he would tell you that she was an angel upon earth  that was why he telegraphed to me and i returned  what was my baggage or africa to me when i learned that such a fate had come upon my darling  there you have the missing clue to my action mr holmes  proceed said my friend  dr sterndale drew from his pocket a paper packet and laid it upon the table  on the outside was written radix pedis diaboli with a red poison label beneath it  he pushed it towards me  i understand that you are a doctor sir  have you ever heard of this preparation  devilsfoot root  no i have never heard of it  it is no reflection upon your professional knowledge said he for i believe that save for one sample in a laboratory at buda there is no other specimen in europe  it has not yet found its way either into the pharmacopoeia or into the literature of toxicology  the root is shaped like a foot half human half goatlike hence the fanciful name given by a botanical missionary  it is used as an ordeal poison by the medicinemen in certain districts of west africa and is kept as a secret among them  this particular specimen i obtained under very extraordinary circumstances in the ubangi country  he opened the paper as he spoke and disclosed a heap of reddishbrown snufflike powder  well sir asked holmes sternly  i am about to tell you mr holmes all that actually occurred for you already know so much that it is clearly to my interest that you should know all  i have already explained the relationship in which i stood to the tregennis family for the sake of the sister i was friendly with the brothers  there was a family quarrel about money which estranged this man mortimer but it was supposed to be made up and i afterwards met him as i did the others  he was a sly subtle scheming man and several things arose which gave me a suspicion of him but i had no cause for any positive quarrel  one day only a couple of weeks ago he came down to my cottage and i showed him some of my african curiosities  among other things i exhibited this powder and i told him of its strange properties how it stimulates those brain centres which control the emotion of fear and how either madness or death is the fate of the unhappy native who is subjected to the ordeal by the priest of his tribe  i told him also how powerless european science would be to detect it  how he took it i cannot say for i never left the room but there is no doubt that it was then while i was opening cabinets and stooping to boxes that he managed to abstract some of the devilsfoot root  i well remember how he plied me with questions as to the amount and the time that was needed for its effect but i little dreamed that he could have a personal reason for asking  i thought no more of the matter until the vicars telegram reached me at plymouth  this villain had thought that i would be at sea before the news could reach me and that i should be lost for years in africa but i returned at once  of course i could not listen to the details without feeling assured that my poison had been used  i came round to see you on the chance that some other explanation had suggested itself to you  but there could be none  i was convinced that mortimer tregennis was the murderer that for the sake of money and with the idea perhaps that if the other members of his family were all insane he would be the sole guardian of their joint property he had used the devilsfoot powder upon them driven two of them out of their senses and killed his sister brenda the one human being whom i have ever loved or who has ever loved me  there was his crime what was to be his punishment  should i appeal to the law  where were my proofs  i knew that the facts were true but could i help to make a jury of countrymen believe so fantastic a story  i might or i might not but i could not afford to fail  my soul cried out for revenge i have said to you once before mr holmes that i have spent much of my life outside the law and that i have come at last to be a law to myself  so it was even now  i determined that the fate which he had given to others should be shared by himself either that or i would do justice upon him with my own hand  in all england there can be no man who sets less value upon his own life than i do at the present moment  now i have told you all  you have yourself supplied the rest i did as you say after a restless night set off early from my cottage  i foresaw the difficulty of arousing him so i gathered some gravel from the pile which you have mentioned and i used it to throw up to his window  he came down and admitted me through the window of the sittingroom  i laid his offence before him i told him that i had come both as judge and executioner  the wretch sank into a chair paralyzed at the sight of my revolver i lit the lamp put the powder above it and stood outside the window ready to carry out my threat to shoot him should he try to leave the room  in five minutes he died my god how he died  but my heart was flint for he endured nothing which my innocent darling had not felt before him  there is my story mr holmes  perhaps if you loved a woman you would have done as much yourself  at any rate i am in your hands  you can take what steps you like  as i have already said there is no man living who can fear death less than i do  holmes sat for some little time in silence  what were your plans he asked at last  i had intended to bury myself in central africa  my work there is but half finished  go and do the other half said holmes  i at least am not prepared to prevent you  dr sterndale raised his giant figure bowed gravely and walked from the arbour  holmes lit his pipe and handed me his pouch  some fumes which are not poisonous would be a welcome change said he  i think you must agree watson that it is not a case in which we are called upon to interfere  our investigation has been independent and our action shall be so also  you would not denounce the man  certainly not i answered  i have never loved watson but if i did and if the woman i loved had met such an end i might act even as our lawless lionhunter has done who knows  well watson i will not offend your intelligence by explaining what is obvious  the gravel upon the windowsill was of course the startingpoint of my research  it was unlike anything in the vicarage garden  only when my attention had been drawn to dr sterndale and his cottage did i find its counterpart  the lamp shining in broad daylight and the remains of powder upon the shield were successive links in a fairly obvious chain  and now my dear watson i think we may dismiss the matter from our mind and go back with a clear conscience to the study of those chaldean roots which are surely to be traced in the cornish branch of the great celtic speech
