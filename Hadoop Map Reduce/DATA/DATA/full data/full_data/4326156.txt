literary remains of george boon                        appropriate to the times                        prepared for publication by                             reginald bliss              author of the

another and mr fisher unwin is no exception to the rule nobody reads introductions they serve no useful purpose and they give no pleasure but they appeal to the business mind i think because as a rule they cost nothing at any rate by the pressure of a certain inseparable intimacy between mr reginald bliss and myself this introduction has been extracted from me i will confess that i have not read his book through though i have a kind of firsthand knowledge of its contents and that it seems to me an indiscreet illadvised book  i have a very strong suspicion that this introduction idea is designed to entangle me in the responsibility for the book in america at any rate the life of george meek bath chairman was ascribed to me upon no better evidence yet any one who likes may go to eastbourne and find meek with chair and all complete but in view of the complications of the book market and the large simplicities of the public mind i do hope that the readerand by that i mean the reviewerwill be able to see the reasonableness and the necessity of distinguishing between me and mr reginald bliss i do not wish to escape the penalties of thus participating in and endorsing his manifest breaches of good taste literary decorum and friendly obligation but as a writer whose reputation is already too crowded and confused and who is for the ordinary purposes of every day known mainly as a novelist i should be glad if i could escape the public identification i am now repudiating bliss is bliss and wells is wells and bliss can write all sorts of things that wells could not do  this introduction has really no more to say than that                                                        h g wells     contents     introduction  chapter the first the back of miss bathwick and

miss bathwick and george boon   ยง 1  it is quite probable that the reader does not know of the death of george boon and that remains before his name upon the titlepage will be greeted with a certain astonishment in the ordinary course of things before the explosion of the war the death of george boon would have been an eventoh a threequarters of a column or more in the times event and articles in the monthlies and reminiscences as it is he is not so much dead as missing something happened at the eleventh houri think it was chiefly the admiralty report of the fight off the falkland islandsthat blew his obituary notices clean out of the papers and yet he was one of our most popular writers and in america i am told he was in the hundred thousand class but now we think only of lord kitcheners hundred thousands  it is no good pretending about it the war has ended all that boon died with his age after the war there will be a new sort of booktrade and a crop of new writers and a fresh tone and everything will be different this is an obituary of more than george boon i regard the outlook with profound dismay i try to keep my mind off it by drilling with the shrewsbury last line of volunteers and training down the excrescences of my physical style when the war is over will be time enough to consider the prospects of a superannuated man of letters we national volunteers are now no mere soldiers on paper we have fairly washable badges by way of uniform we have bought ourselves dummy rifles we have persuaded the war office to give us a reluctant recognition on the distinct understanding that we have neither officers nor authority in the event of an invasion i understand we are to mobilize and  do quite a number of useful things but until there is an invasion in actual progress nothing is to be decided more precisely than what this whiff of printers shrapnel these four full stops conveys   ยง 2  i must confess i was monstrously disappointed when at last i could get my hands into those barrels in the attic in which boon had stored his secret writings there was more perhaps than i had expected i do not complain of the quantity but of the disorder the incompleteness the want of discipline and forethought  boon had talked so often and so convincingly of these secret books he was writing he had alluded so frequently to this or that great project he would begin so airily with in the seventeenth chapter of my wild asses of the devil or i have been recasting the third part of our mind of the race that it came as an enormous shock to me to find there was no seventeenth chapter there was not even a completed first chapter to the former work and as for the latter there seems nothing really finished or settled at all beyond the fragments i am now issuing except a series of sketches of lord rosebery for the most part in a toga and a wreath engaged in a lettered retirement at his villa at epsom and labelled patrician dignity the last phasesketches i suppress as of no present interestand a complete gallery of imaginary portraits with several duplicates of the academic committee that has done so much for british literature the polignac prize for example and sir henry newbolts professorship in the last four or five years so incredulous was i that this was all that i pushed my inquiries from their original field in the attic into other parts of the house pushed them indeed to the very verge of ransacking and in that i greatly deepened the want of sympathy already separating me from mrs boon but i was stung by a thwarted sense of duty and quite resolved that no illadvised interference should stand between me and the publication of what boon has always represented to me as the most intimate productions of his mind  yet now the first rush of executorial emotion is over i can begin to doubt about boons intention in making me his literary executor did he after all intend these pencilled scraps these marginal caricatures andwhat seems to me most objectionableannotated letters from harmless prominent people for publication or was his selection of me his last effort to prolong what was i think if one of the slightest one also of the most sustained interests of his life and that was a prolonged faint jeering at my expense because alwaysit was never hidden from mein his most earnest moments boon jeered at me i do not know why he jeered at me it was always rather pointless jeering and far below his usual level but jeer he did even while we talked most earnestly and brewed our most intoxicating draughts of project and conviction there was always this scarce perceptible blossom and flavour of ridicule floating like a drowning sprig of blue borage in the cup his was indeed essentially one of those suspended minds that float above the will and action when at last reality could be evaded no longer it killed him he never really believed nor felt the urgent need that goads my more accurate nature to believe and do always when i think of us together i feel that i am on my legs and that he sits about and yet he could tell me things i sought to know prove what i sought to believe shape beliefs to a conviction in me that i alone could never attain  he took life as it came let his fancy play upon it selected elucidated ignored threw the result in jest or observation or elaborate mystification at us and would have no more of it he would be earnest for a time and then break away the last trump is quite typical of the way in which he would turn upon himself it sets out so straight for magnificence it breaks off so abominably you will read it  yet he took things more seriously than he seemed to do  this war i repeat killed him he could not escape it it bore him down he did his best to disregard it but its worst stresses caught him in the climax of a struggle with a fit of pneumonia brought on by a freak of bathing by moonlightin an english october a thing he did to distract his mind from the tension after the marneand it destroyed him the last news they told him was that the germans had made their shoot and scuttle raid upon whitby and scarborough there was much circumstantial description in the mornings paper they had smashed up a number of houses and killed some hundreds of people chiefly women and children ten little children had been killed or mutilated in a bunch on their way to school two old ladies at a boardinghouse had had their legs smashed and so on  take this newspaper he said and held it out to his nurse take it he repeated irritably and shook it at her  he stared at it as it receded then he seemed to be staring at distant things  wild asses of the devil he said at last oh wild asses of the devil i thought somehow it was a joke it wasnt a joke there they are and the world is theirs  and he turned his face to the wall and never spoke again   ยง 3  but before i go on it is necessary to explain that the george boon i speak of is not exactly the same person as the george boon the great writer whose fame has reached to every bookshop in the world the same bodily presence perhaps they had but that is all except when he chose to allude to them those great works on which that great fame rests those books and plays of his that have made him a household word in half a dozen continents those books with their style as perfect and obvious as the gloss upon a new silk hat with their flat narrative trajectory that nothing could turn aside their unsubdued and apparently unsubduable healthy note their unavoidable humour and their robust pathos never came between us we talked perpetually of literature and creative projects but never of that output of his we talked as men must talk who talk at all with an untrammelled freedom now we were sublime and now curious now we pursued subtleties and now we were utterly trivial but always it was in an undisciplined irregular style quite unsuitable for publication that indeed was the whole effect of the george boon i am now trying to convey that he was indeed essentially not for publication and this effect was in no degree diminished by the fact that the photograph of his beautiful castellated house and of that extraordinarily irrelevant person mrs boonfor i must speak my mind of herand of her two dogs binkie and chum whom he detested were so to speak the poulet and salade in the menu of every illustrated magazine  the fact of it is he was one of those people who will not photograph so much of him was movement gesture expression atmosphere and colour and so little of him was form his was the exact converse of that semimineral physical quality that men call handsome and now that his career has come to its sad truncation i see no reason why i should further conceal the secret of the clear emphatic solid impression he made upon all who had not met him it was indeed a very simple secret  he never wrote anything for his public with his own hand  he did this of set intention he distrusted a certain freakishness of his fingertips that he thought might have injured him with his multitudinous master he knew his holograph manuscript would certainly get him into trouble he employed a lady the lady who figures in his will miss bathwick as his amanuensis in miss bathwick was all his security she was a large cool freshcoloured permanently young lady full of serious enthusiasms she had been faultlessly educated in a girls high school of a not too modern type and she regarded boon with an invincible respect she wrote down his sentences spelling without blemish in all the european languages as they came from his lips with the aid of a bright efficient newlooking typewriter if he used a rare word or a whimsical construction she would say i beg your pardon mr boon and he would at once correct it and if by any lapse of an always rather too nimble imagination he carried his thoughts into regions outside the tastes and interests of that enormous antebellum public it was his fortune to please then according to the nature of his divagation she would either cough or sigh orin certain eventualitiesget up and leave the room  by this ingenious deviceif one may be permitted to use the expression for so pleasant and trustworthy an assistanthe did to a large extent free himself from the haunting dread of losing his public by some eccentricity of behaviour some quirk of thought or fluctuation of attitude that has pursued him ever since the great success of captain clayball a book he wrote to poke fun at the crude imaginings of a particularly stupid schoolboy he liked had put him into the forefront of our literary world   ยง 4  he had a peculiar and i think a groundless terror of the public of the united states of america from which country he derived the larger moiety of his income in spite of our remonstrances he subscribed to the new york nation to the very end and he insisted in spite of fact reason and my earnest entreaties having regard to the future unification of the englishspeaking race in figuring that continental empire as a vain garrulous and prosperous female of uncertain age and still more uncertain temper with unfounded pretensions to intellectuality and an ideal of refinement of the most negative description entirely on the strength of that one sample one might as well judge england by the spectator my protests seemed only to intensify his zest in his personification of columbia as the aunt errant of christendom as a wild sentimental and advanced maiden lady of inconceivable courage and enterprise whom everything might offend and nothing cow i know he used to say something will be said or done and shell have hysterics the temptation to smuggle something through miss bathwicks back is getting almost too much for me i could you know or some one will come along with something a little harder and purer and emptier and more emphatically handsome than i can hope to do i shall lose her one of these days how can i hope to keep for ever that proud and fickle heart  and then i remember he suddenly went off at a tangent to sketch out a great novel he was to call aunt columbia no he said they would suspect thataunt dove she was to be a lady of great unpremeditated wealth living on a vast estate near a rather crowded and troublesome village everything she did and said affected the village enormously she took the peoples children into her employment they lived on her surplus vegetables she was to have a particularly troublesome and dishonest household of servants and a spoiled nephew called teddy and whenever she felt dull or energetic she drove down into the village and lectured and blamed the villagersfor being overcrowded for being quarrelsome for being poor and numerous for not in fact being spinster ladies of enormous good fortune that was only the beginning of one of those vast schemes of his that have left no trace now in all the collection  his fear of shocking america was i think unfounded at any rate he succeeded in the necessary suppressions every time and until the day of his death it was rare for the american presscuttings that were removed in basketfuls almost daily with the other debris of his breakfasttable to speak of him in anything but quasiamorous tones he died for them the most spiritual as well as the most intellectual of men not simply intellectual but lovable they spoke of his pensive eyes though indeed when he was not glaring at a camera they were as pensive as champagne and when the robust pathos bumped against the unavoidable humour as they were swept along the narrow torrent of his story they said with all the pleasure of an apt quotation that indeed in his wonderful heart laughter mingled with tears   ยง 5  i think george boon did on the whole enjoy the remarkable setting of his philosophical detachment very keenly the monstrous fame of him that rolled about the world that set out east and came back circumferentially from the west and beat again upon his doors he laughed irresponsibly spent the resulting money with an intelligent generosity and talked of other things it is the quality of life he said and the people love to have it so  i seem to see him still hurrying but not dismayed in flight from the camera of an intrusive admireran admirer not so much of him as of his popularityup one of his garden walks towards his agreeable study i recall his round enigmatical face an affair of rosy rotundities his very bright active eyes his queer wiry black hair that went out to every point in the heavens his ankles and neck and wrists all protruding from his garments in their own peculiar way protruding a little more in the stress of flight i recall too his general effect of careless and on the whole commendable dirtiness accentuated rather than corrected by the vivid tie of soft orangecoloured silk he invariably wore and how his light paces danced along the turf he affected in his private dominions trousers of faint drab corduroy that were always too short braced up with vehement tightness and displaying claretcoloured socks above his easy squaretoed shoes and i know that even that lumbering camera coming clumsily to its tripod ambush neither disgusted nor vulgarized him he liked his game he liked his success and the opulent stateliness it gave to the absurdities of mrs boon and all the circumstances of his profoundly philosophical existence and he liked it all none the worse because it was indeed nothing of himself at all because he in his essence was to dull intelligences and commonplace minds a man invisible a man who left no impression upon the cameraplate or moved by a hairs breadth the scale of a materialist balance   ยง 6  but i will confess the state of the remains did surprise and disappoint me  his story of great literary enterprises holograph and conducted in the profoundest secrecy tallied so completely with for example certain reservations withdrawals that took him out of ones company and gave him his evident best companionship as it were when he was alone it was so entirely like him to concoct lengthy books away from his neatly ordered study from the wise limitations of miss bathwicks significant cough and her still more significant back that we all i think believed in these unseen volumes unquestioningly while those fine romances those large bright plays were being conceived in a publicity about as scandalous as a royal gestation publicly planned and announced developed written boomed applauded there was we knew this undercurrent of imaginative activity going on concealed from miss bathwicks guardian knowledge withdrawn from the stately rhythm of her keys what more natural than to believe he was also writing it down  alas i found nothing but fragments the work upon which his present fame is founded was methodical punctual and careful and it progressed with a sort of inevitable precision from beginning to end and so on to another beginning not only in tone and spirit but in length that most important consideration he was absolutely trustworthy his hundred thousand words of good healthy straightforward story came out in five months with a precision almost astronomical in that sense he took his public very seriously to have missed his mornings exercises behind miss bathwicks back would have seemed to him the most immoralnay worse the most uncivil of proceedings  she wouldnt understand it he would say and sigh and go  but these scraps and fragments are of an irregularity diametrically contrasting with this they seem to have been begun upon impulse at any time and abandoned with an equal impulsiveness and they are written upon stationery of a variety and nature that alone would condemn them in the eyes of an alienist the handwriting is always atrocious and frequently illegible the spelling is strange and sometimes indecently bad the punctuation is sporadic and many of the fragments would be at once put out of court as modern literature by the fact that they are written in pencil on both sides of the paper such of the beginnings as achieve a qualified completeness are of impossible lengths the longest is a pieceallowing for gapsof fourteen thousand words and another a fragment shaping at about eleven these are of course quite impossible sizes neither essay nor short story nor novel and no editor or publisher would venture to annoy the public with writings of so bizarre a dimension in addition there are fragments of verse but i look in vain for anything beyond the first chapter of that tremendous serial the wild asses of the devil that kept on day by day through june and july to the very outbreak of the war and only a first chapter and a few illustrations and memoranda and fragments for our mind of the race that went on intermittently for several years whole volumes of that great hotchpotch of criticism are lost in the sandbanks of my treacherous memory for ever  much of the matter including a small ms volume of those brief verses called limericks personal always generally actionable and frequently lacking in refinement i set aside at an early date much else also i rejected as too disjointed and unfinished or too eccentric two bizarre fragments called respectively jane in heaven and an account of a play i may perhaps find occasion to issue at a later date and there were also several brief imitations of villiers de lisle adam quite alien to contemporary anglosaxon taste which also i hold over sometimes upon separate sheets sometimes in the margins of other compositions and frequently at the end of letters received by him i found a curious abundance of queer little drawings caricatures of his correspondents burlesque renderings of occurrences disrespectful sidenotes to grave and pregnant utterances and the like if ever the correspondence of george boon is published it will have to be done in facsimile there is a considerable number of impressions of the back of miss bathwicks head with and without the thread of velvet she sometimes wore about her neck and quite a number of curiously idealized studies of that american reading public he would always so grotesquely and annoyingly insist on calling her and among other things i found a rendering of myself as a short flattened little object that has a touch of malignity in it i had no reason to expect few or none of these quaint comments are drawn with indian ink upon millboard in a manner suitable for reproduction and even were they so i doubt whether the public would care for very many of them i give my own portraitit is singularly unlike meto show the style of thing he did  illustration  of the mind of the race i may perhaps tell first i find he had written out and greatly embellished the singularly vivid and detailed and happily quite imaginary account of the murder of that eminent litterateur dr tomlinson keyhole with which the mind of the race was to have concluded and there are an extraordinarily offensive interview with mr raymond blathwayt which since it now dates so markedly i have decided to suppress altogether and an unfinished study of the literary statesmen of the transition years from the nineteenth to the twentieth centuries including a lengthy comparison of the greatness of lords bryce and morley a eulogy of lord morley and a discussion whether he has wit or humour that were new to me and perhaps i may note at this point the twenty sixpenny washing books in which boon had commenced what i am firmly convinced is a general index of the works of plato and aristotle it is conceivable he did this merely as an aid to his private reading though the idea of a popular romancer reading anything will come to the general reader with a little shock of surprise  illustration boons idea of aristotle in modern dress from the washing books  when asked why in modern dress boon replied simply that he would be  for my own part and having in memory his subtle and elusive talk i am rather inclined to think that at one time he did go so far as to contemplate a familiar and humorous commentary upon these two pillars of the worlds thought an edition of them edited and copiously illustrated by him would i feel sure have been a remarkable addition to any gentlemans library if he did turn his mind to anything of the sort he speedily abandoned the idea again and with this mention and the note that he detested aristotle those six and twenty washing books may very well follow the bulk of the drawings and most of the verse back into their original oblivion  illustration boons idea of plato from the washing books  boon absolutely rejected the indian bacchus bust as a portrait of plato when asked why he remarked merely that it wasnt like him   ยง 7  but now you will begin to understand the nature of the task that lies before me if i am to do any justice to the cryptic george boon if indeed i am to publish anything at all about him i must set myself to edit and convey these books whose only publication was in fact by word of mouth in his garden arbours using these few fragments as the merest accessories to that i have hesitated i have collected unfavourable advice but at last i have resolved to make at least one experimental volume of boons remains after all whatever we have of aristotle and socrates and all that we most value of johnson comes through the testimony of hearers and though i cannot venture to compare myself with boswell  i know the dangers i shall run in this attempt to save my friend from the devastating expurgations of his written ostensible career i confess i cannot conceal from myself that for example i must needs show boon by the standards of every day a little treacherous  when i thrust an arm into one or other of the scores of densely packed bins of press cuttings that cumber the attics of his castellated mansion and extract a sample clutch i find almost invariably praise not judicious or intelligent praise perhaps but slab and generous praise paragraphs advice photographs notices notes allusions and comparisons praise of the unparalleled gloss on his style by doctor tomlinson keyhole under the pseudonym of simon up to snuff praise of the healthiness of the tone by doctor tomlinson keyhole under the pseudonym of the silver fish inspired announcements of some forthcoming venture made by doctor tomlinson keyhole under the pseudonym of the trueborn englishman and interesting and exalting speculations as to the precise figure of boons income over dr tomlinson keyholes own signature i find chatty if a little incoherent notices by braybourne of the most friendly and helpful sort and interviews of the most flattering description by this wellknown litterateur and that and i reflect that while all this was going on there was boon on the other side of miss bathwicks rampart mind not only not taking them and himself seriously not only not controlling his disrespectful internal commentary on these excellent men but positively writing it down regaling himself with the imagined murder of this leader of thought and the forcible abduction to sinister and melancholy surroundings of that  and yet i find it hard to do even this measure of justice to my friend he was treacherous it must be written and yet he was one must confess a singularly attractive man there was a certain quality in his lifeit was pleasant when i think of doing him justice i am at once dashed and consoled by the thought of how little he cared how i judged him and i recall him very vividly as i came upon him on one occasion  he is seated on a garden rolleran implement which makes a faultless outdoor seat when the handle is adjusted at a suitable angle against a tree and one has taken the precaution to skid the apparatus with a piece of rockery or other convenient object his back is against the handle his legs lie in a boneless curve over the roller and an inch or so of native buff shows between the corduroy trousers and the claretcoloured socks he appears to be engaged partly in the degustation of an unappetizing lead pencil and partly in the contemplation of a halfquire of notepaper the expression of his rubicund face is distinctly a happy one at the sound of my approach he looks up ive been drawing old keyhole again he says like a schoolboy  illustration  nevertheless if critics of standing are to be drawn like this by authors of position then it seems to me that there is nothing before us but to say goodbye for ever to the dignity of letters     chapter the second  being the first chapter of the mind of the race   ยง 1  it was one of boons peculiarities to maintain a legend about every one he knew and to me it was his humour to ascribe a degree of moral earnestness that i admit only too sadly is altogether above my quality having himself invented this great project of a book upon the mind of the race which formed always at least the thread of the discourse when i was present he next went some way towards foisting it upon me he would talk to me about it in a tone of remonstrance raise imaginary difficulties to propositions i was supposed to make and superstitions i entertained speak of it as this book bliss is going to write and at the utmost admit no more than collaboration possibly i contributed ideas but i do not remember doing so now very distinctly possibly my influence was quasimoral the proposition itself fluctuated in his mind to suit this presentation and that it had more steadfastness in mine but if i was the anchorage he was the ship at any rate we planned and discussed a book that boon pretended that i was writing and that i believed him to be writing in entire concealment from miss bathwick about the collective mind of the whole human race  edwin dodd was with us i remember in one of those early talks when the thing was still taking form and he sat on a large inverted flowerpotwe had camped in the greenhouse after lunchand he was smiling with his head slightly on one side and a wonderfully foxy expression of being on his guard that he always wore with boon dodd is a leading member of the rationalist press association a militant agnostic and a dear compact man one of those middle victorians who go about with a preoccupied caulking air as though after having been at great cost and pains to banish god from the universe they were resolved not to permit him back on any terms whatever he has constituted himself a sort of alert customs officer of a materialistic age saying suspiciously here now whats this rapping under the table here and examining every proposition to see that the creator wasnt being smuggled back under some specious new generalization boon used to declare that every night dodd looked under his bed for the deity and slept with a large revolver under his pillow for fear of a revelation from the first dodd had his suspicions about this collective mind of boons most unjustifiable they seemed to me then but he had them  you must admit my dear dodd began boon  i admit nothing said dodd smartly  you perceive something more extensive than individual wills and individual processes of reasoning in mankind a body of thought a trend of ideas and purposes a thing made up of the synthesis of all the individual instances something more than their algebraic sum losing the old as they fall out taking up the young a common mind expressing the species  ohfiguratively perhaps said dodd   ยง 2  for my own part i could not see where dodds figuratively comes in the mind of the race is as real to me as the mind of dodd or my own because dodd is completely made up of dodds right leg plus dodds left leg plus dodds right arm plus dodds left arm plus dodds head and dodds trunk it doesnt follow that dodd is a mere figurative expression  dodd i remember protested he had a selfconsciousness that held all these constituents together but there was a time when dodd was six months old let us say and there are times now when dodd sleeps or is lost in some vivid sensation or action when that clear sense of self is in abeyance there is no reason why the collective mind of the world should not presently become at least as selfconscious as dodd boon indeed argued that that was happening even now that our very talk in the greenhouse was to that synthetic overbrain like a childs first intimations of the idea of me its a fantastic notion said dodd shaking his head  but boon was fairly launched now upon his topic and from the first i will confess it took hold of me  you mustnt push the analogy of dodds mind too far said boon these great overminds  so there are several said dodd  they fuse they divide these great overminds these race minds share nothing of the cyclic fate of the individual life there is no birth for them no pairing and breeding no inevitable death that is the lot of such intermediate experimental creatures as ourselves the creatures below us like the creatures above us are free from beginnings and ends the amoeba never dies it divides at times parts of it die here and there it has no sex no begetting existence without a love interest my god how it sets a novelist craving neither has the germ plasm these overminds which for the most part clothe themselves in separate languages and maintain a sort of distinction stand to us as we stand to the amoebรฆ or the germ cells we carry they are the next higher order of being they emerge above the intense intensely defined struggle of individuals which is the more obvious substance of lives at the rank of ours they grow they divide they feed upon one another they coalesce and rejuvenate so far they are like amoebรฆ but they think they accumulate experiences they manifest a collective will  nonsense said dodd shaking his head from side to side  but the thing is manifest  ive never met it  you met it my dear dodd the moment you were born who taught you to talk your mother you say but whence the language who made the language that gives a bias to all your thoughts and who taught you to think dodd whence came your habits of conduct your mother your schoolmaster were but mouthpieces the books you read the mere forefront of that great being of voices there it isyour antagonist today you are struggling against it with tracts and arguments  but now boon was fairly going physically perhaps we were the children of our ancestors but mentally we were the offspring of the race mind it was clear as daylight how could dodd dare to argue we emerged into a brief independence of will made our personal innovation became as it were new thoughts in that great intelligence new elements of effort and purpose and were presently incorporated or forgotten or both in its immortal growth would the race mind incorporate dodd or dismiss him dodd sat on his flowerpot shaking his head and saying pooh to the cinerarias and i listened never doubting that boon felt the truth he told so well he came near making the race soul incarnate one felt it about us receptive and responsive to boons words he achieved personification he spoke of wars that peoples have made of the roads and cities that grow and the routes that develop no man planning them he mentioned styles of architecture and styles of living the gothic cathedral i remember he dwelt upon a beauty that arose like an exhalation out of scattered multitudes of men he instanced the secular abolition of slavery and the establishment of monogamy as a development of christian teaching as things untraceable to any individuals purpose he passed to the mysterious consecutiveness of scientific research the sudden determination of the european race mind to know more than chance thoughts could tell it  francis bacon said dodd  men like bacon are no more than bright moments happy thoughts the discovery of the inevitable word the race mind it was took it up the race mind it was carried it on  mysticism said dodd give me the rock of fact he shook his head so violently that suddenly his balance was disturbed clap went his feet the flowerpot broke beneath him and our talk was lost in the consequent solicitudes  illustration dodd the agnostic just before the flowerpot broke   ยง 3  now that i have been searching my memory i incline rather more than i did to the opinion that the bare suggestion at any rate of this particular book did come from me i probably went to boon soon after this talk with dodd and said a fine book might be written about the mind of humanity and in all likelihood i gave some outlinei have forgotten what i wanted a larger picture of that great being his imagination had struck out i remember at any rate boon taking me into his study picking out goldsmiths inquiry into the present state of polite learning turning it over and reading from it something in this line he said and read      complaints of our degeneracy in literature as well as in     morals i own have been frequently exhibited of late the     dullest critic who strives at a reputation for delicacy by     showing he cannot be pleased   the old old thing you see the weak protest of the living  he turned over the pages he shows a proper feeling but hes a little thin he says some good things butthe age of louis xiv notwithstanding these respectable names is still vastly superior is it guess the respectable names that age of louis xiv could overridevoltaire rousseau diderot montesquieu dalembert and now tell me the respectable names of the age of louis xiv and the conclusion of the whole matter      thus the man who under the patronage of the great might     have done honour to humanity when only patronized by the     bookseller becomes a thing a little superior to the fellow who     works at the press  the patronage of the great fellow who works at the press goldsmith was a damnably genteel person at times in spite of the vicar its printed with the long s you see it all helps to remind one that times have changed   i followed his careless footsteps into the garden he went gesticulating before me repeating an inquiry into the state of polite learning thats what your mind of the race means suppose one did it now we should do it differently in every way from that  yes but how should we do it said i  the project had laid hold upon me i wanted a broad outline of the whole apparatus of thinking and determination in the modern state something that should bring together all its various activities which go on now in a sort of deliberate ignorance of one another which would synthesize research education philosophical discussion moral training public policy there is i said a disorganized abundance now  its a sort of subconscious mind said boon seeming to take me quite seriously with a half instinctive will  we discussed what would come into the book one got an impression of the enormous range and volume of intellectual activity that pours along now in comparison with the jejune trickle of goldsmiths days then the world hadwhat a few english writers a few men in france the royal society the new berlin academy conducting its transactions in french all resting more or less upon the insecure patronage of the great a few schools public and private a couple of dozen of universities in all the world a press of which the gentlemans magazine was the brightest ornament now  it is a curious thing that it came to us both as a new effect this enormously greater size of the intellectual world of today we didnt at first grasp the implications of that difference we simply found it necessitated an enlargement of our conception and then a mans thoughts lived too in a world that had been created lock stock and barrel a trifle under six thousand years ago  we fell to discussing the range and divisions of our subject the main stream we settled was all that one calls literature in its broader sense we should have to discuss that principally but almost as important as the actual development of ideas suggestions ideals is the way they are distributed through the body of humanity developed rendered brought into touch with young minds and fresh minds who are drawn so into participation who themselves light up and become new thoughts one had to consider journalism libraries book distribution lecturing teaching then there is the effect of laws of inventions done in a large dull halfabstract way said boon one might fill volumes one might become an eminent sociologist you might even invent terminology its a chance  we let it pass he went on almost at once to suggest a more congenial form a conversational novel i followed reluctantly i share the general distrust of fiction as a vehicle of discussion we would he insisted invent a personality who would embody our idea who should be fanatically obsessed by this idea of the mind of the race who should preach it on all occasions and be brought into illuminating contact with all the existing mental apparatus and organization of the world something of your deep moral earnestness you know only a little more presentable and not quite so vindictive said boon and without yourlapses i seem to see him rather like leo maxse the same white face the same bright eyes the same pervading suggestion of nervous intensity the same earnest quasireasonable voicebut instead of that antigerman obsession of his an intelligent passion for the racial thought he must be altogether a fanatic he must think of the mind of the race in season and out of season collective thought will be no joke to him it will be the supremely important thing he will be passionately a patriot entirely convinced of your proposition that the thought of a community is the life of a community and almost as certain that the tide of our thought is ebbing  is it said i  ive never thought the encyclopรฆdia britannica says it is  we must call the encyclopรฆdia britannica  as a witnessin the bookrather but anyhow this man of ours will believe it and struggle against it it will make him ill it will spoil the common things of life for him altogether i seem to see him interrupting some nice bright clean english people at tennis look here you know he will say this is all very well but have you thought today they tell me the germans are thinking the japanese i see him going in a sort of agony round and about canterbury cathedral here are all these beautiful tranquil residences clustering round this supremely beautiful thing all these welldressed excellent freshcoloured englishmen in their beautiful clerical raimentdeans canonsand what have they thought any of them i keep my ear to the hibbert journal but is it enough imagine him going through london on an omnibus he will see as clear as the advertisements on the hoardings the signs of the formal breaking up of the old victorian church of england and dissenting cultures that have held us together so long he will see that the faith has gone the habits no longer hold the traditions lie lax like cut stringthere is nothing to replace these things people do this and that dispersedly there is democracy in beliefs even and any notion is as good as another and there is america like a burst haggis intellectually the mind is confused the race in the violent ferment of new ideas in the explosive development of its own contrivances has lost its head it isnt thinking any more its stupefied one moment and the next its diving about  it will be as clear as day to him that a great effort of intellectual selfcontrol must come if the race is to be saved from utter confusion and dementia and nobody seems to see it but he he will go about wringing his hands so to speak i fancy him at last at a writingdesk nervous white fingers clutched in his black hair how can i put it so that they must attend and see  so we settled on our method and principal character right away but we got no farther because boon insisted before doing anything else on drawing a fancy portrait of this leading character of ours and choosing his name we decided to call him hallery and that he should look something like this  illustration hallery preparing to contradict  that was how the mind of the race began the book that was to have ended at last in grim burlesque with hallerys murder of dr tomlinson keyhole in his villa at hampstead and the conversation at dawn with that incredulous but literate policeman at highgatehe was reading a worlds classicto whom hallery gave himself up     chapter the third  the great slump the revival of letters and the garden by the sea   ยง 1  the story as boon planned it was to begin with a spacious introduction we were to tell of the profound decadence of letters at the opening of the twentieth century and how a movement of revival began a few notes in pencil of this opening do exist among the remains and to those i have referred he read them over to me  we begin he said in a minor key the impetus of the romantic movement we declare is exhausted the race mind not only of the englishspeaking peoples but of the whole world has come upon a period of lethargy the giants of the victorian age  my eye discovered a familiar binding among the flowerpots you have been consulting the encyclopรฆdia britannica i said  he admitted it without embarrassment  i have prigged the whole thing from the last victorian editionwith some slight variations the giants of the victorian age had passed men looked in vain for their successors for a time there was an evident effort to fill the vacant thrones for a time it seemed that the unstinted exertions of miss marie corelli mr hall caine mrs humphry ward and the friends of mr stephen phillips might go some way towards obliterating these magnificent gaps and then slowly but surely it crept into mens minds that the game was up  you will alter that phrase i said  certainly but it must serve now  that humanly speaking it was impossible that anything at once so large so copious so broadly and unhesitatingly popular so nobly cumulative as the great victorian reputations could ever exist again the race seemed threatened with intellectual barrenness it had dropped its great blossoms and stood amidst the pile of their wilting but still showy petals budless and bare it is curious to recall the public utterances upon literature that distinguished this desolate and melancholy time it is a chorus of despair there is in the comments of such admirable but ageing critics as still survived of mr gosse for example and the venerable sir sidney colvin and mr mumchance an inevitable suggestion of widowhood the judges bishops statesmen who are called to speak upon literature speak in the same reminiscent inconsolable note as of a thing that is dead year after year one finds the speakers at the dinner of the royal literary fund admitting the impudence of their appeal i remember at one of these festivities hearing the voice of mr justice gummidge break the strain it is needless to say found its echo in dr tomlinson keyhole he confessed he never read anything that is less than thirty years old with the slightest enjoyment and threw out the suggestion that nothing new should be publishedat least for a considerable timeunless it was clearly shown to be posthumous  except for a few irresistible volumes of facetiousness the reading public very obediently followed the indications of authority in these matters just as it had followed authority and sustained the giants in the great victorian days it bought the longneglected classicsanything was adjudged a classic that was out of copyrightit did its best to read them to find a rare smack in their faded allusions an immediate application for their forgotten topics it made believe that architects were still like mr pecksniff and schoolmasters like squeers that there were no different women from jane austens women and that social wisdom ended in ruskins fine disorder but with the decay of any intellectual observation of the present these past things had lost their vitality a few resolute people maintained an artificial interest in them by participation in quotationhunting competitions and the like but the great bulk of the educated classes ceased presently to read anything whatever the classics were still bought by habit as people who have lost faith will still go to church but it is only necessary to examine some surviving volume of this period to mark the coruscation of printers errors the sheets bound in upside down or accidentally not inked in printing or transferred from some sister classic in the same series to realize that these volumes were mere receipts for the tribute paid by the pockets of stupidity to the ancient prestige of thought  an air of completion rested upon the whole world of letters a movement led by professor armstrong the eminent educationist had even gone some way towards banishing books from the schoolroomtheir last refuge people went about in the newly invented automobile and played openair games they diverted what attention they had once given to their minds to the more rational treatment of their stomachs reading became the last resort of those too sluggish or too poor to play games one had recourse to it as a substitute for the ashes of more strenuous times in the earlier weeks of mourning for a near relative and even the sale of classics began at last to decline an altogether more satisfying and alluring occupation for the human intelligence was found in the game of bridge this was presently improved into auction bridge preparations were made for the erection of a richly decorative memorial in london to preserve the memory of shakespeare an english taj mahal an academy of uncreative literature was established under the presidency of lord reay who had never written anything at all and it seemed but the matter of a few years before the goal of a complete and final mental quiet would be attained by the whole englishspeaking community   ยง 2  you know i said that doesnt exactly represent  hush said boon it was but a resting phase and at this point i part company with the encyclopรฆdia  but you didnt get all that out of the encyclopรฆdia  practicallyyes i may have rearranged it a little the encyclopรฆdist is a most interesting and representative person he takes up an almost eighteenthcentury attitude holds out hopes of a revival of taste under an academy declares the interest of the great mass of men in literature is always empirical regards the great victorian boom in letters as quite abnormal and seems to ignore what you would call that necessary element of vitalizing thought its just here that hallery will have to dispute with him we shall have to bring them together in our book somehow into this impressive scene of decline and the ebb of all thinking comes this fanatic hallery of ours reciting with passionate conviction the thought of a nation is the life of a nation you see our leading effect  he paused we have to represent hallery as a voice crying in the wilderness we have to present him in a scene of infinite intellectual bleakness with the thinnest scrub of secondrate books growing contemptibly and patches of what the encyclopรฆdist calls tareswindwilted taresabout him a mournful encyclopรฆdist like some lone bird circling in the empty air beneath the fading stars well something of that effect anyhow and then you know suddenly mysteriously one grows aware of light of something coming of something definitely coming of the dawn of a great literary revival  how does it come  oh in the promiscuous way of these things the swing of the pendulum it may be some eminent person gets bored at the prospect of repeating that rigmarole about the great victorians and our present slackness for all the rest of his life and takes a leaf from one of hallerys books we might have something after the fashion of the efficiency and wakeupengland affair have you ever heard guineafowl at dawn  ive heard them at twilight they say come back come back but what has that to do with  nothing theres a movement a stir a twittering and then a sudden promiscuous uproar articles in the reviews articles in the newspapers paragraphs letters associations societies leagues i imagine a very great personality indeed in the most extraordinary and unexpected way coming in it was one of boons less amiable habits to impute strange and uncanny enterprises the sudden adoption of movements manias propagandas adhesion to vegetarianism socialism the strangest eccentricities to the british royal family as a result hallery finds himself perforce a person of importance the thought of a nation is the life of a nation one hears it from royal lips a literature a living soul adequate to this vast empire turns up in the speech of a statesman of the greatest literary pretensions arnold white responds to the new note the

uncivil glass against the lower orders is pierced by castiron gates clumsily classical and through the iron bars of these there is visible the deserted gatekeepers lodge its cracked windows opaque with immemorial dirt and a rich undergrowth of nettles beneath the rusty cypresses and stonepines that border the carriageway an automobile throbs in the road its occupants regard a board leaning all askew above the parapet and hesitate to descend on the board which has been enriched by the attentions of the passing boy with innumerable radiant mud pellets one reads with difficulty

                                         this must be it my dear archer says one of the occupants of the motorcar and he rises throws aside his furs and revealsthe urbane presence of the encyclopรฆdist he descends and rings a clangorous bell eh  its the garden of the new republic  exactly revisited its an astonishing thing do you know the date of the new republic the books nearly forty years old about the time of matthew arnolds friendships garland and since that time theres been nothing like a systematic stocktaking of the englishspeaking minduntil the encyclopรฆdist reported no effects and i propose to make this little party in the motorcar a sort of scratch expedition under the impetus of the proposed revival of thought they are prospecting for a summer congress which is to go into the state of the republic of letters thoroughly it isnt perhaps quite gosses style but he has to be therein a way hes the official british man of lettersbut we shall do what we can for him we shall make him show a strong disposition towards protective ironies and confess himself not a little bothered at being dragged into the horrid business and i think we must have george moore who has played uncle to so many movements and been so uniformly disappointed in his nephews and william archer with that face of his which is so exactly like his mind a remarkably fine face mysteriously marred by an expression of unscrupulous integrity and lastly keyhole  why keyhole i asked  hallery has to murder some one ive planned thatand who would he murder but keyhole and we have to hold the first meeting in mallocks garden to preserve the continuity of english thought  very well then we invent a morose elderly caretaker greatly embittered at this irruption he parleys for a time through the gate with all the loyalty of his class mentions a number of discouraging defects more particularly in the drainage alleges the whole place is clammy and only at gosses clearly enunciated determination to enter produces the key  boon consulted his text naturally one would give a chapter to the villa by the sea and mallock generally our visitors explore they visit one scene after another familiar to the good mallockite they descend the broad flights of steps flanked by gods and goddesses that lead from one to another of the long straight terraces set with vases and irish yews and the yews you know have suffered from the want of water the vases are empty and ivy under the benediction of our modest climate has already veiled the classical freedomthe conscientious nudity one might sayof the statuary the laurels have either grown inordinately or perished and the busts of orators poets and philosophers with latin inscriptions stand either bleakly exposed or else swallowed up in a thicket there is a pleasing struggle to translate the legends and one gathers scholarship is not extinct in england  the one oasis in a universal weediness is the pond about the scaly triton which has been devoted to the culture of spring onions a vegetable to which the aged custodian quite superfluously avows himself very partial the visitors return to the house walk along its terrace survey its shuttered front and they spend some time going through its musty rooms dr keyhole distinguishes himself by the feverish eagerness of his curiosity about where leslie slept and where was the boudoir of mrs sinclair he insists that a very sad and painful scandal about these two underlies the new republic and professes a thirsty desire to draw a veil over it as conspicuously as possible the others drag him away to the summer diningroom now a great brier tangle where once lady grace so pleasantly dined her guests the little arena about the fountain in a porphyry basin they do not find but the garden study they peer into and see its inkpot in the shape of a classical temple just as mr mallock has described it and the windowless theatre and in addition they find a small private gasworks that served it the old man lets them in and by the light of uplifted vestas they see the decaying ratdisordered ruins of the scene before which jenkinson who was jowett and herbert who was ruskin preached it is as like a gorge in the indian caucasus as need be the brocken actdrop above hangs low enough to show the toes of the young witch still brightly pink  they go down to the beach and the old man with evil chuckles recalls a hitherto unpublished anecdote of mixed bathing in the seventies in which mrs sinclair and a flushed and startled dr jenkinson greek in thought rather than action play the chief parts and then they wade through a nettlebed to that small classical portico which leads to the locked enclosure containing the three tombs with effigies after the fashion of genoa cemetery but the key of the gate is lost so that they cannot go in to examine them and the weeds have hidden the figures altogether  thats a pity some one remarks for its here no doubt that old laurence lies with his first mistress and his lastunder these cypresses  the aged custodian makes a derisive noise and every one turns to him  i gather you throw some doubt the encyclopรฆdist begins in his urbane way  buriedunder the cypressesfirst mistress and last the old man makes his manner invincibly suggestive of scornful merriment  but isnt it so  bless yr art no mr laurenceburied mr laurence wornt never alive  but there was a young mr laurence  that was mr mallup imself that was e was a great mistifier was mr mallup and sometimes e went about pretendin to be mr laurence and sometimes he was mr leslie and sometimesbut there youd ardly believe e got all this upcypresses chumes everythinkout of is ed potry why ere jest come along ere gents  he leads the way along a narrow privet alley that winds its surreptitious way towards an alcove  miss merton he says flinging the door of this open  the roman catholic young person says dr tomlinson keyhole  quite right sir says the aged custodian  they peer in  hanging from a peg the four visitors behold a pale blue dress cut in the fashion of the seventies a copious chignon of fair hair large earrings and on the marble bench a pair of openwork stockings and other articles of feminine apparel a tall mirror hangs opposite these garments and in a little recess convenient to the hand are the dusty and decaying materials for a hasty makeup  the old custodian watches the effect of this display upon the others with masked enjoyment  you mean miss merton painted said the encyclopรฆdist knitting his brows  mr mallup did says the aged custodian  you mean  mr mallup was miss merton e got er up too parst er orf as a young lady e did oh e was a great mistifier was mr mallup none of the three of em wasnt real people really he got em all up  she had sadlooking eyes a delicate proud mouth and a worn melancholy look muses mr archer  and young laurence was in love with her adds the encyclopรฆdist  they was all mr mallup says the aged custodian made up out of is ed and the gents that pretended they was mr uxley and mr tyndall in disguise one was bill smithers the chemists assistant and the other was the chap that used to write and print the margate advertiser before the noo papers come     chapter the fourth  of art of literature of mr henry james   ยง 1  the garden by the sea chapter was to have gone on discursively with a discussion upon this project of a conference upon the mind of the race the automobileful of gentlemen who had first arrived was to have supplied the opening interlocutors but presently they were to have been supplemented by the most unexpected accessories it would have been an enormously big dialogue if it had ever been written and boons essentially lazy temperament was all against its ever getting written there were to have been disputes from the outset as to the very purpose that had brought them all together a sort of literary stocktaking was to have been mr archers phrase repeated unhappily its commercialism was to upset mr gosse extremely he was to say something passionately bitter about its utter lack of dignity then relenting a little he was to urge as an alternative some controlling influence some standard and restraint a new and better academic influence dr keyhole was to offer his journalistic services in organizing an academic plebiscite a suggestion which was to have exasperated mr gosse to the pitch of a gleaming silence  in the midst of this conversation the party is joined by hallery and an american friend a quiet harvard sort of man speaking meticulously accurate english and still later by emissaries of lord northcliffe and mr hearst by mr henry james rather led into it by a distinguished hostess by mr w b yeats late but keen and by that sir henry lunn who organizes the swiss winter sports hotels all these people drift in with an all too manifestly simulated accidentalness that at last arouses the distrust of the elderly custodian so that mr orage the gifted editor of the new age arriving last is refused admission the sounds of the conflict at the gates do but faintly perturb the conference within which is now really getting to business but afterwards mr orage slightly wounded in the face by a dexterously plied rake and incurably embittered makes his existence felt by a number of unpleasant missiles discharged from over the wall in the direction of any audible voices ultimately mr orage gets into a point of vantage in a small pinetree overlooking the seaward corner of the premises and from this he contributes a number of comments that are rarely helpful always unamiable and frequently in the worst possible taste  such was boons plan for the second chapter of the mind of the race but that chapter he never completely planned at various times boon gave us a number of colloquies never joining them together in any regular order the project of taking up the discussion of the mind of the race at the exact point mr mallock had laid it down and taking the villa by the sea for the meetingplace was at once opposed by hallery and his american friend with an evidently preconcerted readiness they pointed out the entire democratization of thought and literature that had been going on for the past four decades it was no longer possible to deal with such matters in the old aristocratic countryhouse style it was no longer possible to take them up from that sort of beginning the centre of mental gravity among the englishspeaking community had shifted socially and geographically what was needed now was something wider and ampler something more in the nature of such a conference as the annual meeting of the british association science left the gentlemans mansion long ago literature must follow ithad followed it to come back to mr lankesters villa by the sea was to come back to a beaten covert the hearst representative took up a strongly supporting position and suggested that if indeed we wished to move with the times the thing to do was to strike out boldly for a special annex of the panama exhibition at san francisco and for organization upon sound american lines it was a case he said even for exhibits sir henry lunn however objected that in america the anglosaxon note was almost certain to be too exclusively sounded that we had to remember there were vigorous cultures growing up and growing up more and more detachedly upon the continent of europe we wanted at least their reflected lights  some more central position in fact switzerland  where also numerous convenient hotels  patronized he gathered from the illustrated papers by lord lytton mrs asquith mr f r benson  and all sorts of helpful leading people   ยง 2  meanwhile boons plan was to make mr george moore and mr henry james wander off from the general dispute and he invented a dialogue that even at the time struck me as improbable in which both gentlemen pursue entirely independent trains of thought  mr moores conception of the projected symposium was something rather in the vein of the journeyings of shelley byron and their charming companions through france to italy but magnified to the dimensions of an enormous pilgrimage enlarged to the scale of a stream of refugees what my dear james he asked is this mind of humanity at all without a certain touch of romance of adventure even mallock appreciated the significance of froufrou but these fellows behind here  to illustrate his meaning better he was to have told with an extraordinary and loving mastery of detail of a glowing little experience that had been almost forced upon him at nismes by a pretty little woman from nebraska and the peculiar effect it had had and particularly the peculiar effect that the coincidence that both nebraska and nismes begin with an n and end so very differently had had upon his imagination  meanwhile mr james being anxious not merely to state but also to ignore laboured through the long cadences of his companion as an indefatigable steamtug might labour endlessly against a rolling sea elaborating his own particular point about the proposed conference  owing it as we do he said very very largely to our friend gosse to that peculiar that honest but restless and as it were at times almost malignantly ambitious organizing energy of our friend i cannot altogetheraltogether even if in any case i should have taken so extreme so devastatingly isolating a step as to put it violently stand out yet i must confess to a considerable anxiety a kind of distress an apprehension the terror so to speak of the kerbstone at all this stream of intellectual trafficking of going to and fro in a superb and towering manner enough no doubt but still essentially going to and fro rather than in any of the completed senses of the word getting there that does so largely constitute the aggregations and activities we are invited to traverse my poor head such as it is and as much as it can and upon such legssave the markas it can claim must i suppose play its inconsiderable part among the wheels and the rearings and the toots and the whistles and all this uproar thismm mmlet us say this infernal uproar of the occasion and if at times one has ones doubts before plunging in whether after all after the plunging and the dodging and the close shaves and narrow squeaks one does begin to feel that one is getting through whether after all one will get through and whether indeed there is any getting through whether to deepen and enlarge and display ones doubt quite openly there is in truth any sort of ostensible and recognizable other side attainable and definable at all whether to put this thing with a lucidity that verges on the brutal whether our amiable and in most respects our adorable gosse isnt indeed preparing here and now not the gathering together of a conference but the assembling the meet so to speak of a wildgoose chase of an entirely desperate and hopeless description  at that moment mr george moore was saying little exquisite shoulders without a touch of colour and with just that suggestion of rare old ivory in an old shop window in some outoftheway corner of paris that only the most patent abstinence from baths and the brutality of soaping  each gentleman stopped simultaneously  ahead the path led between boxhedges to a wall and above the wall was a pinetree and the editor of the new age was reascending the pinetree in a laborious and resolute manner gripping with some difficulty in his hand a large and very formidable lump of unpleasantness  with a common impulse the two gentlemen turned back towards the house  mr james was the first to break the momentary silence and so my dear moore and soto put it shortlywithout any sort of positive engagement or entanglement or pledge or pressurei came and at the proper time and again with an entirely individual detachment and as little implication as possible i shall go  subsequently mr james was to have buttonholed hallerys american and in the warm bath of his sympathy to have opened and bled slowly from another vein of thought  i admit the abundance ofwhat shall i sayactivities that our friend is summoning the tremendous wealth of matter of material for literature and art that has accumulated during the last few decades no one could appreciate could savour and watch and respond more than myself to the tremendous growing clangour of the mental process as the last halfcentury has exhibited it but when it comes to the enterprise of gathering it together and not simply just gathering it together but gathering it all together then surely one must at some stage ask the question why all why in short attempt to a comprehensiveness that must be overwhelming when in fact the need is for a selection that shall not merely represent but elucidate and lead arent we after all all of us after some such indicating projection of a leading digit after such an insistence on the outstandingly essential in face of this abundance this saturation this fluid chaos that perpetually increases here we are gathering together to celebrate and summarize literature in some sort of undefined and unprecedented fashion and for the life of me i find it impossible to determine what among my numerous associates and friends andto embrace still larger quantities of the stuff in handmy contemporaries is considered to be the literature in question so confused now are we between matter and treatment between what is stated and documented and what is prepared and presented that for the life of me i do not yet see whether we are supposed to be building an ark or whether by immersion and the meekest of submersions and an altogether complete submission of our distended and quite helpless carcasses to its incalculable caprice we are supposed to be celebrating and in the whirling uncomfortable fashion of flotsam at large indicating and making visible the whole tremendous cosmic inundation  illustration mr james converses with mr george moore upon matters of vital importance to both of them   ยง 3  it was entirely in the quality of boons intellectual untidiness that for a time he should go off at a tangent in pursuit of mr henry james and leave his literary picnic disseminated about the grounds of mr mallocks villa there indeed they remained the story when he took it up again picked up at quite a different point  i remember how boon sat on the wall of his vegetable garden and discoursed upon james while several of us squatted about on the cucumberframes and big flowerpots and suchlike seats and how over the wall ford madox hueffer was beating wilkins at badminton hueffer wanted to come and talk too james is one of his countless subjectsand what an omniscient man he is toobut wilkins was too cross to let him off  so that all that hueffer was able to contribute was an exhortation not to forget that henry james knew turgenev and that he had known them both and a flat denial that dickens was a novelist this last was the tail of that preraphaelite feud begun in household words oh generations ago  got you there my boy said wilkins seven twelve  we heard no more from hueffer  you see boon said you cant now talk of literature without going through james james is unavoidable james is to criticism what immanuel kant is to philosophya partially comprehensible essential an inevitable introduction if you understand what james is up to and if you understand what james is not up to then you are placed you are in the middle of the critical arena you are in a position to lay about you with significance otherwise  i want to get this hallery of mine who is to be the hero of the mind of the race into a discussion with henry james but that you know is easier said than imagined hallery is to be one of those enthusiastic thinkers who emit highly concentrated opinion in gobbets suddenly jamesisnt  boon meditated upon his difficulties hallerys idea of literature is something tremendously comprehensive something that pierces always down towards the core of things something that carries and changes all the activities of the race this sort of thing  he read from a scrap of paper  the thought of a community is the life of that community and if the collective thought of a community is disconnected and fragmentary then the community is collectively vain and weak that does not constitute an incidental defect but essential failure though that community have cities such as the world has never seen before fleets and hosts and glories though it count its soldiers by the army corps and its children by the million yet if it hold not to the reality of thought and formulated will beneath these outward things it will pass and all its glories will pass like smoke before the wind like mist beneath the sun it will become at last only one more vague and fading dream upon the scroll of time a heap of mounds and pointless history even as are babylon and nineveh  ive heard that before somewhere said dodd  most of this dialogue will have to be quotation said boon  he makes literature include philosophy  everything its all the central things its the larger bible to him a thing about which all the conscious direction of life revolves its alive with passion and will or if it isnt then it ought to be and then as the antagonist comes this artist this man who seems to regard the whole seething brew of life as a vat from which you skim with slow dignified gestures works of art  works of art whose only claim is their art hallery is going to be very impatient about art  ought there to be such a thing as a literary artist some one said  ought there in fact to be henry james said dodd  i dont think so hallery wont think so you see the discussion will be very fundamental theres contributory art of course and a way of doing things better or worse just as there is in war or cooking but the way of doing isnt the end first the end must be judgedand then if you like talk of how it is done get there as splendidly as possible but get there james and george moore neither of them take it like that they leave out getting there or the thing they get to is so trivial as to amount to scarcely more than an omission  boon reflected in early life both these men poisoned their minds in studios thought about pictures even might be less studioridden than it is but james has never discovered that a novel isnt a picture that life isnt a studio  he wants a novel to be simply and completely done he wants it to have a unity he demands homogeneity why should a book have that for a picture its reasonable because you have to see it all at once but theres no need to see a book all at once its like wanting to have a whole county done in one style and period of architecture its like insisting that a walking tour must stick to one valley  but james begins by taking it for granted that a novel is a work of art that must be judged by its oneness judged first by its oneness some one gave him that idea in the beginning of things and he has never found it out he doesnt find things out he doesnt even seem to want to find things out you can see that in him he is eager to accept thingselaborately you can see from his books that he accepts etiquettes precedences associations claims that is his peculiarity he accepts very readily and thenelaborates he has i am convinced one of the strongest most abundant minds alive in the whole world and he has the smallest penetration indeed he has no penetration he is the culmination of the superficial type or else he would have gone into philosophy and been greater even than his wonderful brother but here he is spinning about like the most tremendous of waterboatmenyou know those insectskept up by surface tension as if when once he pierced the surface he would drown its incredible a waterboatman as big as an elephant i was reading him only yesterday the golden bowl its dazzling how never for a moment does he go through  recently hes been explaining himself said dodd  his notes on novelists its one sustained demand for the picture effect which is the denial of the sweet complexity of life of the pointing this way and that of the spider on the throne philosophy aims at a unity and never gets there that true unity which we all suspect and which no one attains if it is to be got at all it is to be got by penetrating penetrating down and through the picture on the other hand is forced to a unity because it can see only one aspect at a time i am doubtful even about that think of hogarth or carpaccio but if the novel is to follow life it must be various and discursive life is diversity and entertainment not completeness and satisfaction all actions are halfhearted shot delightfully with wandering thoughtsabout something else all true stories are a felt of irrelevances but james sets out to make his novels with the presupposition that they can be made continuously relevant and perceiving the discordant things he tries to get rid of them he sets himself to pick the straws out of the hair of life before he paints her but without the straws she is no longer the mad woman we love he talks of selection and of making all of a novel definitely about a theme he objects to a saturation that isnt oriented and he objects if you go into it for no clear reason at all following up his conception of selection see what in his own practice he omits in practice jamess selection becomes just omission and nothing more he omits everything that demands digressive treatment or collateral statement for example he omits opinions in all his novels you will find no people with defined political opinions no people with religious opinions none with clear partisanships or with lusts or whims none definitely up to any specific impersonal thing there are no poor people dominated by the imperatives of saturday night and monday morning no dreaming typesand dont we all more or less live dreaming and none are ever decently forgetful all that much of humanity he clears out before he begins his story its like cleaning rabbits for the table  but you see how relentlessly it follows from the supposition that the novel is a work of art aiming at pictorial unities  all art too acutely selfcentred comes to this sort of thing jamess denatured people are only the equivalent in fiction of those eggfaced blackhaired ladies who sit and sit in the japanese colourprints the unresisting stuff for an arrangement of blacks  then with the eviscerated people he has invented he begins to make up stories what stories they are concentrated on suspicion on a gift on possessing a piece of old furniture on what a little girl may or may not have noted in an emotional situation these people cleared for artistic treatment never make lusty love never go to angry war never shout at an election or perspire at poker never in any way date and upon the petty residuum of human interest left to them they focus minds of a jamesian calibre  the only living human motives left in the novels of henry james are a certain avidity and an entirely superficial curiosity even when relations are irregular or when sins are hinted at you feel that these are merely attitudes taken up gambits before the game of attainment and overperception begins his people nose out suspicions hint by hint link by link have you ever known living human beings do that the thing his novel is about is always there it is like a church lit but without a congregation to distract you with every light and line focused on the high altar and on the altar very reverently placed intensely there is a dead kitten an eggshell a bit of string like his altar of the dead with nothing to the dead at all for if there was they couldnt all be candles and the effect would vanish and the elaborate copious emptiness of the whole henry james exploit is only redeemed and made endurable by the elaborate copious wit upon the desert his selection has made henry james erects palatial metaphors the chief fun the only exercise in reading henry james is this clambering over vast metaphors  having first made sure that he has scarcely anything left to express he then sets to work to express it with an industry a wealth of intellectual stuff that dwarfs newton he spares no resource in the telling of his dead inventions he brings up every device of language to state and define bare verbs he rarely tolerates he splits his infinitives and fills them up with adverbial stuffing he presses the passing colloquialism into his service his vast paragraphs sweat and struggle they could not sweat and elbow and struggle more if god himself was the processional meaning to which they sought to come and all for tales of nothingness it is leviathan retrieving pebbles it is a magnificent but painful hippopotamus resolved at any cost even at the cost of its dignity upon picking up a pea which has got into a corner of its den most things it insists are beyond it but it can at any rate modestly and with an artistic singleness of mind pick up that pea   ยง 4  a little while ago said boon suddenly struggling with his trouser pocket and producing some pieces of paper i sketched out a novel and as it was rather in the manner of henry james i think perhaps you might be interested by it now so much that is as there is of it it is to be called the spoils of mr blandish and it is all about this particular business of the selective life mr blandish as i saw him was pretty completely taken from the james ideal he was a man with an exquisite apprehension of particulars with just that sense of there being a rightness attainable a fitness a charm a finish in any little affair he believed that in speech and still more that in writing there was an inevitable right word in actions great and small a mellowed etiquette in everything a possible perfection he was in fact the very soul of henry jamesas i understand it this sort of man  illustration mr blandish going delicately through life oh no oh no but yes and this is it  going delicately  i was able to secure the sketch  he didnt marry he didnt go upon adventures lust avarice ambition all these things that as milton says are to be got not without dust and heat were not for him blood and dust and heathe ruled them out but he had independent means he could live freely and delicately and charmingly he could travel and meet and be delighted by all the best sorts of people in the best sorts of places so for years he enriched his resonances as an admirable violin grows richer with every note it sounds he went about elaborately avoiding ugliness death suffering industrialism politics sport the thought of war the red blaze of passion he travelled widely in the more settled parts of the world chiefly he visited interesting and ancient places putting his ever more exquisite sensorium at them consciously taking delicate impressions upon the refined wax of his being in a manner most carefully occasional he wrote always of faded places his ypres was wonderful his bruges and his hour of van eyk  such said boon is the hero the story begins oh quite in the james manner with he read  at times it seemed inaccessible a thing beyond hope beyond imagining and then at times it became so concrete an imagination a desire so specific so nearly expressed as to grow if not to the exact particulars of longitude and latitude yet at any rate so far as county and district and atmosphere were concerned so far indeed as an intuition of proximity was concerned an intimation that made it seem at last at certain moments as if it could not possibly be very much farther than just round the corner or over the crest  but ive left a good bit of that to write up in the book there will be pages and sheets of that sentence the gist is that mr blandish wants a house to live in and that he has an idea of the kind of house he wants and the chapter the long unresting progressing chapter expands and expands it never jumps you forward it never lets you off you cant skip and you cant escape until there comes at last a culminating distension of statement in which you realize more and more clearly until you realize it with the unforgettable certainty of a thing long fought for and won at last that mr blandish has actually come upon the house and with a vigour of decision as vivid as a flash of lightning in a wilderness of troubled clouds as vivid indeed as the loud sonorous bursting of a long blown bladder has said this is it on that this is it my chapter ends with an effect of enormous relief with something of the beautiful serenity that follows a difficult parturition  the story is born  and then we leap forward to possession  and here he was in the warmest reality in the very heart of the materialization of his dream he has in fact got the house for a year or so from its first accidental discovery he had done nothing but just covet the house too fearful of an overwhelming disappointment even to make a definite inquiry as to its accessibility but he has you will gather taken apartments in the neighbourhood thither he visits frequently and almost every day when he walks abroad the coveted house draws him it is in a little seaside place on the east coast and the only available walks are along the shore or inland across the golflinks either path offers tempting digressions towards it he comes to know it from a hundred aspects and under a thousand conditions of light and atmosphere and while still in the early stage he began a curious and delicious secret practice in relationship you have heard of the spaniard in love in love with a woman he had seen but once whom he might never see again a princess etiquettedefended a goddess and who yet seeing a necklace that became her bought it for the joy of owning something that was at least by fitness hers even so did mr blandish begin to buy first one little article and then the fancy growing upon him more and more things pieces they call them that were in the vein of samphire house and then came the day the wonderful day when as he took his afternoon feast of the eye the door opened some one came out towards him  it was incredible they were giving him tea with hot inadvisable sconesbut their hotness their close heaviness he accepted with a ready devotion would have accepted had they been ten times as hot and close and heavy not heedlessly indeed but gratefully willingly paying his price for these astonishing revelations that without an effort serenely calmly dropped in between her gentle demands whether he would have milk and her mild inquiries as to the exact quantity of sugar his habits and hygienic outlook demanded that his hostess so casually made these generous heedless people were talking of departures of abandonments of so they put it selling the dear old place if indeed any one could be found to buy a place so old and so remote andshe pointed her intention with a laughso very very dear repletion of scones were a small price to pay for such a glowing such an incredible gift of opportunity thrust thus straight into the willing amazed hands  he gets the house he has it done up he furnishes it and every article of furniture seems a stroke of luck too good to be true and to crown it all i am going to write one of those long crescendo passages that james loves a sentence pages of it of happy event linking to happy event until at last the incredible completion a butler unquestionably early georgian respectability competence equally unquestionable a wife who could cook and cook well no children no thought or possibility of children and to crown all the perfect namemutimer  illustration mutimer at first  all this you must understand is told retrospectively as blandish installs himself in samphire house it is told to the refrain still fresh every morning came the persuasion this is too good to be true and as it is told something else by the most imperceptible degrees by a gathering up of hints and allusions and pointing details gets itself told too and that is the growing realization in the mind of blandish of a something extra of something not quite bargained forthe hoard and the haunting about the house hangs a presence  he had taken it at first as a mere picturesque accessory to the whole picturesque and delightful wreathing of association and tradition about the place that there should be this ancient flavour of the cutlass and the keg this faint aroma of buried doubloons and stevensonian experiences he had assumed etc he had gathered etc and it was in the most imperceptible manner that beyond his sense of these takings and assumptions and gatherings there grew his perception that the delicate quiver of appreciation at first his utmost tribute to these illegal and adventurous and sanguinary associations was broadening and strengthening was one hardly knew whether to say developing or degenerating into a nervous reaction more spinal and less equivocally agreeable into the question sensed rather than actually thought or asked whether in fact the place didnt in certain lights and certain aspects and at certain unfavourable moments come near to evoking the ghostif such sorites are permissible in the world of delicate shadesof the ghost of the ghost of a shiverof aversion  and so at page a hundred and fifty or thereabouts we begin to get into the story said boon  you wade through endless marshes of subtle intimation to a sense of a presence in samphire house for a number of pages you are quite unable to tell whether this is a ghost or a legend or a foreboding or simply oldfashioned dreams that are being allusively placed before you but there is an effect piled up very wonderfully of mr blandish obsessed uneasy watching furtively and steadfastly his guests his callers his domestics continually asking himself do they note it are they feeling it  we break at last into incidents a young friend of the impossible name of deshman helps evolve the story he comes to stay he seems to feel the influence from the outset he cannot sleep he wanders about the house do others know others the gardener takes to revisiting the gardens after nightfall he is met in the shrubbery with an unaccountable spade in his hand and answers huskily why should a gardener carry a spade why should he answer huskily why should the presence the doubt the sense of something else elusively in the air about them become intensified at the encounter oh conceivably of course in many places but just there as some sort of protection it may be then suddenly as mr blandish sits at his lonely but beautifully served dinner he becomes aware for the first time of a change in mutimer  illustration mutimer at the end of a year  something told him in that instant that mutimer also knew  deshman comes again with a new and disconcerting habit of tapping the panelling and measuring the thickness of the walls when he thinks no one is looking and then a sister of mr blandish and a friend a woman yet not so much a woman as a disembodied intelligence in a feminine costume with one of those impalpable relationships with deshman that people have with one another in the world of henry james an association of shadows an atmospheric liaison follow some almost sentenceless conversations mr blandish walks about the shrubbery with the friend elaborately getting at itwhatever it isand in front of them now hidden by the yew hedges now fully in view walks deshman with the married and settled sister of mr blandish  so said mr blandish pressing the point down towards the newly discovered sensitiveness where we feel he it seems knows  she seemed to consider  he doesnt know completely was her qualification  but he has somethingsomething tangible  if he can make it tangible  on that the mind of mr blandish played for a time  then it isnt altogether tangible yet  it isnt tangible enough for him to go upon  definitely something  her assent was mutely concise  that we on our part  the we seemed to trouble her  he knows more than you do she yielded  the gesture the half turn the momentary halt in the paces of mr blandish plied her further  more i think than he has admittedto any one  even to you  he perceived an interesting wave of irritation even to me he had wrung from her but at the price of all further discussion  putting the thing crassly said boon deshman has got wind of a hoard of a treasure of somethingheaven as yet only knows what somethingburied imbedded in some as yet unexplained way incorporated with samphire house on the whole the stress lies rather on treasure the treasure of smuggling of longshore practices of illegality on the high seas and still clearer is it that the amiable deshman wants to get at it without the participation of mr blandish until the very end you are never quite satisfied why deshman wants to get at it in so private a fashion as the plot thickens you are played about between the conviction that deshman wants the stuff for himself and the firm belief of the lady that against the possible intervention of the treasury he wants to secure it for mr blandish to secure it at least generously if nefariously lest perhaps it should fall under the accepted definition and all the consequent confiscations of treasure trove and there are further beautiful subtleties as to whether she really believes in this more kindly interpretation of the refined but dubitable deshman a friend of deshmans shameless under the incredible name of mimbleton becomes entangled in this thick sweet flow of narrativethe james method of introducing a character always reminds me of going round with the lantern when one is treacling for moths mimbleton has energy he presses under a summer dawn of delicious sweetness mimbleton is found insensible on the croquet lawn by mr blandish who like most of the characters in the narrative from first to last has been unable to sleep and at the near corner of the house close to a never before remarked ventilator is a hastily and inaccurately refilled excavation  then events come hurrying in a sort of tangled hastemaking sibyllike gestures  at the doorway mutimer appearsswaying with some profound emotion he is still in his evening attire he has not yet gone to bed in spite of the dawn he carried a burning candleobliquely at the sight of his master he withdrawsbackwards and with difficulty  then said boon i get my crowning chapter the breakfast a peculiar something something almost palpable in the atmospheredeshman hoarse and a little talkative mimbleton with a possibly nervous headache husky also and demanding tea in a thick voice mutimer waiting uneasily and mr blandish outwardly calm yet noting every particular thinking meanings into every word and movement and growing more and more clear in his conviction that mutimer knowsknows everything  illustration mutimer as the plot thickens  book two opens with mr blandish practically in possession of the facts putting the thing coarsely the treasure is1813 brandy in considerable quantities bricked up in a disused cellar of samphire house samphire house instead of being the fine claret of a refuge mr blandish supposed is a loaded port but of course in the novel we shall not put things coarsely and for a long time you will be by no means clear what the spirit is that mr blandish is now resolved to exorcise he is in fact engaged in trying to get that brandy away trying to dealcoholize his existence tryingif one must put the thing in all the concrete crudity of his fundamental intentionto sell the stuff  now in real life you would just go and sell it but people in the novels of henry james do not do things in the inattentive offhand rather confused and partial way of reality they bring enormous brains to bear upon the minutest particulars of existence mr blandish following the laws of that world has not simply to sell his brandy he has to sell it subtly intricately interminably with a delicacy with a dignity  he consults friendsimpalpable intricate inexhaustible friends  there are misunderstandings one old and trusted intimate concludes rather hastily that mr blandish is confessing that he has written a poem another that he is making a proposal of marriage another that he wishes an introduction to the secretary of the psychical research society all this said boon remains perhaps indefinitely to be worked out only the end the end comes with a rush deshman has found for himone never gets nearer to it than the real right people the real right people send their agent down a curious blend of gentleman and commercial person he is to investigate to verify to estimate quantities ultimately he willshall we say itmake an offer with a sense of immense culmination the reader at last approaches the hoard  you are never told the thing exactly it is by indefinable suggestions by exquisite approaches and startings back by circumlocution the most delicate that your mind at last shapes its realization thatthe last drop of the last barrel has gone and that mutimer the butler lies dead or at least helplessin the inner cellar and a beautiful flavour ripe and yet rare rich without opulence hangsdiminuendo morendoin the air     chapter the fifth  of the assembling and opening of the world conference on the mind of the race   ยง 1  it must be borne in mind that not even the opening chapter of this huge book the mind of the race was ever completely written the discussion in the garden by the sea existed merely so far as the fragment of dialogue i have quoted took it i do not know what mr gosse contributed except that it was something bright and that presently he again lost his temper and washed his hands of the whole affair and went off with mr yeats to do a little academy thing of their own round a corner and i do not know what became of the emissaries of lord northcliffe and mr hearst one conversation drops out of mind and another begins it is like the battle of the aisne passing slowly into the battle of the yser the idea develops into the holding of a definite congress upon the mind of the race at some central place i dont think boon was ever very clear whether that place was chautauqua or grindelwald or stratford or oxford during the long vacation or the exhibition grounds at san francisco it was at any rate some such place and it was a place that was speedily placarded with all sorts of bills and notices and counsels such as to the central hall or section b criticism and reviewing or section m prose style or authors society british solicitors department or exhibit of the reading room of the british museum  manifestly the model of a meeting of the british association for the advancement of science dominated his mind more and more until at last he began to concoct a presidential address and he invented a man called j b pondlebury very active and illiterate but an excellent organizer trained by selfridge that marshal field of london who is very directive throughout j b pondlebury orders the special trains contrives impossible excursions organizes garden fรชtes and water parties keeps people together who would prefer to be separated and breaks up people who have been getting together through all these things drifts hallery whose writings started the idea and sometimes he is almost as it were leader and sometimes he is like a drowned body in the torrent below niagarapondlebury being niagara  on the whole the atmosphere of the great conference was american and yet i distinctly remember that it was the special train to bรขle of which he gave us an account one afternoon it was a night journey of considerable eventfulness with two adjacent carriages de luxe labelled respectively specially reserved for miss marie corelli and specially reserved for mr and mrs george bernard shaw with conspicuous reiterations the other compartments were less exclusive and contained curious minglings of greatness activity and reputation sir j m barrie had an upper berth in a wagonlit where he remained sympathetically silent above a crowd of younger reputations a crowd too numerous to permit the making of the lower berth and overflowing into the corridor i remember boon kept jamming new people into that congestion the whole train indeed was to be fearfully overcrowded that was part of the joke james joyce i recall as a novelist strange to me that boon insisted was a firstrater he represented him as being of immense size but extreme bashfulness and he talked about d h lawrence st john ervine reginald wright kauffman leonard merrick viola meynell rose macaulay katherine mansfield mary austin clutton brock robert lynd james stephens philip guedalla h m tomlinson denis garstin dixon scott rupert brooke geoffrey young f s flint marmaduke pickthall randolph s bourne james milne  through all the jam i think we must have ford madox hueffer wandering to and fro up and down the corridor with distraught blue eyes laying his hands on heads and shoulders the only uncle of the gifted young talking in a languid plangent tenor now boasting about trivialities and now making familiar criticisms which are invariably illreceived and occasionally quite absentmindedly producing splendid poetry  like most authors who have made their way to prominence and profit boon was keenly sympathetic with any new writer who promised to do interesting work and very ready with his praise and recognition that disposition in these writing prolific times would alone have choked the corridor and he liked young people even when their promises were not exactly convincing he hated to see a good book neglected and was for ever ramming the crystal age and said the fisherman and tony drum and georges mother and a hind let loose and growing pains down the throats of his visitors but there were very human and definite limits to his appreciations conspicuous success and particularly conspicuous respectable success chilled his generosity conrad he could not endure i do him no wrong in mentioning that it is the way with most of us and a score of flourishing contemporaries who might have liked tickets for the conference special would have found great difficulty in getting them  there is a fascination in passing judgements and drawing up class lists for a time the high intention of the mind of the race was forgotten while we talked the narrow shop of london literary journalism and discovered and weighed and logrolled andin the case of the more establishedblamed and condemned that bรขle train became less and less like a train and more and more like a descriptive catalogue  for the best part of an afternoon we talked of the young and the new and then we fell into a discussion about such reputations as pickthalls and w h hudsons and the late stephen cranes reputations ridiculously less than they ought to be so that these writers who are certainly as securely classic as beckford or herrick are still unknown to half the educated english reading public was it due to the haste of criticism or the illiteracy of publishers that question led us so far away from the special bรขle train that we never returned to it but i know that we decided that the real and significant writers were to be only a small portion of the crowd that congested the train there were also to be endless impostors imitators editors raiders of the world of print at every important station there was to be a frightful row about all these peoples tickets and violent attempts to remove doubtful cases then mr clement k shorter was to come in to advise and help the conductor ultimately this led to trouble about mr shorters own credentials  some of boons jokes about this train were to say the best of them obvious mr compton mackenzie was in trouble about his excess luggage for example mr upton sinclair having carried out his ideal of an innocent frankness to a logical completeness in his travelling equipment was forcibly wrapped in blankets by the train officials mr thomas hardy had a firstclass ticket but travelled by choice or mistake in a secondclass compartment his deserted place being subsequently occupied by that promising young novelist mr hugh walpole provided with a beautiful fur rug a fitted dressingbag a writing slope a goldnibbed fountain pen innumerable introductions and everything that a promising young novelist can need the brothers chesterton mr maurice baring and mr belloc sat up all night in the wagonrestaurant consuming beer enormously and conversing upon immortality and whether it extends to semitic and oriental persons at the end of the train i remember there was to have been a horsevan containing mr maurice hewletts chargermr hewlett himself i believe was left behind by accident at the gare de lyonsmr cunninghame grahams arab steed and a large quiet sheep the inseparable pet of mr arthur christopher benson  there was also i remember a description of the whole party running for early coffee which gave boon ample and regrettable opportunities for speculations upon the dรฉshabille of his contemporaries much of the detail of that invention i prefer to forget but i remember mr shaw was fully prepared for the emerging with handpainted pyjamas over which he was wearing a saffron dressinggown decorated in green and purple scrolls by one of the bolder artists associated with mr roger fry and as these special train allusions are all that i can ever remember boon saying about shaw and as the drawing does in itself amount to a criticism i give it here  illustration how mr shaw knocked them all on bรขle platform and got right into the middle of the picture remark his earnest face this surely is no mountebank   ยง 2  boon was greatly exercised over the problem of a president  why have a president dodd helped  there must be a presidential address said boon and these things always do have a president  lord rosebery suggested wilkins  lord morley said dodd  lord bryce  then we looked at one another  for my own part said boon if we are going in for that sort of thing i favour lord reay  you see lord reay has never done anything at all connected with literature morley and bryce and rosebery have at any rate written thingshistorical studies addresses things like thatbut reay has never written anything and he let gollancz make him president of the british academy without a murmur this seems to mark him out for this further distinction he is just the sort of man who would be madeand who would let himself be madepresident of a british affair of this sort and they would hoist him up and he would talk for two or three hours without a blush just like that other confounded peerwhat was his namewho bored and bored and bored at the anatole france dinner in the natural course of things it would be one of these literary lords  what would he say asked dodd  maunderings of course it will make the book rather dull i doubt if i can report him at length he will speak upon contemporary letters the lack of current achievement i doubt if a man like lord reay ever reads at all one wonders sometimes what these british literary aristocrats do with all their time probably he left off reading somewhere in the eighties he wont have noted it of course and he will be under the impression that nothing has been written for the past thirty years  good lord said wilkins  and hell say that slowly steadily endlessly then he will thank god for the english classics ask where now is our thackeray where now our burns our charlotte brontรซ our tennyson say a good word for our immortal bard and sit down amidst the loud applause of thousands of speechlessly furious british and american writers  i dont see that this will help your book forward said dodd  no but its a proper way of beginning like family prayers  i suppose said wilkins if you told a man of that sort that there were more and better poets writing in english beautifully in 1914 than ever before he wouldnt believe it i suppose if you said that ford madox hueffer for example had produced sweeter and deeper poetry than alfred lord tennyson hed have a fit  hed have nothing of the kind you could no more get such an idea into the head of one of these great vestiges of our gladstonian days than you could get it into the seat of a windsor chair and people dont have fits unless something has got into them no hed reflect quite calmly that first of all hed never heard of this hueffer then that probably he was a very young man and anyhow one didnt meet him in important places and after inquiry he would find out he was a journalist and then probably hed cease to cerebrate upon the question   ยง 3  besides said boon we must have one of our literary peers because of america  youre unjust to america i said  no said boon but aunt dovei know her ways  that led to a long rambling discussion about the american literary atmosphere nothing that i could say would make him relent from his emphatic assertion that it is a spinster atmosphere an atmosphere in which you cant say all sorts of things and where all sorts of things have to be specially phrased and she cant stand young things and crude things  america said wilkins  the america i mean the sort of america that ought to supply young new writers with caresses andnourishment instead of which you get the nation that bleak acidity that refined appeal to take the child away  but they dont produce new young writers said wilkins  but they do said boon and they strangle them  it was extraordinary what a power metaphors and fancies had upon boon only those who knew him intimately can understand how necessary miss bathwick was to him he would touch a metaphor and then return and sip it and then sip and drink and swill until it had intoxicated him hopelessly  america said boon can produce such a supreme writer as stephen cranethe best writer of english for the last halfcenturyor mary austin who used to write what other woman could touch her but america wont own such children its amazing its a case of concealment of birth she exposes them whether its shameor a chinese trick shell sit never knowing shes had a stephen crane adoring the european reputation the florid mental gestures of a conrad you see she can tell conrad writes it shows and shell let mary austin die of neglect while she worships the art of mary ward its like turning from the feet of a goddess to a pair of goloshes she firmly believes that old quack bergson is a bigger man than her own unapproachable william james shes incredible i tell you its only conceivable on one supposition id never thought before about these disgraceful sidelights on miss doves career  we english do make foundlings of some of her little victims anyhow but why hasnt she any natural instinct in the matter  now if one represented that peculiar bostonian intellectual gentility the nation kind of thing as a very wicked sour ladysmaid with a tremendous influence over the spinsters conduct  his mind was running on  i begin to see a melodramatic strain in this great novel miss dove miss doves derelicts too broad i am afraid if one were to represent sargent and henry james as two children left out one cold night in a basket at a cottage in the village by a mysterious stranger with nothing but a roll of dollars and a rough drawing of the washington coatofarms to indicate their parentage  then when they grow up they go back to the big house and shes almost kind to them  have you ever read the critical articles of edgar allan poe theyre very remarkable he is always demanding an american literature it is like a deserted baby left to die in its cradle weeping and wailing for its bottle what he wanted of course was honest and intelligent criticism  to this day america kills her poes  but confound it said wilkins america does make discoveries for herself hasnt she discovered lowes dickinson  but that merely helps my case lowes dickinson has just the qualities that take the american judgement he carries the shadow of kings college chapel about with him wherever he goes he has an unobtrusive air of being doubly starred in baedeker and not thinking anything of it and also she took noyes to her bosom but when has american criticism ever had the intellectual pluck to proclaim an american  and so you see he remarked going off again at a tangent if we are going to bid for american adhesions theres only one course open to us in the matter of this presidential address lord morley  youre a little difficult to follow at times said wilkins  because hes the man whos safest not to say anything about babies oranything alive obviously a literary congress in america must be a festival in honour of sterility  aunt dove demands it like celebrating the virginity of queen elizabeth   ยง 4  i find among the fragments of my departed friend some notes that seem to me to be more or less relevant here they are an incomplete report of the proceedings of a section s devoted to poiometry apparently the scientific measurement of literary greatness it seems to have been under the control of a special committee including mr james huneker mr slosson sir thomas seccombe mr james douglas mr clement k shorter the acting editor of the bookman and the competition editress of the westminster gazette  apparently the notes refer to some paper read before the section its authorship is not stated nor is there any account of its reception but the title is the natural history of greatness with especial reference to literary reputations  the opening was evidently one of those rapid historical sketches frequent in such papers  persuasion that human beings are sometimes of disproportionate size appears first in the egyptian and syrian wall paintings probably innate the discouragement of the young a social necessity in all early societies in all societies exaggerated stories about the departed golden ages heroic ages ancestor worship dead dogs better than living

satyricon other instances of unorthodox ancient criticism shakespeare as an intellectual nuisance extreme suffering caused to contemporary writers by the shakespeare legend  another form of opposition to these obsessions is the creation of countervailing reputations certain people in certain ages have resolved to set up great men of their own to put beside these brocken spectres from the past this marks a certain stage of social development the beginning of selfconsciousness in a civilized community selfcriticism always begins in selfflattery virgil as an early instance of a great man of set

and devoted following of sympathizers shelley then capable advocacy is needed and a critical world large enough to be effective but small enough to be unanimous part an able publisher may play in establishing and developing a great man quiet push not noisy push injury done by tactless advertisement the element of luck  these are the seeds of greatness but the growth depends upon the soil the best soil is a large uncritical public newly come to reading a little suspicious of the propriety of the practice and in a state of intellectual snobbishness it must also be fairly uniform and on some common basis of ideas ideally represented by the reading publics of germany britain the united states and france in the middle nineteenth century  decline in the output of greatness towards the end of the victorian time probably due in all cases to an enlargement of the reading public to unmanageable dimensions no reputation sufficiently elastic to cover it the growth of chicago new york and the west destroyed the preponderance of boston in america and the civil war broke the succession of american great men rarity of new americanborn greatnesses after the war dumping of established greatnesses from england gave no chance to the native market no protection for america in this respect in great britain the board schools create big masses of intelligent people inaccessible to the existing machinery by which greatness is imposed the greatness output in britain declines also in consequence mrs humphry ward the last of the british victorian great expressed admiration of mr gladstone for her work support of the spectator profound respect of the american people rumour that she is represented as a sea goddess at the base of the queen victoria memorial unfounded nobody is

ultimately against every possibility of the case boon decided that the president of his conference must be hallery and he wrote his presidential address but he never read that address to us some shyness i think restrained him i dig it out here now for the first time a little astonished at it disposed to admire something in its spirit but yet one has to admit that it shows an extraordinary lapse from boons accustomed mocking humour  here is the opening  hallery then advanced to the edge of the platform and fumbled with his manuscript his face was very white and his expression bitterly earnest with an appearance of effort he began omitting in his nervousness any form of address to his audience  for the most part the life of human communities has been as unconscious as the life of animals they have been born as unknowingly as the beasts they have followed unforeseen and unheeded destinies and destruction has come to them from forces scarcely anticipated and not understood tribes nations beyond counting have come and passed with scarcely a mental activity beyond a few legends a priestly guess at cosmogony a few rumours and traditions a list of kings as bare as a schoolboys diary a war or so a triumph or so we are still only in the beginning of historyin the development that is of a racial memory we have as yet hardly begun to inquire into our racial origins our racial conditions our racial future philosophy which is the discussion of the relation of the general to the particular of the whole to the part of the great and yet vague life of the race to the intense yet manifestly incomplete life of the individual is still not three thousand years old man has lived consciously as man it may be for hundreds of thousands of years he has learnt of himself by talking to his fellows he has expressed personal love and many personal feelings with a truth and beauty that are well nigh final but the race does but begin to live as a conscious being it begins to live as a conscious being and as it does so the individual too begins to live in a new way a greater more understanding and more satisfying way his thoughts apprehend interests beyond himself and beyond his particular life  at this point hallery became so acutely aware of his audience that for some seconds he could not go on reading a number of people in various parts of the hall had suddenly given way to their coughs a baldheaded gentleman about the middle of the assembly had discovered a draught and was silently but conspicuously negotiating for the closing of a window by an attendant and at the back a cultivatedlooking young gentleman was stealing out on tiptoe  illustration the first departure  for a moment hallery was distressed by the thought that perhaps he might have taken a more amusing line than the one he had chosen and then realizing how vain were such regrets and rather quickening his pace he resumed the reading of his address  you see that i am beginning upon a very comprehensive scale for i propose to bring within the scope of this conference all that arises out of these two things out of the realization of the incompleteness of mans individual life on the one hand and out of the realization of a greater being in which man lives of a larger racial life and ampler references upon the other all this muchand with a full awareness of just how much it isi am going to claim as literature and our province religion i hold every religion so far as it establishes and carries ideas is literature philosophy is literature science is literature a pamphlet or a leading article i put all these things together  at this point there was a second departure  illustration the second departure  almost immediately followed by a third  illustration the third departure  hallery halted for a second time and then gripped the readingdesk with both hands and reading now with a steadily accelerated velocity heeded his audience no more  i put all these things together because indeed it is only associations of antiquity and prescription and prestige can separate them altogether they constitute the great vague body of mans superpersonal mental life his unselfish life his growing life as a premeditating selfconscious race and destiny here in growing volume in this comprehensive literature of ours preserved selected criticized restated continually rather more fined continually rather more clarified we have the mind not of a mortal but of an immortal adventurer whom for the moment fractionally infinitesimally whenever we can forget ourselves in pure feeling in service in creative effort or disinterested thought we are privileged in that measure to become this wonder that we celebrate this literature is the dawn of human divinity                                                                 but though hallery went on i do not on reflection think that i will i doubt if boon ever decided to incorporate this extraordinary presidential address in our book i think perhaps he meant to revise it or substitute something else he wanted to state a case for the extreme importance of literature and to my mind he carried his statement into regions mystical to say the least of it and likely to be considered blasphemous by many quite rightminded people for instance he made hallery speak of the word that links mens minds he brings our poor mortal mental activities into the most extraordinary relationship with those greater things outside our lives which it is our duty to revere as much as possible and to think about as little as possible he draws no line between them he never i say read the paper to us i cannot guess whether he did not read it to us because he doubted himself or because he doubted us and i do not even care to examine my own mind to know whether i do or do not believe in the thesis he sets so unhesitatingly down in a sense it is no doubt true that literature is a kind of overmind of the race and in a sense no doubt the bible and the koran the talmud and the prayer book are literature in a sense mr upton sinclairs bible for socialists of bits from ancient and modern writings is literature in a sense too literature does go on rather like a continuous mind thinking but i feel that all this is just in a sense i dont really believe it i am not quite sure what i do really believe but i certainly recoil from anything so crudely positive as hallerys wild assertions it would mean worshipping literature or at least worshipping the truth in literature  of course one knows that real literature is something that has to do with leisure and cultivated people and books and shaded lamps and all that sort of thing but hallery wants to drag in not only cathedrals and sanctuaries but skysigns and hoardings he wants literature to embrace whatever is in or whatever changes the mind of the race except purely personal particulars and i think boon was going to make hallery claim this just in order to show up against these tremendous significances the pettiness of the contemporary literary life the poverty and levity of criticism the mean business side of modern bookmaking and bookselling  turning over the pages of this rejected address which i am sure the reader would not thank me for printing i do come upon this presentable passage which illustrates what i am saying  so that every man who writes to express or change or criticize an idea every man who observes and records a fact in the making of a research every man who hazards or tests a theory every artist of any sort who really expresses does thereby in that very act participate share in become for just that instant when he is novel and authentically true the mind of the race the thinking divinity do you not see then what an arrogant worship what a sacramental thing it is to lift up brain and hand and say i too will add we bring our little thoughts as the priest brings a piece of common bread to consecration and though we have produced but a couplet or a dozen lines of prose we have nevertheless done the parallel miracle and all reading that is reading with the mind all conscious subjugation of our attention to expressed beauty or expressed truth is sacramental is communion with the immortal being we lift up our thoughts out of the little festering pit of desire and vanity which is ones individual self into that greater self  so he talks and again presently of that worldwide immortal communion incessant as the march of sun and planets amidst the stars  and then going on with his vast comparison for i cannot believe this is more than a fantastic parallelism and if the mind that does as we say create is like the wafer that has become miraculously divine then though you may not like to think of it all you who give out books who print books and collect books and sell books and lend them who bring pictures to peoples eyes set things forth in theatres hand out thought in any way from the thinking to the attentive mind all you are priests you do a priestly office and every bookstall and hoarding is a wayside shrine offering consolation and release to men and women from the intolerable prison of their narrow selves   ยง 6  that i think is what boon really at the bottom of his heart felt and believed about literature  and yet in some way he could also not believe it he could recognize something about it that made him fill the margin of the manuscript of this address with grotesque figures of an imaginary audience going out they were i know as necessary to his whole conception as his swinging reference to the stars both were as much part of his profound belief as the gargoyle on the spire and the high altar are necessary parts of a gothic cathedral and among other figures i am amused rather than hurt to find near the end this of myself  illustration too highpitched even for reginald     chapter the sixth  of not liking hallery and the royal society for the discouragement of literature   ยง 1  in the same peculiar receptacle in which i find this presidential address i found a quantity of other papers and scraps of paper upon which boon i should judge had been thinking about that address and why he was ashamed to produce it to us and why he perceived that this audience would dislike hallery so much that he was obliged to admit that they would go out before his lecture was finished and why he himself didnt somehow like this hallery that he had made all these writings are in the nature of fragments some are illegible and more are incomprehensible but it is clear that his mind attacked these questions with a most extraordinary width of reference i find him writing about the one and the many the general and the particular the species and the individual declaring that it is through the dimensions sic of space and time that individuation becomes possible and citing darwin heraclitus kant plato and tagore all with a view to determining just exactly what it was that irritated people in the breadth and height and expression of hallerys views or to be more exact what he knew would have irritated people with these views if they had ever been expressed  here is the sort of thing that i invite the intelligent reader to link up if he can with the very natural phenomenon of a number of quite ordinary sensible people hostile and in retreat before a tedious perplexing and presumptuous discourse  the individual human mind spends itself about equally in headlong flight from the universal which it dreads as something that will envelop and subjugate it and in headlong flight to the universal which it seeks as a refuge from its own loneliness and silliness it knows very certainly that the universal will ultimately comprehend and incorporate it yet it desires always that the universal should mother it take it up without injuring it in the slightest degree foment and nourish its egotism cherish fondly all its distinctions give it all the kingdoms of existence to play with  ordinary people snuggle up to god as a lost leveret in a freezing wilderness might snuggle up to a siberian tiger  you see that man who flies and seeks who needs and does not want does at last get to a kind of subconscious compromise over the matter couldnt he perhaps get the infinite with the chill off couldnt he perhaps find a warm stuffed tiger he cheats himself by hiding in what he can pretend is the goal so he tries to escape from the pursuit of the living god to dead gods evades religion in a church does his best to insist upon timehonoured formulรฆ god must have a button on the point and it is our instinctive protection of the subconscious arrangement that makes us so passionately resentful at raw religion at crude spiritual realities at people who come at us saying harsh understandable things about these awful matters they may wake the tiger  we like to think of religion as something safely specialized codified and put away then we can learn the rules and kick about a bit but when some one comes along saying that science is religion literature is religion businesstheyll come to that presentlybusiness is religion  it spoils the afternoon  but that alone does not explain why hallery delivering his insistent presidential address is detestable to his audiencefor it is quite clear that he is detestable im certain of it no what is the matter there is that the aggression of the universal is pointed and embittered by an all too justifiable suspicion that the individual who maintains it is still more aggressive has but armed himself with the universal in order to achieve our discomfiture its no good his being modest that only embitters it it is no good his making disavowals that only shows that he is aware of it  of course i invented hallery only to get this burthen off myself  all spiritual truths ought to be conveyed by a voice speaking out of a dark void as hardy wants his spirits to speak in the dynasts failing that why should we not deal with these questions through the anonymity of a gramophone  a modern religion founded on a mysterious gramophone which was discovered carefully packed in a box of peculiar construction on a seat upon primrose hill  how well the great organized religions have understood this how sound is the effort to meet it by shaving a priests head or obliging him to grow a beard putting him into canonicals drilling him and regimenting him so as to make him into a mere type  if i were to found a religion i think i should insist upon masked priests   ยง 2  this idea that the defensive instinct of the individuality jealousy is constantly at war not only with other individualities but with all the great deindividualizing things with faith with science with truth with beauty that out of its resentments and intricate devices one may draw the explanation of most of the perplexities and humours of the intellectual life indeed the explanation of most life and of most motives is the quintessence of boon the mind of the race toils through this jungle of jealous individuality to emerge and the individual knowing that singlehanded he hasnt a chance against the immortal allies himself with this and that with sham immortalities and partially effaced and partially confuted general things and so it sets up its greatnesses to save it from greatness its solemnities to preserve it from the overwhelming gravity of truth see it can say i have my gods already thank you i do not think we will discuss this matter further  i admit the difficulty of following boon in this i admit too that i am puzzled about his mind of the race does he mean by that expression a great wisdom and will that must be or a great wisdom and will that might be  but here he goes on with the topic of hallery again  i invented hallery to get rid of myself but after all hallery is really no more than the shadow of myself and if i were impersonal and well bred and if i spoke behind a black screen it would still be as much my voice as ever i do not see how it is possible to prevent the impersonal things coming by and through persons but at any rate we can begin to recognize that the person who brings the message is only in his way like the messengerboy who brings the telegrams the writer may have a sensitive mind the messengerboy may have nimble heels that does not make him the creator of the thing that comes then i think people will be able to listen to such lectures as this of hallerys without remembering all the time that its a particular human being with a white face and a lisp and perhaps they will be able to respect literature and fine thought for the sake of the general human mind for which they live and for the sake of their own receptiveness   ยง 3  and from that boon suddenly went off into absurdities  should all literature be anonymous he asks at the head of a sheet of notes  but one wants an authors name as a brand perhaps a number would suffice would authors write if they remained unknown mixed motives could one run a church with an unsalaried priesthood but certainly now the rewards are too irregular successful authors are absurdly flattered and provoked to impossible ambitions could we imitate the modern constitutional state by permitting limited ambitions but retaining all the higher positions inaccessible to mere enterprise and merit hereditary novelists poets and philosophers for example the real ones undistinguished hereditary historians and scientific men are already practical reality then such mischievous rewards and singlings out as the nobel prize could be distributed among these official intellectuals by lot or better by seniority it would prevent much heartburning  these last notes strike me as an extraordinary declension from the at least exalted argument of the preceding memoranda but they do serve to emphasize the essence ofwhat shall i call itboonism the idea that there is a great collective mental process going on in many minds and that it is impertinent and distracting to single out persons great men groups and schools coteries and academies the flame burns wide and free it is here it is gone you had it you have it not and again you see it plainly stretching wide across the horizon   ยง 4  but after these scrappy notes about jealousy and how people protect their minds against ideas and especially the idea which is god and against the mental intrusions of their fellowcreatures conveying ideas i understand better the purport of that uninvited society which he declared insisted upon coming to the great conference upon the mind of the race and which held such enthusiastic and crowded meetings that at last it swamped all the rest of the enterprise it was he declared to the bitter offence of dodd a society with very much the same attitude towards all impersonal mental activities that the rationalist press association has to religion and it was called the royal society for the discouragement of literature  why royal i asked  ohobviously he said  this royal society was essentially an organization of the conservative instincts of man its aim was to stop all this thinking  and yet in some extraordinary way that either i did not note at the time or that he never explained it became presently the whole conference the various handbills pamphlets in outline notes for lectures and so forth that accompanied his notes of the proceedings of the royal society may either be intended as part of the sectional proceedings of the great conference or as the production of this hostile organization i will make a few extracts from the more legible of these memoranda which render the point clearer   ยง 5  publishers and book distributors  comparable to the priest who hands the elements and as much upon their honour  the publisher regrets that the copy for this section is missing and fears that the substance of it must be left to the imagination of the reader this is the more regrettable as the section was probably of a highly technical nature   ยง 6  the young reviewer  here again mr boons notes are not to be found and repeated applications to mr bliss have produced nothing but a vague telegram to go ahead   ยง 7  the schoolmaster and literature  essentially the work of the schoolmaster is to prepare the young and naturally overindividualized mind for communion with the mind of the race essentially his curriculum deals with modes of expression with languages grammar the mathematical system of statement the various scientific systems of statement the common legend of history all leads up as the scholar approaches adolescence to the introduction to living literature living thought criticism and religion but when we consider how literature is taught in schools  here the writing leaves off abruptly and then there is written in very minute letters far down the page and apparently after an interval for reflection      scholastic humour      o god     chapter the seventh  wilkins makes certain objections   ยง 1  wilkins the author began to think about the mind of the race quite suddenly he made an attack upon boon as we sat in the rosearbour smoking after lunch wilkins is a man of a peculiar mental constitution he alternates between a brooding sentimental egotism and a brutal realism and he is as weak and false in the former mood as he is uncompromising in the latter i think the attraction that certainly existed between him and boon must have been the attraction of opposites for boon is as emotional and sentimental in relation to the impersonal aspects of life as he is pitiless in relation to himself wilkins still spends large portions of his time thinking solemnly about some ancient trouble in which he was treated unjustly i believe i once knew what it was but i have long since forgotten yet when his mind does get loose from his own case for a bit it is i think a very penetrating mind indeed and at any rate he gave a lot of exercise to boon  all through this book boon he began  what book asked dodd  this one we are in all through this book you keep on at the idea of the mind of the race it is what the book is about it is its theme yet i dont see exactly what you are driving at sometimes you seem to be making out this mind of the race to be a kind of god  a synthetic god said boon if it is to be called a god at all  dodd nodded as one whose worst suspicions are confirmed  then one has to assume it is a continuing coherent mind that is slowly becoming wider saner profounder more powerful  boon never likes to be pressed back upon exact statements yes he said reluctantly in generalon the wholeyes what are you driving at  it includes all methods of expression from the poster when a play is produced at his majestys theatre from the cheering of the crowd when a fireman rescues a baby up towalter pater  so far as pater expresses anything said boon  then you go on from the elevation this idea of a secular quasidivine racial mental progress gives you to judge and condemn all sorts of decent artistic and literary activities that dont fall in or dont admit that they fall in  something of that idea said boon growing a little testysomething of that idea  it gives you an opportunity of annoying a number of people you dont like  if i offend it is their fault said boon hotly criticism can have no friendships if they like to take it ill my criticism is absolutely honest some of them are my dearest friends  they wont be said wilkins when all this comes out but anyhow your whole case your justification your thesis is that there is this mind of the race overriding dominating and that you are its prophet  because a man confesses a belief wilkins that doesnt make him a prophet i dont set upi express  your mind of the race theory has an elegance a plausibility i admit said wilkins  dodds expression indicated that it didnt take him in he compressed his lips not a bit of it  but is this in reality true is this what exists and goes on we people who sit in studies and put in whole hours of our days thinking and joining things together do get a kind of coherence into our ideas about the world just because there is leisure and time for us to think but are you sure that is the race at all that is my point arent we intellectually just a byproduct if you went back to the time of plato you would say that the idea of his republic was what was going on in the mind of the race then but i object that that was only the futile fancy of a gentleman of leisure what was really going on was the gathering up of the macedonian power to smash through greece and then make greece conquer asia your literature and philosophy are really just the private entertainment of old gentlemen out of the hurlyburly and ambitious young men too delicate to hunt or shoot thought is nothing in the world until it begins to operate in will and act and the history of mankind doesnt show now and it never has shown any consecutive relation to human thinking the real mind of the race is i submit something not literary at all not consecutive but like the inconsecutive incoherences of an idiot  no said boon of a child  you have wars you have great waves of religious excitement you have patriotic and imperial delusions you have illconceived and surprising economic changes  as if humanity as a whole were a mere creature of chance and instinct said boon  exactly said wilkins  i admit that said boon but my case is that sanity grows that what was ceases to be the mind of reason gets now out of the study into the marketplace  you mean really boon that the mind of the race isnt a mind that is it is just a mind that becomes  thats what its all about said boon  and that is where i want to take you up said wilkins i want to suggest that the mind of the race may be just a gleam of conscious realization that passes from darkness to darkness  no said boon  why not  because i will not have it so said boon   ยง 2  there can be no denying that from quite an early stage in the discussion boon was excited and presently on the verge of illtemper this dragging of his will into a question of fact showed i think the beginning of his irritation and he was short and presently rather uncivil in his replies to wilkins  boon argued that behind the individualities and immediacies of life there was in reality a consecutive growth of wisdom that larger numbers of people and a larger proportion of people than ever before were taking part in the world mind process and that presently this would become a great conscious general thinking of the race together  wilkins admitted that there had been a number of starts in the direction of impersonal understanding and explanation indeed there was something of the sort in every fresh religious beginning but he argued that these starts do not show a regular progressive movement and that none of them had ever achieved any real directive and unifying power over their adherents that only a few christians had ever grasped christianity that brahminism fell to intellectual powder before it touched the crowd that nowadays there was less sign than ever of the honest intellectuals getting any hold whatever upon the minds and movements of the popular mass  the mind of the race said wilkins seems at times to me much more like a scared child cowering in the corner of a cage full of apes  boon was extraordinarily disconcerted by these contradictions  it will grow up he snatched  if the apes let it said wilkins you can see how completely the thinkers and poets and all this stuff of literature and the study dont represent the real mind such as it is of humanity when you note how the mass of mankind turns naturally to make and dominate its own organs of expression take the popular press take the popular theatre take popular religion take current fiction take the musichall watch the development of the cinematograph there you have the real body of mankind expressing itself if you are right these things should fall in a kind of relationship to the intellectual hierarchy but the intellectual hierarchy goes and hides away in country houses and beautiful retreats and provincial universities and stuffy highclass periodicals its afraid of the mass of men it dislikes and dreads the mass of men and it affects a pride and aloofness to cover it plato wanted to reorganize social order and the common life the young man in the twopenny tube was the man he was after he wanted to exercise him and teach him exactly what to do with the young woman beside him instead of which poor plato has become just an occasion for some oxford don to bleat about his unapproachable style and wisdom  i admit were not connected up yet said boon  youre more disconnected than ever you were in the middle ages there was something like a connected system of ideas in christendom so that the pope and the devout fishwife did in a sense march together  you see the wrangling argument on which they were launched  boon maintained that there was a spreading thought process clearly perceptible nowadays and that those detachments of wilkins were not complete he instanced the cheap editions of broadthinking books the variety of articles in the modern newspaper the signs of wide discussions wilkins on the other hand asserted a predominant intellectual degeneration moreover wilkins declared with the murmurous approval of dodd that much even of the academic thought process was going wrong that bergsons pragmatism for ladies was a poor substitute even for herbert spencer that the boom about mendelism was a triumph of weak thinking over comprehensive ideas  even if we leave the masses out of account it is still rather more than doubtful if there is any secular intellectual growth  and it is curious to recall now that as an instance of a degenerative thought process among educated people wilkins instanced modern germany here he said in the case of a mind covering over a hundred million people altogether was a real retrocession of intellectual freedom the pretentious expression of instinctive crudity had always been the peculiar weakness of the german mind it had become more and more manifest he said as nationalism had ousted foreign influence you see what pretty scope for mutual contradiction there was in all this let me get books cried wilkins and i will read you samples of the sort of thing that passes for thinking in germany i will read you some of houston stewart chamberlain some of nietzsches boiling utterance some of schopenhauer  let me said wilkins read a passage i have picked almost haphazard from schopenhauer one gets schopenhauer rammed down ones throat as a philosopher as a deep thinker as the only alternative to the hegelian dose and just listen  he began to read in a voice of deliberate malice letting his voice italicize the more scandalous transitions of what was certainly a very foolish and illknit piece of assertion      little men have a decided inclination for big women and     vice versรข and indeed in a little man the preference for     big women will be so much the more passionate if he himself     was begotten by a big father and only remains little through     the influence of his mother because he has inherited from his     father the vascular system and its energy which was able to     supply a large body with blood if on the other hand his     father and grandfather were both little that inclination will     make itself less felt at the foundation of the aversion of a     big woman to big men lies the intention of nature to avoid     too big a race further the consideration as to the     complexion is very decided blondes prefer dark persons or     brunettes but the latter seldom prefer the former the     reason is that fair hair and blue eyes are in themselves a     variation from the type almost an abnormity analogous to     white mice or at least to grey horses in no part of the     world not even in the vicinity of the pole are they     indigenous except in europe and are clearly of scandinavian     origin i may here express my opinion in passing that the     white colour of the skin is not natural to man but that by     nature he has a black or brown skin like our forefathers the     hindus that consequently a white man has never originally     sprung from the womb of nature and that thus there is no such     thing as a white race much as this is talked of but every     white man is a faded or bleached one forced into this strange     world where he only exists like an exotic plant and like     this requires in winter the hothouse in the course of     thousands of years man became white the gipsies an indian     race which immigrated only about four centuries ago show the     transition from the complexion of the hindu to our own     therefore in sexual love nature strives to return to dark     hair and brown eyes as the primitive type but the white     colour of the skin has become second nature though not so     that the brown of the hindu repels us finally each one also     seeks in the particular parts of the body the corrective of     his own defects and aberrations and does so the more     decidedly the more important the part is therefore     snubnosed individuals have an inexpressible liking for     hooknoses parrotfaces and it is the same with regard to     all other parts men with excessively slim long bodies and     limbs can find beauty in a body which is even beyond measure     stumpy and short whoever is himself in some respects very     perfect does not indeed seek and love imperfection in this     respect but is yet more easily reconciled to it than others     because he himself insures the children against great     imperfection of this part for example whoever is himself     very white will not object to a yellow complexion but whoever     has the latter will find dazzling whiteness divinely     beautiful you will note that he perceives he has     practically contradicted this a few lines before and that     evidently he has gone back and stuck in that saving clause     about a white skin being second nature the rare case in     which a man falls in love with a decidedly ugly woman occurs     when beside the exact harmony of the degree of sex explained     above the whole of her abnormities are precisely the     opposite and thus the corrective of his the love is then     wont to reach a high degree  and so on and so on said wilkins just a foolish irresponsible saying of things and all this stuff this celibate cerebration you must remember is not even fresh it was said far more funnily and pleasantly by old campanella in his city of the sun and mind you this isnt a side issue schopenhauer is upon it isnt a moment of relaxation this argument is essential to the whole argument of his philosophy  but after all said boon schopenhauer is hardly to be considered a modern he was predarwinian  exactly why i begin with him said wilkins he was a contemporary of darwin and it was while darwin was patiently and industriously building up evidence that this nonsense a whole torrent of it a complete doctrine about the will to live was being poured out but what i want you to notice is that while the sort of cautious massing of evidence the close reasoning the honesty and veracity that distinguished the method of darwin and huxley are scarcely to be met with anywhere today this spouting style of doing things is everywhere take any of the stuff of that intellectual jackdaw bernard shaw and you will find the schopenhauer method in full development caughtup ideas glib irrational transitions wild assertions about the life force about the effects of alcohol about fearpoisoned meat about medical science about economic processes about russia about the irish temperament and the english intelligence about the thoughts and mental processes of everybody and every sort of mind stuff too incoherent and recklessly positive ever to be systematically answered and yet half at least of the englishspeaking intelligenzia regards shaw as a part of the thought process of the world schopenhauer was a pioneer in the game of impudent assertion very properly disregarded by his own generation shaws dementia samples this age you see my case in any rationally trained clearheaded period shaw would have been looked into dissected and disposed of long ago and here i have two other of the voices that this time respects it is all my argument that they are respected now enormously boon not merely that they exist men to talk and write foolishly to make groundless positive statements and to misapprehend an opponent there have always been but this age now tolerates and accepts them here is that invalid englishman houston stewart chamberlain who found a more congenial intellectual atmosphere in germany and this is his great book the foundations of the nineteenth century this book has been received with the utmost solemnity in the highest quarters nowhere has it been handed over to the derision which is its only proper treatment you remember a rather readable and rather pretentious history we had in our schooldays full of bad ethnology about kelts and anglosaxons called j r greens history of the english people it was part of that movement of professorial barbarity of braggart raceimperialism and antiirishism of which froude and freeman were leaders it smelt of carlyle and germany it helped provoke the keltic renascence well that was evidently the germ of herr chamberlain here  wilkins turned over the pages  here he is in fairly good form it is a section called the turning point and its quite on all fours with schopenhauers our ancestors the hindus it is part of a sketch in outline of the history of the past the important thing he says is to fix the turningpoint of the history of europe while he was at it he might just as well have fixed the equator of the history of europe and its sparkingplug and the position of its liver now listen      the awakening of the teutonic peoples to the consciousness     of their allimportant vocation as the founders of a     completely new civilization and culture marks the     turningpoint the year 1200 can be designated the central     moment of this awakening  just consider that he does not even trouble to remind us of the very considerable literature that must exist of course as evidence of that awakening he just flings the statement out knowing that his sort of follower swallows all such statements blind and then possibly with some qualms of doubt about what may have been happening in spain and italy and india and china and japan he goes on      scarcely any one will have the hardihood to deny that the     inhabitants of northern europe have become the makers of the     worlds history at no time have they stood alone  others     too have exercised influenceindeed great influenceupon     the destinies of mankind but then always merely as opponents     of the men from the north  poor jenghiz khan who had founded the mogul empire in india just about that time and was to lay the foundations of the yuen dynasty and prepare the way for the great days of the mings never knew how mere his relations were with these marvellous men from the north the tartars it is true were sacking moscow somewhere about twelve hundred but let us get on to more of the recital of teutonic glories      if however the teutons were not the only people who     moulded the worlds history generous admission they     unquestionably that unquestionably deserve the first     place all those who appear as genuine shapers of the     destinies of mankind whether as builders of states or as     discoverers of new thoughts and of original art oh japan oh     ming dynasty oh art and life of india belong to the     teutonic race the impulse given by the arabs is short lived     astronomy chemistry mathematics modern science     generally the mongolians destroy but do not create     anything samarkand delhi pekin the great italians of     the rinascimento were all born either in the north     saturated with lombardic gothic and frankish blood or in     the extreme germanohellenic south in spain it was the     western goths who formed the element of life the jews are     working out their renaissance of today by following in     every sphere as closely as possible the example of the     teutonic peoples  that dodge of claiming all the great figures of the nonteutonic nations as teutons is carried out to magnificent extremes dante is a teuton on the strength of his profile and his surname and there is some fine play about the race of christ he came from galilee notoriously nonjewish and so on but lord redesdale who writes a sympathetic introduction sets the seal on the teutonic nationality of christ by reminding us that joseph was only the putative father  it makes a born teuton like myself feel his divinity said wilkins and read browsing from the moment the teuton awakes a new world begins to open out um um oh here we are again      it is equally untrue that our culture is a renaissance of     the hellenic and the roman it was only after the birth of the     teutonic peoples that the renaissance of past achievements was     possible and not vice versรข i wonder what exactly     vice versรข means there the mightiest creators of that     epocha shakespeare a michael angelodo not know a word of     greek or latin  the stalwart ignorance of it little latin and less greek even ben jonson allowed our william and manifestly he was fed on tudor translations and the illiteracy of michael angelo is just an inspiration of chamberlains he knows his readers now in itself there is no marvel in this assertive prejudiced garrulous ignorance it is semisober bierhalle chatter written down and god forgive us most of us have talked in this way at one time or another the sign and the wonder for you boon is that this stuff has been taken quite seriously by all germany and england and america that it is accepted as firstrank stuff that it has never been challenged cut up and sent to the butterman it is modern thought it is my second sample of the contemporary mind of the race and now gentlemen we come to the third great intellectual highkicker nietzsche nietzsche i admit had once a real and valid idea and his work is built upon that real and valid idea it is an idea that comes into the head of every intelligent person who grasps the idea of the secular change of species the idea of darwinism in the course of five or six minutes after the effective grasping this is the idea that man is not final but nietzsche was so constituted that to get an idea was to receive a revelation this step that every bright mind does under certain circumstances take seemed a gigantic stride to him a stride only possible to him and for the rest of his lucid existence he resounded variations he wrote epigrammatic crackermottoes and sham indian apophthegms round and about his amazing discovery and the whole thing is summed up in the title of dr alexander tilles von darwin bis nietzsche in which this miracle of the obvious this necessary corollary is treated as a huge advance of the mind of mankind no one slays this kind of thing nowadays it goes on and goes on a perpetually reinforced torrent of unreason washing through the brain of the race there was a time when the general intelligence would have resisted and rejected schopenhauer nietzsche chamberlain shaw now it resists such invasions less and less that boon is my case  wilkins with his little pile of books for reference his sombre manner and his persistence was indeed curiously suggestive of an advocate opening a trial the mind of the race was far less of a continuity than it was when a generally recognized and understood orthodox christianity held it together as a backbone holds together the ribs and limbs and head of a body that manifestly was what he was driving at as dodd presently complained in those stabler days every one with ideas willingly or unwillingly had to refer to that doctrinal core had to link up to it even if the connection was used only as a point of departure now more and more as in these three examples people began irresponsibly in the air with rash assertions about life and race and the tendency of things and the louder they shouted the more fantastic and remarkable they were the more likely they were to gather a following and establish a fresh vortex in the deliquescent confusion  on the whole boon was disposed to tolerate these dispersed beginnings we attack truth in open order he said instead of in column  i dont mind fresh beginnings said wilkins i dont mind open order but i do object to blank ignorance and sheer misconception it isnt a new beginning for schopenhauer to say we are descended from hindus it is just stupidity and mental retrogression we are no more descended from hindus than hindus are descended from us that we may have a common ancestry is quite a different thing one might as well say that the chimpanzee is descended from a gorilla or a gorilla from a chimpanzee and it isnt any sort of truth it is just a loud lie that the germanic peoples realized anything whatever in the year 1200 but all thesewhat shall i call themmoderns are more and more up to that kind of thing stating plausible things that have already been disproved stating things erroneously inventing pseudofacts and so getting off with a flourish in the fields of ideas and presently in the fields of action these wildly kicking personalities have swamped any orderly progress they have arrested and disowned all that clearing up of thought and all that patient triumphant arrangement of proven fact which characterized the late eighteenth and the first half of the nineteenth century during that time the great analysis of biological science went on which culminated in an entire revision of our conceptions of species which opened a conceivable and hitherto undreamedof past and future to the human imagination which seemed to have revised and relaid the very foundations of philosophical discussion and on that foundation what has been done  naturally cried boon after a great achievement there must be a pause the mind of the race must have its digestive interludes  but this is indigestion first comes herbert spencer with his misconception of the life process as a struggle of individuals to survive his word evolution is the quintessence of the misunderstanding his image of a steadfast mechanical unfolding through selfishness masked plausibly and disastrously the intricate perplexing vision of the truth from that sort of thing we go at a stride to the inevitable super man the megatherium individual of futurity the large egoist and all that nonsense then comes a swarm of shallow incontinent thinkers anxious to find a simple driving force with a simple name for the whole process the life force and will and so on these things my dear boon are just the appalling bubbles of gas that show how completely the mind of the race has failed to assimilate  it is remarkable said boon how a metaphor may run away with the clearest of thinkers the mind of the race is not so consistently gastric as all that  you started the metaphor said wilkins  and you mounted it and it bolted with you to these unpleasant consequences well i hold on the contrary that after the superficialities of the sixties and seventies and eighties peoples minds have been getting a firmer and firmer grip upon the reality of specific instability the new body of intellectual experiment which isnt indigestion at all but only a preliminary attack is all that mass of trial thinking that one lumps together in ones mind when one speaks of pragmatism with the breakdown of specific boundaries the validity of the logical process beyond finite ends breaks down we make our truth for our visible purposes as we go along and if it does not work we make it afresh we see life once more as gallant experiment the boundaries of our universe recede not only in time and space but thought the hardandfast line between the scientific and the poetic method disappears  and you get bergson said wilkins triumphantly  bergson is of that class and type that exploits the affairs of thought but i refuse to have pragmatism judged by bergson he takes hold of the unfinished inquiries that constitute the movement of pragmatism and he makes a soft scepticism for delicate minds with easy ways back to any oldestablished orthodoxy they may regret  but here is my case again said wilkins it is only through bergson that the mind of the race the great operating mass mind out there can take hold of this new system of ideas   ยง 3  but now boon and wilkins were fairly launched upon a vital and entirely inconclusive controversy was the thought process of the world growing spreading progressing or was it going to pieces the one produced a hundred instances of the enlarging and quickening of mens minds the other replied by instancing vulgarities distortions wide acceptance of nonsense did public advertisements make a more intelligent or less intelligent appeal now than they used to do for half an afternoon they fought over the alleged degeneration of the times multiplying instances comparing the parnellism and crime pamphlet with lord northcliffes war indiscretions and discussing the comparative merits of mr moberly bells campaign to sell the twentyyearold encyclopรฆdia britannica and found a book club that should abolish booksellers with the displayed and illustrated advertisements of the new period  the talk you see went high and low and came to no conclusion but i think that on the whole wilkins did succeed in shaking boons halfmystical confidence in the inevitableness of human wisdom the honours i think lay with wilkins boon did seem to establish that in physical science there had been and was still a great and growing process but he was not able to prove he could only express his faith that the empire of sanity was spreading to greater and more human issues he had to fall back upon prophecy presently there would be another big lunge forward and so forth but wilkins on his side was able to make a case for a steady rotting in political life an increase in loudness emptiness and violence in the last twenty years he instanced carsonism the methods of tariff reform the vehement feminist movement the malignant silliness of the rebel labour press the rankness of german patriotism  but there are young people thinking said boon at last it isnt just these matured showings where one youth thought thirty years ago fifty are thinking now these wild loud things are just an irruption just an irruption  the mocker was distressed  the idea of active intellectual wrongness distressed him so much that he cast aside all his detachment from hallery and showed plainly that to this imaginary hallerys idea of a secular growth of wisdom in mankind he himself was quite passionately clinging   ยง 4  he was so distressed that one day he talked about it to me alone for some time  wilkins he said insists on facts it is difficult to argue with him on that basis you see i dont intend hallerys view to be an induction from facts its a conviction an intuition it is not the sort of thing one perceives after reading the newspaper placards or looking at the bookshelves in the british museum its something one knows for certain in the middle of the night there is the mind of the race i mean it is something general it is a refuge from the particular and it is in the nature of god thats plain isnt it and through it there is communion these phases these irruptions are incidents if all the world went frantic if presently some horrible thing some monstrous war smashed all books and thinking and civilization still the mind would be there it would immediately go on again and presently it would pick up all that had been done beforejust as a philosopher would presently go on reading again after the servantgirl had fallen downstairs with the crockery it keeps on anyhow  oh i dont know how my dear fellow i cant explain im not telling you of something ive reasoned out and discovered im telling you of something i know its faith if you like it keeps on and i know it keeps onalthough i cant for the life of me tell how  he stopped he flushed  that you see is hallerys point of view he said awkwardly  but wilkins perhaps wouldnt contradict that his point is merely that to be exact about words that godmind that general mind of yours isnt exactly to be called the mind of the race  but it is the mind of the race said boon it is the mind of the race most of the race is out of touch with it lost to it much of the race is talking and doing nonsense and cruelty astray absurd that does not matter to the truth bliss it matters to literature it matters because literature the clearing of minds the release of minds the food and guidance of minds is the way literature is illumination the salvation of ourselves and of every one from isolations  might be i suggested  must be he said oh i know ive lived behind miss bathwick but im breaking out one of these days i will begin to dictate to herand not mind what she does im a successful nobodysuperficiallyand its only through my private thoughts and private jeering that ive come to see these things     chapter the eighth  the beginning of the wild asses of the devil   ยง 1  one day a little time after the argument with wilkins boon told me he would read me a story he read it from a pencilled manuscript after some anxious seeking i have found most of it again and put it together only a few pages are missing here is the story i am sorry to say it was never finished but he gave me a very clear conception of the contemplated end that i will indicate in its place and i think you will see how its idea springs from the talk with wilkins i have had to render in the previous chapter   ยง 2  there was once an author who pursued fame and prosperity in a pleasant villa on the south coast of england he wrote stories of an acceptable nature and rejoiced in a growing public esteem carefully offending no one and seeking only to please he had married under circumstances of qualified and tolerable romance a lady who wrote occasional but otherwise regular verse he was the father of a little daughter whose reported sayings added much to his popularity and some of the very best people in the land asked him to dinner he was a deputylieutenant and a friend of the prime minister a literary knighthood was no remote possibility for him and even the nobel prize given a sufficient longevity was not altogether beyond his hopes and this amount of prosperity had not betrayed him into any unenglish pride he remembered that manliness and simplicity which are expected from authors he smoked pipes and not the excellent cigars he could have afforded he kept his hair cut and never posed he did not hold himself aloof from people of the inferior and less successful classes he habitually travelled third class in order to study the characters he put into his delightful novels he went for long walks and sat in inns accosting people he drew out his gardener and though he worked steadily he did not give up the care of his body which threatened a certain plumpness and what is more to the point a localized plumpness not generally spread over the system but exaggerating the anterior equator this expansion was his only care he thought about fitness and played tennis and every day wet or fine he went for at least an hours walk  yet this man so representative of edwardian literaturefor it is in the reign of good king edward the story beginsin spite of his enviable achievements and prospects was doomed to the most exhausting and dubious adventures before his life came to its unhonoured end  because i have not told you everything about him sometimesin the morning sometimeshe would be irritable and have quarrels with his shaving things and there were extraordinary moods when it would seem to him that living quite beautifully in a pleasant villa and being welloff and famous and writing books that were always goodhumoured and grammatical and a little distinguished in an inoffensive way was about as boring and intolerable a life as any creature with a soul to be damned could possibly pursue which shows only that god in putting him together had not forgotten that viscus the liver which is usual on such occasions  illustration  the winter at the seaside is less agreeable and more bracing than the summer and there were days when this author had almost to force himself through the wholesome necessary routines of his life when the southwest wind savaged his villa and roared in the chimneys and slapped its windows with gustsful of rain and promised to wet that author thoroughly and exasperatingly down his neck and round his wrists and ankles directly he put his nose outside his door and the grey waves he saw from his window came rolling inshore under the hurrying grey rainbursts line after line to smash along the undercliff into vast feathering fountains of foam and sud and send a salttasting spindrift into his eyes but manfully he would put on his puttees and his waterproof cape and his biggest brierwood pipe and out he would go into the whurryballoo of it all knowing that so he would be all the brighter for his nice storywriting after tea  on such a day he went out he went out very resolutely along the seaside gardens of gravel and tamarisk and privet resolved to oblige himself to go right past the harbour and up to the top of the east cliff before ever he turned his face back to the comforts of fire and wife and tea and buttered toast  and somewhere perhaps half a mile away from home he became aware of a queer character trying to keep abreast of him  his impression was of a very miserable black man in the greasy blueblack garments of a stoker a lascar probably from a steamship in the harbour and going with a sort of lame hobble  as he passed this individual the author had a transitory thought of how much authors dont know in the world how much for instance this shivering cringing body might be hiding within itself of inestimable value as local colour if only one could get hold of it for putting into ones large acceptable novels why doesnt one sometimes tap these sources kipling for example used to do so with most successful results and then the author became aware that this enigma was hurrying to overtake him he slackened his pace  the creature wasnt asking for a light it was begging for a box of matches and what was odd in quite good english  the author surveyed the beggar and slapped his pockets never had he seen so miserable a face it was by no means a prepossessing face with its aquiline nose its sloping brows its dark deep bloodshot eyes much too close together its vshaped dishonest mouth and drenched chintuft and yet it was attractively animal and pitiful the idea flashed suddenly into the authors head why not instead of going on thinking emptily through this beastly weatherwhy not take this man back home now to the warm dry study and give him a hot drink and something to smoke and draw him out  get something technical and firsthand that would rather score off kipling  its damnably cold he shouted in a sort of hearty forecastle voice  its worse than that said the strange stoker  its a hell of a day said the author more forcible than ever  dont remind me of hell said the stoker in a voice of inappeasable regret  the author slapped his pockets again youve got an infernal cold look here my manconfound it would you like a hot grog  illustration   ยง 3  the scene shifts to the authors studya blazing coal fire the stoker sitting dripping and steaming before it with his feet inside the fender while the author fusses about the room directing the preparation of hot drinks the author is acutely aware not only of the stoker but of himself the stoker has probably never been in the home of an author before he is probably awestricken at the array of books at the comfort convenience and efficiency of the home at the pleasant personality entertaining him meanwhile the author does not forget that the stoker is material is copy is being watched observed so he poses and watches until presently he forgets to pose in his astonishment at the thing he is observing because this stoker is rummier than a stoker ought to be  he does not simply accept a hot drink he informs his host just how hot the drink must be to satisfy him  isnt there something you could put in itsomething called red pepper ive tasted that once or twice its good if you could put in a bit of red pepper  if you can stand that sort of thing  and if there isnt much water cant you set light to the stuff or let me drink it boiling out of a pannikin or something pepper and all  wonderful fellows these stokers the author went to the bell and asked for red pepper  and then as he came back to the fire he saw something that he instantly dismissed as an optical illusion as a mirage effect of the clouds of steam his guest was disengaging the stoker was sitting all crouched up as close over the fire as he could contrive and he was holding his black hands not to the fire but in the fire holding them pressed flat against two red glowing masses of coal he glanced over his shoulder at the author with a guilty start and then instantly the author perceived that the hands were five or six inches away from the coal  then came smoking the author produced one of his big cigarsfor although a conscientious pipesmoker himself he gave people cigars and then again struck by something odd he went off into a corner of the room where a little oval mirror gave him a means of watching the stoker undetected and this is what he saw  he saw the stoker after a furtive glance at him deliberately turn the cigar round place the lighted end in his mouth inhale strongly and blow a torrent of sparks and smoke out of his nose his firelit face as he did this expressed a diabolical relief then very hastily he reversed the cigar again and turned round to look at the author the author turned slowly towards him  you like that cigar he asked after one of those mutual pauses that break down a pretence  its admirable  why do you smoke it the other way round  the stoker perceived he was caught its a stokehole trick he said do you mind if i do it i didnt think you saw  pray smoke just as you like said the author and advanced to watch the operation  it was exactly like the fireeater at a village fair the man stuck the burning cigar into his mouth and blew sparks out of his nostrils ah he said with a note of genuine satisfaction and then with the cigar still burning in the corner of his mouth he turned to the fire and began to rearrange the burning coals with his hands so as to pile up a great glowing mass he picked up flaming and whitehot lumps as one might pick up lumps of sugar the author watched him dumbfounded  i say he cried you stokers get a bit tough  the stoker dropped the glowing piece of coal in his hand i forgot he said and sat back a little  isnt that a bitextra asked the author regarding him isnt that some sort of trick  we get so tough down there said the stoker and paused discreetly as the servant came in with the red pepper  now you can drink said the author and set himself to mix a drink of a pungency that he would have considered murderous ten minutes before when he had done the stoker reached over and added more red pepper  i dont quite see how it is your hand doesnt burn said the author as the stoker drank the stoker shook his head over the uptilted glass  incombustible he said putting it down could i have just a tiny drop more just brandy and pepper if you dont mind set alight i dont care for water except when its superheated steam  and as the author poured out another stiff glass of this incandescent brew the stoker put up his hand and scratched the matted black hair over his temple then instantly he desisted and sat looking wickedly at the author while the author stared at him aghast for at the corner of his square high narrow forehead revealed for an instant by the thrusting back of the hair a curious stumpy excrescence had been visible and the top of his earhe had a pointed top to his ear  aaaah said the author with dilated eyes  aaaah said the stoker in hopeless distress  but you arent  i knowi know im not i know im a devil a poor lost homeless devil  and suddenly with a gesture of indescribable despair the apparent stoker buried his face in his hands and burst into tears  only man whos ever been decently kind to me he sobbed and nowyoull chuck me out again into the beastly wet and cold beautiful fire nice drink almost homelike just to torment me booooh  and let it be recorded to the credit of our little author that he did overcome his momentary horror that he did go quickly round the table and that he patted that dirty stokers shoulder  there he said there dont mind my rudeness have another nice drink have a hell of a drink i wont turn you out if youre unhappyon a day like this have just a mouthful of pepper man and pull yourself together  and suddenly the poor devil caught hold of his arm nobody good to me he sobbed nobody good to me and his tears ran down over the authors plump little handscalding tears   ยง 4  all really wonderful things happen rather suddenly and without any great emphasis upon their wonderfulness and this was no exception to the general rule this author went on comforting his devil as though this was nothing more than a chance encounter with an unhappy child and the devil let his grief and discomfort have vent in a manner that seemed at the time as natural as anything could be he was clearly a devil of feeble character and uncertain purpose much broken down by harshness and cruelty and it throws a curious light upon the general state of misconception with regard to matters diabolical that it came as a quite pitiful discovery to our author that a devil could be unhappy and heartbroken for a long time his most earnest and persistent questioning could gather nothing except that his guest was an exile from a land of great warmth and considerable entertainment and it was only after considerable further applications of brandy and pepper that the sobbing confidences of the poor creature grew into the form of a coherent and understandable narrative  and then it became apparent that this person was one of the very lowest types of infernal denizen and that his role in the dark realms of dis had been that of watcher and minder of a herd of sinister beings hitherto unknown to our author the devils wild asses which pastured in a stretch of meadows near the styx they were he gathered unruly dangerous and enterprising beasts amenable only to a certain formula of expletives which instantly reduced them to obedience these expletives the stokerdevil would not repeat to do so except when actually addressing one of the wild asses would he explained involve torments of the most terrible description the bare thought of them gave him a shivering fit but he gave the author to understand that to crack these curses as one drove the wild asses to and from their grazing on the elysian fields was a by no means disagreeable amusement the assherds would try who could crack the loudest until the welkin rang  and speaking of these things the poor creature gave a picture of diabolical life that impressed the author as by no means unpleasant for any one with a suitable constitution it was like the idylls of theocritus done in fire the devils drove their charges along burning lanes and sat gossiping in hedges of flames rejoicing in the warm dry breezes which it seems are rendered peculiarly bracing by the faint flavour of brimstone in the air and watching the harpies and furies and witches circling in the perpetual afterglow of that inferior sky and ever and again there would be holidays and one would take ones lunch and wander over the sulphur craters picking flowers of sulphur or fishing for the souls of usurers and publishers and houseagents and landagents in the lakes of boiling pitch it was good sport for the usurers and publishers and houseagents and landagents were always eager to be caught they crowded round the hooks and fought violently for the bait and protested vehemently and entertainingly against the rules and regulations that compelled their instant return to the lake of fire  and sometimes when he was on holiday this particular devil would go through the saltpetre dunes where the witchesbrooms grow and the blasted heath is in flower to the landingplace of the ferry whence the great road runs through the shops and banks of the via dolorosa to the new judgement hall and watch the crowds of damned arriving by the steam ferryboats of the consolidated charon company this steamboatgazing seems about as popular down there as it is at folkestone almost every day notable people arrive and as the devils are very well informed about terrestrial affairsfor of course all the earthly newspapers go straight to hellwhatever else could one expectthey get ovations of an almost undergraduate intensity at times you can hear their cheering or booing as the case may be right away on the pastures where the wild asses feed and that had been this particular devils undoing  he had always been interested in the career of the rt hon w e gladstone  he was minding the wild asses he knew the risks he knew the penalties but when he heard the vast uproar when he heard the eager voices in the lane of fire saying its gladstone at last when he saw how quietly and unsuspiciously the wild asses cropped their pasture the temptation was too much he slipped away he saw the great englishman landed after a slight struggle he joined in the outcry of speech speech he heard the first delicious promise of a home rule movement which should break the last feeble links of celestial control  and meanwhile the wild asses escapedaccording to the rules and the prophecies   ยง 5  the little author sat and listened to this tale of a wonder that never for a moment struck him as incredible and outside his rainlashed window the strungout fishing smacks pitched and rolled on their way home to folkestone harbour  the wild asses escaped  they got away to the world and his superior officers took the poor herdsman and tried him and bullied him and passed this judgement upon him that he must go to the earth and find the wild asses and say to them that certain string of oaths that otherwise must never be repeated and so control them and bring them back to hell thator else one pinch of salt on their tails it did not matter which one by one he must bring them back driving them by spell and curse to the cattleboat of the ferry and until he had caught and brought them all back he might never return again to the warmth and comfort of his accustomed life that was his sentence and punishment and they put him into a shrapnel shell and fired him out among the stars and when he had a little recovered he pulled himself together and made his way to the world  but he never found his wild asses and after a little time he gave up trying  he gave up trying because the wild asses once they had got out of control developed the most amazing gifts they could for instance disguise themselves with any sort of human shape and the only way in which they differed then from a normal human being wasaccording to the printed paper of instructions that had been given to their custodian when he was fired outthat their general conduct remains that of a wild ass of the devil  and what interpretation can we put upon that he asked the listening author  and there was one night in the yearwalpurgis night when the wild asses became visibly great black wild asses and kicked up their hind legs and brayed they had to but then of course said the devil they would take care to shut themselves up somewhere when they felt that coming on  like most weak characters the stoker devil was intensely egotistical he was anxious to dwell upon his own miseries and discomforts and difficulties and the general injustice of his treatment and he was careless and casually indicative about the peculiarities of the wild asses the matter which most excited and interested the author he bored on with his doleful story and the author had to interrupt with questions again and again in order to get any clear idea of the situation  the devils main excuse for his nervelessness was his profound ignorance of human nature so far as i can see he said they might all be wild asses i tried it once  tried what  the formula you know  yes  on a man named sir edward carson  well  ugh said the devil  punishment  dont speak of it he was just a professional lawyerpolitician who had lost his sense of values how was i to know but our people certainly know how to hurt  after that it would seem this poor devil desisted absolutely from any attempt to recover his lost charges he just tried to live for the moment and make his earthly existence as tolerable as possible it was clear he hated the world he found it cold wet draughty i cant understand why everybody insists upon living outside of it he said if you went inside  he sought warmth and dryness for a time he found a kind of contentment in charge of the upcast furnace of a mine and then he was superseded by an electricfan while in this position he read a vivid account of the intense heat in the red sea and he was struck by the idea that if he could get a job as stoker upon an indian liner he might snatch some days of real happiness during that portion of the voyage for some time his natural ineptitude prevented his realizing this project but at last after some bitter experiences of homelessness during a london december he had been able to ship on an indiaward boatonly to get stranded in folkestone in consequence of a propeller breakdown and so here he was  he paused  but about these wild asses said the author  the mournful dark eyes looked at him hopelessly  mightnt they do a lot of mischief asked the author  theyll do no end of mischief said the despondent devil  ultimately youll catch it for that  ugh said the stoker trying not to think of it   ยง 6  now the spirit of romantic adventure slumbers in the most unexpected places and i have already told you of our plump authors discontents he had been like a smouldering bomb for some years now he burst out he suddenly became excited energetic stimulating uplifting  illustration the author uplifts the devil  he stood over the drooping devil  but my dear chap he said you must pull yourself together you must do better than this these confounded brutes may be doing all sorts of mischief while youshirk  and so on real ginger  if i had some one to go with me some one who knew his way about  the author took whisky in the excitement of the moment he began to move very rapidly about his room and make short sharp gestures you know how this sort of emotion wells up at times we must work from some central place said the author to begin with london perhaps  it was not two hours later that they started this author and this devil he had taken to himself upon a mission they went out in overcoats and warm underclothingthe author gave the devil a thorough outfit a double lot of jaegers extra thickand they were resolved to find the wild asses of the devil and send them back to hell or at least the author was in the shortest possible time in the picture you will see him with a fieldglass slung under his arm the better to watch suspected cases in his pocket wrapped in oiled paper is a lot of salt to use if by chance he finds a wild ass when the devil and his string of oaths is not at hand so he started and when he had caught and done for the wild asses then the author supposed that he would come back to his nice little villa and his nice little wife and to his little daughter who said the amusing things and to his popularity his large giltedged popularity andexcept for an added prestigebe just exactly the man he had always been little knowing that whosoever takes unto himself a devil and goes out upon a quest goes out upon a quest from which there is no returning  nevermore  illustration precipitate start of the wild ass hunters     chapter the ninth  the hunting of the wild asses of the devil   ยง 1  at this point the surviving manuscript comes to an abrupt end  but boon read or extemporized far beyond this point  he made a figure that was at once absurd and pitiful of his little author making this raid upon the world resolved to detect and exorcise these suspected wild asses and he told us at great length of how steadily and inevitably the poor enthusiast entangled himself in feuds and false accusations libels and denunciations free fights burglaries and so to universal execration in a perpetually tightening coil ill stick to it he squeaks with every fresh blow of fate behind him with a developing incurable bronchitis that could never be fatal toiled the devil more and more despondent more and more draggletailed voiceless and unhelpful  after a time he was perpetually trying to give his author the slip  but continually it is clearer that there were diabolical wild asses loose and active in the affairs of the world  one day the author had an inspiration was your lot the only lot that ever escaped  oh no said the devil ages beforethere were some it led to an awful row just before the flood they had to be drowned out thats why theyve been so stiff with me im not quite sure whether they didnt interbreed they say in hell that the world has never been quite the same place since  you see the scope this story gave boons disposition to derision there were endless things that boon hated movements that seemed to him wanton and mischievous outbreaks of disastrous violence evil ideas i should get myself into as much hot water as his author did if i were to tell all this poor mans adventures he went to ulster he pursued prominent tariff reformers he started off to mexico and came back to investigate pangermanism i seem to remember his hanging for days about the entrance to printing house square and there was a scene in the house of commons the author and the devil had been tracking a prominent politiciannever mind whomwith the growing belief that here at last they had one of them and walpurgis night grew near walpurgis night came  we must not lose sight of him said the author very alert and ruthless if necessary we must smash the windows blow open doors  but the great man went down to the house as though nothing could possibly happen they followed him  he will certainly rush home said the author as the clock crept round to halfpast eleven but anyhow let us get into the strangers gallery and keep our eyes on him to the last  they managed it with difficulty  i remember how vividly boon drew the picture for us the rather bored house a coming and going of a few inattentive members the nodding speaker and the clerks the silent watchers in the gallery a little flicker of white behind the grille and then at five minutes to twelve the honourable member arose  we were wrong said the author  the draught here is fearful said the devil hadnt we better go  the honourable member went on speaking showy memorable mischievous things the seconds ticked away and thenthen it happened  the author made a faint rattling sound in his throat and clung to the rail before him the devil broke into a cold sweat there visible to all men was a large black wild ass kicking up its heels upon the floor of the house and braying  and nobody was minding  the speaker listened patiently one long finger against his cheek the clerks bowed over the papers the honourable members two colleagues listened like men under an anรฆsthetic each sideways each with his arm over the back of the seat across the house one member was furtively writing a letter and three others were whispering together  the author felt for the salt then he gripped the devils wrist  say those words he shouted quite loudlysay those words say them now thenwe shall have him  but you know those house of commons ushers and at that time their usual alertness had been much quickened by several suffragette outrages before the devil had got through his second sentence or the author could get his salt out of his pocket both devil and author were travelling violently scruff and pantseat irresistibly gripped down saint stephens hall   ยง 2  and you really begin to think said wilkins that there has been an increase in violence and unreasonableness in the world  my case is that it is an irruption said boon but i do begin to see a sort of violence of mind and act growing in the world  there has always been something convulsive and extravagant in human affairs said wilkins no public thing no collective thing has ever had the sanity of men thinking quietly in a study  and so we fell to discussing the mind of the race again and whether there was indeed any sanity growing systematically out of human affairs or whether this mind of the race was just a poor tormented rag of partial understanding that would never control the blind forces that had made and would destroy it and it was inevitable that such a talk should presently drift to the crowning human folly to that crowned wild ass of the devil aggressive militarism that talk was going on i remember one very bright warm sunny day in may or it may be in june of 1914 and we talked of militarism as a flourish as a kicking up of the national heels as extravagance and waste but what seems to me so singular now we none of us spoke of it or thought of it as a thing that could lead to the full horror of a universal war human memory is so strange and treacherous a thing that i doubt now if many english people will recall our habitual disregard in those days of war as a probability we thought of it as a costly foolish threatening but that it could actually happen   ยง 3  some things are so shocking that they seem to have given no shock at all just as there are noises that are silences because they burst the ears and for some days after the declaration of war against germany the whole business seemed a vast burlesque it was incredible that this great people for whom all western europe has mingled and will to the end of time mingle admiration with a certain humorous contempt was really advancing upon civilization enormously armed scrupulously prepared bellowing deutschland deutschland ueber alles smashing destroying killing we felt for a time in spite of reason that it was a joke that presently michael would laugh  but by jove the idiot wasnt laughing  for some weeks nobody in the circle about boon talked of anything but the war the wild asses of the devil became an allusion to indicate all this that was kicking europe to splinters we got maps and still more maps we sent into the town for newspapers and got special intelligence by telephone we repeated and discussed rumours the belgians were showing pluck and resource but the french were obviously shockingly unprepared there were weeksone may confess it now that they have so abundantly proved the contrarywhen the french seemed crumpling up like pasteboard they were failing to save the line of the meuse maubeuge lille laon there were surrenders there was talk of treachery and general french left with his flank exposed made a costly retreat it was one sunday in early september that wilkins came to us with a sunday observer look he said they are down on the seine they are sweeping right round behind the eastern line they have broken the french in two here at senlis they are almost within sight of paris  then some london eavesdropper talked of the british retreat kitchener says our army has lost half its fighting value our base is to be moved again from havre to la rochelle  boon sat on the edge of his hammock  the germans must be beaten he said the new world is killed we go back ten thousand years there is no light no hope no thought nor freedom any more unless the germans are beaten until the germans are beaten there is nothing more to be done in art in literature in life they are a dull envious greedy cunning vulgar interfering and intolerably conceited people a world under their dominance will be intolerable i will not live in it  i had never believed they would do it said wilkins  both my boys said dodd have gone into the officers training corps they were in their cadet corps at school  wasnt one an engineer asked boon  the other was beginning to paint rather well said dodd but it all has to stop  i suppose i shall have to do something said the london eavesdropper im thirtyeight i can ride and im pretty fit its a nuisance  what is a man of my kind to do asked wilkins im fortyeight  i cant believe the french are as bad as they seem said boon but anyhow weve no business to lean on the french but i wonder now pass me that map   ยง 4  next week things had mended and the french and british were pushing the germans back from the marne to the aisne whatever doubts we had felt about the french were dispelled in that swift week of recovery they were all right it was a stupendous relief for if france had gone down if her spirit had failed us then we felt all liberalism all republicanism all freedom and light would have gone out in this world for centuries  but then again at the aisne the germans stood and our brisk rush of hope sobered down towards anxiety as the long flanking movement stretched towards the sea and the antwerp situation developed  by imperceptible degrees our minds began to free themselves from the immediate struggle of the war from strategy and movements from the daily attempt to unriddle from reluctant and ambiguous dispatches dutch rumours censored gaps and uninforming maps what was happening it became clear to us that there were to be no particular dramatic strokes no sudden decisive battles no swift and clear conclusions the struggle began to assume in our minds its true proportions its true extent in time in space in historical consequence we had thought of a dramatic three months conflict and a redrawn map of europe we perceived we were in the beginnings of a far vaster conflict the end of an age the slow murderous testing and condemnation of whole systems of ideas that had bound men uneasily in communities for all our lives we discussedas all the world was discussingthe huge organization of sentiment and teaching that had produced this aggressive german patriotism this tremendous national unanimity ford madox hueffer came in to tell us stories of a disciplined professoriate of all education turned into a war propaganda of the deliberate official mental moulding of a whole people that was at once fascinating and incredible we went over bernhardi and treitschke we weighed nietzsches share in that mental growth our talk drifted with the changing season and boons sudden illness after his chill from his garden to his sittingroom where he lay wrapped up upon a sofa irritable and impatient with this unaccustomed experience of illhealth  you see how much easier it is to grow an evil weed than a wholesome plant he said while this great strong wickedness has developed in germany what thought have we had in our englishspeaking community what does our world of letters amount to clowns and dons and prigs cults of the precious and cults of style a few squeaking authorjournalists and such timeserving scoundrels as i with my patent bathwick filter my twenty editions and my thousands a year none of us with any sense of a whole community or a common purpose where is our strength to go against that strength of the heavy german mind where is the mind of our race  he looked at me with tired eyes  it has been a joke with us he said  is there no power of thought among free men strong enough to swing them into armies that can take this monster by the neck must men be bullied for ever are there no men to think at least as earnestly as one climbs a mountain and to write with their uttermost pride are there no men to face truth as those boys at mons faced shrapnel and to stick for the honour of the mind and for truth and beauty as those lads stuck to their trenches bliss and i have tried to write of all the world of letters and we have found nothing to write about but posturing and competition and sham reputations and of dullness and impudence hiding and sheltering in the very sheath of the sword of thought for a little while after the war began our people seemed noble and dignified but see now how all britain breaks after its first quiet into chatter about spies sentimentality about the architecture of louvain invasion scares the bitter persecution of stray germans and petty disputes and recriminations like a pool under a breeze and below that nothing while still the big thing goes on ungrasped day after day a monstrous struggle of our world against the thing it will not have no one is clear about what sort of thing we will have it is a nightmare in which we try continually to escape and have nowhither to escape what is to come out of this struggle just anything that may come out of it or something we mean shall come out of it  he sat up in his bed his eyes were bright and he had little red spots in his cheeks  at least the germans stand for something it may be brutal stupid intolerable but there it isa definite intention a scheme of living an order germanic kultur but what the devil do we stand for was there anything that amounted to an intellectual life at all in all our beastly welter of writing of niceyoungman poetry of stylish fiction and fiction without style of lazy history popular philosophy slobbering criticism academic civilities is there anything here to hold a people together is there anything to make a new world a literature ought to dominate the mind of its people yet here comes the gale and all we have to show for our racial thought all the fastness we have made for our souls is a flying scud of paper scraps poems such poems casual articles whirling headlong in the air a few novels drowning in the floods   ยง 5  there were times during his illness and depression when we sat about boon very much after the fashion of jobs comforters and i remember an occasion when wilkins took upon himself the responsibility for a hopeful view there was about wilkinss realistic sentimentality something at once akin and repugnant to boons intellectual mysticism so that for a time boon listened resentfully and then was moved to spirited contradiction wilkins declared that the war was like one of those great illnesses that purge the system of a multitude of minor ills it was changing the spirit of life about us it would end a vast amount of mere pleasureseeking and aimless extravagance it was giving people a sterner sense of duty and a more vivid apprehension of human brotherhood this ineffective triviality in so much of our literary life of which boon complained would give place to a sense of urgent purpose  war said boon turning his face towards wilkins does nothing but destroy  all making is destructive said wilkins while boon moved impatiently the sculptor destroys a block of marble the painter scatters a tube of paint  boons eye had something of the expression of a man who watches another ride his favourite horse  see already the new gravity in peoples faces the generosities the pacification of a thousand stupid squabbles  if you mean carsonism said boon its only sulking until it can cut in again  i deny it said wilkins warming to his faith this is the firing of the clay of western european life it stops our little arts perhapsbut see the new beauty that comes we can well spare our professional books and professional writing for a time to get such humour and wonder as one can find in the soldiers letters from the front think of all the people whose lives would have been slack and ignoble from the cradle to the grave who are being twisted up now to the stern question of enlistment think of the tragedies of separation and danger and suffering that are throwing a stern bright light upon ten thousand obscure existences  and the noble procession of poor devils tramping through the slush from their burning homes god knows whither and the light of fire appearing through the cracks of falling walls and charred bits of old people in the slush of the roadside and the screams of men disembowelled and the crying of a dying baby in a wet shed full of starving refugees who do not know whither to go go on wilkins  oh if you choose to dwell on the horrors  the one decent thing that we men who sit at home in the warm can do is to dwell on the horrors and do our little best to make sure that never never shall this thing happen again and that wont be done wilkins by leaving war alone war war with modern machines is a damned great horrible trampling monster a filthy thing an indecency we arent doing anything heroic we are trying to lift a foul stupidity off the earth we are engaged in a colossal sanitary job these men who go for us into the trenches they come back with no illusions they know how dirty and monstrous it is they are like men who have gone down for the sake of the people they love to clear out a choked drain they have no illusions about being glorified they only hope they arent bloodpoisoned and their bodies altogether ruined and as for the bracing stir of it they tell me wilkins that their favourite song now in the trenches is    nobody knows how bored we are       bored we are       bored we are   nobody knows how bored we are       and nobody seems to care  meanwhile you sit at home and feel vicariously ennobled  he laid his hand on a daily newspaper beside him  oh youre not the only one i will make you ashamed of yourself wilkins heres the superlative to your positive heres the sort of man i should like to hold for five minutes head downwards in

ancient times of the state that lives by and     for warfare though never despising the rewards of an astute     diplomacy she was the prussia of antiquity      spartan ideal of duty and discipline  you see the spirit of him you see what has got loose it is a real and potent spirit you have to reckon with it through all this business to this sort of mind the pacificist is a hateful fool the pacificist prefers making vineyards painting pictures building gothic cathedrals thinking clear thoughts to bawling bruteland bruteland over all and killing people and smashing things up he is a maker that is what is intended here by a coward all real creative activity is hateful to a certain ugly influential aggressive type of mind to this type of mind that expresses itself here in england through the morning post and spectator both these papers are soaked through and through with a genuine detestation of all fine creation all beauty all novelty all frank generous and pleasant things in peacetime they maintain an attitude of dyspeptic hostility to free art to free literature to fresh thought they stand uncompromisingly for ugliness dullness and restrictionas ends in themselves when you talk wilkins of the intellectual good of the war i ask you to note the new exultation that has come into these evil papers when they speak of the moral benefits of war they mean the smashing up of everything that they hate and we care for they mean reaction this good man osborn whom i have never seen or heard of before seems to be quintessential of all that side i can imagine him i believe i could reconstruct him from this article i have here just as anatomists have reconstructed extinct monsters from a single bone he is i am certain a don the emotional note suggests oxford he is a classical scholar and that is the extent of his knowledge something in this way  he began to sketch rapidly  illustration fancy portrait of mr e b osborn singing about his sword and his shield and his ruthless virility and all that sort of thing  you have to realize that while the pacificists talk of the horrible ugliness of war and the necessity of establishing an everlasting worldpeace whiskered old ladies in hydropaths dons on the morning post chattering district visitors and blustering bellowing parsons people who are ever so much more representative of general humanity than we literary odditiesall that sort of people tucked away somewhere safe are in a state of belligerent lustfulness and preparedoh prepared to give the very eyes of everybody else in this country prepared to sacrifice the lives of all their servants and see the poor taxed to the devil first for a victory over germany and then for the closest silliest loudest imitation of prussian swagger on our part with them of course on the very top of it all that we can contrive that spirit is loose wilkins all the dowagers are mewing for blood all the male old women who teach classics and dream of reaction at oxford and cambridge are having the time of their lives they trust to panic to loud accusations to that fear of complexity that comes with fatigue they trust to the exhaustion of delicate purposes and sensitive nerves and this forceloving bullying silliness is far more likely to come out on top after the distresses of this war after the decent men are dead in the trenches and the wise ones shouted to silence than any finely intellectual necessarily difficult plan to put an end for ever to all such senseless brutalities  i think you underrate the power ofwell modern sanity said wilkins  time will show said boon i hope i do  this man osborn whoever he may be must be just a fantastic extremist i do not see that he is an answer to my suggestion that for the whole mass of people this war means graver thought steadier thought a firmer collective purpose it isnt only by books and formal literature that people think there is the tremendous effect of realized and accumulated facts  wilkins said boon do not cuddle such illusions it is only in books and writings that facts get assembled people are not grasping any comprehensive effects at all at the present time one day one monstrous thing batters on our mindsa battleship is blown up or a hundred villagers murderedand next day it is another we do not so much think about it as get mentally scarred you can see in this spy hunt that is going on and in the increasing denunciations and wrangling of the papers how the strain is telling attention is overstrained and warms into violence people are reading no books they are following out no conclusions no intellectual force whatever is evident dominating the situation no organization is at work for a sane peace where is any power for pacificism where is any strength on its side america is far too superior to do anything but trade the liberals here sniff at each other and quarrel gently but firmly on minor points mr norman angell advertises himself in a small magazine and resents any other work for peace as though it were an infringement of his copyright read the daily papers go and listen to the talk of people dont theorize but watch the mind you will meet is not in the least like a mind doing something slowly but steadfastly far more is it like a mind being cruelly smashed about and worried and sticking to its immediate purpose with a narrower and narrower intensity until at last it is a pointed intensity it is like a dying man strangling a robber in his deathgrip we shall beat them but we shall be dead beat doing it you see wilkins i have tried to think as you do in a sort of way this war has inverted our relations i say these things now because they force themselves upon me  wilkins considered for some moments  even if nothing new appears he said at last the mere beating down and discrediting of the militarist system leaves a world released  but will it be broken down said boon think of the osborns  and then he cried in a voice of infinite despair no war is just the killing of things and the smashing of things and when it is all over then literature and civilization will have to begin all over again they will have to begin lower down and against a heavier load and the days of our jesting are done the wild asses of the devil are loose and there is no restraining them what is the good wilkins of pretending that the wild asses are the instruments of providence kicking better than we know it is all evil evil an evil year and i lie here helpless spitting and spluttering with this chill upon my chest i cannot say or write what i would and in the days of my sunshine there were things i should have written things i should have understood   ยง 6  afterwards boon consoled himself very much for a time by making

war had a profoundly depressing effect upon me i do all in my power to believe that wilkins is right and that the hopelessness that darkened boons last days was due to the overshadowing of his mind by his illness it was not simply that he despaired of the world at large so far as i am concerned he pointed and barbed his opinion by showing how inevitable it was that the existing publishing and book trade would be shattered to fragments adapted as i am now to the necessities of that trade incapable as i am of the fresh exertions needed to bring me into a successful relationship to the unknown exigencies of the future the sense of complete personal ruin mingled with and intensified the vision he imposed upon me of a world laid waste i lay awake through long stretches of the night contemplating now my own life no longer in its first vigour pinched by harsh necessities and the fiercer competition of a young and needy generation and now all life with its habits and traditions strained and broken my daily fatigues at drill and the universal heavy cold in the head that has oppressed all britain this winter almost more than the war have added their quota to my nightly discomfort and when at last i have slept i have been oppressed with peculiar and melancholy dreams  one is so vividly in my mind that i am obliged to tell it here although i am doubtful whether except by a very extreme stretching of the meaning of words we can really consider it among the remains of george boon  it was one of those dreams of which the scenery is not so much a desolate place as desolation itself and i was there toiling up great steepnesses with a little box of something in my hand and i knew in that queer confused way that is peculiar to dreams that i was not myself but that i was the author who is the hero of the wild asses of the devil and also that i was neither he nor i but all sorts of authors the spirit of authorship no author in particular but the author at large and that since the melancholy devil had deserted mehe had sneaked off heaven knows whitherit rested with me and with me alone to discover and catch and send out of this tormented world those same wild asses of the devil of which you have read and so i had salt in my box attic salt a precious trust the one thing in all the universe with which i could subdue them  and then suddenly there i was amidst all those very asses of which i have told you there they were all about me and they were more wild and horrible than i can describe to you it was not that they were horrible in any particular way they were just horrible and they kicked up far over head and leapt and did not even seem to trouble to elude my poor ineffectual efforts to get within salting distance of them i toiled and i pursued amidst mad mountains that were suddenly marble flights of stairs that sloped and slid me down to precipices over which i floated and then we were in soft places kneedeep in bloodred mud and then they were close to my face eye to eye enormous revolving eyes like the lanterns of lighthouses and then they swept away and always i grew smaller and feebler and more breathless and always they grew larger until only their vast legs danced about me on the sward and all the rest was hidden and all the while i was tugging at my box of attic salt to get it open to get a pinch suddenly i saw they were all coming down upon me and all the magic salt i had was in the box that would not open  i saw the sward they trampled and it was not sward it was living beings men hurt by dreadful wounds and poor people who ran in streaming multitudes under the beating hoofs and a lichenous growth of tender things and beautiful and sweet and right things on which they beat splashing it all to blood and dirt i could not open my box i could not open my box and a voice said your box your box laugh at them for the fools they are and at the salt sting of laughter back they will fly to hell  but i could not open my box for i thought of my friends sons and dear friends of my own and there was no more spirit in me we cannot laugh i cried we cannot laugh another generation another generation may have the heart to do what we cannot do  and the voice said courage only your poor courage can save us  but in my dream i could do no more than weep pitifully and weep and when i woke up my eyes were wet with tears     chapter the tenth  the story of the last trump   ยง 1  after this war said wilkins after its revelation of horrors and waste and destruction it is impossible that people will tolerate any longer that system of diplomacy and armaments and national aggression that has brought this catastrophe upon mankind this is the war that will end war  osborn said boon osborn  but after all the world has seen  the world doesnt see said boon  boons story of the last trump may well come after this to terminate my book it has been by no means an easy task to assemble the various portions of this manuscript it is written almost entirely in pencil and sometimes the writing is so bad as to be almost illegible but here at last it is as complete i think as boon meant it to be it is his epitaph upon his dream of the mind of the race   ยง 2  the story of the last trump  the story of the last trump begins in heaven and it ends in all sorts of places round about the world  heaven you must know is a kindly place and the blessed ones do not go on for ever singing alleluia whatever you may have been told for they too are finite creatures and must be fed with their eternity in little bits as one feeds a chick or a child so that there are mornings and changes and freshness there is time to condition their lives and the children are still children gravely eager about their playing and ready always for new things just children they are but blessรจd as you see them in the pictures beneath the careless feet of the lord god and one of these blessรจd children routing about in an atticfor heaven is of course full of the most heavenly attics seeing that it has childrencame upon a number of instruments stored away and laid its little chubby hands upon them  now indeed i cannot tell what these instruments were for to do so would be to invade mysteries but one i may tell of and that was a great brazen trumpet which the lord god had made when he made the worldfor the lord god finishes all his jobsto blow when the time for our judgement came round and he had made it and left it there it was and everything was settled exactly as the doctrine of predestination declares and this blessรจd child conceived one of those unaccountable passions of childhood for its smoothness and brassiness and he played with it and tried to blow it and trailed it about with him out of the attic into the gay and golden streets and after many fitful wanderings to those celestial battlements of crystal of which you have doubtless read and there the blessed child fell to counting the stars and forgot all about the trumpet beside him until a flourish of his elbow sent it over  down fell the trump spinning as it fell and for a day or so which seemed but moments in heaven the blessed child watched its fall until it was a glittering little speck of brightness  when it looked a second time the trump was gone  i do not know what happened to that child when at last it was time for judgement day and that shining trumpet was missed i know that judgement day is long overpassed because of the wickedness of the world i think perhaps it was in ad 1000 when the expected day should have dawned that never came but no other heavenly particulars do i know at all because now my scene changes to the narrow ways of this earth  and the prologue in heaven ends   ยง 3  and now the scene is a dingy little shop in caledonian market where things of an incredible worthlessness lie in wait for such as seek after an impossible cheapness in the window as though it had always been there and never anywhere else lies a long battered discoloured trumpet of brass that no prospective purchaser has ever been able to sound in it mice shelter and dust and fluff have gathered after the fashion of this world the keeper of the shop is a very old man and he bought the shop long ago but already this trumpet was there he has no idea whence it came nor its country or origin nor anything about it but once in a moment of enterprise that led to nothing he decided to call it an ancient ceremonial shawm though he ought to have known that whatever a shawm may be the last thing it was likely to be is a trumpet seeing that they are always mentioned together and above it hung concertinas and melodeons and cornets and tin whistles and mouthorgans and all that rubbish of musical instruments which delight the hearts of the poor until one day two blackened young men from the big motor works in the pansophist road stood outside the window and argued  they argued about these instruments in stock and how you made these instruments sound because they were fond of argument and one asserted and the other denied that he could make every instrument in the place sound a note and the argument rose high and led to a bet  supposing of course that the instrument is in order said hoskin who was betting he could  thats understood said briggs  and then they called as witnesses certain other young and black and greasy men in the same employment and after much argument and discussion that lasted through the afternoon they went in to the little old dealer about teatime just as he was putting a bleareyed stinking paraffinlamp to throw an unfavourable light upon his always very unattractive window and after great difficulty they arranged that for the sum of one shilling paid in advance hoskin should have a try at every instrument in the shop that briggs chose to indicate  and the trial began  the third instrument that was pitched upon by briggs for the trial was the strange trumpet that lay at the bottom of the window the trumpet that you who have read the introduction know was the trumpet for the last trump and hoskin tried and tried again and then blowing desperately hurt his ears but he could get no sound from the trumpet then he examined the trumpet more carefully and discovered the mice and fluff and other things in it and demanded that it should be cleaned and the old dealer nothing loth knowing they were used to automobilehorns and suchlike instruments agreed to let them clean it on condition that they left it shiney so the young men after making a suitable deposit which as you shall hear was presently confiscated went off with the trumpet proposing to clean it next day at the works and polish it with the peculiarly excellent brass polish employed upon the honkhonk horns of the firm and this they did and hoskin tried again  but he tried in vain whereupon there arose a great argument about the trumpet whether it was in order or not whether it was possible for any one to sound it for if not then clearly it was outside the condition of the bet  others among the young men tried it including two who played wind instruments in a band and were musically knowing men after their own failure they were strongly on the side of hoskin and strongly against briggs and most of the other young men were of the same opinion  not a bit of it said briggs who was a man of resource ill show you that it can be sounded  and taking the instrument in his hand he went towards a peculiarly powerful foot blowpipe that stood at the far end of the toolshed good old briggs said one of the other young men and opinion veered about  briggs removed the blowpipe from its bellows and tube and then adjusted the tube very carefully to the mouthpiece of the trumpet then with great deliberation he produced a piece of beeswaxed string from a number of other strange and filthy contents in his pocket and tied the tube to the mouthpiece and then he began to work the treadle of the bellows  good old briggs said the one who had previously admired him  and then something incomprehensible happened  it was a flash whatever else it was it was a flash and a sound that seemed to coincide exactly with the flash  afterwards the young men agreed to it that the trumpet blew to bits it blew to bits and vanished and they were all flung upon their facesnot backward be it noted but on their facesand briggs was stunned and scared the toolshed windows were broken and the various apparatus and cars around were much displaced and no traces of the trumpet were ever discovered  that last particular puzzled and perplexed poor briggs very much it puzzled and perplexed him the more because he had had an impression so extraordinary so incredible that he was never able to describe it to any other living person but his impression was this that the flash that came with the sound came not from the trumpet but to it that it smote down to it and took it and that its shape was in the exact likeness of a hand and arm of fire   ยง 4  and that was not all that was not the only strange thing about the disappearance of that battered trumpet there was something else even more difficult to describe an effect as though for one instant something opened  the young men who worked with hoskin and briggs had that clearness of mind which comes of dealing with machinery and they all felt this indescribable something else as if for an instant the world wasnt the world but something lit and wonderful larger  this is what one of them said of it  i felt he said just for a minuteas though i was blown to kingdom come  it is just how it took me said another lord i says heres judgement day and then there i was sprawling among the flies  but none of the others felt that they could say anything more definite than that   ยง 5  moreover there was a storm all over the world there was a storm that puzzled meteorology a moments gale that left the atmosphere in a state of wild swaygog rains tornadoes depressions irregularities for weeks news came of it from all the quarters of the earth  all over china for example that land of cherished graves there was a duststorm dust leaped into the air a kind of earthquake shook european earthquake that seemed to have at heart the peculiar interests of mr algernon ashton everywhere it cracked mausoleums and shivered the pavements of cathedrals swished the flowerbeds of cemeteries and tossed tombstones aside a crematorium in texas blew up the sea was greatly agitated and the beautiful harbour of sydney in australia was seen to be littered with sharks floating upside down in manifest distress  and all about the world a sound was heard like the sound of a trumpet instantly cut short   ยง 6  but this much is only the superficial dressing of the story the reality is something different it is this that in an instant and for an instant the dead lived and all that are alive in the world did for a moment see the lord god and all his powers his hosts of angels and all his array looking down upon them they saw him as one sees by a flash of lightning in the darkness and then instantly the world was opaque again limited petty habitual that is the tremendous reality of this story such glimpses have happened in individual cases before the lives of the saints abound in them such a glimpse it was that came to devindranath tagore upon the burning ghat at benares but this was not an individual but a world experience the flash came to every one not always was it quite the same and thereby the doubter found his denials when presently a sort of discussion broke out in the obscurer press for this one testified that it seemed that one stood very near to me and another saw all the hosts of heaven flame up towards the throne  and there were others who had a vision of brooding watchers and others who imagined great sentinels before a veiled figure and some one who felt nothing more divine than a sensation of happiness and freedom such as one gets from a sudden burst of sunshine in the spring so that one is forced to believe that something more than wonderfully wonderful something altogether strange was seen and that all these various things that people thought they saw were only interpretations drawn from their experiences and their imaginations it was a light it was beauty it was high and solemn it made this world seem a flimsy transparency  then it had vanished  and people were left with the question of what they had seen and just how much it mattered   ยง 7  a little old lady sat by the fire in a small sittingroom in west kensington her cat was in her lap her spectacles were on her nose she was reading the mornings paper and beside her on a little occasional table was her tea and a buttered muffin she had finished the crimes and she was reading about the royal family when she had read all there was to read about the royal family she put down the paper deposited the cat on the hearthrug and turned to her tea she had poured out her first cup and she had just taken up a quadrant of muffin when the trump and the flash came through its instant duration she remained motionless with the quadrant of muffin poised halfway to her mouth then very slowly she put the morsel down  now what was that she said  she surveyed the cat but the cat was quite calm then she looked very very hard at her lamp it was a patent safety lamp and had always behaved very well then she stared at the window but the curtains were drawn and everything was in order  one might think i was going to be ill she said and resumed her toast   ยง 8  not far away from this old lady not more than threequarters of a mile at most sat mr parchester in his luxurious study writing a perfectly beautiful sustaining sermon about the need of faith in god he was a handsome earnest modern preacher he was rector of one of our big west end churches and he had amassed a large fashionable congregation every sunday and at convenient intervals during the week he fought against modern materialism scientific education excessive puritanism pragmatism doubt levity selfish individualism further relaxation of the divorce laws all the evils of our timeand anything else that was unpopular he believed quite simply he said in all the old simple kindly things he had the face of a saint but he had rendered this generally acceptable by growing side whiskers and nothing could tame the beauty of his voice  he was an enormous asset in the spiritual life of the metropolisto give it no harsher nameand his fluent periods had restored faith and courage to many a poor soul hovering on the brink of the dark river of thought  and just as beautiful christian maidens played a wonderful part in the last days of pompeii in winning proud roman hearts to a hated and despised faith so mr parchesters naturally graceful gestures and his simple melodious trumpet voice won back scores of our halfpagan rich women to church attendance and the social work of which his church was the centre  and now by the light of an exquisitely shaded electric lamp he was writing this sermon of quiet confident belief with occasional hard smacks perfect stingers in fact at current unbelief and rival leaders of opinion in the simple divine faith of our fathers  when there came this truncated trump and this vision   ยง 9  of all the innumerable multitudes who for the infinitesimal fraction of a second had this glimpse of the divinity none were so blankly and profoundly astonished as mr parchester forit may be because of his subtly spiritual naturehe saw and seeing believed he dropped his pen and let it roll across his manuscript he sat stunned every drop of blood fled from his face and his lips and his eyes dilated  while he had just been writing and arguing about god there was god  the curtain had been snatched back for an instant it had fallen again but his mind had taken a photographic impression of everything that he had seenthe grave presences the hierarchy the effulgence the vast concourse the terrible gentle eyes he felt it as though the vision still continued behind the bookcases behind the pictured wall and the curtained window even now there was judgement  for quite a long time he sat incapable of more than apprehending this supreme realization his hands were held out limply upon the desk before him and then very slowly his staring eyes came back to immediate things and fell upon the scattered manuscript on which he had been engaged he read an unfinished sentence and slowly recovered its intention as he did so a picture of his congregation came to him as he saw it from the pulpit during his evening sermon as he had intended to see it on the sunday evening that was at hand with lady rupert in her sitting and lady blex in hers and mrs munbridge the rich and in her jewish way very attractive mrs munbridge running them close in her adoration and each with one or two friends they had brought to adore him and behind them the hexhams and the wassinghams and behind them others and others and others ranks and ranks of people and the galleries on either side packed with worshippers of a less dominant class and the great organ and his magnificent choir waiting to support him and supplement him and the great altar to the left of him and the beautiful new lady chapel done by roger fry and wyndham lewis and all the latest people in art to the right he thought of the listening multitude seen through the haze of the thousand electric candles and how he had planned the paragraphs of his discourse so that the notes of his beautiful voice should float slowly down like golden leaves in autumn into the smooth tarn of their silence word by word phrase by phrase until he came to  now to god the father god the son  and all the time he knew that lady blex would watch his face and mrs munbridge leaning those graceful shoulders of hers a little forward would watch his face  many people would watch his face  all sorts of people would come to mr parchesters services at times once it was said mr balfour had come just to hear him after his sermons the strangest people would come and make confessions in the beautifully furnished receptionroom beyond the vestry all sorts of people once or twice he had asked people to come and listen to him and one of them had been a very beautiful woman and often he had dreamt of the people who might come prominent people influential people remarkable people but never before had it occurred to mr parchester that a little hidden from the rest of the congregation behind the thin veil of this material world there was another auditorium and that god also god also watched his face  and watched him through and through  terror seized upon mr parchester  he stood up as though divinity had come into the room before him he was trembling he felt smitten and about to be smitten  he perceived that it was hopeless to try and hide what he had written what he had thought the unclean egotism he had become  i did not know he said at last  the click of the door behind him warned him that he was not alone he turned and saw miss skelton his typist for it was her time to come for his manuscript and copy it out in the specially legible type he used for a moment he stared at her strangely  she looked at him with those deep adoring eyes of hers am i too soon sir she asked in her slow unhappy voice and seemed prepared for a noiseless departure  he did not answer immediately then he said miss skelton the judgement of god is close at hand  and seeing she stood perplexed he said  miss skelton how can you expect me to go on acting and mouthing this tosh when the sword of truth hangs over us  something in her face made him ask a question  did you see anything he asked  i thought it was because i was rubbing my eyes  then indeed there is a god and he is watching us now and all this about us this sinful room this foolish costume this preposterous life of blasphemous pretension  he stopped short with a kind of horror on his face  with a hopeless gesture he rushed by her he appeared wildeyed upon the landing before his manservant who was carrying a scuttle of coal upstairs  brompton he said what are you doing  coal sir  put it down man he said are you not an immortal soul god is here as close as my hand repent turn to him the kingdom of heaven is at hand   ยง 10  now if you are a policeman perplexed by a sudden and unaccountable collision between a taxicab and an electric standard complicated by a blinding flash and a sound like an abbreviated trump from an automobile horn you do not want to be bothered by a hatless clerical gentleman suddenly rushing out of a handsome private house and telling you that the kingdom of heaven is at hand you are respectful to him because it is the duty of a policeman to be respectful to gentlemen but you say to him sorry i cant attend to that now sir one thing at a time ive got this little accident to see to and if he persists in dancing round the gathering crowd and coming at you again you say im afraid i must ask you just to get away from here sir you arent being a elp sir and if on the other hand you are a welltrained clerical gentleman who knows his way about in the world you do not go on pestering a policeman on duty after he has said that even although you think god is looking at you and judgement is close at hand you turn away and go on a little damped looking for some one else more likely to pay attention to your tremendous tidings  and so it happened to the reverend mr parchester  he experienced a curious little recession of confidence he went on past quite a number of people without saying anything further and the next person he accosted was a flowerwoman sitting by her basket at the corner of chexington square she was unable to stop him at once when he began to talk to her because she was tying up a big bundle of white chrysanthemums and had an end of string behind her teeth and her daughter who stood beside her was the sort of girl who wouldnt say bo to a goose  do you know my good woman said mr parchester that while we poor creatures of earth go about our poor business here while we sin and blunder and follow every sort of base end close to us above us around us watching us judging us are god and his holy angels i have had a vision and i am not the only one i have seen we are in the kingdom of heaven now and here and judgement is all about us now have you seen nothing no light no sound no warning  by this time the old flowerseller had finished her bunch of flowers and could speak i saw it she said and maryshe saw it  well said mr parchester  but lord it dont mean nothing said the old flowerseller   ยง 11  at that a kind of chill fell upon mr parchester he went on across chexington square by his own inertia  he was still about as sure that he had seen god as he had been in his study but now he was no longer sure that the world would believe that he had he felt perhaps that this idea of rushing out to tell people was precipitate and inadvisable after all a priest in the church of england is only one unit in a great machine and in a worldwide spiritual crisis it should be the task of that great machine to act as one resolute body this isolated crying aloud in the street was unworthy of a consecrated priest it was a dissenting kind of thing to do a vulgar individualistic screaming he thought suddenly that he would go and tell his bishopthe great bishop wampach he called a taxicab and within half an hour he was in the presence of his commanding officer it was an extraordinarily difficult and painful interview  you see mr parchester believed the bishop impressed him as being quite angrily resolved not to believe and for the first time in his career mr parchester realized just how much jealous hostility a beautiful fluent and popular preacher may arouse in the minds of the hierarchy it wasnt he felt a conversation it was like flinging oneself into the paddock of a bull that has long been anxious to gore one  inevitably said the bishop this theatricalism this starturn business with its extreme spiritual excitements its exaggerated soul crises and all the rest of it leads to such a breakdown as afflicts you inevitably you were at least wise to come to me i can see you are only in the beginning of your trouble that already in your mind fresh hallucinations are gathering to overwhelm you voices special charges and missions strange revelations i wish i had the power to suspend you right away to send you into retreat  mr parchester made a violent effort to control himself but i tell you he said that i saw god he added as if to reassure himself more plainly more certainly than i see you  of course said the bishop this is how strange new sects come into existence this is how false prophets spring out of the bosom of the church looseminded excitable men of your stamp  mr parchester to his own astonishment burst into tears but i tell you he wept he is here i have seen i know  dont talk such nonsense said the bishop there is no one here but you and i  mr parchester expostulated but he protested he is omnipresent  the bishop controlled an expression of impatience it is characteristic of your condition he said that you are unable to distinguish between a matter of fact and a spiritual truth now listen to me if you value your sanity and public decency and the discipline of the church go right home from here and go to bed send for broadhays who will prescribe a safe sedative and read something calming and graceful and purifying for my own part i should be disposed to recommend the life of saint francis of assisi   ยง 12  unhappily mr parchester did not go home he went out from the bishops residence stunned and amazed and suddenly upon his desolation came the thought of mrs munbridge  she would understand  he was shown up to her own little sittingroom she had already gone up to her room to dress but when she heard that he had called and wanted very greatly to see her she slipped on a loose beautiful teagown nรฉgligรฉ thing and hurried to him he tried to tell her everything but she only kept saying there there she was sure he wanted a cup of tea he looked so pale and exhausted she rang to have the tea equipage brought back she put the dear saint in an armchair by the fire she put cushions about him and ministered to him and when she began partially to comprehend what he had experienced she suddenly realized that she too had experienced it that vision had been a brainwave between their two linked and sympathetic brains and that thought glowed in her as she brewed his tea with her own hands he had been weeping how tenderly he felt all these things he was more sensitive than a woman what madness to have expected understanding from the bishop but that was just like his unworldliness he was not fit to take care of himself a wave of tenderness carried her away here is your tea she said bending over him and fully conscious of her fragrant warmth and sweetness and suddenly she could never afterwards explain why she was so she was moved to kiss him on his brow  how indescribable is the comfort of a truehearted womanly friend the safety of it the consolation  about halfpast seven that evening mr parchester returned to his own home and brompton admitted him brompton was relieved to find his employer looking quite restored and ordinary again brompton said mr parchester i will not have the usual dinner tonight just a single mutton cutlet and one of those quarterbottles of perrier jouet on a tray in my study i shall have to finish my sermon tonight  and he had promised mrs munbridge he would preach that sermon specially for her   ยง 13  and as it was with mr parchester and brompton and mrs munbridge and the taxidriver and the policeman and the little old lady and the automobile mechanics and mr parchesters secretary and the bishop so it was with all the rest of the world if a thing is sufficiently strange and great no one will perceive it men will go on in their own ways though one rose from the dead to tell them that the kingdom of heaven was at hand though the kingdom itself and all its glory became visible blinding their eyes they and their ways are one men will go on in their ways as rabbits will go on feeding in their hutches within a hundred yards of a battery of artillery for rabbits are rabbits and made to eat and breed and men are human beings and creatures of habit and custom and prejudice and what has made them what will judge them what will destroy themthey may turn their eyes to it at times as the rabbits will glance at the concussion of the guns but it will never draw them away from eating their lettuce and sniffing after their does   ยง 14  there was something of invalid peevishness even in the handwriting of boons last story the story of the last trump  of course i see exactly what boon is driving at in this fragment  the distresses of the war had for a time broken down his faith in the mind of the race and so he mocked at the idea that under any sort of threat or warning whatever mens minds can move out of the grooves in which they run and yet in happier moods that was his own idea and my belief in it came from him that he should in his illness fall away from that saving confidence which he could give to me and that he should die before his courage returned seems just a part of the inexplicable tragedy of life because clearly this end of the story of the last trump is forced and false is unjust to life i know how feebly we apprehend things i know how we forget but because we forget it does not follow that we never remember because we fail to apprehend perfectly it does not follow that we have no understanding and so i feel that the true course of the story of the last trump should have been far larger and much more wonderful and subtle than boon made it that instant vision of god would not have been dismissed altogether people might have gone on as boon tells us they went on but they would have been haunted nevertheless by a new sense of deep tremendous things  cynicism is humour in illhealth it would have been far more difficult to tell the story of how a multitude of commonplace people were changed by a halfdubious perception that god was indeed close at hand to them a perception that they would sometimes struggle with and deny sometimes realize overwhelmingly it would have been a beautiful pitiful wonderful story and it may be if boon had lived he would have written it he could have written it but he was too ill for that much of writing and the tired pencil turned to the easier course  i cant believe after all i know of him and particularly after the intimate talk i have repeated that he would have remained in this mood he would i am certain have altered the story of the last trump he must have done so  and so too about this war this dreadful outbreak of brutish violence which has darkened all our lives i do not think he would have remained despairful as his health mended as the braveries of spring drew near he would have risen again to the assurance he gave me that the mind is immortal and invincible  of course there is no denying the evil the black evils of this war many of us are impoverished and ruined many of us are wounded almost all of us have lost friends and suffered indirectly in a hundred ways and all that is going on yet the black stream of consequence will flow for centuries but all this multitudinous individual unhappiness is still compatible with a great progressive movement in the general mind being wounded and impoverished being hurt and seeing things destroyed is as much living and learning as anything else in the world the tremendous present disaster of europe may not be after all a disaster for mankind horrible possibilities have to be realized and they can be realized only by experience complacencies fatuities have to be destroyed we have to learn and relearn what boon once called the bitter need for honesty we must see these things from the standpoint of the race life whose days are hundreds of years  nevertheless such belief cannot alter for me the fact that boon is dead and our little circle is scattered i feel that no personal comfort nor any further happiness of the mind remains in store for me my duties as his literary executor still give me access to the dear old house and the garden of our security and in spite of a considerable coolness between myself and mrs boonwho would willingly have all this material destroyed and his reputation rest upon his betterknown worksi make my duty my excuse to go there nearly every day and think i am really in doubt about many matters i cannot determine for example whether it may not be possible to make another volume from the fragments still remaining over after this one there are great quantities of sketches several long pieces of vers libre the story of jane in heaven the draft of a novel and so i go there and take out the papers and fall into fits of thinking i turn the untidy pages and think about boon and of all the stream of nonsense and fancy that was so much more serious to him and to me than the serious business of life i go there i know very much as a cat hangs about its home after its people have departedthat is to say a little incredulously and with the gleam of a reasonless hope  there must i suppose come a limit to these visitations and i shall have to go about my own business i can see in mrs boons eye that she will presently demand conclusive decisions in a world that has grown suddenly chilly and lonely i know i must go on with my work under difficult and novel conditions and now well into the routines of middle age as if there were no such things as loss and disappointment i am i learned long ago an uncreative unimportant man and yet i suppose i do something i count it is better that i should help than not in the great task of literature the great task of becoming the thought and the expressed intention of the race the task of taming violence organizing the aimless destroying error the task of waylaying the wild asses of the devil and sending them back to hell it does not matter how individually feeble we writers and disseminators are we have to hunt the wild asses as the feeblest puppy has to bark at cats and burglars and we have to do it because we know in spite of the darkness the wickedness the haste and hate we know in our hearts though no momentary trumpeting has shown it to us that judgement is all about us and god stands close at hand  yes we go on  but i wish that george boon were still in the world with me and i wish that he could have written a different ending to the story of the last trump     the gresham press  unwin brothers limited  woking and london
