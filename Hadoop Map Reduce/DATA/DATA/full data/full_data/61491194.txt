pieces from the village coquettes  a comic opera  1836   the village coquettes  about the year 1834 when the earliest of the sketches by boz were appearing in print a young composer named john hullah set to music a portion of an opera called the gondolier which he thought might prove successful on the stage twelve months later hullah became acquainted with charles dickens whose name was then unknown to those outside his own immediate circle and it occurred to him that he and boz might combine their forces by converting the gondolier into a popular play dickens who always entertained a passion for the theatre entered into the project at once and informed hullah that he had a little unpublished story by him which he thought would dramatise welleven better than the gondolier notion confessing that he would rather deal with familiar english scenes than with the unfamiliar venetian environment of the play favoured by hullah the title of the gondolier was consequently abandoned and a novel subject found and put forward as the village coquettes a comic opera of which songs duets and concerted pieces were to form constituent parts dickens of course became responsible for the libretto and hullah for the music and when completed the little play was offered to and accepted by braham the lessee of the st jamess theatre who expressed an earnest desire to be the first to introduce boz to the public as a dramatic writer a favourite comedian of that day john pritt harley after reading the words of the opera prior to its representation declared it was a sure card and felt so confident of its success that he offered to wager ten pounds that it would run fifty nightsan assurance which at once decided braham to produce it  the village coquettes described on the titlepage of the printed copies as a comic opera in two acts was played for the first time on december 6 1836 with braham and harley in the cast in his preface to the play published contemporaneously by richard bentley and dedicated to harley dickens explained that the libretto of an opera must be to a certain extent a mere vehicle for the music and that it is scarcely fair or reasonable to judge it by those strict rules of criticism which would be justly applicable to a fiveact tragedy or a finished comedy there is no doubt that the merits of the play were based upon the songs set to hullahs music rather than upon the play itself and it is said that harleys reputation as a vocalist was established by his able rendering of them  the village coquettes enjoyed a run of nineteen nights in london during the season and was then transferred to edinburgh where it was performed under the management of mr ramsay a friend of sir walter scott sala as a boy of ten witnessed its first representation in london and ever retained a vivid impression of the event while especial interest appertains to the fact that a copy of the play became the means of first bringing dickens into personal communication with john forster his lifelong friend and biographer it is more than probable that boz felt a little elated by the reception accorded by the public to the dramatic bantling but as time progressed he realised that the somewhat unfavourable comments of the critics were not entirely devoid of truth indeed when in 1843 it was proposed to revive the play he expressed a hope that it might be allowed to sink into its native obscurity i did it he explained in a fit of damnable goodnature long ago for hullah who wrote some very pretty music to it i just put down for everybody what everybody at the st jamess theatre wanted to say and do and what they could say and do best and i have been most sincerely repentant ever since the novelist confessed that both the operetta and a little farce called the strange gentleman the latter written as a practical joke for the st jamess theatre about the same time were done without the least consideration or regard to reputation he also declared that he wouldnt repeat them for a thousand pounds apiece and devoutly wished these early dramatic efforts to be forgotten À propos of this the late frederick lockerlampson has recorded that when he asked dickens about a year before the great writers death whether he possessed a copy of the village coquettes his reply was no and if i knew it was in my house and if i could not get rid of it in any other way i would burn the wing of the house where it was  although perhaps not of a high order of merit the village coquettes is not without bibliographical interest and may be regarded as a musical and literary curiosity copies of the first edition of the little play are now seldom met with and whenever a perfect impression comes into the market it commands a good price even as much as £10 or £12indeed a particularly fine copy was sold at sothebys in 1889 for twentyfive pounds in 1878 the words of the opera were reprinted in facsimile by richard bentley for which a frontispiece was etched by f w pailthorpe a year later   the village coquettes   round    hail to the merry autumn days when yellow cornfields shine   far brighter than the costly cup that holds the monarchs wine

farce  1838   the lamplighter  in 1838 dickens agreed to prepare a little play for macready the famous actor then the manager of drury lane theatre it was called the lamplighter and when completed the author read aloud the unfortunate little farce as he subsequently termed it in the greenroom of the theatre although the play went through rehearsal it was never presented before an audience for the actors would not agree about it and at macreadys suggestion dickens consented to withdraw it declaring that he had no other feeling of disappointment connected with this matter but that which arose from the failure in attempting to serve his friend the manuscript of the play not in dickenss handwriting reposes in the forster library at the victoria and albert museum and in 1879 it was printed for the first time in the form of a pamphlet of which only two hundred and fifty copies were issued  when rejected by macready as unsuitable for stage presentation the lamplighter was adapted by dickens to another purposethat is to say he converted it into a tale called the lamplighters story for publication in the picnic papers issued in 1841 for the benefit of the widow of macrone dickenss first publisher who died in great poverty between the farce and the story there are but slight differences the duet of two verses sung by tom and betsy to the air of the young maymoon cannot of course

perhaps the most acceptable of all dickenss poetical efforts it was originally set to music at dickenss request by his brotherinlaw henry burnett a professional vocalist who by the way was the admitted prototype of nicholas nickleby mr burnett sang the ballad scores of times in the presence of literary men and artists and it proved an especial favourite with landor the ivy green was not written for pickwick mr burnett assured me but on its being so much admired the author said it should go into a monthly number and it did the most popular setting is undoubtedly that of henry russell who has recorded that he received as his fee the magnificent sum of ten shillings the ballad in this form went into many editions and the sales must have amounted to tens of thousands   the ivy green    oh a dainty plant is the ivy green   that creepeth oer ruins old   of right choice food are his meals i ween   in his cell so lone and cold   the wall must be crumbled the stone decayed   to

though he wears no wings   and a staunch old heart has he   how closely he twineth how tight he clings   to his friend the huge oak tree   and slily he traileth along the ground   and his leaves he gently waves   as he joyously hugs and crawleth round   the rich mould of dead mens graves       creeping where grim death hath been       a rare old plant is the ivy green    whole ages have fled and their works decayed   and nations have scattered been   but the stout old ivy shall never fade   from its hale and hearty green   the brave old plant in its lonely days   shall fatten upon the past

stanzas bearing the above title will be found in the twentyeighth chapter of pickwick where they are introduced as the song which that hospitable old soul mr wardle sung appropriately in a good round

who stole a sexton is one of several short tales chiefly of a dismal character introduced into pickwick they were doubtless written prior to the conception of pickwick each being probably intended for independent publication and in a manner similar to the boz sketches for some reason these stories were not so published and dickens evidently saw a favourable opportunity of utilising his unused

ven he took the sitivation at the lighthouse  with this prelude mr samuel weller burst at once into the following wild and beautiful legend which under the impression that it is not generally known we take the liberty of quoting we would beg to call particular attention to the monosyllable at the end of the second and fourth lines which not only enables the singer to take breath at those points but greatly assists the metrethe pickwick papers chapter xliii  at the conclusion of the performance the mottledfaced gentleman contended that the song was personal to the cloth and demanded the name of the bishops coachman whose cowardice he regarded as a reflection upon coachmen in general sam replied that his name was not known as he hadnt got his card in his pocket whereupon the mottledfaced gentleman declared the statement to be untrue stoutly maintaining that the said coachman did not run away but died gamegame as pheasants and he would hear nothin said to the contrairey  even in the vernacular observes mr percy fitzgerald this master of words charles dickens could be artistic and it may fairly be asserted that mr wellers song to the coachmen is superior to anything of the kind

ever enjoyed anything more than the power of thus taking part occasionally unknown to outsiders in the sharp conflict the press was waging at the time in all probability he contributed other political rhymes to the pages of the examiner as events prompted if so they are buried beyond easy reach of identification  writing to forster at this time dickens said by jove how radical i am getting i wax

daughter  1842   prologue to the patricians daughter  the patricians daughter was the title bestowed upon a play in the tragic vein by a then unknown writer j westland marston it being his maiden effort in dramatic authorship dickens took great interest in the young man and indicated a desire to promote the welfare of his production by composing some introductory lines to macready he wrote the more i think of marstons play the more sure i feel that a prologue to the purpose would help it materially and almost decide the fate of any ticklish point on the first night now i have an idea not easily explainable in writing but told in five words that would take the prologue out of the conventional dress of prologues quite get the curtain up with a dash and begin the play with a sledgehammer blow if on consideration you should agree with me i will write the prologue heartily happily for the author his little tragedy was the first new play of the season and it thus attracted greater attention its initial representation took place at drury lane theatre on december 10 1842 and the fact that dickenss dignified and vigorous lines were recited by macready the leading actor of his day undoubtedly gave prestige to this performance but the play although it made a sensation for the moment did not enjoy a long run its motive being for some reason misunderstood as explained by the editors of the letters of charles dickens it was to a certain extent an experiment in testing the effect of a tragedy of modern times and in modern dress the novelists prologue being intended to show that there need be no incongruity between plain clothes of the nineteenth century and high tragedy  the patricians daughter a tragedy in five acts appeared in pamphlet form during the year prior to its being placed upon the boards the prologue was printed for the first time in the sunday times december 11 1842 and then in the theatrical journal and strangers guide december 17 1842 by the kind permission of miss hogarth the lines are here reproduced from the revised and only correct version in the letters of charles dickens  in the preface to the second edition of the play 1842 the author thus acknowledges his indebtedness to dickens for the prologue which however does not appear in the book how shall i thank mr dickens for the spontaneous kindness which has furnished me with so excellent a letter of introduction to the audience the simplest acknowledgment is perhaps the best since the least i might say would exceed his estimate of the obligation while the most i could say would fail to express mine   prologue to the patricians daughter  spoken by mr macready    no tale of streaming plumes and harness bright   dwells on the poets maiden harp tonight   no trumpets clamour and no battles fire   breathes in the trembling accents of his lyre   enough for him if in his lowly strain   he wakes one household echo not in vain   enough for him if in his boldest word   the beating heart of man be dimly heard    its solemn music which like strains that sigh   through charmèd gardens all who hearing die   its solemn music he does not pursue   to distant ages out of human view   nor listen to its wild and mournful chime   in the dead caverns on the shore of time   but musing with a calm and steady gaze   before the crackling flames of living days   he hears it whisper through the busy roar   of what shall be and what has been before   awake the present shall no scene display   the tragic passion of the passing day   is it with man as with some meaner things

ainsworth dorsay and the rest her ladyship through her personal charm and natural gifts succeeded in securing the services of eminent authors for the aristocratic publication even dickens could not resist her appeal and in a letter to forster dated july 1843 he wrote i have heard as you have from lady blessington for whose behalf i have this morning penned the lines i send you herewith but i have only done so to excuse myself for i have not the least idea of their suiting her and i hope she will send them back to you for the examiner lady blessington however decided to retain the thoughtful little poem which was referred to in the london review twentythree years later as a graceful and sweet apologue reminding one of the manner of hood the theme of the poem which forster

remembered was founded in january 1846 by charles dickens who officiated as its first editor he soon sickened of the mechanical drudgery appertaining to the position and resigned his editorial functions the following month from january 21st to march 2nd he contributed to its columns a series of travelling sketches afterwards reprinted in volume form as pictures from italy he also availed himself of the opportunity afforded him by his association with that newspaper of once more taking up the cudgels against the tories and as in the case of the examiner his attack was conveyed through the medium of some doggerel verses these were entitled the british liona new song but an old story to be sung to the tune of the great seasnake they bore the signature of catnach the famous balladsinger and were printed in the daily news of january 24 1846  three weeks later some verses of a totally different character appeared in the columns of the daily news signed in full charles dickens one lucy simpkins of bremhill or bremble a parish in wiltshire had just previously addressed a night meeting of the wives of agricultural labourers in that county in support of a petition for free trade and her vigorous speech on that occasion inspired dickens to write the hymn of the wiltshire labourers thus offering an earnest protest against oppression concerning the hymn a writer in a

writing to intimate friends as for example in a letter to maclise the artist which began with a parody of byrons lines to thomas moore    my foot is in the house     my bath is on the sea   and before i take a souse     heres a single note to thee  a more remarkable instance of his propensity to indulge in parody of this kind is to be found in a letter addressed to mark lemon in the spring of 1849

dramas for representation at dickenss residence tavistock house a portion of which had been already adapted for private theatricals the rooms so converted being described in the bills as the smallest theatre in the world the first of these plays was called the lighthouse and the initial performance took place on june 19 1855 dickens not only wrote the prologue and the song of the wreck but signally distinguished himself by enacting the part of aaron gurnock a lighthousekeeper his clever impersonation recalling frédérick lemaître the only actor he ever tried to take as a model  with regard to the song of the wreck dickens evidently intended to bestow upon it a different title for in a letter addressed to wilkie collins during the preparation of the play he said i have written a little ballad for marythe story of the ships carpenter and the little boy in the shipwreck the song was rendered by his eldest daughter mary who assumed the rôle of phoebe in the play it was set to

january 1857 and subsequently at the gallery of illustration in the presence of queen victoria and the royal family as in the case of the lighthouse the play had the advantage of a prologue in rhyme by charles dickens who again electrified his audiences by marvellous acting the character of richard wardour a young naval officer being selected by him for representation  the prologue was recited at tavistock house by john forster and at the public performances of the play by dickens himself  it is not generally known that a by no means inconsiderable portion of the drama was composed by dickens as testified by the original manuscripts of the play and of the promptbook which contain numerous additions and corrections in his handwriting these manuscripts by the way realised £300 at sothebys in 1890  the main idea of a tale of two cities was conceived by dickens when performing in the frozen deep a strong desire was upon me then he writes in the preface to the story to embody it in my own person and i traced out in my fancy the state of mind of which it would necessitate the presentation to an observant spectator with particular care and interest as the idea became familiar to me it gradually shaped itself into its present form throughout its execution it has had complete possession of me i have so far verified what is done and suffered in these pages as that i have certainly

golden mary  1856   a childs hymn  the christmas number of household words for 1856 is especially noteworthy as containing the hymn of five verses which dickens contributed to the second chapter this made a highly favourable impression and a certain clergyman the rev r h davies was induced to express to the editor of household words his gratitude to the author of these lines for having thus conveyed to innumerable readers such true religious sentiments in acknowledging the receipt of the letter dickens observed that such a mark of approval was none the less gratifying to him because he was himself the author of the hymn there cannot be many men i believe he added who have a more humble veneration for the new testament or a more profound conviction of its allsufficiency than i have if i am ever as you tell me i am mistaken on this subject it is because i discountenance all obtrusive professions of and tradings in religion as one of the main causes why real christianity has been
