harper  brothers franklin square 1892     the quality of mercy     part first     i   northwicks man met him at the station with the cutter the train was a little late and elbridge was a little early after a few moments of formal waiting he began to walk the clipped horses up and down the street as they walked they sent those quivers and thrills over their thin coats which horses can give at will they moved their heads up and down slowly and easily and made their bells jangle noisily together the bursts of sound evoked by their firm and nervous pace died back in showers and falling drops of music all the time elbridge swore at them affectionately with the unconscious profanity of the rustic yankee whose lot has been much cast with horses in the halts he made at each return to the station he let his blasphemies bubble sociably from him in response to the friendly imprecations of the three or four other drivers who were waiting for the train they had apparently no other parlance the drivers of the hotel bus and of the local express wagon were particular friends they gave each other to perdition at every other word a growing boy who had come to meet mr gerrish the merchant with the family sleigh made himself a fountain of meaningless maledictions the public hackman who admired elbridge almost as much as he respected elbridges horses they were really northwicks but the professional convention was that they were elbridges clothed them with fond curses as with a garment he was himself more literally speaking clothed in an old ulster much frayed about the wrists and skirts and polished across the middle of the back by rubbing against counters and windowsills he was bearded like a patriarch and he wore a rusty fur cap pulled down over his ears though it was not very cold its peak rested on the point of his nose so that he had to throw his head far back to get elbridge in the field of his vision elbridge had on a high hat and was smoothly buttoned to his throat in a plain coachmans coat of black northwick had never cared to have him make a closer approach to a livery and it is doubtful if elbridge would have done it if he had asked or ordered it of him he deferred to northwick in a measure as the owner of his horses but he did not defer to him in any other quality  say elbridge when you goin to give me that old hat o yourn asked the hackman in a shout that would have reached elbridge if he had been half a mile off instead of half a rod  what do you want of another secondhand hat you   old fool you asked elbridge in his turn  the hackman doubled himself down for joy and slapped his leg at the sound of a whistle to the eastward he pulled himself erect again and said as if the fact were one point gained well there she blows any way then he went round the corner of the station to be in full readiness for any chance passenger the train might improbably bring him  no one alighted but mr gerrish and northwick mr gerrish found it most remarkable that he should have come all the way from boston on the same train with northwick and not known it but northwick was less disposed to wonder at it he passed rapidly beyond the following of mr gerrish and mounted to the place elbridge made for him in the cutter while elbridge was still tucking the robes about their legs northwick drove away from the station and through the village up to the rim of the highland that lies between hatboro and south hatboro the bare line cut along the horizon where the sunset lingered in a light of liquid crimson paling and passing into weaker violet tints with every moment but still tenderly flushing the walls of the sky and holding longer the accent of its color where a keen star had here and there already pierced it and shone quivering through the shortest days were past but in the first week of february they had not lengthened sensibly though to a finer perception there was the promise of release from the winter dark if not from the winter cold it was not far from six oclock when northwick mounted the southward rise of the street it was still almost light enough to read and the little slender black figure of a man that started up in the middle of the road as if it had risen out of the ground had an even vivid distinctness he must have been lying in the snow the horses crouched back with a sudden recoil as if he had struck them back with his arm and plunged the runners of the cutter into the deeper snow beside the beaten track he made a slight pause long enough to give northwick a contemptuous glance and then continued along the road at a leisurely pace to the deep cut through the snow from the next house here he stood regarding such difficulty as northwick had in quieting his horses and getting underway again he said nothing and northwick did not speak elbridge growled hes on one of his tears again and the horses dashed forward with a shriek of all their bells northwick did not open his lips till he entered the avenue of firs that led from the highway to his house they were still clogged with the snowfall and their lowermost branches were buried in the drifts  whats the matter with the colt he asked  i dont know as that fellow understands the colts feet very well i guess one of the shoes is set wrong said elbridge  better look after it  northwick left elbridge the reins and got out of the cutter at the flight of granite steps which rose to the groundfloor of his wooden palace broad levels of piazza stretched away from the entrance under a portico of that carpentry which so often passes with us for architecture in spite of the effect of organic flimsiness in every wooden structure but a log cabin or a fishermans cottage shingled to the ground the house suggested a perfect functional comfort there were double windows on all round the piazzas a mellow glow from the incandescent electrics penetrated to the outer dusk from them when the door was opened to northwick a pleasant heat gushed out together with the perfume of flowers and the odors of dinner  dinner is just served sir said the inside man disposing of northwicks overcoat and hat on the hall table with respectful scruple  northwick hesitated he stood over the register and vaguely held his hands in the pleasant warmth indirectly radiated from the steampipes below  the young ladies were just thinking you wouldnt be home till the next train the man suggested at the sound of voices from the diningroom  they have some one with them northwick asked  yes sir the rector sir mr wade sir  ill come down by and by northwick said turning to the stairs say i had a late lunch before i left town  yes sir said the man  northwick went on up stairs with footfalls hushed by the thicklypadded thick carpet and turned into the sort of study that opened out of his bedroom it had been his wifes parlor during the few years of her life in the house which he had built for her and which they had planned to spend their old age in together it faced southward and looked out over the greenhouses and the gardens that stretched behind the house to the bulk of woods shutting out the stagepicturesqueness of the summer settlement of south hatboro she had herself put the rockingchair in the sunny baywindow and northwick had not allowed it to be disturbed there since her death in an alcove at one side he had made a place for the safe where he kept his papers his wife had intended to keep their silver in it but she had been scared by the notion of having burglars so close to them in the night and had always left the silver in the safe in the diningroom  she was all her life a timorous creature and after her marriage had seldom felt safe out of northwicks presence her portrait by hunt hanging over the mantelpiece suggested something of this though the painter had made the most of her thin middleaged blond good looks and had given her a substance of general character which was more expressive of his own free and bold style than of the facts in the case she was really one of those henminded women who are so common in all walks of life and are made up of only one aim at a time and of manifold anxieties at all times her instinct for saving long survived the days of struggle in which she had joined it to northwicks instinct for getting she lived and died in the hope if not the belief that she had contributed to his prosperity by looking strictly after all manner of valueless odds and ends but he had been passively happy with her since her death he had allowed her to return much into his thoughts from which her troublesome solicitudes and her entire uselessness in important matters had obliged him to push her while she lived he often had times when it seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing and then he found he had been thinking of her at such times with a pang he realized that he missed her but perhaps the wound was to habit rather than affection he now sat down in his swivelchair and turned it from the writingdesk which stood on the rug before the fireplace and looked up into the eyes of her effigy with a sense of her intangible presence in it and with a dumb longing to rest his soul against hers she was the only one who could have seen him in his wish to have not been what he was she would have denied it to his face if he had told her he was a thief and as he meant to make himself more and more a thief her love would have eased the way by full acceptance of the theories that ran along with his intentions and covered them with pretences of necessity he thought how even his own mother could not have been so much comfort to him she would have had the mercy but she would not have had the folly at the bottom of his heart and under all his pretences northwick knew that it was not mercy which would help him but he wanted it as we all want what is comfortable and bad for us at times with the performance and purpose of a thief in his heart he turned to the pictured face of his dead wife as his refuge from the face of all living it could not look at him as if he were a thief  the word so filled his mind that it seemed always about to slip from his tongue it was what the president of the board had called him when the fact of his fraudulent manipulation of the companys books was laid so distinctly before him that even the insane refusal which the criminal instinctively makes of his crime in its presence was impossible the other directors sat blankly round and said nothing not because they hated a scene but because the ordinary course of life among us had not supplied them with the emotional materials for making one the president however had jumped from his seat and advanced upon northwick what does all this mean sir ill tell you what it means it means that youre a thief sir the same as if you had picked my pocket or stolen my horse or taken my overcoat out of my hall  he shook his clenched fist in northwicks face and seemed about to take him by the throat afterwards he inclined more to mercy than the others it was he who carried the vote which allowed northwick three days grace to look into his affairs and lay before the directors the proof that he had ample means as he maintained to meet the shortage in the accounts i wish you well out of it for your familys sake he said at parting but all the same sir you are a thief  he put his hands ostentatiously in his pockets when some others meaninglessly shook hands with northwick at parting as northwick himself might have shaken hands with another in his place and he brushed by him out of the door without looking at him he came suddenly back to say if it were a question of you alone i would cheerfully lose something more than youve robbed me of for the pleasure of seeing you handcuffed in this room and led to jail through the street by a constable no honest man no man who was not always a rogue at heart could have done what youve done juggled with the books for years and bewitched the record so by your infernal craft that it was never suspected till now youve given mind to your scoundrelly work sir all the mind you had for if you hadnt been so anxious to steal successfully youd have given more mind to the use of your stealings you may have some of them left but it looks as if youd made ducks and drakes of them like any petty rascal in the hands of the employees insurance company yes sir i believe youre of about the intellectual calibre of that sort of thief i cant respect you even on your own ground but im willing to give you the chance you ask for your daughters sake shes been in and out of my house with my girl like one of my own children and i wont send her father to jail if i can help it understand i havent any sentiment for you northwick youre the kind of rogue id like to see in a convicts jacket learning to make shoebrushes but you shall have your chance to go home and see if you can pay up somehow and you shant be shadowed while youre at it you shall keep your outside to the world three days longer you whited sepulchre but if you want to know i think the best thing that could happen to you on your way home would be a good railroad accident  the mans words and looks were burnt into northwicks memory which now seemed to have the faculty of simultaneously reproducing them all northwick remembered his purple face with its prominent eyes and the swing of his large stomach and just how it struck against the jamb as he whirled a second time out of the door the other directors some of them stood round buttoned up in their overcoats with their hats on and a sort of stunned aspect some held their hats in their hands and looked down into them with a decorous absence of expression as people do at a funeral then they left him alone in the treasurers private room with its official luxury of thick turkey rugs leathern armchairs and nickelplated cuspidors standing one on each side of the hearth where a fire of soft coal in a lowdown grate burned with a subdued and respectful flicker     ii   if it had not been for the boisterous indignation of the president northwick might have come away from the meeting after the exposure of his defalcations with an unimpaired personal dignity but as it was he felt curiously shrunken and shattered till the prevailing habit of his mind enabled him to piece himself together again and resume his former size and shape this happened very quickly he had conceived of himself so long as a man employing funds in his charge in speculations sometimes successful and sometimes not but at all times secured by his personal probity and reliability he had in fact more than once restored all that he had taken and he had come to trust himself in the course of these transactions as fully as he was trusted by the men who were ignorant of his irregularities he was somehow flattered by the complete confidence they reposed in him though he really felt it to be no more than his due he had always merited and received the confidence of men associated with him in business and he had come to regard the funds of the corporation as practically his own in the early days of his connection with the company it largely owed its prosperity to his wise and careful management one might say that it was not until the last when he got so badly caught by that drop in railroads that he had felt anything wrong in his convertible use of its money it was an informality he would not have denied that but it was merely an informality then his losses suddenly leaped beyond his ability to make them good then for the first time he began to practice that system in keeping the books which the furious president called juggling with them even this measure he considered a justifiable means of selfdefence pending the difficulties which beset him and until he could make his losses good by other operations from time to time he was more fortunate and whenever he dramatized himself in an explanation to the directors as he often did especially of late he easily satisfied them as to the nature of his motives and the propriety of his behavior by calling their attention to these successful deals and to the probability the entire probability that he could be at any moment in a position to repay all he had borrowed of the company he called it borrowing and in his long habit of making himself these loans and returning them he had come to have a sort of vague feeling that the company was privy to them that it was almost an understood thing the presidents violence was the first intimation to reach him in the heart of his artificial consciousness that his action was at all in the line of those foolish peculators whose discovery and flight to canada was the commonplace of every mornings paper such a commonplace that he had been sensible of an effort in the papers to vary the tiresome repetition of the same old fact by some novel grace of wit or some fresh picturesqueness in putting it in the presence of the directors he had refused to admit it to himself but after they adjourned and he was left alone he realized the truth he was like those fools exactly like them in what they had done and in the way of doing it he was like them in motive and principle all of them had used others money in speculation expecting to replace it and then had not been able to replace it and then had skipped as the newspapers said  whether he should complete the parallel and skip too was a point which he had not yet acknowledged to himself that he had decided he never had believed that it need come to that but for an instant when the president said he could wish him nothing better on his way home than a good railroad accident it flashed upon him that one of the three alternatives before him was to skip he had the choice to kill himself which was supposed to be the gentlemanly way out of his difficulties and would leave his family unstained by his crime that matter had sometimes been discussed in his presence and every one had agreed that it was the only thing for a gentleman to do after he had pilfered people of money he could not pay back there was something else that a man of other instincts and weaker fibre might do and that was to stand his trial for embezzlement and take his punishment or a man if he was that kind of a man could skip the question with northwick was whether he was that kind of man or whether if he skipped he would be that kind of man whether the skipping would make him that kind of man  the question was a cruel one for the selfrespect which he had so curiously kept intact he had been respectable ever since he was born if he was born with any instinct it was the instinct of respectability the wish to be honored for what he seemed it was all the stronger in him because his father had never had it perhaps an hereditary trait found expression in him after passing over one generation perhaps an antenatal influence formed him to that type his mother was always striving to keep the man she had married worthy of her choice in the eyes of her neighbors but he had never seconded her efforts he had been educated a doctor but never practised medicine in carrying on the drug and book business of the village he cared much more for the literary than the pharmaceutical side of it he liked to have a circle of cronies about the woodstove in his store till midnight and discuss morals and religion with them and one night when denying the plenary inspiration of the scriptures he went to the wrong jar for an ingredient of the prescription he was making up the patient died of his mistake the disgrace and the disaster broke his wifes heart but he lived on to a vague and colorless old age supported by his son in a total disoccupation the elder northwick used sometimes to speak of his son and his success in the world not boastfully but with a certain sarcasm for the source of his bounty as a boy who had always disappointed him by a narrowness of ambition he called him milt and he said he supposed now milt was the most selfsatisfied man in massachusetts he implied that there were better things than material success he did not say what they were and he could have found very few people in that village to agree with him or to admit that the treasurer of the ponkwasset mills had come in anywise short of the destiny of a man whose father had started him in life with the name of john milton they called him milt too among themselves and perhaps here and there a bolder spirit might have called him so to his face if he had ever come back to the village but he had not he had as they had all heard that splendid summer place at hatboro where he spent his time when he was not at his house in boston and when they verified the fact of his immense prosperity by inquiry of some of the summerfolks who knew him or knew about him they were obscurely flattered by the fact just as many of us are proud of belonging to a nation in which we are enriched by the fellowcitizenship of many manifold millionnaires they did not blame northwick for never coming to see his father or for never having him home on a visit they daily saw what old northwick was and how little he was fitted for the society of a man whose respectability even as it was reflected upon them was so dazzling old northwick had never done anything for milt he had never even got along with him the fellow had left him and made his own way and the old man had no right to talk if milt was ever of a mind to cut off his rations the old man would soon see     iii   the local opinion scarcely did justice to old northwicks imperfect discharge of a fathers duties his critics could not have realized how much some capacities if not tastes which northwick had inherited contributed to that very effect of respectability which they revered the early range of books the familiarity with the mere exterior of literature restricted as it was helped northwick later to pass for a man of education if not of reading with men who were themselves less read than educated the people whom his ability threw him with in boston were all harvard men and they could not well conceive of an acquaintance so gentlemanly and quiet as northwick who was not college bred too by unmistakable signs which we carry through life they knew he was from the country and they attributed him to a freshwater college they said youre a dartmouth man northwick i believe or i think youre from williams and when northwick said no they forgot it and thought that he was a bowdoin man the impression gradually fixed itself that he was from one or other of those colleges it was believed in like manner partly on account of his name that he was from one of those old ministerial families that you find up in the hills where the whole brood study greek while they are sugaring off in the spring and that his own mother had fitted him for college there was in fact something clerical in northwicks bearing and it was felt by some that he had studied for the ministry but had gone into business to help his family the literary phase of the superstition concerning him was humored by the library which formed such a striking feature of his house in boston as well as his house in hatboro at hatboro it was really vast and was so charming and so luxurious that it gave the idea of a cultivated family they preferred to live in it and rarely used the drawingroom which was much smaller and was a gold and white sanctuary on the north side of the house only opened when there was a large party of guests for dancing most people came and went without seeing it and it remained shut up as much a conjecture as the memory of northwicks wife she was supposed to have been taken from him early to save him and his children from the mortifying consequences of one of those romantic loveaffairs in which a conscientious man had sacrificed himself to a girl he was certain to outgrow none of his world knew that his fortunes had been founded upon the dowry she brought him and upon the stay her belief in him had always been she was a churchmember as such women usually are but northwick was really her religion and as there is nothing that does so much to sanctify a deity as the blind devotion of its worshippers northwick was rendered at times worthy of her faith by the intensity of it in his sort he returned her love he was not the kind of man whose affections are apt to wander perhaps because they were few and easily kept together perhaps because he was really principled against letting them go astray he was not merely true in a passive way but he was constant in the more positive fashion when they began to get on in the world and his business talent brought him into relations with people much above them socially he yielded to her shrinking from the opportunities of social advancement that opened to them and held aloof with her this kept him a country person in his experiences much longer than he need have remained and tended to that sort of defensive secretiveness which grew more and more upon him and qualified his conduct in matters where there was no question of his knowledge of the polite world it was not until after his wifes death and until his daughters began to grow up into the circles where his money and his business associations authorized them to move that he began to see a little of that world even then he left it chiefly to his children for himself he continued quite simply loyal to his wifes memory and apparently never imagined such a thing as marrying again  he rose from the chair where he had sat looking up into her pictured face and went to open the safe near the window but he stopped in stooping over to work the combination and glanced out across his shoulder into the night the familiar beauty of the scene tempted him to the window for what all at once he felt might be his last look though the next instant he was able to argue the feeling down and make his meditated act work into his schemes of early retrieval and honorable return he must have been thinking there before the fire a long time for now the moon had risen and shone upon the black bulk of firs to the southward and on the group of outbuildings these were in a sort the mechanism that transacted the life of his house ministering to all its necessities and pleasures under the conservatories with their long stretches of glass catching the moons rays like levels of water was the steam furnace that imparted their summer climate through heavy mains carried below the basement to every chamber of the mansion a ragged plume of vapor escaped from the tall chimney above them and dishevelled itself in diaphanous silver on the nightbreeze beyond the hothouses lay the cold graperies and off to the left rose the stables in a cosy nook of this low mass northwick saw the lights of the coachmans familyrooms beyond the stables were the cowbarn and the dairy with the farmers cottage it was a sort of joke with northwicks business friends that you could buy butter of him sometimes at less than half it cost him and the joke flattered northwicks sense of baronial consequence with regard to his place it was really a farm in extent and it was mostly a grazing farm his cattle were in the herdbooks and he raised horses which he would sell now and then to a friend they were so distinctly varied from the original stock as to form almost a breed of themselves they numbered scores in his stalls and pastures the whole group of the buildings was so great that it was like a sort of communal village in the silent moonlight northwick looked at it as if it were an expansion or extension of himself so personally did it seem to represent his tastes and so historical was it of the ambitions of his whole life he realized that it would be like literally tearing himself from it when he should leave it that would be the real pang his children could come to him but not his home but he reminded himself that he was going only for a time until he could rehabilitate himself and come back upon the terms he could easily make when once he was on his feet again he thought how fortunate it was that in the meanwhile this property could not be alienated how fortunate it was that he had originally deeded it to his wife in the days when he had the full right to do so and she had willed it to their children by a perfect entail the horses and the cattle might go and probably must go and he winced to think of it but the land and the houseall but the furniture and pictureswere the childrens and could not be touched the pictures were his and would have to go with the horses and cattle but ten or twelve thousand dollars would replace them and he must add that sum to his other losses and bear it as well as he could  after all when everything was said and done he was the chief loser if he was a thief as that man said he could show that he had robbed himself of two dollars for every dollar that he had robbed anybody else of if now he was going to add to his theft by carrying off the fortythree thousand dollars of the companys which he found himself possessed of it was certainly not solely in his own interest it was to be the means of recovering all that had gone before it and that the very men whom it would enable him to repay finally in full supposed it to have gone with  northwick felt almost a glow of pride in clarifying this point to his reason the additional theft presented itself almost in the light of a duty it really was his duty to make reparation to those he had injured if he had injured any one and it was his first duty to secure the means of doing it if that money which it might almost be said was left providentially in his hands were simply restored now to the company it would do comparatively no good at all and would strip him of every hope of restoring the whole sum he had borrowed he arrived at that word again and reinforced by it he stooped again to work the combination of his safe and make sure of the money which he now felt an insane necessity of laying his hands on but he turned suddenly sick with a sickness at the heart or at the stomach and he lifted himself and took a turn about the room  he perceived that in spite of the outward calm which it had surprised him to find in himself he was laboring under some strong inward stress and he must have relief from it if he was to carry this business through he threw up the window and stood with his hand on the sash quivering in the strong inrush of the freezing air but it strengthened him and when he put down the window after a few moments his faintness passed altogether still he thought he would not go through that business at once there was time enough he would see his girls and tell them that he was obliged to leave by an early train in the morning  he took off his shoes and put on his slippers and his housecoat and went to the stairlanding outside and listened to the voices in the library below he could hear only womens voices and he inferred that the young man who had been dining with his daughters was gone he went back into his bedroom and looked at the face of an unmasked thief in his glass it was not to get that aspect of himself though that he looked it was to see if he was pale or would seem ill to his children     iv   northwick was fond of both his daughters if he was more demonstrative in meeting the younger it was because she had the more modern and more urban habit of caressing her father the elder who was very much the elder followed an earlier country fashion of selfpossession and remained silent and seated when he came into the room though she watched with a pleased interest the exchange of endearments between him and her sister her name was adeline which was her mothers name too and she had the effect of being the aunt of the young girl she was thin and tall and she had a new england indigestion which kept her looking frailer than she really was she conformed to the change of circumstances which she had grown into almost as consciously as her parents and dressed richly in sufficiently fashionable gowns which she preferred to have of silk cinnamon or brown in color on her slight bony fingers she wore a good many rings  suzette was the name of the other daughter her mother had fancied that name but the single monosyllable it had been shortened into somehow suited the proudlooking girl better than the whole name with its suggestion of coquettishness  she asked why didnt you come down papa mr wade was calling and he stayed to dinner she smiled and it gave him a pang to see that she seemed unusually happy he could have borne better he perceived to leave her miserable at least then he would not have wholly made her so  i had some matters to look after he said i thought i might get down before he went a deep leathern armchair stood before the hearth where the young rector had been sitting with the ladies at either corner of the mantel northwick let himself sink into it and with a glance at the face of the faintly ticking clock on the black marble shelf before him he added casually i must get an early train for ponkwasset in the morning and i still have some things to put in shape  is there any trouble there the girl asked from the place she had resumed she held by one hand from the corner of the mantel and let her head droop over on her arm her father had a sense of her extraordinary beauty as a stranger might have had  trouble he echoed  with the hands  oh no nothing of that sort what made you think so asked northwick rapidly exploring the perspective opened up in his mind by her question to see if it contained any suggestion of advantage to him he found an instants relief in figuring himself called to the mills by a labor trouble  that tiresome little wretch of a putney is going about circulating all sorts of reports  there is no reason as yet to suppose the strike will affect us said northwick but i think i had better be on the ground  i should think you could leave it to the superintendent said the girl without wearing your own life out about it  i suppose i might said northwick with an effect of refusing to acquire merit by his behavior but the older hands all know me so well that  he stopped as if it were unnecessary to go on and the elder daughter said he is on one of his sprees again i should think something ought to be done about him for his familys sake if nothing else elbridge told james that you almost drove over him coming up  yes said northwick i didnt see him until he started up under the horses feet  he will get killed some of these days said adeline with the sort of awful satisfaction in realizing a catastrophe which delicate women often feel  it would be the best thing for him said her sister and for his family too when a man is nothing but a burden and a disgrace to himself and everybody belonging to him he had better die as soon as possible  northwick sat looking into his daughters beautiful face but he saw the inflamed and heated visage of the president of the board and he heard him saying the best thing that could happen to you on your way home would be a good railroad accident  he sighed faintly and said we cant always tell i presume it isnt for us to say he went on with that leniency for the shortcomings of others which we feel when we long for mercy to our own putney is a very able man one of the ablest lawyers in the state and very honest he could be almost anything if he would let liquor alone i dont wish to judge him he may havenorthwick sighed again and ended vaguelyhis reasons  suzette laughed how moderate you always are papa and how tolerant  i guess mr putney knows pretty well whom hes got to deal with and that hes safe in abusing you all he likes said adeline but i dont see how such respectable people as dr morrell and mrs morrell can tolerate him ive no patience with dr morrell or his wife either to be sure they tolerate mrs wilmington too  suzette went over to her father to kiss him well im going to bed papa if youd wanted more of my society you ought to have come down sooner i suppose i shant see you in the morning so its goodbye as well as goodnight when will you be home  not for some days perhaps said the unhappy man  how doleful are you always so homesick when you go away  not always no  well try to cheer up this time then and if you have to be gone a great while send for me wont you  yes yes i will said northwick the girl gave his head a hug and then glided out of the room she stopped to throw him a kiss from the door  there said adeline i didnt mean to let mrs wilmington slip out she cant bear the name and i know it drove her away but you mustnt let it worry you father i guess its all going well now  whats going well northwick asked vaguely  the jack wilmington business i know shes really given him up at last and we cant be too thankful for that much if its no more i dont believe hes bad for all the talk about him but hes been weak and thats a thing she couldnt forgive in a man shes so strong herself  northwick did not think of wilmington he thought of himself and in the depths of his guilty soul in those secret places underneath all his pretences where he really knew himself a thief he wondered if his childs strength would be against her forgiving his weakness what we greatly dread we most unquestioningly believe and it did not occur to him to ask whether impatience with weakness was a necessary inference from strength he only knew himself to be miserably weak  he rose and stood a moment by the mantel with his impassive handsome face turned toward his daughter as if he were going to speak to her he was a tall man rather thin he was clean shaven except for the grayish whiskers just forward of his ears and on a line with them he had a regular profile which was more attractive than the expression of his direct regard he took up a crystal ball that lay on the marble and looked into it as if he were reading his future in its lucid depths and then put it down again with an effect of helplessness when he spoke it was not in connection with what his daughter had been talking about he said almost dryly i think i will go up and look over some papers i have to take with me and then try to get a little sleep before i start  and when shall we expect you back asked his daughter submissively accepting his silence concerning her sisters love affairs she knew that it meant acquiescence in anything that sue and she thought best  i dont know exactly i cant say now goodnight  to her surprise he came up and kissed her his caresses were for sue and she expected them no more than she invited them why father she said in a pleased voice  let james pack the small bag for me and send elbridge to me in about an hour he said as he went out into the hall     v   northwick was now fiftynine years old but long before he reached this age he had seen many things to make him doubt the moral government of the universe his earliest instruction had been such as we all receive he had been taught to believe that there was an overruling power which would punish him if he did wrong and reward him if he did right or would at least be displeased in one case and pleased in the other the precept took primarily the monitory form and first enforced the fact of the punishment or the displeasure there were times when the reward or the pleasure might not sensibly follow upon good behavior but evil behavior never escaped the just consequences this was the doctrine which framed the mans intention if not his conduct of life and continued to shape it years after experience of the world and especially of the business world had gainsaid it he had seen a great many cases in which not only good behavior had apparently failed of its reward but bad behavior had failed of its punishment in the case of bad behavior his observation had been that no unhappiness not even any discomfort came from it unless it was found out for the most part it was not found out this did not shake northwicks principles he still intended to do right so as to be on the safe side even in a remote and improbable contingency but it enabled him to compromise with his principles and to do wrong provisionally and then repair the wrong before he was found out or before the overruling power noticed him  but now there were things that made him think in the surprising misery of being found out that this power might have had its eye upon him all the time and was not sleeping or gone upon a journey as he had tacitly flattered himself it seemed to him that there was even a dramatic contrivance in the circumstances to render his anguish exquisite he had not read many books but sometimes his daughters made him go to the theatre and once he had seen the play of macbeth the people round him were talking about the actor who played the part of macbeth but northwick kept his mind critically upon the play and it seemed to him false to what he had seen of life in having all those things happen just so to fret the conscience and torment the soul of the guilty man he thought that in reality they would not have been quite so pat it gave him rather a low opinion of shakespeare lower than he would have dared to have if he had been a more cultivated man now that play came back into his mind and he owned with a pang that it was all true he was being quite as aptly visited for his transgression his heart was being wrung too by the very things that could hurt it most he had not been very well of late and was not feeling physically strong his anxieties had preyed upon him and he had never felt the need of the comfort and quiet of his home so much as now when he was forced to leave it never had it all been so precious never had the beauty and luxury of it seemed so great all that was nothing though to the thought of his children especially of that youngest child whom his heart was so wrapt up in and whom he was going to leave to shame and ruin the words she had spoken from her pride in him her ignorant censure of that drunkard as a man who had better die since he had become nothing but a burden and disgrace to his family stung on as if by incessant repetition he had crazy thoughts impulses fantasies in which he swiftly dreamed renunciation of escape then he knew that it would not avail anything to remain it would not avail anything even to die nothing could avail anything at once but in the end his going would avail most he must go it would break the childs heart to face his shame and she must face it he did not think of his eldest daughter except to think that the impending disaster could not affect her so ruinously  my god my god he groaned as he went up stairs adeline called from the room he had left did you speak father  he had a conscience that mechanical conscience which becomes so active in times of great moral obliquity against telling a little lie and saying he had not spoken he went on up stairs without answering anything he indulged the self pity a little longer of feeling himself an old man forced from his home and he had a blind reasonless resentment of the behavior of the men who were driving him away and whose interests even at that moment he was mindful of but he threw off this mood when he entered his room and settled himself to business there was a good deal to be done in the arrangement of papers for his indefinite absence and he used the same care in providing for some minor contingencies in the companys affairs as in leaving instructions to his children for their action until they should hear from him again afterwards this curious scrupulosity became a matter of comment among those privy to it some held it another proof of the ingrained rascality of the man a trick to suggest lenient construction of his general conduct in the management of the companys finances others saw in it an interesting example of the involuntary operation of business instincts which persisted at a juncture when the man might be supposed to have been actuated only by the most intensely selfish motives  the question was not settled even in the final retrospect when it appeared that at the very moment that northwick showed himself mindful of the companys interests on those minor points he was defrauding it further in the line of his defalcations and keeping back a large sum of money that belonged to it but at that moment northwick did not consider that this money necessarily belonged to the company any more than his daughters house and farm belonged to it to be sure it was the fruit of money he had borrowed or taken from the company and had used in an enormously successful deal but the company had not earned it and in driving him into a corner in forcing him to make instant restitution of all its involuntary loans it was justifying him in withholding this part of them northwick was a man of too much sense to reason explicitly to this effect but there was a sophistry tacitly at work in him to this effect which made it possible for him to go on and steal more where he had already stolen so much in fact it presented the further theft as a sort of duty this sum large as it was really amounted to nothing in comparison with the sum he owed the company but it formed his only means of restitution and if he did not take it and use it to that end he might be held recreant to his moral obligations he contended from that vestibule of his soul where he was not a thief with that self of his inmost where he was a thief that it was all most fortunate if not providential as it had fallen out not only had his broker sent him that large check for his winnings in stocks the day before but northwick had contrary to his custom cashed the check and put the money in his safe instead of banking it now he could perceive a leading in the whole matter though at the time it seemed a flagrant defiance of chance and a sort of invitation to burglars he seemed to himself like a burglar when he had locked the doors and pulled down the curtains and stood before the safe working the combination he trembled and when at last the mechanism announced its effect with a slight click of the withdrawing bolt he gave a violent start at the same time there came a rough knock at the door and northwick called out in the choking incoherent voice of one suddenly roused from sleep hello whos there what is it  its me said elbridge  oh yes well all right hold on a minute ahyou can come back in ten or fifteen minutes im not quite ready for you yet northwick spoke the first broken sentences from the safe where he stood in a frenzy of dismay the more collected words were uttered from his desk where he ran to get his pistol he did not know why he thought elbridge might try to force his way in perhaps it was because any presence on the outside of the door would have terrified him he had time to recognize that he was not afraid for the money but that he was afraid for himself in the act of taking it  elbridge gave a cough on the other side of the door and said with a little hesitation all right and northwick heard him tramp away and go down stairs  he went back to the safe and pulled open the heavy door whose resistance helped him shake off his nervousness then he took the money from the drawer where he had laid it counted it slipped it into the inner pocket of his waistcoat and buttoned it in there he shut the safe and locked it the succession of these habitual acts calmed him more and more and after he had struck a match and kindled the fire on his hearth which he had hitherto forgotten he was able to settle again to his preparations in writing     vi   when elbridge came back northwick called out come in and then went and unlocked the door for him i forgot it was locked he said carelessly do you think the colts going to be lame  well i dont like the way she behaves very well them shoes have got to come off elbridge stood at the corner of the desk and diffused a strong smell of stable through the hot room  youll see to it of course said northwick im going away in the morning and i dont know just how long i shall be gone northwick satisfied his mechanical scruple against telling a lie by this formula and in its shelter he went on to give elbridge instructions about the management of the place in his absence he took some money from his pocketbook and handed it to him for certain expenses and then he said i want to take the five oclock train that reaches ponkwasset at nine you can drive me up with the black mare  all right said elbridge but his tone expressed a shadow of reluctance that did not escape northwick  anything the matter he asked  i dunno our little boy dont seem to be very well  what ails him asked northwick with the sympathy it was a relief for him to feel  well dr morrells just been there and hes afraid its the membranous crou the last letter stuck in elbridges throat he gulped it down  oh i hope not said northwick  hes comin back againhe had to go off to another placebut i could see twant no use said elbridge with patient despair he had got himself in hand again and spoke clearly  northwick shrank back from the shadow sweeping so near him a shadow thrown from the skies no doubt but terrible in its blackness on the earth why of course you mustnt think of leaving your wife you must telephone simpson to come for me  all right elbridge took himself away  northwick watched him across the icy stableyard going to the coachmans quarters in that cosy corner of the spreading barn the windows were still as cheerily bright with lamplight as when they struck a pang of dumb envy to northwicks heart the childs sickness must have been very sudden for his daughters not to have known of it he thought he ought to call adeline and send her in there to those poor people but he reflected that she could do no good and he spared her the useless pain she would soon need all her strength for herself his thought returned to his own cares from which the trouble of another had lured it for a moment but when he heard the doctors sleighbells clash into the stableyard he decided to go himself and show the interest his family ought to feel in the matter  no one answered his knock at elbridges door and he opened it and found his way into the room where elbridge and his wife were with the doctor the little boy had started up in his crib and was struggling with his arms thrown wildly about  there there hes got another of them chokin spells screamed the mother elbridge newton aint you goin to do anything oh help him save him dr morrell oh i should think youd be ashamed to let him suffer so she sprang upon the child and caught him from the doctors hands and turned him this way and that trying to ease him he was suddenly quiet and she said there i just knew i could do it what are you big strong men good for any she looked down at the childs face in her arms and then up at the doctors and she gave a wild screech like the cry of one in piercing torment  it turned northwick heartsick he felt himself worse than helpless there but he went to the farmers house and told the farmers wife to go over to the newtons their little boy had just died he heard her coming before he reached his own door and when he reached his room he heard the bells of the doctors sleigh clashing out of the avenue  the voice and the look of that childless mother haunted him she had been one of the hatshop hands a flighty nervous thing madly in love with elbridge whom she ruled with a sort of frantic devotion since their marriage compensating his cool quiet with a perpetual flutter of exaggerated sensibilities in every direction but somehow she had put northwick in mind of his own mother and he thought of the chance or the will that had bereaved one and spared the other and he envied the little boy who had just died  he considered the case of the parents who would want to make full outward show of their grief and he wrote elbridge a note to be given him in the morning and enclosed one of the bills he was taking from the company he hoped elbridge would accept it from him towards the expenses he must meet at such a time  then he wheeled his chair about to the fire and stretched his legs out to get what rest he could before the hour of starting he would have liked to go to bed but he was afraid of oversleeping himself in case elbridge had neglected to telephone simpson but he did not believe this possible and he had smoothly confided himself to his experience of elbridges infallibility when he started awake at the sound of bells before the front door and then the titter of the electric bell over his bed in the next room he thought it was an officer come to arrest him but he remembered that only his household was acquainted with the use of that bell and then he wondered that simpson should have found it out he put on his overcoat and arctics and caught up his bag and hurried down stairs and out of doors it was elbridge who was waiting for him on the threshold and took his bag from him  why wheres simpson he asked couldnt you get him  its all right said elbridge opening the door of the booby and gently bundling northwick into it i could come justs easy as not i thought youd ride better in the booby its a little mite chilly for the cutter the stars seemed points of ice in the freezing sky the broken snow clinked like charcoal around elbridges feet he shut the booby door and then came back and opened it slightly i want agoin to let no simpson carry you to no train noway  the tears came into northwicks eyes and he tried to say why thank you elbridge but the door shut upon his failure and elbridge mounted to his place and drove away northwick had been able to get out of his house only upon condition that he should behave as if he were going to be gone on an ordinary journey he had to keep the same terms with himself on the way to the station when he got out there he said to elbridge ive left a note for you on my desk im sorry to be leaving homeat such a timewhen youve  youll telegraph when to meet you elbridge suggested  yes said northwick he went inside the station which was deliciously warm from the large register in the centre of the room and brilliantly lighted in readiness for the train now almost due the closing of the door behind northwick roused a little black figure drooping forward on the benching in one corner it was the drunken lawyer there had been some displeasures general and personal between the two men and they did not speak but now at sight of northwick putney came forward and fixed him severely with his eye  northwick do you know who you tried to drive over last evening  northwick returned his regard with the halfironical halfpatronizing look a dull man puts on with a person of less fortune but more brain i didnt see you mr putney until i was quite upon you the horses  it was the law you tried to drive over thundered the little man with a voice out of keeping with his slender body dont try it too often you cant drive over the law yetyou havent quite millions enough for that heigh that so he queried sensible of the anticlimax of asking such a question in that way but tipsily helpless in it  northwick did not answer he walked to the other end of the station set off for ladies and putney did not follow him the train came in and northwick went out and got aboard     vii   the president of the board who had called northwick a thief and yet had got him a chance to make himself an honest man was awake at the hour the defaulter absconded after passing quite as sleepless a night he had kept a dinner engagement hoping to forget northwick but he seemed to be eating and drinking him at every course when he came home toward eleven oclock he went to his library and sat down before the fire his wife had gone to bed and his son and daughter were at a ball and he sat there alone smoking impatiently  he told the man who looked in to see if he wanted anything that he might go to bed he need not sit up for the young people hilary had that kind of consideration for servants and he liked to practise it he liked to realize that he was practising it now in a moment when every habit of his life might very well yield to the great and varying anxieties which beset him  he had an ideal of conduct of what was due from him to himself as a gentleman and a citizen and he could not conceal from himself that he had been mainly instrumental in the escape of a rogue from justice when he got the board to give northwick a chance his ideals had not hitherto stood in the way of his comfort his entire repose of mind any more than they had impaired his prosperity though they were of a kind far above those which commercial honor permits a man to be content with he held himself bound as a man of a certain origin and social tradition to have public spirit and he had a great deal of it he believed that he owed it to the community to do nothing to lower its standards of personal integrity and responsibility and he distinguished himself by a gratified consciousness from those people of chromomorality who held all sorts of loose notions on such points his name stood not merely for so much money many names stood for far more but it meant reliability it meant honesty it meant good faith he really loved these things though no doubt he loved them less for their own sake than because they were spiritual properties of eben hilary he did not expect everybody else to have them but his theory of life exacted that they should be held the chief virtues he was so conscious of their value that he ignored all those minor qualities in himself which rendered him not only bearable but even lovable he was not aware of having any sort of foibles so that any error of conduct in himself surprised him even more than it pained him it was not easy to recognize it but when he once saw it he was not only willing but eager to repair it  the error that he had committed in northwicks case if it was an error was one that presented peculiar difficulties as every error in life does the errors love an infinite complexity of disguise and masquerade as all sorts of things there were moments when hilary saw his mistake so clearly that it seemed to him nothing less than the repayment of northwicks thefts from his own pocket would satisfy the claims of justice to his fellowlosers if northwick ran away and then again it looked like the act of wise mercy which it had appeared to him when he was urging the board to give the man a chance as the only thing which they could hopefully do in the circumstances as common sense as business but it was now so obvious that a man like northwick could and would do nothing but run away if he were given the chance that he seemed to have been his accomplice when he used the force of his personal character with them in northwicks behalf he was in a ridiculous position there was no doubt of that and he was not going to get out of it without much painful wear and tear of pride of selfrespect  after a long time he looked at the clock and found it still early for the return of his young people he was impatient to see his son and to get the situation in the light of his mind and see how it looked there he had already told him of the defalcation and of what the board had decided to do with northwick but this was while he was still in the glow of action and he had spoken very hurriedly with matt who came in just as he was going out to dinner it was before his cold fit came on  he had reached that time of life when a man likes to lay his troubles before his son and in the view his son usually took of his troubles hilary seemed to find another mood of his own it was a fresher different self dealing with them for the fellow was not only younger and more vigorous he was another temperament with the same interests and often the same principles he had disappointed hilary in some ways but he had gratified his pride in the very ways he had disappointed him the father had expected the son to go into business and matt did go into the mills at ponkwasset where he was to be superintendent in the natural course but one day he came home and told his father that he had begun to have his doubts of the existing relations of labor and capital and until he could see his way clearer he would rather give up his chance with the company it was a keen disappointment to hilary he made no concealment of that but he did not quarrel with his son about it he robustly tolerated matts queer notions not only because he was a father who blindly doted on his children and behaved as if everything they did was right no matter if it put him in the wrong but because he chose to respect the fellows principles if those were his principles he had his own principles and matt should have his if he liked he bore entirely well the purpose of going abroad that matt expressed and he wished to give him much more money than the fellow would take to carry on those researches which he made in his travels when he came back and published his monograph on work and wages in europe hilary paid the expense and took as unselfish an interest in the slow and meagre sale of the little book as if it had cost him nothing  eben hilary had been a crank too in his day so far as to have gone counter to the most respectable feeling of business in boston when he came out an abolitionist his individual impulse to radicalism had exhausted itself in that direction we are each of us good for only a certain degree of advance in opinion few men are indefinitely progressive and hilary had not caught on to the movement that was carrying his son with it but he understood how his son should be what he was and he loved him so much that he almost honored him for what he called his balderdash about industrial slavery his heart lifted when at last he heard the scratching of the nightlatch at the door below and he made lumbering haste down stairs to open and let the young people in he reached the door as they opened it and in the momentary lightness of his soul at sight of his children he gave them a gay welcome and took his daughter all a fluff of soft silken and furry wraps into his arms  oh dont kiss my nose she called out itll freeze you to death papa what in the world are you up for anything the matter with mamma  no she was in bed when i came home i thought i would sit up and ask what sort of a time youd had  did you ever know me to have a bad one i had the best time in the world i danced every dance and i enjoyed it just as much as if i had shut and been a bud again but dont you know its very bad for old gentlemen to be up so late  they were mounting the stairs and when they reached the library she went in and poked her longgloved hands well in over the fire on the hearth while she lifted her eyes to the clock oh it isnt so very late only five  no its early said her father with the security in a feeble joke which none but fathers can feel with none but their grownup daughters its full an hour yet before matt would be getting up to feed his cattle if he were in vardley hilary had given matt the old family place there and he always liked to make a joke of his getting an honest living by farming it  dont speak of that agricultural angel said the girl putting her draperies back with one hand and confining them with her elbow so as to give her other hand greater comfort of the fire to do better yet she dropped on both knees before it  was he nice asked the father with confidence  nice ask all the plain girls he danced with all the dull girls he talked with when i think what a good time i should have with him as a plain girl if i were not his sister i lose all patience she glanced up in her fathers face with all the strange charm of features that had no regular beauty and then as she had to do whenever she remembered them she asserted the grace which governed every movement and gesture in her and got as lightly to her feet as if she were a windbowed flower tilting back to its perpendicular her father looked at her with as fond a delight as a lover could have felt in her fascination she was in fact a youthful feminine version of himself in her plainness though the grace was all her own her complexion was not the leathery red of her fathers but a smooth and even white from cheek to throat she let her loose cloak fall to the chair behind her and showed herself tall and slim with that odd visage of hers drooping from a perfect neck why she said if we had all been horned cattle he couldnt have treated us better  do you hear that matt asked the father as his son came in after a methodical and deliberate bestowal of his outer garments below his method and his deliberation were part of the joke of him in the family  complaining of me for making her walk home he asked in turn with the quiet which was another part of the joke i didnt suppose youd give me away louise  i didnt i knew i only had to wait and you would give yourself away said the girl  did he make you walk home said the father thats the reason your hands are so cold  theyre not very coldnow and if they were i shouldnt mind it in such a cause  what cause  oh the general shamefulness of disusing the feet god had given me but it was only three blocks and i had my arctics she moved a little away toward the fire again and showed the arctics on the floor where she must have been scuffling them off under her skirts ugh but its cold she now stretched a satin slipper in toward the fire  yes its a cold night but you seem to have got home alive and i dont think youll be the worse for it now if you go to bed at once said her father  is that a hint she asked with a dreamy appreciation of the warmth through the toe of her slipper  not at all we should be glad to have you sit up the whole night with us  ah now i know youre hinting is it business  yes its business  well im just in the humor for business ive had enough pleasure  i dont see why louise shouldnt stay and talk business with us if she likes i think its a pity to keep women out of it as if it didnt concern them said the son ninetenths of the time it concerns them more than it does men he had a bright friendly philosophical smile in saying this and he stood waiting for his sister to be gone with a patience which their father did not share he stood something over six feet in his low shoes and his powerful frame seemed starting out of the dresssuit which it appeared so little related to his whole face was handsome and regular and his full beard did not wholly hide a mouth of singular sweetness  yes i think so too in the abstract said the father if the business were mine or were business in the ordinary sense of the term  why why did you say it was business at all then the girl put her arms round her fathers neck and let her headscarf fall on the rug a little way from her cloak and her arctics if you hadnt said it was business i should have been in bed long ago then as if feeling her fathers eagerness to have her gone she said good night and gave him a kiss and a hug or two more and said good night matt and got herself away letting a long glove trail somewhere out of her dress and stretch its weak length upon the floor after her as if it were trying to follow her     viii   louises father in turning to look from her toward his son felt himself slightly pricked in the cheek by the pin that had transferred itself from her neckgear to his coat collar and matt went about picking up the cloak the arctics the scarf and the glove he laid the cloak smoothly on the leathern lounge and arranged the scarf and glove on it and set the arctics on the floor in a sort of normal relation to it and then came forward in time to relieve his father of the pin that was pricking him and that he was rolling his eyes out of his head to get sight of  what in the devil is that he roared  louises pin said matt as placidly as if that were quite the place for it and its function were to prick her father in the cheek he went and pinned it into her scarf and then he said its about northwick i suppose  yes said his father still furious from the pinprick im afraid the miserable scoundrel is going to run away  did you expect there was a chance of that asked matt quietly  expect his father blustered i dont know what i expected i might have expected anything of him but common honesty the position i took at the meeting was that our only hope was to give him a chance he made all sorts of professions of ability to meet the loss i didnt believe him but i thought that he might partially meet it and that nothing was to be gained by proceeding against him you cant get blood out of a turnip even by crushing the turnip  that seems sound said the son with his reasonable smile  i didnt spare him but i got the others to spare him i told him he was a thief  oh said matt  why wasnt he returned his father angrily  yes yes i suppose he might be called so matt admitted it with an air of having his reservations which vexed his father still more  very well sir he roared then i called him so and i think that it will do him good to know it hilary did not repeat all of the violent things he had said to northwick though he had meant to do so being rather proud of them the tone of his sons voice somehow stopped him for the moment i brought them round to my position and we gave him the chance he asked for  it was really the only thing you could do  of course it was it was the only businesslike thing though it wont seem so when it comes out that hes gone to canada i told him i thought the best thing for him would be a good thorough railroad accident on his way home and that if it were not for his family for his daughter whos been in and out here so much with louise i would like to see him handcuffed and going down the street with a couple of constables  matt made no comment upon this perhaps because he saw no use in criticising his father and perhaps because his mind was more upon the point he mentioned it will be hard for that pretty creature  it will be hard for a number of creatures pretty and plain said his father it wont break any of us but it will shake some of us up abominably i dont know but it may send one or two people to the wall for the time being  ah but that isnt the same thing at all thats suffering it isnt shame it isnt the misery that the sin of your father has brought on you  well of course not said hilary impatiently granting it but miss northwick always seemed to me a tolerably tough kind of young person i never quite saw what louise found to like in her  they were at school together said the son shes a sufficiently offensive person i fancy or might be but she sometimes struck me as a person that one might be easily unjust to for that very reason i suppose she has the fascination that a proud girl has for a girl like louise  hilary asked with a divergence more apparent than real how is that affair of hers with jack wilmington  i dont know it seems to have that quality of mystery that belongs to all affairs of the kind when they hang fire we expect people to get married and be done with it though that may not really be the way to be done with it  wasnt there some scandal about him of some kind  yes but i never believed in it  he always struck me as something of a cub but somehow he doesnt seem the sort of a fellow to give the girl up because  because her father is a fraud matt suggested no i dont think he is quite but there are always a great many things that enter into the matter besides a mans feelings or his principles even i cant say what i think wilmington would do what steps do you propose to take next in the matter  i promised him he shouldnt be followed up while he was trying to right himself if we find hes gone we must give the case into the hands of the detectives i suppose the disgust showed itself in hilarys face which was an index to all his emotions and his son said with a smile of sympathy  the apparatus of justice isnt exactly attractive even when one isnt a criminal but i dont know that its any more repulsive than the apparatus of commerce or business as we call it some dirt seems to get on everybodys bread by the time hes earned it or on his money even when hes made it in large sums as our class do  the last words gave the father a chance to vent his vexation with himself upon his son i wish you wouldnt talk that walkingdelegates rant with me matt if i let you alone in your nonsense i think you may fitly take it as a sign that i wish to be let alone myself  i beg your pardon said the young man i didnt wish to annoy you  dont do it then after a moment hilary added with a return to his own sense of deficiency the whole things as thoroughly distasteful to me as it can be but i cant see how i could have acted otherwise than ive done i know ive made myself responsible in a way for northwicks getting off but there was really nothing to do but to give him the chance he asked for his having abused it wont change that fact at all but i cant conceal from myself that i halfexpected him to abuse it  he put this tentatively and his son responded i suppose that naturally inclines you to suppose hell run away  yes  but your supposition doesnt establish the fact  no but the question is whether it doesnt oblige me to act as if it had whether i oughtnt if ive got this suspicion to take some steps at once to find out whether northwicks really gone or not and to mix myself actively up in the catchpole business of his pursuit after i promised him he shouldnt be shadowed in any way till his three days were over  its a nice question said matt or rather its a nasty one still youve only got your fears for evidence and you must all have had your fears before i dont think that even a bad conscience ought to hurry one into the catchpole business matt laughed again with that fondness he had for his father though as for any peculiar disgrace in catchpoles as catchpoles i dont see it theyre a necessary part of the administration of justice as we understand it and have it and i dont see how a detective who arrests say a murderer is not as respectably employed as the judge who sentences him or the hangman who puts the rope round his neck the distinction we make between them is one of those tricks for shirking responsibility which are practised in every part of the system not that i want you to turn catchpole its all so sorrowful and sickening that i wish you hadnt any duty at all in the matter i suppose you feel at least that you ought to let the board know that you have your misgivings  yes said hilary ruefully with his double chin on his breast i felt like doing it at once but there was my word to him and i wanted to talk with you  it was just as well to let them have their nights rest there isnt really anything to be done matt rose from the low chair where he had been sprawling and stretched his stalwart arms abroad if the man was going hes gone past recall by this time and if he isnt gone theres no immediate cause for anxiety  then you wouldnt do anything at present  i certainly shouldnt what could you do  yes it might as well all go till morning i suppose  good night the son said suggestively i suppose there isnt really anything more  no what could there be you had better go to bed  and you too i hope father  oh i shall go to bedas a matter of form  the son laughed i wish you could carry your formality so far as to go to sleep too i shall  i shant sleep said the father bitterly when things like this happen someone has to lie awake and think about them  well i dare say northwicks doing that  i doubt it said hilary i suspect northwick is enjoying a refreshing slumber on the montreal express somewhere near st albans about this time  i doubt if his dreams are pleasant after all hes only going to a larger prison if hes going into exile he may be on the montreal express but i guess he isnt sleeping said matt  yes his father admitted poor devil hed much better be dead     ix   the groom who drove miss sue northwick down to the station at noon that day came back without her an hour later he brought word to her sister that she had not found the friend she expected to meet at the station but had got a telegram from her there and had gone into town to lunch with her the man was to return and fetch her from the six oclock train  she briefly explained at dinner that her friend had been up at four balls during the week and wished to beg off from the visit she had promised until after the fifth which was to be that night  i dont see how she lives through it said adeline and at her age it seems very odd to be just as fond of dancing as if she were a bud  louise is only twentythree said suzette if she were married she would be just in the heart of her gayeties at that age or even older  but she isnt married and that makes all the difference  her brother is spending the month at home and she makes the most of his being with them  has he given up his farming its about time  no not at all i believe she says hes in boston merely as a matter of duty to chaperon her at parties and save her mother from having to go with her  well said adeline i should think he would want to be of some use in the world and if he wont help his father in business he had better help his mother in society  suzette sat fallen back in her chair for the moment and she said as if she had not heeded i think i will give a little dance here next week louise can come up for a couple of days and we can have it thursday we made out the listjust a few people she went out with me after lunch and we saw most of the girls and i ordered the supper mrs lambert will matronize them itll be an old dance rather as far as the girls are concerned but ive asked two or three buds and some of the young married people it will be very pleasant dont you think  very do you think mr wade would like to come  suzette smiled i dare say he would i wasnt thinking of him in making it but i dont see why he shouldnt look in  he might come to the supper adeline mused aloud if it isnt one of his church days i never can keep the run of them  we were talking about that and we decided that thursday would be perfectly safe louise and i looked it up together but we knew we could make everything sure by asking mrs lambert first of all she would have been certain to object if we had made any mistake  im very glad said adeline i know father will be glad to have mr wade here hes taken a great fancy to him  mr wades very nice said suzette coolly i shouldnt have liked to have it without him  they left the table and went into the library to talk the dance over at larger leisure suzette was somewhat sleepy from the fatigues of her escapade to boston and an afternoon spent mostly in the cold air and from time to time she yawned and said she must really go to bed and then went on talking  shall you have any of the south hatboro people her sister asked  mrs munger and her tribe said suzette with a contemptuous little smile i dont think she would contribute much why not the morrells or the putneys at once she added abruptly i think i shall ask jack wilmington adeline gave a start and looked keenly at her but she went on quite imperviously the hilarys know him matt hilary and he were quite friends at one time besides she said as if choosing now to recognize the quality of adelines gaze i dont care to have louise suppose theres the shadow of anything between us any more not even a quarrel  adeline gave a little sigh of relief im glad thats it im always afraid youll get  to thinking about him again you neednt be all thats as thoroughly dead and gone as anything can be in this world no she continued in the tone that is more than half for ones self in such dealings whatever there was of that or might have been mr wilmington has put an end to long ago it never was anything but a fancy and i dont believe it could have been anything else if it had ever come to the point  im glad it seems so to you now sue said her sister but you neednt tell me that you werent very much taken with him at one time and if its going to begin again id much rather you wouldnt have him here  suzette laughed at the oldmaidish anxiety do you think you shall see me at his feet before the evening is over but i should like to see him at mine for a moment and to have the chance of hearing his explanations  i dont believe hes ever been bad cried adeline hes just weak  very well i should like to hear what a man has to say for his weakness and then tell him that i had a little weakness of my own and didnt think i had strength to endure a husband that had to be explained  ah youre in love with him yet you shall never have him here in the world after the way hes treated you  dont be silly adeline dont be romantic if you had ever been in love yourself you would know that people outlive that as well as other things lets see how the drawingroom will do for the dance  she jumped from her chair and touched the electric button at the chimney you think that nothing but death can kill a fancy and yet nobody marries their first love and lots of women have second husbands the man showed himself at the door and she said to him in a rapid aside turn up the lights in the drawingroom james and returned to her sister no adeline the only really enduring and undying thing is a slight that lastswith me  adeline was moved to say in the perverse honesty of her soul and from the inborn new england love of justice i dont believe he ever meant it sue i dont believe but what he was influenced  suzette laughed not at all bitterly oh youre in love with him well you may have him if ever he offers himself to me lets look at the drawingroom she caught adeline round her bony waist where each rib defined itself to her hand and danced her out of the library across the hall into the white and gold saloon beyond yes she said with a critical look at the room it will do splendidly we shall have to put down linen of course but then the dancing will be superbas good as a bare floor yes it will be a grand success ugh come out come out come out how deathly cold it is  she ran back into the warm library and her sister followed more slowly you shouldnt think she said as if something in sues words had reminded her of it that coming so soon after mrs newtons little boy  well thats like you adeline to bring that up no indeed itll be a whole week nearly and besides he isnt quite one of the family what an idea  of course her sister assented abashed by sues scornful surprise  its too bad it should have happened just at this time said the girl with some relenting when is it to be  tomorrow at eleven said adeline she perceived that sues selfishness was more a selfishness of words perhaps than of thoughts or feelings you neednt have anything to do with it i can tell them you were not very well and didnt feel exactly like coming they will understand she was used to making excuses for suzette and a motherly fib like this seemed no harm to her     x   in the morning before her sister was astir adeline went out to the coachmans quarters in the stabling and met the mother of the dead child at the door come right in she said fiercely as she set it wide i presume you want to know if theres anything you can do for me thats what they all ask well there aint unless you can bring him back to life ive been up and doin as usual this mornin she said and a sound of frying came from the kitchen where she had left her work to let her visitor in we got to eat we got to live  the farmers wife came in from the next chamber where the little one lay she had her bonnet and shawl on as if going home after a nights watching she said i tell her hes better off where hes gone but she cant seem to sense the comfort of it  how do you know hes better off demanded the mother turning upon her it makes me tired to hear such stuff whos goin to take more care of the child where hes gone than what his mother could dont you talk nonsense mrs saunders you dont know anything about it and nobody does i can bear it yes ive got the strenth to stand up against death but i dont want any comfort you want to see elbridge miss northwick hes in the harness room i guess hes got to keep about too if he dont want to go clear crazy one thing he dont have to stand any comfortin i guess men dont say such things to each other as women do big fools as they be  mrs saunders gave miss northwick a wink of pity for mrs newton and expressed that she was hardly accountable for what she was saying  he used to complain of me for lettin arty get out into the stable among the horses but i guess he wont be troubled that way much more said the mother and then something in miss northwicks face seemed to stay her in her wild talk and she asked want i should call him for you  no no said adeline ill go right through to him myself she knew the way from the coachmans dwelling into the stable and she found elbridge oiling one of the harnesses with a sort of dogged attention to the work which he hardly turned from to look at her elbridge she asked did you drive father to the depot yesterday morning  yes maam i did  when did he say he would be back  well he said he couldnt say exactly but i understood in a day or two  did he expect to be anywhere but ponkwasset  no maam i didnt hear him say as he did  then its a mistake and of course i knew it was a mistake theres more than one northwick in the world i presume she laughed a little hysterically she had a newspaper in her hand and it shook with the nervous tremor that passed over her  why what is it miss northwick said elbridge with a perception of the trouble in her voice through the trouble in his own heart he stopped pulling the greasy sponge over the trace in his hand and turned towards her  oh nothing theres been an accident on the union and dominion railroad and of course its a mistake  she handed him the paper folded to the column which she wished to show and he took it between two fingertips so as to soil it as little as possible and stood reading it she went on saying he wouldnt be on the train if he was at ponkwasset i got the paper when i first came down stairs but i didnt happen to read the account till just now and then i thought id run out and see what father said to you about where he was going he told us he was going to the mills too and her voice growing more and more wistful died away in the fascination of watching the fascination of elbridge as he first took in the halfcolumn of scareheads and then followed down to the meagre details of the dispatch eked out with doubleleading to cover space  it appeared that the northern express had reached wellwater junction on the union and dominion line several hours behind time and after the usual stop there for supper had joined the boston train on the united states and canada for montreal and had just after leaving the junction run off the track the deadly car stove got in its work on the wreck and many lives had been lost by the fire especially in the parlor car it was impossible to give a complete list of the killed and wounded but several bodies were identified and among the names of passengers in the pullman that of t w northwick was reported from a telegram received by the conductor at wellwater asking to have a seat reserved from that point to montreal  it aint him i know it aint miss northwick said elbridge he offered to give her the paper but took another look at it before he finally yielded it theres lots of folks of the same name i dont care what it is and the initials aint the ones  no she said doubtfully but i didnt like the last name being the same  well you cant help that and as long as it aint the initials and you know your father is safe and sound at the mills you dont want to worry  no said adeline youre sure he told you he was going to the mills  why didnt he tell you he was i dont recollect just what he said but he told me about that note he left for me and that had the money in it for the funal elbridge stopped for a moment before he added he said hed telegraph just which train he wanted me to meet him when he was comin back why dumn it i guess i must be crazy we can settle it in half an hours timeor an hour or two at the outsideand no need to worry about it telegraph to the mills and find out whether hes there or not  he dropped his harness and went to the telephone and called up the western union operator at the station he had the usual telephonic contention with her as to who he was and what he wanted but he got her at last to take his dispatch to ponkwasset falls asking whether northwick was at the mills  there he said i dont believe but what thatll fix it all right and ill bring you in the answer myself when it comes miss northwick  i do hate to trouble you with my foolishness when  i guess you neednt mind about that said elbridge i guess it wouldnt make much difference to me if the whole world was burnt up be a kind of a relief he did not mean just the sense the words conveyed and she in her preoccupation with her own anxiety and her pity for him interpreted them aright  she stayed to add i dont know what he could have been on that train for any way do you  no and he want on it youll find that out  itll be very provoking she said forecasting the minor trouble of the greater troubles failure everybody will wonder if it isnt father and we shall have to tell them it isnt  well that wont be so bad as havin to tell em it is said elbridge getting back for the moment to his native dryness  thats true adeline admitted dont speak to anybody about it till you hear she knew from his making no answer that he would obey her and she hid the paper in her pocket as if she would hide the intelligence it bore from all the rest of the world  she let suzette sleep late after the fatigues of her day in boston and the excitement of their talk at night which she suspected had prevented the girl from sleeping early elbridges sympathetic incredulity had comforted her if it had not convinced her and she possessed herself in such patience as she could till the answer should come from the mills if her father were there then it would be all right and in the meantime she found some excuses for not believing the worst she feared there was no reason in the world why he should be on that train there was no reason why she should identify him with that t w northwick in the burntup car that was not his name and that was not the place where he would have been     xi   there was trouble with the telegraph and telephone connections between hatboro and ponkwasset and adeline had to go to the funeral without an answer to elbridges message below her surface interest in the ceremony and the behavior of the mourners and the friends which nothing could have alienated but the actual presence of calamity she had a nether misery of alternating hope and fear of anxieties continually reasoned down and of security lost the instant it was found the double strain told so upon her nerves that when the rites at the grave were ended she sent word to the clergyman and piteously begged him to drive home with her  why arent you well miss northwick he asked with a glance at her troubled face as he got into the covered sleigh with her  oh yes she said and she flung herself back against the cushioning and began to cry  poor mrs newtons grief has been very trying he said gently and with a certain serenity of smile he had and he added as if he thought it well to lure miss northwick from the minor affliction that we feel for others sorrows to the sorrow itself it has been a terrible blow to herso sudden and her only child  oh it isnt that said adeline frankly havehave you seen thepaper this morning  it came said the clergyman but in view of the duty before me i thought i wouldnt read it is there anything particular in it  no nothing onlyonly adeline had not been able to separate herself from the dreadful thing and she took it out of the carriage pocket there has been an accident on the railroad she began firmly but she broke down in the effort to go on and i wanted to have you seesee she stopped and handed him the paper  he took it and ran over the account of the accident and came at her trouble with an instant intelligence that was in itself a sort of reassurance but had you any reason to suppose your father was on the train  no she said from the strength he gave her that is the strange part about it he went up to the mills yesterday morning and he couldnt have been on the train at all only the name  it isnt quite the name said wade with a gentle moderation as if he would not willingly make too much of the difference and felt truth to be too sacred to be tampered with even while it had merely the form of possibility  no said adeline eager to be comforted and im sure hes at the mills elbridge has sent a dispatch to find out if hes there but there must be something the matter with the telegraph we hadnt heard before the funeral or at least he didnt bring the word and i hated to keep round after him when  he probably hadnt heard said the clergyman soothingly and no news is good news you know but hadnt we better drive round by the station and find out whether any answer has been  o no i couldnt do that said adeline nervously they will telephone the answer up to elbridge but come home with me if you havent something to do and stay with us till we  oh very willingly on the way the young clergyman talked of the accident guessing that her hysterical conjectures had heightened the horror and that he should make it less dreadful by exploring its facts with her he did not declare it impossible her father should have been on the train but he urged the extreme improbability  elbridge and his wife passed them driving rapidly in simpsons booby which adeline had ordered for their use at the funeral and when she got into the house elbridge was waiting there for her he began at once miss northwick i dont believe but what your fathers staid over at springfield for something he was talkin to me last week about some hosses there  isnt he at the mills she demanded sharply  elbridge gave his hat a turn on his hand before he looked up well no he haint been yet  adeline made no sound but she sank down as a column of water sinks  at the confusion of movements and voices that followed suzette came to the door of the library and looked wonderingly into the hall where this had happened with a book clasped over her finger what in the world is the matter she asked with a sort of sarcastic amaze at sight of elbridge lifting something from the floor  dont be alarmed miss suzette said mr wade your sister seems a little faint and  its this sickening heat cried the girl running to the door and setting it wide it suffocates me when i come in from the outside ill get some water she vanished and was back again instantly stooping over adeline to wet her forehead and temples the rush of the cold air began to revive her she opened her eyes and suzette said severely what has come over you adeline arent you well and as adeline answered nothing she went on i dont believe she knows where she is let us get her into the library on the lounge  she put her strength with that of the young clergyman and they carried adeline to the lounge suzette dispatched elbridge hanging helplessly about for some of the women he sent the parlormaid and did not come back  adeline kept looking at her sister as if she were afraid of her when she was recovered sufficiently to speak she turned her eyes on the clergyman and said huskily tell her  your sister has had a little fright he began and with his gentle eyes on the girls he went on to deal the pain that priests and physicians must give theres the report of a railroad accident in the morning paper and among the passengersthe missingwas one of the name of northwick  but father is at the mills  your sister had telegraphed before the funeral to make sureand word has come that heisnt there  where is the paper demanded suzette with a kind of haughty incredulity  wade found it in his pocket where he must have put it instead of giving it back to adeline in the sleigh suzette took it and went with it to one of the windows she stood reading the account of the accident while her sister watched her with tremulous eagerness for the help that came from her contemptuous rejection of the calamity  how absurd it isnt fathers name and he couldnt have been on the train what in the world would he have been going to montreal for at this time of year its ridiculous suzette flung the paper down and came back to the other two  i felt said wade that it was extremely improbable  but where adeline put in faintly could he have been if he wasnt at the mills  anywhere in the world except wellwater junction returned suzette scornfully he may have stopped over at springfield or  yes adeline admitted thats what elbridge thought  or he may have gone on to willoughby junction he often goes there  that is true said the other suffering herself to take heart a little and hes been talking of selling his interest in the quarries there and  hes there of course said suzette with finality if hed been going farther hed have telegraphed us hes always very careful im not in the least alarmed and i advise you not to be adeline when did you see the paper first  when i came down to breakfast said adeline quietly  and i suppose you didnt eat any breakfast  adelines silence made confession  what i think is wed better all have lunch said suzette and she went and touched the bell at the chimney youll stay with us wont you mr wade we want lunch at once james she said to the man who answered her ring of course you must stay mr wade and help see adeline back to her right mind she touched the bell again and when the man appeared my sleigh at once james she commanded i will drive you home mr wade on my way to the station of course i shall not leave anything in doubt about this silly scare i fancy it will be no great difficulty to find out where father is where is that railroad guide probably my father took it up to his room she ran upstairs and came down with the book in her hand now we will see i dont believe he could get any train at springfield where he would have to change for the mills that would take him beyond the junction at that hour last night the express has to come up from boston she stopped and ran over the timetable of the route well he could get a connecting train at the junction but that doesnt prove at all that he did  she talked on mocking the mere suggestion of such a notion and then suddenly rang the bell once more to ask sharply isnt lunch ready yet then bring us tea here i shall telegraph to the mills again and i shall telegraph to mr hilary in boston he will know whether father was going anywhere else they had a meeting of the board day before yesterday and father went to the mills unexpectedly i shall telegraph to ponkwasset junction too and you may be sure i shall not come home adeline till i know something definite  the tea came and suzette served the cups herself with nerves that betrayed no tremor in the clash of silver or china but she made haste and at the sound of sleighbells without she put down her own cup untasted  oh must you take mr wade away adeline feebly pleaded stay till she comes back she entreated  suzette faltered a moment and then with a look at mr wade she gave a harsh laugh very well she said  she ran into the hall and up the stairs and in another moment they heard her coming down again the outer door shut after her and then came the flutter of the sleighbells as she drove away  over the lunch the elder sister recovered herself a little and ate as one can in the suspense of a strong emotion  your sister is a person of great courage said the clergyman as if he were a little abashed by it  she would never show that shes troubled but i know well enough that shes troubled by the way she kept talking and doing something every minute and now if she hadnt gone to telegraph shedi mustnt keep you here any longer mr wade she broke off in the sense of physical strength the food had given her indeed i mustnt you neednt be anxious i shall do very well now yes i shall  she begged him to leave her but he perceived that she did not really wish him to go and it was nearly an hour after suzette drove away before he got out of the house he would not let her send him home and he walked toward the village in the still sunny cold of the early winter afternoon thinking of the sort of contempt with which that girl had spurned the notion of calamity as if it were something to be resented and even snubbed in its approach to her it was as if she had now gone to trace it to its source and defy it there to stamp upon the presumptuous rumor and destroy it  just before he reached the crest of the upland that shut out the village from him he heard the clash of sleighbells a pair of horses leaped into sight and came bearing down upon him with that fine throw of their feet which you get only in such a direct encounter he stepped into the side track and then he heard miss sue northwick call to her horses and saw her pulling them up she had her fathers fondness for horses and the pair of little grays were a gift from him with the picturesque sledge they drew the dasher swelled forward like a swans breast and then curved deeply backward from either corner of the band of iron filagree at the top dangled a red horsetail the man who had driven her to the station sat in a rumble behind on the seat with suzette was another young lady who put out her hand to wade with a look of uncommon liking across the shining bearskin robe and laughed at his astonishment in seeing her while they talked the clipped grays nervously lifted and set down their forefeet in the snow as if fingering it they inhaled the cold air with squared nostrils and blew it out in blasts of white steam suzette said in explanation of her friends presence louise had seen the account and she made her brother bring her up they think just as i do that theres nothing of it one of the papers had the name nordeck but weve left mr hilary at the station fighting the telegraph and telephone in all directions and he isnt to stop till he gets something positive hes trying wellwater now she said all this very haughtily but she added the only thing is i cant understand why my father hasnt been heard of at the mills some one was asking for him there yesterday  probably he went on to willoughby junction as you suggested  of course he did said louise we havent heard from there yet  oh im not in the least troubled said sue but its certainly very provoking she lifted her reins im hurrying home to let adeline know  shell be very glad wade returned as if it were the certainty of good news she was carrying i think ill join matt at the station he suggested to louise  do she answered you can certainly manage something between you matt will be almost as glad of your coming as my going i thought we were coming up here to reassure sue but i seem strangely superfluous  you can reassure adeline said sue she added to wade i keep thinking what an annoyance it will be to my father to have all this fuss made over him i sometimes feel vexed with adeline goodbye she called back to him as she drove away and she stopped again to add wont you come up with mr hilary when youve heard something definite  wade promised and they repeated their goodbyes all round with a resolute cheerfulness     xii   the affair had been mixed up with tea and lunch and there was now the suggestion of a gay return to the northwick place and an hour or two more in that pleasant company of pretty and lively women which wade loved almost as well as he loved righteousness he knew that there was such a thing as death in the world he had often already seen its strange peaceful face he had just stood by an open grave but at the moment his youth denied it all and he swung along over the hardpacked roadway thinking of the superb beauty of suzette northwick and the witchery of louise hilarys face it was like her to come at once to her friend in this anxiety and he believed a strength in her to help bear the worst the worst that now seemed so remote and impossible  he did not find matt hilary in the station but he pushed through to the platform outside and saw him at a little distance standing between two of the tracks and watching a group of men there who were replacing some wornout rails with new ones  matt he called to him and matt turned about and said hello caryl and yielded him a sort of absentminded hand while he kept his face turned smilingly upon the men some were holding the rails in position and another was driving in the spike that was to rivet the plate to the sleeper he struck it with exquisite accuracy from a wide freehanded rhythmical swing of his hammer  beautiful isnt it said matt i never see any sort of manual labor even the kinds that are brutified and demoralized by their association with machinery without thinking how far the arts still come short of the trades if any sculptor could feel it what a magnificent basrelief just that thing would make he turned round to look at the men again in their different poses of selfforgetfulness and interest in their work they had a beauty and grace in spite of their clumsy dress which ennobled the scene  when matt once more faced round he smiled serenely on his friend wade who knew his temperament and his philosophy was deceived for the moment then you dont share miss northwicks anxiety about her father he began as if matt had been dealing directly with that matter and had been giving his reasons for not being troubled about it have you heard any thing yet but of course you havent or  matt halted him and looked down into his face from his greater height with a sort of sobered cheerfulness how much do you know about miss northwicks father  very littlenothing in fact but what she and her sister showed me in the morning paper i know theyre in great distress about him i just met miss suzette and your sister and they told me i should find you at the station  matt began to walk on again i didnt know but you had heard some talk from the outside i came off to escape the pressure of inquiry at the station people had found out somehow that i had been put in charge of the telegraphing when the young ladies left i imagined they wouldnt follow me if i went for a walk he put his hand through wades arm and directed their course across the tracks toward the street away from the station where elbridge had walked his horses up and down the evening he met northwick i told them to look out for me if they got anything i should keep in sight somewhere isnt it a curious commentary on our state of things he went on that when any man in a position of trust cant be accounted for twentyfour hours after he leaves home the businesslike supposition is that he has run away with money that doesnt belong to him  what do you mean matt  i mean that the popular belief in hatboro seems to be that northwick was on his way to canada on the train that was wrecked  shocking shocking said wade what makes you think they believe that  the conjecture and speculation began in the station the moment miss northwick left it and before it could be generally understood that i was there to represent her i suppose there wasnt a man among them that wouldnt have trusted northwick with all he had or wouldnt have felt that his fortune was made if northwick had taken charge of his money in fact i heard some of them saying so before their deference for me shut their mouths yet i havent a doubt they all think hes an absconding defaulter  its shocking said wade sadly but im afraid youre right these things are so common that people are subjected to suspicion on no kind of but just at this juncture matt lifted his head from the moments revery in which he seemed to have been far absent  have you seen much of the family this winter  yes a good deal said wade theyre not communicants but theyve been regular attendants at the services and ive been a good deal at their house they seem rather lonely they have very little to do with the south hatboro people and nothing at all with the villagers i dont know why theyve spent the winter here of course one hears all kinds of gossip the gossips at south hatboro say that miss suzette was willing to be on with young wilmington again and that she kept the family here but i place no faith in such a conjecture  it has a rustic crudity said matt but if jack wilmington ever cared anything for the girl nows his chance to be a man and stand by her  something in matts tone made wade stop and ask what do you mean matt is there anything besides  yes matt took a fresh grip of his friends arm and walked him steadily forward and kept him walking in spite of his involuntary tendency to come to a halt every few steps and try to urge something that he never quite got from his tongue against the probability of what matt was saying i mean that these people are right in their suspicions  right  my dear caryl there is no doubt whatever that northwick is a defaulter to the company in a very large amount it came out at a meeting of the directors on monday he confessed it for he could not deny it in the face of the proof against him and he was given a number of days to make up his shortage he was released on parole it was really the best thing the wisest as well as the mercifullest and of course he broke his word and seized the first chance to run away i knew all about the defalcation from my father just after the meeting there is simply no question about it  gracious powers said wade finally helpless to dispute the facts which he still did not realize and you think it possibledo you supposeimaginethat it was really he who was in that burning car what an awful fate  an awful fate asked matt do you think so yes yours is the safe ground in regard to a thing of that kindthe only ground  the only ground  i was thinking of my poor father said matt  he said some sharp things to that wretched creature at the meeting of the boardcalled him a thief and i dare say other hard namesand told him that the best thing that could happen to him was a railroad accident on his way home  ah  you see when he read the account of that accident in the paper this morning and found a name so much like northwicks among the victims he was fearfully broken up of course he felt somehow as if he had caused his deathi could see that though of course he wouldnt admit anything of the kind  of course said wade compassionately  i suppose it isnt well to invoke death in any way he is like the devil and only too apt to come if you ask for him i dont mean anything superstitious and i dont suppose my father really has any superstitious feeling about the matter but hes been rather a friendor a victimof that damnable theory that the gentlemanly way out of a difficulty like northwicks is suicide and i suppose he spoke from association with it or by an impulse from it he has been telegraphing right and left to try to verify the reports as it was his business and duty to do anyway and he caught at the notion of my coming up here with louise to see if we could be of any use to those two poor women  poor women wade echoed the worst must fall upon them as the worst always seems to do  yes wherever a cruel blow falls there seems to be a woman for it to fall on and you see what a refinement of cruelty this is going to be when it reaches them they have got to know that their father met that awful death and that he met it because he was a defaulter and was running away i suppose the papers will be full of it  that seems intolerable couldnt anything be done to stop them  why the thing has to come out you can keep happiness a secret but sorrow and shame have to come outi dont know why but they do then when they come out we feel as if the means of their publicity were the cause of them its very unphilosophical they walked slowly along in silence for a few moments and then matts revery broke out again in words well its to be seen now whether she has the strength that bears or the strength that breaks the way she held her head as she took the reins and drove off with poor louise beside her palpitating with sympathy for her trouble and anxiety about her horses was yes it was superb theres no other word for it ah poor girl  your sisters presence will be a great help to her said wade it was very good of her to come  ah there wasnt anything else for it said matt flinging his head up louise has my fathers loyalty i dont know much about her friendship with miss northwickshes so much younger than i and they came together when i was abroadbut ive fancied she wasnt much liked among the girls and louise was her champion in a way when louise read that report nothing would do but she must come  of course  but our being here must have its embarrassments for my father it was a sacrifice for him to let us come  i dont understand  it was he who carried through the respite the directors gave northwick and now he will have the appearance before some people of helping to cover up the miserable facts of putting a good face on things while a rogue was getting away from justice he might even be supposed to have some interest in getting him out of the way  oh i dont think any such suspicion can attach itself to such a man as mr hilary said wade with a certain resentment of the suggestion even from the mans son  in a commercial civilization like ours any sort of suspicion can attach to any sort of man in a case like this said matt  wade took off his hat and wiped his forehead i cant realize that the case is what you say i cant realize it at all it seems like some poor sort of play of makebelieve i cant forgive myself for being so little moved by it we are in the presence of a horror that ought to make us uncover our heads and fall to our knees and confess our own sins to god  ah im with you there said matt and he pushed his hand farther through his friends arm  they were both still well under thirty and they both had that zest for mere experience any experience that hunger for the knowledge of life which youth feels in their several ways they were already men who had thought for themselves or conjectured rather and they were eager to verify their speculations through their emotions they thought a good deal alike in many things though they started from such opposite points in their thinking and they both had finally the same ideal of life their intimacy was of as old a date as their school days at harvard they were in the same clubs as well as the same class wades father was not a boston man but his mother was a bellingham and he was nurtured in the traditions of hilarys social life both had broken with them wade not so much when he became a ritualist as hilary when he turned his back on manufacturing  they were now not without a kind of pride in standing so close to the calamity they were fated witnesses of and in the midst of their sympathy they had a curiosity which concerned itself with one of the victims because she was a young and beautiful girl their pity not so much forgot as ignored northwicks elder daughter who was a plain sick old maid and followed the younger with a kind of shrinking and dread of her doom which matt tried to put into words  i assure you if i couldnt manage to pull away from it at moments i dont see how i could stand it i had a sense of personal disgrace when i met that poor girl with what i had in my mind i felt as if i were taking some base advantage of her in knowing that about her father and i was so glad when she went off with louise and left me to struggle with my infamous information alone i hurried louise away with her in the most cowardly haste we dont any of us realize it as you say why just imagine it means sorrow it means shame it means poverty they will have to leave their house their home she will have to give up everything to the company it isnt merely friends and her place in the world its money its something to eat and wear its a roof over her head  wade refused the extreme view portrayed by his friends figures of course she wont be allowed to come to want  of course but theres really no measuring the sinuous reach of a disaster like this it strikes from a coil that seems to involve everything  what are you going to do if you get bad news asked wade  ah i dont know i must tell her somehow unless you think that you wade gave a start which matt interpreted aright he laughed nervously no no its for me to do it i know that unless i can get louise ah i wonder what that is  they were walking back toward the station again and matt had seen a head and arm projected from the office window and a hand waving a sheet of yellow paper it seemed meant for them they both began to run and then they checked themselves and walked as fast as they could  we must refer the matter to your sister said wade and if she thinks best remember that i shall be quite ready to speak to miss northwick or if you think best i will speak to her without troubling your sister  oh youre all right wade you neednt have any doubt of that well see i wonder what there is in that dispatch  the old station master had come out of the station and was hurrying to meet them with the message now duly enclosed in an envelope he gave it to matt and promptly turned his back on him  matt tore it open and read impossible to identify parlorcar passengers the telegram was signed operator and was dated at wellwater it fell blankly on their tense feeling  well said wade after a long breath it isnt the worst  matt read it frowningly over several times then he smiled oh no this isnt at all bad its nothing but so far its rather comforting and its something even if it is nothing well i suppose id better go up to miss northwick with it wait a moment i must tell them where to send if anything else comes  ill walk with you as far as st michaels said wade when they left the station im going to my study there  they set off together up the middle of the street which gave them more elbowroom than the sidewalk narrowly blocked out of the snow  from a large store as they were passing a small drylooking pompous little man advanced to the middle of the street and stopped them i beg your pardon mr wade i beg your pardon sir he said nimbly transferring himself after the quasi selfintroduction from wade to matt may i ask whether you have received any further information  no said matt amiably the only answer we have got is that it is impossible to identify the passengers in the parlorcar  ah thank you thank you very much sir i felt sure it couldnt be our mr northwick ergoodmorning sir  he bowed himself away and went into his store again and matt asked wade who in the world is that  hes a mr gerrishkeeps the large store there rather an unpleasant type  matt smiled he had the effect of refusing to believe that anything so low as an accident could happen to a man of northwicks business standing  something of that wade assented he worships northwick on the altar of material success  matt lifted his head and looked about i suppose the whole place is simply seething with curiosity  just after they reached the sidestreet where wade left him to go down to his church he met sue northwick driving in her sleigh she was alone except for the groom impassive in the rumble  have you heard anything she asked sharply  matt repeated the dispatch from the operator at wellwater  i knew it was a mistake she said with a kind of resolute scorn its perfectly ridiculous why should he have been there i think there ought to be some way of punishing the newspapers for circulating false reports ive been talking with the man who drove my father to the train yesterday morning and he says he spoke lately of buying some horses at springfield he got several from a farm near there once im going down to telegraph the farmer i found his name among fathers bills of course hes there ive got the dispatch all written out  let me take it back to the station for you miss northwick said matt  no get in with me here and well drive down and then ill carry you back home or here dennis she said to the man in the rumble and she handed him the telegram take this to the telegraphoffice and tell them to send it up by simpson the instant the answer comes  the irishman said yes maam and dropped from his perch with the paper in his hand  get in mr hilary she said and after he had mounted she skilfully backed the sleigh and turned the horses homeward if i hear nothing from my dispatch or if i hear wrong i am going up to wellwater junction myself by the first train i cant wait any longer if its the worst i want to know the worst  matt did not know what to say to her courage so he said alone to gain time  of course at such a time i would rather be alone  at the house matt found louise had gone to her room for a moment and he said he would like to speak with her there  she was lying on the lounge when he announced himself and she said come in and explained i just came off a moment to give my sympathies a little rest and then being up late so many nights this week what have you heard  nothing practically louise how long did you expect to stay  i dont know i hadnt thought as long as im needed i suppose why must you go back  nonot exactly  not exactly what are you driving at  why theres nothing to be found out by telegraphing some one must go up to the place where the accident happened she sees that and she wants to go she cant realize at all what it means to go there suppose she could manage the journey going alone and all that what could she do after she got there how could she go and look up the place of the accident and satisfy herself whether her father was  matt shrieked his sister if you go on you will drive me wild she mustnt go thats all there is of it you mustnt think of letting her go she sat up on the lounge in expression of her resolution on this point she must send somebodysome of their men she mustnt go its too hideous  no said matt thoughtfully i shall go  you  why not i can be at the place by four or five in the morning and i can ascertain all the facts and be able to relieve this terrible suspense for her  for both of them suggested louise it must be quite as bad for that poor sick old maid  why of course said matt and he felt so much ashamed of having left her out of the account that he added i dare say its even worse for her shes seen enough of life to realize it more  sue was his favorite though louise returned of course you must go matt you couldnt do less its magnificent of you have you told her yet that you would go  not yet i thought i would talk it over with you first  oh i approve of it its the only thing to do and i had better stay here till you come back  why no im not sure he came a little nearer and dropped his voice youd better know the whole trouble louise theres great trouble for them whether hes dead or alive theres something wrong in his accounts with the company and if he was on that train he was running away to canada to escape arrest  he could see that only partial intelligence of the case reached her  then if hes killed it will all be hushed up i see it makes you hope hes killed  matt gave a despairing groan if hes killed it makes it just so much the worse the defalcation has to come out any way  when must it come out  a good many people know of it and such things are hard to keep it may come outsome rumor of itin the morning papers the question is whether you want to stay till they know it here whether it would be wise or useful  certainly not i should want to kill anybody that was by when such a thing as that came out and i should despise sue northwick if she let me get away alive i must go at once  she slid herself from the lounge and ran to the glass where she put up a coil of hair in the knot it had escaped from  i had my doubts matt said about letting you come here without telling you just what the matter was but mother thought you would insist upon coming any way and that you would be embarrassed  oh that was quite right said louise the great thing now is to get away  i hope you wont let her suspect  well i think you can trust me for that matt said louise turning round upon him with a hairpin in her mouth long enough to give him as sarcastic a glance as she could if her present selfpossession was a warrant of future performance matt thought he could trust her but he was afraid louise had not taken in the whole enormity of the fact and he was right in this as a crime she did not then or ever afterwards fully imagine it it may be doubted whether she conceived of it as other than a great trouble and as something that ought always to be kept from her friend  matt went down stairs and found sue northwick in the library  i feel perfectly sure she said that we shall hear of my father at springfield one of the horses he got there has gone lame and it would be quite like him to stop and look up another in the place of it on the same farm  the logic of this theory did not strike matt but the girl held her head in such a strong way she drew her short breaths with such a smoothness she so visibly concealed her anxiety in the resolution to believe herself what she said that he could not refuse it the tribute of an apparent credence yes that certainly makes it seem probable  at any rate she said if i hear nothing from him there or we get no news from wellwater i shall go there at once ive made up my mind to that  i shouldnt wish you to go alone sue adeline quavered her eyes were red and her lips swollen as if she had been crying and now the tears came with her words you could never get there alone in the world dont you remember it took us all day to get to wellwater the last time we went to quebec  sue gave her sister a severe look as if to quell her open fears at least and matt asked aimlessly is it on the way to quebec  sue picked up the railroad guide from the desk where she had left it yes it is and it isnt she opened the book and showed him the map of the road the train divides at wellwater and part goes to montreal and part to quebec there are all sorts of stops and starts on the quebec branch so that you dont arrive till next morning but you get to montreal in five or six hours but the whole thing seems perfectly frantic i dont see why we pay the slightest attention to it of course papa has stayed over in springfield for something only hes usually so careful about telegraphing us if he changes his plans  she faltered and let the book drop matt picked it up for her and began to look at the timetable at first to hide the pain he felt at the selfdiscouragement in which she ended and then to see if he might not somehow be useful to her i see that a train from boston meets the springfield train at wellwater  does there she bent to look over the book with him and he felt the ungovernable thrill at being near the beauty of a womans face which a man never knows whether to be ashamed of or glad of but which he cannot help feeling then perhaps i had better go by way of boston what time does it start oh i see seven thirty i could get that trainif i dont hear from him at springfield but i know i shall hear  a stir of drapery made them aware of louise at the library door suzette went toward her are you going she asked without apparently sharing the surprise matt felt at seeing his sister with her hat and gloves on and her jacket over her arm  yes im going sue i just ran up to see youi had to do thatbut we both know im of no use here and so we wont make any pretences louise spoke very steadily almost coldly her brother did not quite know what to make of her she was pale and she looked down while she spoke but when she finished buttoning the glove she was engaged with she went up and put both her hands in suzettes i dont need to tell you that im going just to get myself out of your way it isnt a time for ornamental friendshipping and youve got all the good you could out of seeing me and knowing that im anxious with you thats about all there is of it and i guess wed better not spin it out but remember sue whenever you need me when you really want me you can send for me and if i dont come again till you do youll know that im simply waiting will you remember thatwhatever happens  matt gave a long tacit sigh of relief  yes i will louise said suzette they kissed each other as if in formal ratification of their compact which meant so much more to one of them than it could to the other  come matt said louise  she added hastily to prevent insistence against her plan that they would have time to walk to the station and she wished to walk then matt said i will see you aboard the train and then ill come back and wait till you hear from springfield miss suzette  that is a good idea said louise  but adeline urged tremulously shant you be afraid to go to boston alone itll be dark by the time you get there  the journey cant be very dangerous said louise and when i arrive i shall put myself in charge of a faithful boston hackman and tell him im very valuable and am to be taken the best of care of then i shall be set down at our door in perfect safety  they all had the relief of a little laugh even adeline joined reluctantly in it  when they were once free of the house matt said i wonder whether she will remember after the worst comes what you said and whether she will trust you enough to turn to us  i dont know probably she will be too proud at first but i shall come whether she asks me or not if they had relations or connections as everybody else has it would be different but as it is  yes of course said matt  i wish i could realize that sue is fond of him as we are of papa but i cant he always made me feel creepy didnt he you  he was a secret person but as far as i had anything to do with him at the mills when i was there i found him square enough he was a country person  i suppose sues pride is countrified said louise  matt went on his secrecy may have been only a sort of shyness heaven knows i dont want to judge him i suppose that that slow deliberation of his was an effort to maintain himself with dignity of course we see him now in the light of his rascality poor man and most of his traits seem ugly  they had a little time after they reached the station and they walked up and down the platform talking and matt explained how his father might be glad to have him go to wellwater and settle the question whether northwick was in the accident or not it would be a great relief for him to know he tried to make out that he was going from a divided motive  oh you neednt be at the trouble to say all that to me matt said louise i dont blame you for wanting to go even out of kindness  no i suppose theres no guilt attaching to a thing of that kind matt answered  there were a good many loungers about the station young men and girls released from the shops for the day in such towns they find the station an agreeable resort and enjoy a neverfailing excitement in the coming and going of the trains they watched the hilarys as they walked with envy of that something distinguished which both of them had they were both tall and handsomely made and they had the ease before their fellowbeings which perhaps comes as much from the lifelong habit of good clothes as from anything else matt had a conscience against whatever would separate him from his kind but he could not help carrying himself like a swell for all that and louise did not try to help it for her part she was an avowed worldling and in this quality she now wore a drab cloth costume bordered with black fur down the front of the jacket and around it at the hips the skirt which fell plain to her feet had a border of fur there and it swirled and swayed with her long dashing stride in a way that filled all those poor girls who saw it with despair it seemed to interest almost as painfully a young man with a thin delicate face whom she noticed looking at her she took him at first for one of those educated or halfeducated operatives who are complicating the labor problem more and more he was no better dressed than others in the crowd and there was no reason why he should not be a hatshop or a shoeshop hand and yet at a second glance she decided that he was not he stood staring at her with a studious frown and with the faint suggestion of a sneer on his cleanshaven fine lips but she knew that he was admiring her however he might be hating her and she spoke to matt about him as they turned from him in their walk and promised to point him out but when they came up again to where he had been standing he was gone the train came in and louise got aboard and matt made his way into the station and went to ask the operator in the telegraph office if she had got anything for miss northwick  she said something just come i was waiting for the hack to send it up  oh i will take it if you please i am going back to mr northwicks said matt  all right  matt took the dispatch and hurried out to find some means of getting quickly to miss northwick with it there was no conveyance about the station and he started up the street at a gait which was little short of a run and which exposed him to the ridicule of such small boys as observed his haste in their intervals of punging one who dropped from the runner of a sleigh which came up behind him jeered him for the awkwardness with which he floundered out of its way in the deep snow of the roadside the sleigh was abruptly halted and sue northwick called from it mr hilary i couldnt wait at home and ive just been at the depot by the lower road you have a dispatch  yes i have a telegram  oh give it to me  he withheld it a moment i dont know what it is miss northwick but if isnt what you expected will you letwill you allow me  as if she did not know what she was doing she caught the dispatch from his hand and tore it open well she said i knew it he hasnt been there now i shall go to wellwater she crumpled the telegram nervously in her hand and made a motion to lift the reins  matt put his hand on her wrist you couldnt youyou must let me go  you  me i can get into boston in time for that halfpastseven train and i can do all the things when i get to wellwater that you couldnt do come be reasonable you must see that what i propose is best i solemnly promise you that nothing shall be left undone or omitted or forgotten that could set your mind at rest whatever you would wish done i will do go home your sister needs you you need yourself if you have a trial to meet greater than this suspense which youve borne with such courage you want all your strength for it i beg you to trust me to do this for you i know that it seems recreant to let another go in your place on such an errand but it really isnt so you ought to know that i wouldnt offer to go if i were not sure that i could do all that you could do and more come let me go for you  he poured out his reasons vehemently and she sat like one without strength to answer when he stopped she still waited before she answered simply almost dryly well and she gave no other sign of assent in words but she turned over the hand on which he was keeping his and clutched his hand hard the tears the first she had shed that day gushed into her eyes she lifted the reins and drove away and he stood in the road gazing after her till her sleigh vanished over the rise of ground to the southward     xiii   the pale light in which matt hilary watched the sleigh out of sight thickened into early winter dusk before his train came and he got off to boston in the meantime the electrics came out like sudden moons and shed a lunar ray over the region round about the station where a young man who was in the habit of describing himself in print as one of the boston events young men found his way into an eatinghouse not far from the track it had a simple domestic effect inside and the young man gave a sigh of comfort in the pleasant warmth and light there was a woman there who had a very conversable air a sort of eventual sociability as the young man realized when she looked up from twitching the white clean cloths perfectly straight on the little tables set in rows on either side of the room  she finally reached the table where the young man had taken a chair for his overcoat and hat and was about taking another for himself  well he said lets see no use asking if youve got coffee he inhaled the odor of it coming from the open door of another room with a deep breath  baked beans  yes  well i dont think theres anything much better than baked beans do you  well not when you git em good the woman admitted ril good  and whats the matter with a piece of mince pie  i dont sees theres any great deal hot  every time  i thought so said the woman we have it both ways but id as soon eat a piece of i dont know what as a piece o cold mince pie  we have mince pie right along at our house said the young man but i guess if i was to eat a piece of it cold my wife would have the doctor round inside of five minutes  the woman laughed as if for joy in the hot mincepie fellowship established between herself and the young man well i guess she need to nothin else you want she brought the beans and coffee with a hot plate and a japanese paper napkin and she said as she arranged them on the table before the young man your pies warmin for you i got you some rolls theyre just right out the oven and heres some the best butter i ever put a knife to if i do say so its just as good and sweet as butter can be if it didnt come from the northwick place at a dollar a pound  well now i should have thought youd have used the northwick butter said the young man with friendly irony  you know the northwick butter said the woman charmed at the discovery of another tie  well my wife likes it for cooking said the young man we have a fancy brand for the table  the woman laughed out her delight in his pleasantry land ill bet you grumble at it too she said with a precipitate advance in intimacy which he did not disallow  well im pretty particular said the young man but i have to be to find anything to find fault with in the way my wife manages i dont suppose i shall be able to get much more northwick butter now  why not  why if he was killed in that accident  oh i guess there aint anything to that said the woman i guess it was some other northwick their coachmanelbridge newtonwas tellin my husband that mr northwick had stopped over at springfield to look at some hosses there hes always buyin more hosses i guess he must have as much as eighty or ninety hosses now i dont place any dependence on that report  that so said the young man why what did that fellow mean over at the drug store just now by his getting out for canada  what fellow  little slim chap with a big black moustache and blue eyes blue and blazing as you may say  ohmr putney thats just one of his jokes hes always down on mr northwick  then i suppose hes just gone up to ponkwasset about the trouble there  labor trouble  i guess so  the woman called toward an open door at the end of the room william and a man in his shirt sleeves showed himself you heard of any labor trouble to mr northwicks mills  no i dont believe there is any said the man he came forward inquiringly to the table where his wife was standing by the events young man  well im sorry said the young man but it shows that i havent lost so much in missing mr northwick after all i came up here from boston to interview him for our paper about the labor troubles  i want to know said the hostess you an editor  well im a reportersame thing the young man answered perhaps youve got some troubles of your own here in your shops  no said the host i guess everybodys pretty well satisfied here in hatboro he was tempted to talk by the air of confidence which the events young man somehow diffused about him but his native yankee caution prevailed and he did not take the lead offered him  well said the young man i noticed one of your citizens over at the drug store that seemed to be pretty happy  oh yes mr putney i heard you tellin my wife  who is mr putney any way asked the events man  mr putney the host repeated with a glance at his wife as if for instruction or correction in case he should go wrong hes one of the old hatboro putneys here  all of em preserved in liquor the same way  well no i cant say as they are the host laughed but not with much liking apparently his wife did not laugh at all and the young man perceived that he had struck a false note  pity he said to see a man like that goin that way he said more bright things in five minutes drunk as he was than i could say in a month on a strict prohibition basis  the good understanding was restored by this ready selfabasement well i d know as you can say that exactly said the hostess but he is bright there aint any two ways about it and he aint always that way you see him its just one of his times now he has em about once in every four or five months and the rest part hes just as straight as anybody its like a disease as i tell my husband  i guess if he was a mind to steady up there aint any lawyer could go ahead of him well not in this town said the husband  seems to be pretty popular as it is said the young man what makes him so down on mr northwick  well i dunno said the host what it is hes always been so i presume its more the kind of a man mr northwick is than what it is anything else  why what kind of a man is mr northwick any way the young man asked beginning to give his attention to the pie which the woman had now brought he dont seem to be so popular whats the reason  well i dont know as i could say exactly i presume one thing hes only been here summers till this year since his wife died and he never did have much to do with the place before  whats he living here for this winter economizing  no i guess he no need to do that the host answered  his wife looked knowing and said with a laugh i guess miss sue northwick could tell you if she was a mind to  oh i see said the reporter with an irreverence that seemed to be merely provisional and held subject to instant exchange for any more available attitude young man in the case friendless minister whose slippers require constant attention  i guess he aint very friendless said the hostess as far forth as that goes hes about the most popular minister especially with the workin folks since mr peck  who was mr peck  well he was the one that was run over by the cars at the depot here two or three years back why this house was started on his idea sort of cooperation at first we run it for the social union  and the cooperation petered out said the reporter making a note always does and then you took it and began to make money standard history of cooperation  i guess we aint gettin rich any too fast said the hostess dryly  well you will if you use the northwick butter whats the reason he isnt popular here when he is here must spend a good deal of money on that big place of his and give work  mr putney says its corruptin to have such a rich man in the neighborhood and he does more harm than good with his money the hostess threw out the notion as if it were something she had never been quite able to accept herself and would like to see its effect upon a man of the reporters wide observation he thinks hatboro was better off before there was a single hatshop or shoeshop in the place  and the law offices had it all to themselves said the young man and he laughed well it was a halcyon period what sort of a man is mr northwick personally  the woman referred the question to her husband who pondered it a moment well hes a kind of a closemouthed man hes never had anything to do with the hatboro folks much but i never heard anything against him i guess hes a pretty good man  wouldnt be likely to mention it round a great deal if he was going to canada heigh well im sorry i cant see mr northwick after all with these strikes in the mills everywhere he must have some light to throw on the labor question generally poor boy himself i believe  i dont believe his daughters could remember when said the hostess sarcastically  thats so well we are apt to lose our memory for dates as we get on in the world especially the ladies ponkwasset isnt on the direct line of this road is it he asked this of the host as if it followed  no you got to change at springfield and take the union and dominion road there then its on a branch  well i guess i shall have to run up and see mr northwick there what did you say the young mans name was thats keeping the northwick family here this winter he turned suddenly to the hostess putting up his notebook and throwing a silver dollar on the table to be changed married man myself you know  i guess i haint mentioned any names said the woman in high glee her husband went back to the kitchen and she took the dollar away to a desk in the corner of the room and brought back the change  whod be a good person to talk with about the labor situation here the young man asked in pocketing his money  i d know as i could hardly tell said the hostess thoughtfully theres colonel marvin hes got the largest shoeshop and some the hatshop folks most any of em would do and then theres mr wilmington that owns the stocking mills him or mr jack wilmington either oned be good mr jackd be the best i guess or i dont suppose theres anybuddy in the place d know more if theyd a mind to talk than mrs wilmington unless it was mis docter morrell  is mr jack their son asked the reporter  land why she aint a day older if shes that hes their nephew  oh i see second wife then hes the young man heigh  the hostess looked at the reporter with admiration well you do beat the witch if he haint i guess he might a ben  the reporter said he guessed he would take another piece of that pie and some more coffee if she had it and before he had finished them he had been allowed to understand that if it was not for his being mrs wilmingtons nephew mr jack would have been miss northwicks husband long ago and that the love lost between the two ladies was not worth crying for  the reporter who had fallen into his present calling by a series of accidents not necessarily of final result in it did not use arts so much as instincts in its exercise he liked to talk of himself and his own surroundings and he found that few men and no women could resist the lure thrown out by his sincere expansiveness he now commended himself to the hostess by the philosophical view he took of the popular belief that mrs wilmington was keeping her nephew from marrying any one else so as to marry him herself when her husband died he said that if you were an old man and you married a young woman he guessed that was what you had got to expect this gave him occasion to enlarge upon the happiness to be found only in the married state if you were fitly mated and on his own exceptional good fortune in it  he was in the full flow of an animated confidence relating to the flat he had just taken and furnished in boston when the door opened and the pale young man whom louise hilary had noticed at the station came in  the reporter broke off with a laugh of greeting hello maxwell you onto it too  onto what said the other with none of the reporters effusion  this labortrouble business said the reporter with a wink for him alone  pshaw pinney youd grow a bush for the pleasure of beating about it maxwell hung his hat on a hook above the table but sat down fronting pinney with his overcoat on it was a wellworn overcoat irredeemably shabby at the buttonholes id like some tea he said to the hostess some english breakfast tea if you have it and a little toast he rested his elbows on the table and took his head between his hands and pressed his fingers against his temples  headache asked pinney with the jocose sympathy men show one anothers sufferings as if they could be joked away better take something substantial nothing like ham and eggs for a headache  the other unfolded his paper napkin have you got anything worth while  lots of public opinion and local color said pinney have you  ive been half crazy with this headache i suppose we brought most of the news with us he suggested  well i dont know about that said pinney  i do you got your tip straight from headquarters i know all about it pinney so you might as well save time on that point if times an object with you they dont seem to know anything here but the consensus in hatboro is that he was running away  the what is asked pinney  the consensus  anything like the united states census  it isnt spelt like it  pinney made a note of it ill get a headline out of that i take my own wherever i find it as george washington said  your own you thief said maxwell with sardonic amusement you dont know what the word means  i can make a pretty good guess thank you said pinney putting up his book  do you want to trade maxwell asked after his tea came and he had revived himself with a sip or two  any scoops asked pinney warily anything exclusive  oh come said maxwell no i havent and neither have you what do you make mysteries for ive been over the whole ground and so have you there are no scoops in it  i think theres a scoop if you want to work it said pinney darkly  maxwell received the vaunt with a sneer you ought to be a detectivein a novel he buttered his toast and ate a little of it like a man of small appetite and invalid digestion  i suppose youve interviewed the family suggested pinney  no said maxwell gloomily there are some things that even a spaceman cant do  you ought to go back on a salary said pinney with compassion and superiority youll ruin yourself trying to fill space if you stick at trifles  such as going and asking a mans family whether they think he was burnt up in a railroad accident and trying to make copy out of their emotions thank you i prefer ruin if thats your scoop youre welcome to it  theyre not obliged to see you urged pinney you send in your name and  they shut the door in your face if they have the presence of mind  well what do you care if they do its all in the way of business anyhow its not a personal thing  a snubs a pretty personal thing pinney the reporter doesnt mind it but it makes the mans face burn  oh very well if youre going to let uncleanly scruples like that stand in your way youd better retire to the poets corner and stay there you can fill that much space any way but you are not built for a reporter when are you going to boston  six fifteen ive got a scoop of my own  what is it asked pinney incredulously  come round in the morning and ill tell you  perhaps ill go in with you after all ill just step out into the cold air and see if i can harden my cheek for that interview your diffidence is infectious maxwell     xiv   pinney was really somewhat dashed by maxwells attitude both because it appealed to the more delicate and generous self which he was obliged to pocket so often in the course of business and because it made him suspect that maxwell had already interviewed northwicks family they would be forewarned in that case and would of course refuse to see him but he felt that as a spaceman with the privilege of filling all the space he chose with this defalcation his duty to his family required him to use every means for making copy  he encouraged himself by thinking of his wife and what she was probably doing at that moment in their flat in boston and he was feeling fairly well when he asked for miss northwick at the door of the great wooden palace he had time to take in its characteristics before james the insideman opened the door and scanned him for a moment with a sort of baffled intelligence to the experience of the insideman his appearance gave no proof that he was or was not an agent a peddler in disguise or a genteel mendicant of the sort he was used to detecting and deterring  i dont know sir ill go and see he let rather than invited pinney in and in his absence the representative of the events made note of the interior both of the hall which he had been allowed to enter and of the library where he found himself upon his own responsibility the insideman discovered him there with his back to the fire when he returned with his card still in his hand  miss northwick thinks its her father you wish to see hes not at home  yes i knew that i did wish to see mr northwick and i asked to see miss northwick because i knew he wasnt at home  oh the man disappeared and after another interval adeline came in she showed the trepidation she felt at finding herself in the presence of an interviewer  will you sit down she said timidly and she glanced at the card which she had brought back this time it bore the name of lorenzo a pinney and in the left hand corner the words representing the boston events mr pinney made haste to reassure her by a very respectful and businesslike straightforwardness of manner he did not forbid it a certain shade of authority  i am sorry to disturb you miss northwick i hoped to have some conversation with you in regard to thisthis rumoraccident can you tell me just when mr northwick left home  he went up to the mills yesterday morning quite early said adeline she was in the rise of hope which she and suzette both felt from the mere fact that matt hilary was on the way to hunt the horrible rumor to its source it seemed to her that he must extinguish it there she wanted to tell this friendlylooking reporter so but she would not do this without suzettes authority suzette had been scolding her for not telling her what was in the paper as soon as she read it in the morning and they were both so far respited for the moment from their fear as to have had some words back and forth about the propriety of seeing this reporter at all adeline was on her most prudent behavior  did you expect him back soon when he left pinney asked respectfully  oh no he said he wouldnt be back for some days  its several hours to ponkwasset i believe suggested pinney  yes three or four there is one train at halfpasttwelve i think said miss northwick with a glance at the clock that takes you there in three hours  the early train doesnt connect right through then  no my father would have to wait over at springfield he doesnt often take the early train and so we thought when we found he wasnt at the mills that he had stopped over a day at springfield to buy some horses from a farmer there but weve just heard that he didnt he may have run down to new york he often has business there we dont place any reliance on that storyshe gasped the rest outaboutthat accident  of course not said pinney with real sympathy its just one of those flying rumorsthey get the names all mixed up those country operators  they spelled the name two ways in different papers said adeline father had no earthly business up that way and he always telegraphs  i believe the mills are on the line of the union and dominion road are they not pinney fell into the formal style of his printed questionings  yes they are father could get the northern express at springfield and drive over from ponkwasset junction the express doesnt stop at the falls  i see well i wont trouble you any farther miss northwick i hope youll find out its all a mistake about  oh i know it is said adeline a gentlemana friend of ourshas just gone up to wellwater to see about it  oh well thats good said pinney then youll soon have good news i suppose youve telegraphed  we couldnt get anything by telegraph that is the reason he went  it seemed to pinney that she wished to tell him who went but she did not tell him and after waiting for a moment in vain he rose and said well i must be getting back to boston i should have been up here to see your father about these labor troubles night before last if id taken my wifes advice i always miss it when i dont he said smiling  there is no reason why a man should acquire merit with other women by seeming subject to his wife or dependent upon her but he does they take it as a sort of tribute to themselves or to the abstract woman their respect for that man rises they begin to honor him their hearts warm to him pinneys devotion to his wife had already been of great use to him on several occasions in creating an atmosphere of trust about him he really could not keep her out of his talk for more than five minutes at a time all topics led up to her sooner or later  when he now rose to go miss northwick said im sorry my father isnt at home and im sorry i cant give you any information about the troubles  oh i shall go to the mills tomorrow he interrupted cheerily her relenting emboldened him to say you must have a beautiful place here in summer miss northwick  i like it all times of the year she answered weve all been enjoying the winter so much its the first weve spent here for a long time she felt a strange pleasure in saying this her reference to their family life seemed to reassure her of its unbroken continuity and to warrant her fathers safety  yes said pinney i knew you had let your house in town i think my wife would feel about it just as you do shes a great person for the country and if it wasnt for my work on the paper i guess i shd have to live there  miss northwick took a mass of heavyheaded jacqueminot roses from the vase where they drooped above the mantel and wrapping them in a paper from the desk stiffly offered them to pinney wont you carry these to your wife she said this was not only a recognition of pinneys worth in being so fond of his wife but a vague attempt at propitiation she thought it might somehow soften the heart of the interviewer in him and keep him from putting anything in the paper about her she was afraid to ask him not to do so  oh thank you said pinney i didnt mean toits very kind of youi assure you he felt very queer to be remanded to the purely human basis in relation to these people and he made haste to get away from that interview he had nothing to blame himself for and yet he now suddenly somehow felt to blame in the light of the defaulters home life northwick appeared his victim pinney was not going to punish him he was merely going to publish him but all the same for that moment it seemed to him that he was northwicks persecutor and was hunting him down running him to earth he wished that poor old girl had not given him those flowers he did not feel that he could take them to his wife on the way back to the station he stepped aside from the road and dropped them into the deep snow  his wife met him at the door of their flat eager to know what success he had and at sight of her his spirits rose again and he gave her an enthusiastic synopsis of what he had done  she flung herself on his knees where he sat and embraced him ren youve done splendidly and i know youll beat the abstract clear out of sight oh ren ren she threw her arms round his neck again and the happy tears started to her eyes this will give you any place on the paper you choose to ask for oh im the happiest girl in the world  pinney gave her a joyful hug yes its all right there are ninetynine chances to one that he was going to canada theres a big default running up into the hundred thousands and they gave him a chance to make up his shortageits the old story ive got just the setting i wanted for my facts and now as soon as manton gives us the word to go ahead  wait till manton gives the word cried mrs pinney well you shall do no such thing ren we wont wait a minute  pinney broke out into a laugh and gave her another hug for her enthusiasm and explained between laughing at her and kissing her why he had to wait that if he used the matter before the detective authorized him it would be the last tip he would ever get from manton we shant lose anything im going to commence writing it out now im going to make it a work of art now you go and get me some coffee hat there isnt going to be any let up on this till its all blocked out any way and im going to leave mighty few places to fill in i can tell you he pulled off his coat and sat down at his desk  his wife stopped him youd better come out into the kitchen and work on the table there its bigger than this desk  dont know but i had said pinney he gathered up his work and followed her out into the cosy little kitchen where she cooked their simple meals and they ate them been living on tea since i been gone he pulled open the refrigerator built into the wall and glanced into it last nights dinner all there yet  you know i dont care to eat when youre away ren she said with a pathetic little mouth  pinney kissed her and then he sat down to his work again and when he was tired with writing his wife took the pen and wrote from his dictation as they wrought on they lost the sense if they ever had it of a fellow creature inside of the figure of a spectacular defaulter which grew from their hands and they enjoyed the impersonality which enables us to judge and sentence one another in this world and to do justice as we say it is true that pinney having seen northwicks home and faced his elderly invalid daughter was moved to use him with a leniency which he would not otherwise have felt he recognized a merit in this forbearance of his and once towards the end of his work when he was taking a little rest he said reporters get as much abuse as plumbers but if people only knew what we kept back perhaps they would sing a different tune of course its a temptation to describe his daughter poor old thing and give the interview in full but i dont quite like to ive got to cut it down to the fact that she evidently hadnt the least idea of the defalcation or why he was on the way to canada might work a little pathos in with that but i guess i mustnt  his wife pushed the manuscript away from her and flung down the pen well ren if you go on talking in that way youll take the pleasure out of it for me i can tell you that much if i get to thinking of his family i cant help you any more  pshaw said pinney the facts have got to come out any way and i guess they wont be handled half as mercifully anywhere else as i shall handle em he put his arms round her and pulled her tight up to him your tenderheartedness is going to be the ruin of me yet hat if it hadnt been for thinking how youd have felt i should gone right up to wellwater and looked up that accident myself on the ground but i knew youd go all to pieces if i wasnt back at the time i said and so i didnt go  oh what a story said the young wife fondly with her adoring eyes upon him i shouldnt have cared i guess if youd never come back  shouldnt you how many per cent of that am i going to believe he asked and he drew her to him again in a rapture with her pretty looks and the love he saw in them  pinney was a handsome little fellow himself with a gay giveandtake air that had always served him well with women and that as his wife often told him had made her determine to have him the first time she saw him  this was at the opening of the promontory house two summers before when pinney was assigned to write the affair up for the events she had got her first place as operator in the new hotel and he brought in a despatch for her to send to boston just as she was going to shut up the office for the night and go in to see the dancing in the main diningroom and perhaps be asked to dance herself by some of the clerks  at the sound of a pencil tapping on the ledge of the little window in the castiron filagree wall of her den she turned quickly round ready to cry with disappointment but at sight of pinney with his blue eyes and his brown fringe of moustache curling closely in over his lip under his short straight nose and a funny cleft in his chin she felt more like laughing somehow as she had since told him a hundred times he wrote back to her from boston on some pretended business and they began to correspond as they called it and they were engaged before the summer was over they had never yet tired of talking about that first meeting or of talking about themselves and each other in any aspect they found out as soon as they were engaged and that sort of social splendor which young people wear to each others eyes had passed that they were both rather simple and harmless folks and they began to value each other as being good this tendency only grew upon them with the greater intimacy of marriage the chief reason for thinking that they were good was that they loved each other so much she knew that he was good because he loved her and he believed that he must have a great deal of good in him if such a girl loved him so much they thought it a virtue to exist solely for one another as they did their mutual devotion seemed to them a form of unselfishness they felt it a great merit to be frugal and industrious that they might prosper they prospered solely to their own advantage but the advantage of persons so deserving through their frugality and industry seemed a kind of altruism it kept them in constant good humor with themselves and content with each other they had risked a great deal in getting married on pinneys small salary but apparently their courage had been rewarded and they were not finally without the sense that their happiness had been achieved somehow in the public interest     xv   maxwells headache went off after his cup of tea but when he reached the house in clover street where he had a room in the boardinghouse his mother kept he was so tired that he wanted to go to bed he told her he was not tired only disappointed with his afternoons work  i didnt get very much why of course there was a lot of stuff lying round in the gutters that i can work up if i have the stomach for it youll see it in pinneys report whether i do it or not pinney thinks its all valuable material i left him there interviewing the defaulters family and making material out of their misery i couldnt do that  i shouldnt want you to brice said his mother i couldnt bear to have you  well were wrong both of us from one point of view said the young fellow as pinney says its business to do these things and a business motive ought to purify and ennoble any performance pinney is getting to be a firstclass reporter hell be a managing editor and an owner and be refusing my work in less than ten years  i hope youll be out of such work long before that said the mother  im likely to be out of all kinds of work before that if i keep on at this gait pinney hasnt got the slightest literary instinct hes a woodchopper a stableboy by nature but he knows how to make copy and hes sure to get on  well you dont want to get on in his way the mother urged soothingly  yes but ive got to get on in his way while im trying to get on in my own ive got to work eight hours at reporting for the privilege of working two at literature thats how the world is built the first thing is to earn your bread  well you do earn yours my sonand no one works harder to earn it  ah but its so damned dirty when ive earned it  oh my son  well i wont swear at it thats stupid too as stupid as all the rest he rose from the chair he had dropped into and went toward the door of the next room i must beautify my person with a clean collar and cuffs im going down to make a call on the back bay and i wish to leave a good impression with the fellow that shows me the door when he finds out who i am and what i want im going to interview mr hilary on the companys feelings towards their absconding treasurer what a dose hell never know i hate it ten times as bad as he does but its my only chance for a scoop  im sure hell receive you well brice he must see that youre a gentleman  no im not a gentleman mother the son interrupted harshly from the room where he was modifying his linen im not in that line of business but im like most people in most other lines of business i intend to be a gentleman as soon as i can afford it i shall have to pocket myself as usual when i interview mr hilary perhaps he isnt a gentleman either theres some consolation in that i should like to write an article some day on business methods and their compatibility with selfrespect but mr ricker wouldnt print it  hes very kind to you brice  yes hes as kind as he dares to be hes the oasis in the desert of my life but the countingroom simoom comes along and dries him up every now and then suppose i began my article by a study of the countingroom in independent journalism  mrs maxwell had nothing to say to this suggestion but much concerning the necessity of wearing the neckmuffler which she found her son had not had on all day she put it on for him now and made him promise to put it on for himself when he left the house where he was going to call  the man who came to the door told him that mr hilary was not at home but was expected shortly and consented to let him come in and wait he tried to classify maxwell in deciding where to let him wait his coat and hat looked like a chair in the hall his pale refined rather haughty face like the drawingroom the man compromised on the library and led him in there  louise rose upright on the lounge where she had thrown herself after dinner to rest in the dim light and think over the days strange experience and stared at him helplessly for her greater ease and comfort she had pushed off her shoes and they had gone over the foot of the lounge she found herself confronted with the contumaciouslooking workman she had noticed at the station in hatboro with those thin mocking lips and the large dreamy eyes that she remembered  the servingman said oh i didnt know you were here miss and stood irresolute the gentleman wishes to see your father  will you sit down she said to maxwell my father will be in very soon i think she began to wonder whether she could edge along unobserved to where her shoes lay and slip her feet into them but for the present she remained where she was and not merely because her shoes were off and she could not well get away but because it was not in her nature not to wish every one to be happy and comfortable she was as far as any woman can be from coquetry but she could not see any manner of man without trying to please him im sorry hes isnt here she said and then as there seemed nothing for him to answer she ventured its very cold out isnt it  its grown colder since nightfall said maxwell  he remembered her and she saw that he did and this somehow promoted an illogical sense of acquaintance with him  it seems she ventured farther very unusual weather for the beginning of february  why i dont know said maxwell with rather more selfpossession than she wished him to have so soon i think were apt to have very cold weather after the january thaw  thats true said louise with inward wonder that she had not thought of it his selfpossession did not comport with his threadbare clothes any more than his neat accent and quiet tone comported with the proletarian character she had assigned him she decided that he must be a walkingdelegate and that he had probably come on mischief from some of the workpeople in her fathers employ she had never seen a walkingdelegate before but she had heard much dispute between her father and brother as to his usefulness in society and her decision gave maxwell fresh interest in her mind before he knew who louise was he had made her represent the millionnaires pursepride because he found her in hilarys house and because he had hated her for a swell as much as a young man can hate a pretty woman when he saw her walking up and down the platform at hatboro he looked about the rich mans library with a scornful recognition of its luxury his disdain which was purely dramatic and had no personal direction began to scare louise she wanted to go away but even if she could get to her shoes without his noticing she could not get them on without making a scraping noise on the hardwood floor she did not know what to say next and her heart warmed with gratitude to maxwell when he said with no great relevancy to what they had been saying but with much to what he had in mind i dont think one realizes the winter except in the country  yes she said one forgets how lovely it is out of town  and how dreary he added  oh do you feel that she asked and she said to herself we shall be debating whether summer is pleasanter than winter if we keep on at this rate  yes i think so said maxwell he looked at a picture over the mantel to put himself at greater ease and began to speak of it of the color and drawing she saw that he knew nothing of art and felt only the literary quality of the picture and she was trying compassionately to get the talk away from it when she heard her fathers step in the hall below  hilary gave a start of question when he looked into the library that brought maxwell to his feet mr hilary im connected with the daily abstract and ive come to see if you are willing to talk with me about this rumored accident to mr northwick  no sir no sir hilary stormed back i dont know any more about the accident than you do i havent a word to say about it not a word not a syllable i hope thats enough  quite said maxwell and with a slight bow to louise he went out  oh papa louise moaned out how could you treat him so  treat him so why shouldnt i treat him so confound his impudence what does he mean by thrusting himself in here and taking possession of my library why didnt he wait in the hall  patrick showed him in here he saw that he was a gentleman  saw that he was a gentleman  yes certainly he is very cultivated hes notnot a common reporter at all louises voice trembled with mortification for her father and pity for maxwell as she adventured this assertion from no previous experience of reporters it was shocking to feel that it was her father who had not been the gentleman youyou might have been a little kinder papa he wasnt at all obtrusive and he only asked you whether you would say anything he didnt persist  i didnt intend he should persist said hilary his fire of straw always burnt itself out in the first blaze it was uncomfortable to find himself at variance with his daughter who was usually his fond and admiring ally but he could not give up at once if you didnt like the way i treated him why did you stay he demanded was it necessary for you to entertain him till i came in did he ask for the family what does it all mean  the tears came into her eyes and she said with indignant resentment patrick didnt know i was here when he brought him in im sure i should have been glad to go when you began raging at him papa if i could it wasnt very pleasant to hear you i wont come any more if you dont want me to i thought you liked me to be here you said you did  her father blustered back dont talk nonsense youll come just as you always have i suppose he added after a moment in which louise gathered up her shoes and stood with them in one hand behind her a tall figure of hurt affection and wounded pride i suppose i might have been a little smoother with the fellow but ive had twenty reporters after me today and between them and you and matt in all this bother i hardly know what im about didnt matt see that his going to wellwater in behalf of northwicks family must involve me more and more  i dont see how he could help offering to go when he found suzette was going alone he couldnt do less  oh do less said hilary with imperfectly sustained passion he turned to avoid looking at louise and his eyes fell on a strangelooking notebook on the table where maxwell had sat whats this  he took it up and louise said he must have left it and she thought of course he will come back for it  well i must send it to him and illill write him a note hilary groaned  louise smiled eager forgiveness he seemed very intelligent poor fellow in some ways didnt you notice what a cultivated tone he had its shocking to think of his having to go about and interview people and meet all kinds of rebuffs  i guess youd better not waste too much sympathy on him said hilary with some return to his grudge  oh i didnt mean you papa said louise sweetly  the doorbell rang and after some parley at the threshold patrick came up to say the gentleman that was just here thinks he left his notebook he  hilary did not let him get the words out oh yes show him up here it is he ran half down the stairs himself to meet maxwell     xvi   louise stole a glance at herself across the room in the little triptych mirror against one of the shelves her hair was not tumbled and she completed her toilet to the eye by dropping her shoes and extending the edge of her skirt over them where she stood  her father brought maxwell in by the door and she smiled a fresh greeting to him wei had just picked your notebook up iim glad you came back iwas a little short with you a moment ago iimaynt i offer you a cigar  no thanks i dont smoke said maxwell  then a glass ofits pretty cold out  thank you i never drink  well thats good thatssit down sit downthats a very good thing i assure you i dont think its the least use though i do both my boy doesnt hes a pattern to his father  in spite of hilarys invitation maxwell remained on foot with the effect of merely hearing him out as he went on  iim sorry i havent anything to tell about that accident ive been telegraphing all day without finding out anything beyond the fact as first reported and now my sons gone up to wellwater to look it up on the ground it may have been our mr northwick or it may not may i ask how much you know  i dont know that im quite free to say answered maxwell  oh  and i didnt expect you to say anything unless you wished to make something known its a matter of business  exactly said hilary but i think i might been a little civiller in saying what i did the rumors been a great annoyance to me and i like to share my annoyances with other people i suppose your business often brings you in contact with men of that friendly disposition heigh hilary rolled the cigar he was about to light between his lips  we see the average man said maxwell not at all flattered from his poise by hilarys apologies its a bore to be interviewed i know that from the bore it is to interview  i dare say thats often the worst part of it said hilary lighting his cigar and puffing out the first great clouds well then i may congratulate myself on sparing you an unpleasant duty i didnt know i should come off so handsomely  there seemed nothing more to say and maxwell did not attempt to make conversation hilary offered him his hand and he said as if to relieve the parting of abruptness if you care to look in on me again later on perhaps  thank you said maxwell and he turned to go then he turned back and after a moments hesitation bowed to louise and said very stiffly goodevening and went out  louise fetched a deep breath why didnt you keep him longer papa and find out all about him  i think we know all thats necessary said her father dryly at least he isnt on my conscience any longer and now i hope youre satisfied  yesyes she hesitated you dont think you were too patronizing in your reparation papa  patronizing hilarys crest began to rise  oh i dont mean that but i wish you hadnt let him see that you expected him to leap for joy when you stooped to excuse yourself  hilary delayed for want of adequate terms the violence he was about to permit himself the next time if you dont like my manner with people dont stay louise  i knew you wanted me to stay papa to see how beautifully you could do it and you did do it beautifully it was magnificentperhaps too magnificent she began to laugh and to kiss away the vexation from her fathers face keeping her hands behind her with her shoes she had picked up again in them as she came and leaned over him where he sat  and did i want you to stay and entertain him here till i came in he demanded to keep from being mollified too soon  no she faltered that was a work of necessity he looked so sick and sad that he appealed to my sympathy and besidesdo you think i could trust you with a secret papa  what are you talking about  why you see i thought he was a walkingdelegate at first  and was that the reason you stayed  no that was what frightened me and then interested me i wanted to find out what they were like but that isnt the secret  its probably quite as important hilary growled  well you see its such a good lesson to me i had slipped off my shoes when i was lying down and i couldnt get away he came in so suddenly  and do you mean to tell me louise that you were talking to that reporter all the time in  how should he know it you didnt know it yourself papa i couldnt get my shoes on after he came of course she brought them round before her in evidence  well its scandalous louise simply scandalous i never come in after youve been here without finding some part of your gear lying roundhairpins or gloves or ribbons or belts or handkerchiefs or somethingand i wont have it i want you to understand that i think its disgraceful im ashamed of you  oh no not ashamed papa  yes i am said her father but he had to relent under her look of meek imploring and say or i ought to be i dont see how you could hold up your head  i held it very high up when you havent got your shoes onin companyit gives you a sort ofinternal majesty and i behaved very loftily but its been a fearful lesson to me papa she made her father laugh and then she flung herself upon him and kissed him for his amiability  she said at the end of this rite he didnt seem much impressed even after you had apologized do you think papa  no he didnt hilary grumbled hes as stiffnecked as need be  yes said louise thoughtfully he must be proud how funny proud people are papa i cant understand them that was what always fascinated me with suzette  hilarys face saddened as it softened ah poor thing shell have need of all her pride now  you mean about her father said louise sobered too dont you hope hes got away  what do you mean child that would be a very rascally wish in me  well youd rather he had got away than been killed  why of course of course hilary ruefully assented but if matt finds he wasntin the accident its my business to do all i can to bring him to justice the mans a thief  well then i hope hes got away  you mustnt say such things louise  oh no papa only think them     xvii   hilary had to yield to the pressure on him and send detectives to look into the question of northwicks fate at the scene of the accident it was a formal violation of his promise to northwick that he should have three days unmolested but perhaps the circumstances would have justified hilary to any business man and it could really matter nothing to the defaulter dead or alive in either case he was out of harms way matt all the same felt the ghastliness of being there on the same errand with these agents of his father and reaching the same facts with them at moments it seemed to him as if he were tacitly working in agreement with them for the same purpose as well as to the same end but he would not let this illusion fasten upon him and he kept faith with suzette in the last degree he left nothing undone which she could have asked if he had done he invented some quite useless things to do and did them to give his conscience no cause against him afterwards the fire had left nothing but a few charred fragments of the wreck there had been no means of stopping it and it had almost completely swept away the cars in which it had broken out certain of the cars to the windward were not burnt these lay capsized beside the track bent and twisted and burst athwart fantastically like the pictures of derailed cars as matt had seen them in the illustrated papers the locomotive pitched into a heavy drift was like some dead monster that had struggled hard for its life where the fire had raged there was a wide black patch in the whiteness glistening everywhere else there were ashes and writhen ironwork and bits of charred woodwork but nothing to tell who or how many had died there it was certain that the porter and the parlorcar conductor were among the lost and his list of passengers had perished with the conductor there was only left with the operator the original of that telegram asking to have a chair reserved in the pullman from wellwater and signed with northwicks name but those different initials which had given rise to the report of his death  this was the definite fact which matt could carry back with him to northwicks family and this they knew already it settled nothing it left the question of his death just where it was before but matt struggled with it as if it were some quite new thing and spent himself in trying to determine how he should present it to them in his own mind he had very great doubt whether northwick was in the accident and whether that dispatch was not a trick a ruse to cover up the real course of his flight but then there was no sense in his trying to hide his track for he must have known that as yet there was no pursuit if the telegram was a ruse it was a ruse to conceal the fact that northwick was still in the country and had not gone to canada at all but matt could not imagine any reason for such a ruse the motive must be one of those illogical impulses which sometimes govern criminals in any case matt could not impart his conjectures to the poor women who must be awaiting his return with such cruel anxiety if the man were really dead it would simplify the matter beyond the power of any other fact matt perceived how it would mitigate the situation for his family he could understand how people should hold that suicide was the only thing left for a man in northwicks strait he blamed himself for coming a moment to that ground and owned the shame of his interested motive but it was nevertheless a relief which he did not know how to refuse when suzette northwick took what he had to tell as final proof that her father was dead  she said that she had been talking it all over with her sister and they were sure of it they were prepared for it they expected him to tell them so  matt tried to have her realize that he had not told her so and he urged as far as he could the grounds for hoping that her father was not in the accident  she put them all aside the difference in the initials was really no difference and besides and above all there was the fact that if her father were anywhere alive he must have seen the report of his death by this time and sent some word made some sign for their relief she was doubly sure of this because he was so anxiously thoughtful of them when they were separated he expected them to notify him of every slight change in their plans when they were away and always telegraphed as to his own the only mystery was his going to canada without letting them know his plans before or afterwards it must have been upon some very suddenly urgent business that took his mind off everything else  matt silently hung his head dreading lest she should ask him what he thought and wondering how he must answer if she did he perceived that he had no choice but to lie if she asked him but when he volunteered nothing she did not ask him  it was the second morning after he had left her but he could see that she had lived long since their parting he thought that is the way she will look as she grows old the delicate outline of her cheeks showed a slight straightening of its curve her lips were pinched the aquiline jut of her nose was sharpened there was no sign of tears in her eyes but adeline wept and constantly dried her tears with her handkerchief she accepted her affliction meekly as suzette accepted it proudly and she seemed to leave all the conjectures and conclusions to her sister  suzette was in the exaltation which death first brings to the bereaved when people say that they do not realize it yet and that they will feel it later then they go about especially if they are women in a sort of hysterical strength they speak calmly of what has happened they help those beyond the immediate circle of their loss to bear up against it these look to see them break suddenly under the stress of their bereavement and wonder at their impassioned fortitude  matt knew neither how to stay nor to get away it seemed intrusive to linger and inhuman to go when he had told the little he had to tell suzette had been so still so cold in receiving him that he was astonished at her intensity when he rose to leave her at last  i shall never forget what you have done for us mr hilary never dont belittle it or try to make it seem nothing it was everything i wonder you could do it  yes adeline put in as if they had been talking his kindness over as well as their loss and were of one mind about it  oh indeed he began any one would have done it  dont say so cried suzette you think that because you would have done it for any one but you have done it for us and as long as i live i shall remember that ohshe broke off and dropped her face with a pathetic childlike helplessness on her lifted arm and now he was less than ever able to leave her they all sat down again after they had risen to part matt felt the imperative necessity of encouraging them of rescuing her from the conjecture which she had accepted as certainty he was one of those men in whom passion can be born only of some form of unselfish kindness and who alone can make women happy if it was love that was now stirring so strangely at his heart he did not know it was love he thought it was still the pity that he had felt for the girls immense calamity he knew that from every phase of it he could not save her but he tried to save her from that which now confronted them and from which he saw her suffering he went over all the facts again with the hapless creatures and reasoned from them the probability that their father was still alive it was respite from sorrow which misery must follow it was insane it was foolish it was even guilty but he could not help trying to win it for them and when he left them at last they were bright with the hope he had given them and which the event whether it was death or whether it was disgrace must quench in a blacker despair  the truth of this rushed upon him when he found himself staggering away from the doomed house which cast its light gayly out upon the snow and followed him with a perverse sense of its warmth and luxury into the night but a strange joy mixed with the trouble in his soul and for all that sleepless night the conflict of these emotions seemed to toss him to and fro as if he were something alien and exterior to them northwick was now dead and his death had averted the disgrace which overhung his name now he was still alive and his escape from death had righted all the wrong he had done then his escape had only deepened the shame he had fled from his death had fixed a stain of a bloodguiltiness on his misdeeds and was no caprice of fate but a judgment of the eternal justice against this savage conclusion matt rebelled and made his stand     xviii   for fortyeight hours longer the fact of the defalcation was kept back but then in view of the legal action urged by those who did not accept the theory of northwicks death it had to come out and it broke all bounds in overwhelming floods of publicity  day after day the papers were full of the facts and it was weeks before the editorial homilies ceased from time to time fresh details and unexpected revelations wise guesses and shameless fakes renewed the interest of the original fact there were days when there was nothing about it in the papers and then days when it broke out in vivid paragraphs and whole lurid columns again it was not that the fraud was singular in its features these were common to most of the defalcations great and small which were of daily fame in the newspapers but the doubt as to the mans fate and the enduring mystery of his whereabouts if he were still alive were qualities that gave peculiar poignancy to northwicks case its results in the failure of people not directly involved were greater than could have been expected and the sum of his peculations mounted under investigation it was all much worse than had been imagined and in most of the editorial sermons upon it the moral gravity of the offence was measured by the amounts stolen and indirectly lost by it there was a great deal of mere astonishment as usual that the crime should have been that of a man whom no one would have dreamed of suspecting and there was some sufficiently ridiculous consternation at the presence of such moral decay in the very heart of the commercial life of boston  in the events pinney made his report of the affair the work of art which he boasted should come from his hand it was really a spacemans masterpiece and it appealed to every nerve in the readers body with its sensations repeated through many columns and continued from page to page with a recurrent efflorescence of scareheads and catchlines in the ardor of production all scruples and reluctances became fused in a devotion to the interests of the events and its readers with every hour the painful impressions of his interview with miss northwick grew fainter and the desire to use it stronger and he ended by sparing no color of it but he compromised with his sympathy for her by deepening the shadows in the behavior of the man who could bring all this sorrow upon those dearest to him he dwelt upon the unconsciousness of the family the ignorance of the whole household in which life ran smoothly on while the head of both was a fugitive from justice if not the victim of a swift retribution he worked in all the pathos which the facts were capable of holding and at certain points he enlarged the capacity of the facts he described with a good deal of graphic force the northwick interior under his touch the hall expanded the staircase widened and curved the carpets thickened the servants multiplied the library into which the events representative was politely ushered was furnished with all the appliances of a cultured taste the works of the standard authors in costly bindings graced its shelves magnificent paintings and groups of statuary adorned its walls and alcoves the dress of the lady who courteously received the events reporter was suitably enriched her years were discounted and her beauty approached to the patrician cast there was nothing mean about pinney and while he was at it he lavished a manorial grandeur upon the northwick place outside as well as inside he imparted a romantic consequence to hatboro itself a thriving new england town proud of its historic past and rejoicing in its modern prosperity with a population of some five or six thousand souls among whose working men and women modern ideas of the most advanced character had been realized in the wellknown peck social union with its cooperative kitchen and its clientèle of intelligent members and patrons  people of all occupations became leading residents in virtue of taking pinney into their confidence and a prominent proletarian achieved the distinction of a catchline by freely imparting the impressions of j m northwicks character among the workingclasses the consensus of public feeling in portraying which pinney did not fail to exploit the proprietary word he had seized formed the subject of some dramatic paragraphs and the whole formed a rich and fit setting for the main facts of northwicks undoubted fraud and flight and for the conjectures which pinney indulged in concerning his fate  pinneys masterpiece was in fine such as he could write only at that moment of his evolution as a man and such as the events could publish only at that period of its development as a newspaper the report was flashy and vulgar and unscrupulous but it was not brutal except by accident and not unkind except through the necessities of the case but it was helplessly and thoroughly personal and it was no more philosophized than a monkish chronicle of the middle ages  the abstract addressed a different class of readers and aimed at a different effect in its treatment of public affairs we look upon newspapers as having a sort of composite temperament formed from the temperaments of all the different men employed on them but as a matter of fact they each express the disposition and reflect the temperament of one controlling spirit which all the other dispositions and temperaments yield to this is so much the case that it is hard to efface the influence of a strong mind from the journal it has shaped even when it is no longer actively present in it a good many years before the time of the northwick defalcation the events had been in the management of a journalist once wellknown in boston a certain bartley hubbard who had risen from the ranks of the reporters and who had thoroughly reporterized it in the worst sense after he left it the owner tried several devices for elevating and reforming it but failed partly because he was himself a man of no ideals but those of the countingroom and largely because the paper could not recover from the strong slant given it without selfdestruction so the events continued what bartley hubbard had made it and what the readers he had called about it liked it to be a journal without principles and without convictions but with interests only a map of busy life indeed but glaringly colored with crude endeavors at picturesqueness and with no more truth to life than those railroad maps where the important centres converge upon the broad black level of the line advertised and leave rival roads wriggling faintly about in uninhabited solitudes in hubbards time the abstract then the chronicleabstract was in charge of the editor who had been his first friend on the boston press and whom he finally quarreled with on a point which this friend considered dishonorable to hubbard ricker had not since left the paper and though he was called a crank by some of the more progressive and reckless of the young men he clung to his ideal of a conscience in journalism he gave the abstract a fixed character and it could no more have changed than the events without selfdestruction the men under him were not so many as cæsars soldiers and that perhaps was the reason why he knew not only their names but their qualities when maxwell came with the fact of the defalcation which the detectives had entrusted to him for provisional use and asked to be assigned to the business of working it up kicker consented but he consented reluctantly he thought maxwell was better for better things he knew he was a ravenous reader of philosophy and sociology and he had been early in the secret of his being a poet it had since become an open secret among his fellowreporters for which he suffered both honor and dishonor  i shouldnt think youd like to do it maxwell said ricker kindly it isnt in your line is it better give it to some of the other fellows  its more in my line than you suppose mr ricker said the young fellow its a subject ive looked up a great deal lately i once thoughthe looked down bashfullyof trying to write a play about a defaulter and i got together a good many facts about defalcation youve no idea how common it is its about the commonest fact of our civilization  ah is that so asked ricker with ironical deference to the bold generalizer who else is onto this thing  pinney of the events  well hes a dangerous rival in some ways said ricker when it comes to slush and a whitewash brush i dont think youre a match for him but perhaps you dont intend to choose the same weapons ricker pulled down the greenlined pasteboard peak that he wore over his forehead by gaslight and hitched his chair round to his desk again and maxwell knew that he was authorized to do the work  he got no word from the detective who had given him a hint of the affair to go ahead the night after his return from hatboro as he had expected but he knew that the fact could not be kept back and he worked as hard at his report as pinney and pinneys wife had worked at theirs he waited till the next morning to begin however for he was too fagged after he came home from the hilarys he rose early and got himself a cup of tea over the gasburner before the house was awake he was well on in his report by nightfall he had finished it and then he carried it to ricker the editor had not gone to dinner yet and he gave maxwells work the critical censure of a hungry man it was in two separate parts one a careful and lucid statement of all the facts which had come to maxwells knowledge in his quality of reporter set down without sensation and in that selfrespectful decency of tone which the abstract affected the other an editorial comment upon the facts ricker read the first through without saying anything when he saw what the second was he pushed up his greenlined peak and said hello young man who invited you to take the floor  nobody i found i couldnt embody my general knowledge of defalcation in the report without impertinence and as i had to get my wisdom off my mind somehow i put it in editorial shape i dont expect you to take it perhaps i can sell it somewhere  ricker seemed to pay no attention to his explanation he went on reading the manuscript and when he ended he took up the report again and compared it with the editorial in length if we printed these things as they stand it would look like a case of the tail wagging the dog  maxwell began again oh i didnt expect  oh yes you did said ricker of course you felt that the report was at least physically inadequate  i made as much as i honestly could of it i knew you didnt like padding or faking and i dont myself  ricker was still holding the two manuscripts up before him he now handed them over his shoulder to maxwell where he stood beside him do you think you could weld these two things together  i dont know  suppose you try  as editorial or  either ill decide after youre done do it here  he pushed some papers off the long table beside him and maxwell sat down to his task it was not difficult the material was really of kindred character throughout he had merely to write a few prefatory sentences in the editorial attitude to his report and then append the editorial with certain changes again it did not take him long in half an hour he handed the result to ricker  yes said ricker and he began to read it anew with his blue pencil in his hand  maxwell had come with nerves steeled to bear the rejection of his article entire but he was not prepared to suffer the erasure of all his pet phrases and favorite sentences sometimes running to entire paragraphs  when ricker handed it back to him at last with what do you think of it now maxwell had the boldness to answer well mr ricker if i must say i think youve taken all the bones and blood out of it  ricker laughed oh no merely the fangs and poisonsacks look here young man did you believe all those cynical things when you were saying them  i dont know  i know i know you didnt every one of them rang false they were there for literary effect and for the pleasure of the groundlings but by and by if you keep on saying those things youll get to thinking them and what a man thinks a man is there are things there that you ought to be ashamed of if you really thought them but i know you didnt so i made free to strike them all out maxwell looked foolish he wished to assert himself but he did not know how ricker went on those charming little sarcasms and innuendoes of yours would have killed your article for really intelligent readers they would have suspected a young fellow having his fling or an old fool speaking out of the emptiness of his heart as it is we have got something unique and i dont mind telling you im very glad to have it ive never made any secret of my belief that you have talent  youve been very good said maxwell a little rueful still the surgeons knife hurts though it cures  when maxwell went home he met his mother why mother said the young fellow old ricker is going to print my report as editorial and were not going to have any report  i told you it was good  maxwell felt it was due to himself to keep some grudge and he said yes but hes taken all the life out of it with his confounded blue pencil its perfectly dead  it did not seem so when he saw it in proof at the office later and it did not seem so when he got it in the paper he had not slept well he was excited by several things by the use ricker had made of his work and by the hopes of advancement which this use quickened in him he was not ashamed of it he was very proud of it and he wondered at its symmetry and force as he read and read it again  he had taken very high philosophical ground in his view of the matter and had accused the structure of society there must be something rotten he said at the core of our civilization when every morning brought the story of a defalcation great or small in some part of our country not the peculations of such poor clerks and messengers as their employers could be insured against but of officials public and corporate for whom we had no guaranty but the average morality of our commercial life how low this was might be inferred from the fact that while such a defalcation as that of j m northwick created dismay in business and social circles it could not fairly be said to create surprise it was most unhappily a thing to be expected in proof of which no stronger evidence need be alleged than that patent to the abstract reporter in the community where the defaulter had his home and where in spite of his reputation for the strictest probity it was universally believed that he had run away with other peoples money merely because he had been absent twentyfour hours without accounting for his whereabouts  at this point maxwell wove in the material he had gathered on his visit to hatboro and without using names or persons contrived to give a vivid impression of the situation and the local feeling he aimed at the historical attitude and with some imitation of tainos method and manner he achieved it his whole account of the defalcation had a closeness of texture which involved every significant detail from the first chance suspicion of the defaulters honesty to the final opinions and conjectures of his fate at the same time the right relation and proportion of the main facts were kept and the statement was throughout so dignified and dispassionate that it had the grace of something remote in time and place it was when the narrative ended and the critical comment began that the artistic values made themselves felt ricker had been free in his recognition of the excellence of maxwells work and quick to appreciate its importance to the paper he made the young fellow disjointed compliments and recurrent predictions concerning it when they were together but there were qualities in it that he felt afterwards he had not been just to of course it owed much to the mere accident of maxwells accumulation of material about defalcations for his play but he had known men break down under the mass of their material and it surprised and delighted him to see how easily and strongly maxwell handled his that sick little youngster carried it all off with an air of robust maturity that amused as well as surprised ricker he saw where the fellow had helped himself out consciously or unconsciously with the style and method of his favorite authors and he admired the philosophic poise he had studied from them but no one except maxwell himself was in the secret of the forbearance the humane temperance with which northwick was treated this was a color from the play which had gone to pieces in his hands he simply adapted the conception of a typical defaulter as he had evolved it from a hundred instances to the case of the defaulter in hand and it fitted perfectly he had meant his imaginary defaulter to appeal rather to the compassion than the justice of the theatre and he presented to the reader the almost fatal aspect of the offence he dwelt upon the fact that the case so far from being isolated or exceptional was without peculiarities was quite normal he drew upon his accumulated facts for the proof of this and with a rapid array of defaulting treasurers cashiers superintendents and presidents he imparted a sense of the uniformity in their malfeasance which is so evident to the student they were all comfortably placed and in the way to prosperity if not fortune they were all tempted by the possession of means to immediate wealth they all yielded so far as to speculate with the money that did not belong to them they were all easily able to replace the first loans they made themselves they all borrowed again and then could not replace the loans they were all found out and all were given a certain time to make up their shortage after that a certain diversity appeared some shot themselves and some hanged themselves others decided to stand their trial the vastly greater number ran away to canada  in this presentation of the subject maxwell had hardly to do more than to copy the words of a certain character in his play one of those cynical personages wellknown to the drama whose function is to observe the course of the action and to make goodhumored sarcasms upon the conduct and motives of the other characters it was here that ricker employed his blue pencil the most freely and struck out passages of almost diabolical persiflage and touched the colors of the black pessimism with a few rays of hope the final summing up again was adapted from a drama that had been rejected by several purveyors of the legburlesque as immoral in a soliloquy intended to draw tears from the listener the hero of maxwells play when he parted from his young wife and children before taking poison made some apposite reflections on his case in which he regarded himself as the victim of conditions and in prophetic perspective beheld an interminable line of defaulters to come who should encounter the same temptations and commit the same crimes under the same circumstances maxwell simply recast this soliloquy in editorial terms and maintained that not only was there nothing exceptional in northwicks case but that it might be expected to repeat itself indefinitely on one hand you had men educated to business methods which permitted this form of dishonesty and condemned that their moral fibre was strained if not weakened by the struggle for money going on all around us on the other hand you had opportunity the fascination of chance the uncertainty of punishment the causes would continue the same and the effects would continue the same he declared that no good citizen could wish a defaulter to escape the penalty of his offence against society but it behooved society to consider how far it was itself responsible which it might well do without ignoring the responsibility of the criminal he ended with a paragraph in which he forecast a future without such causes and without such effects but ricker would not let this pass even in the semiironical temper maxwell had given it he said it was rank socialism and he cut it out in the proof where he gave the closing sentences of the article an interrogative instead of an affirmative shape     xix   the hilarys always straggled down to breakfast as they chose when matt was at home his mother and he were usually first then his father came and louise last they took the events as many other people did because with all its faults it was a thorough newspaper and they maintained their selfrespect by taking the abstract the morning that the defalcation came out matt sent and got all the other papers which he had glanced through and talked over with his mother before his father joined them at nine oclock  several of them had illustrations likenesses of northwick and views of his house in boston and his house in hatboro views of the companys mills at ponkwasset views of the railroad wreck at wellwater but it was pinneys masterpiece which really made hilary sick all the papers were atrocious but that was loathsome yet there was really nothing more to blame in the attitude of the papers than in that of the directors who gave the case to the detectives and set the machinery of publicity at work both were acting quite within their rights both were fulfilling an official duty hilary however had been forced against his grain into the position almost of northwicks protector he had suffered keenly from the falsity of this position for no one despised the sort of man northwick was more than he but when you have suffered even for a rogue you begin to feel some kindness for him all these blows fell upon his growing sympathy for the poor devil as he called him he got through the various accounts in the various papers by broken efforts taking them as if in successive shocks from these terrible particulars which seemed to shower themselves upon him when he came in range of them till he felt bruised and beaten all over  well at least its out my dear said his wife who noted the final effect of his sufferings across the table and saw him pause bewildered from the last paper he had dropped theres that comfort  is that a comfort he asked huskily  why yes i think it is the suspense is over and now you can begin to pick yourself up  i suppose theres something in that he kept looking at matt or rather at the copy of the abstract which matt was hiding behind and he said what have you got there matt  perhaps id better read it out said matt it seems to me most uncommonly good i wonder who could have done it  suppose you do your wondering afterwards said his father impatiently and matt began to read the positions of the article were not such as hilary could have taken probably if he had been in a different mood its implications were some of them such as he must have decidedly refused but the temper of the whole was so humane so forbearing so enlightened that hilary was in a glow of personal gratitude to the writer for what he called his common decency by the time the reading was over that is a very extraordinary article he said and he joined matt in wondering who could have done it with the usual effect in such cases  i wish said mrs hilary that every other newspaper could be kept from those poor things she meant northwicks daughters and she added if they must know the facts they couldnt be more mercifully told them  why that was what i was thinking mother said matt but they cant be kept to this version unhappily the misery will have to come on them shapelessly as all our miseries do i dont know that the other papers are so bad  not bad cried his father  no theyre not unkind to them except as they are just to him they probably represent fairly enough the average thinking and feeling about the matter the thing theyll have to meet all their lives and get used to but i wish i knew who did this abstract article i should like to thank him  the question is now said mrs hilary what can we do for them there are you sure you made it clear to them matt that we were willing to have them come to us no matter what happened  louise and i both tried to do that said her son when we were there together and when i reported to them after wellwater i told them again and again what our wish was  well said mrs hilary i am glad we have done everything we could at first i doubted the wisdom of your taking louise to see them but now im satisfied that it was right and im satisfied that your father did right in getting that wretched creature the chance he abused  oh yes said matt that was right and im thoroughly glad hes out of it if hes still alive im glad hes out of it  hilary had kept silent miserably involved in his various remorses and misgivings but now he broke out and i think youre talking abominable nonsense matt i didnt get northwick given that chance to enable him to escape the consequences of his rascality why shouldnt he be punished for it  because it wouldnt do the least good to him or to any one else it wouldnt reform him it wouldnt reform anything northwick isnt the disease hes merely the symptom you can suppress him but that wont cure the disease its the whole social body thats sick as this article in the abstract implies  i dont see any such implication in it his father angrily retorted your theory would form an excuse for the scoundrelism of every scoundrel unhung where is the cure of the social body to begin if it doesnt begin at home with every man in it i tell you it would be a very good thing for northwick and every rogue like him if he could be made serve his term in states prison  the controversy raged a long time without departing from these lines of argument on either side mrs hilary listened with the impatience women feel at every absence from the personal ground the only ground of reality when matt had got so far from it as to be saying to his father then i understand you to maintain that if a is properly punished for his sins b will practice virtue in the same circumstances and under the same temptations that were too much for a his mother tried to break in upon them she did not know much about the metaphysical rights and wrongs of the question she only felt that matt was getting his father who loved him so proudly and indulgently into a corner and she saw that this was unseemly besides when anything wrong happens a woman always wants some one punished some woman first or then some other womans men kindred every woman is a conservative in this and mrs hilary made up her mind to stop the talk between her son and husband because she felt matt to be doubly wrong  but when she spoke her husband roared at her dont interrupt sarah and then he roared at matt i tell you that the individual is not concerned in the matter i tell you that it is the interest the necessity of the community to punish a for his sins without regard to b and for my part i shall leave no stone unturned till we have found northwick dead or alive and if he is alive i shall spare no effort to have him brought to trial conviction and punishment he shouted these words out and thumped the breakfast table so that the spoons clattered in the cups and mrs hilary could hardly hear what patrick was saying just inside the door  to see mr hilary a lady did she send her card  she wouldnt give her name maam she said she didnt wish to maam she wished to see mr hilary just a moment in the receptionroom  hilary was leaning forward to give the table another bang with his fist but his wife succeeded in stopping him with a repetition of patricks message  i wont see her he answered its probably a woman reporter theyre in our very bread trough i tell you he went on to matt there are claims upon you as a citizen as a social factor which annul all your sentimental obligations to b as a brother god bless my soul isnt c a brother too and all the rest of the alphabet if a robs the other letters then let b take a lesson from the wholesome fact that as little game has landed him in jail  oh i admit that the as had better suffer for their sins but i doubt if the punishment which a man gets against his will is the right kind of suffering if this man had come forward voluntarily and offered to bear the penalty he had risked by his misdeed it would have been a good thing for himself and for everybody else it would have been a real warning but he ran away  and so he ought to be allowed to stay away you are a pretty dogberry come to judgment you would convict a thief by letting him steal out of your company  it seems to me thats what you did father and i think you did right as ive told you  what i did shouted hilary no sir i did nothing of the kind i gave him a chance to make himself an honest man  my dear said mrs hilary you must go and get rid of that woman at least or let me  hilary flung down his napkin and red from argument cast a dazed look about him and without really quite knowing what he was about rushed out of the room  his wife hardly had time to say you oughtnt to have got into a dispute with your father matt when you know hes been so perplexed before they heard his voice call out good heavens my poor child for the present they could not know that this was a cry of dismay at the apparition of suzette northwick who met him in the receptionroom with the demand  what is this about my father mr hilary  about your father my dear he took the hands she put out to him with her words and tried to think what pitying and helpful thing he could say she got them away from him and held one fast with the other  is it true she asked  he permitted himself the pretence of not understanding her he had to do it why we hopewe hope it isnt true nothing more is known about his being in the accident than we knew at first didnt matt  it isnt that its worse than that its that other thingthat the papers saythat he was a defaulterdishonest is that true  oh no no nothing of the kind my dear hilary had to say this he felt that it would be inhuman to say anything else nothing else would have been possible those newspapersconfound themyou know how they get things allyou neednt mind what the papers say  but why should they say anything about my father at such a time when heswhat does it all mean mr hilary i dont believe the papers and so i came to youas soon as i could this morning i knew you would tell me the truth you have known my father so long and you know how good he is iyou know that he never wronged any onethat he couldnt  of course of course said hilary it was quite right to come to mequite right howhow is your sister you must stay nowlouise isnt down yetand have breakfast with her ive just left mrs hilary at the table you must join us she can assure youmatt is quite confident that theres nothing to be distressed about in regard to thehe  hilary kept bustling aimlessly about as he spoke these vague phrases and he now tried to have her go out of the room before him but she dropped into a chair and he had to stay  i want you to tell me mr hilary whether there is the slightest foundation for what the papers say this morning  how foundation my dear child  has there been any trouble between my father and the company  wellwell there are always questions arising  is there any question of my fathers accountshis honesty  people question everything nowadays when there is so muchwant of confidence in business there have to be investigations from time to time  and has there been any reason to suspect my father does any one suspect him  hilary looked round the room with a roving eye that he could not bring to bear upon the girls face why i suppose that some of ussome of the directorshave had doubts  have you  my dear girlmy poor child you couldnt understand but i can truly say that when this examinationwhen the subject came up for discussion at the boardmeeting i felt warranted in insisting that your father should have time to make it all right he said he could and we agreed that he should have the chance hilary said this for the sake of the girl and he was truly ashamed of the magnanimous face it put upon his part in the affair he went on it is such a very very common thing for people in positions of trust to use the resources in their charge and then replace them that these things happen every day and no harm is meant and none is doneunlessunless the venture turns out unfortunately its not an isolated case hilary felt that he was getting on now though he was aware that he was talking very immorally but he knew that he was not corrupting the poor child before him and that he was doing his best to console her to comfort her the whole affair was very well put in the abstract have you seen it you must see that and not mind what the other papers say come in to mrs hilarywe have the paper  suzette rose then some of the directors believe that my father has been taking the money of the company as the papers say  their believing this or that is nothing to the point  do you  i cant sayi dont think he meanthe expected to restore it of course he was given time for that hilary hesitated and then he thought he had better say but he had certainly been employing the companys funds in his private enterprises  that is all said the girl and she now preceded hilary out of the room it was with inexpressible relief that he looked up and saw louise coming down the stairs  why sue she cried and she flew down the steps and threw her arms around her friends neck oh sue sue she said in that voice a woman uses to let another woman know that she understands and sympathizes utterly with her  suzette coldly undid her clasping arms let me go louise  no no you shant go i want youyou must stay with us now i know matt doesnt believe at all in that dreadful report  that wouldnt be anything now even if it were true theres another reportdont you know itin the paper this morning louise tried to look unconscious in the slight pause suzette made before she said and your father has been saying my father is a thief  oh papa louise wailed out  it was outrageously unfair and ungrateful of them both and hilary gave a roar of grief and protest suzette escaped from louise and before he could hinder it flashed by hilary to the street door and was gone     xx   the sorrow that turned to shame in other eyes remained sorrow to northwicks daughters when their father did not come back or make any sign of being anywhere in life they reverted to their first belief and accepted the fact of his death but it was a condition of their grief that they must refuse any thought of guilt in him their love began to work that touching miracle which is possible in womens hearts and to establish a faith in his honor which no proof of his dishonesty could shake  even if they could have believed all the things those newspapers accused him of they might not have seen the blame that others did in his acts but as women they could not make the fine distinctions that men make in business morality and as northwicks daughters they knew that he would not have done what he did if it was wrong their father had borrowed other peoples money intending to pay it back and then had lost his own and could not that was all  with every difference of temperament they agreed upon this and they were agreed that it would be a sort of treason to his memory if they encouraged the charges against him by making any change in their life but it was a relief to them especially to suzette who held the purse when the changes began to make themselves and their costly establishment fell away through the discontent and anxiety of this servant and that till none were left but elbridge newton and his wife she had nothing to do now but grieve for the child she had lost and she willingly came in to help about the kitchen and parlor work while her husband looked after the horses and cattle as well as he could and tended the furnaces and saw that the plants in the greenhouses did not freeze he was up early and late he had no poetic loyalty to the northwicks but as nearly as he could explain his devotion they had always treated him well and he could not bear to see things run behind  day after day went by and week after week and the sisters lived on in the solitude to which the compassion the diffidence or the contempt of their neighbors left them adeline saw wade whenever he came to the house where he felt it his duty and his privilege to bring the consolation that his office empowered him to offer in any house of mourning but suzette would not see him she sent him grateful messages and promises when he called and bade adeline tell him each time that the next time she hoped to see him  one of the ladies of south hatboro a mrs munger who spent her winters as well as her summers there penetrated as far as the library upon her own sense of what was due to herself as a neighbor but she failed to find either of the sisters she had to content herself with urging mrs morrell the wife of the doctor to join her in a second attempt upon their privacy but mrs morrell had formed a notion of suzettes character and temper adverse to the motherly impulse of pity which she would have felt for any one else in the girls position mrs gerrish the wife of the leading merchant in hatboro who distinguished himself by coming up from boston with northwick on the very day of the directors meeting would have joined mrs munger but her husband forbade her he had stood out against the whole community in his belief in northwicks integrity and solvency and while every one else accused him of running away as soon as he was reported among the missing in the railroad accident gerrish had refused to admit it the defalcation came upon him like thunder out of a clear sky he felt himself disgraced before his fellowcitizens and he resented the deceit which northwick had tacitly practised upon him he was impatient of the laws delays in seizing the property the defaulter had left behind him and which was now clearly the property of his creditors other people in hatboro those who had been the readiest to suspect northwick cherished a guilty leniency toward him in their thoughts some believed that he had gone to his account in other courts some that he was still alive in poverty and exile which were punishment enough as far as he was concerned but gerrish demanded something exemplary something dramatic from the law he blamed the ponkwasset directors for a species of incivism in failing to have northwick indicted at once dead or alive  why dont they turn his family out of that house and hand it over to the stockholders he has robbed he asked one morning in the chance conclave of loungers in his store i understand it is this man hilary in boston who has shielded andand protected him from the start andand right along i dont know why but if i was one of the ponkwasset stockholders i think i should i should make a point of inquiring why northwicks family went on living in my house after he had plundered me of everything he could lay his hands on  the lawyer putney was present and he shifted the tobacco he had in one cheek to the other cheek and set his little firm jaw well billy ill tell you why because the house and farm and all the real estate belong to northwicks family and not to northwicks creditors the listeners laughed and putney went on that was a point that brother northwick looked after a good while ago i guess i guess he must have done it as long ago as when you first wanted his statue put on top of the soldiers monument  i never wanted his statue put on top of the soldiers monument mr gerrish retorted angrily  putneys spree was past and he was in the full enjoyment of the contempt for gerrish which was apt to turn to profound respect when he was in his cups he was himself aware of the anomalous transition by which he then became a leader of conservative feeling on all subjects and one of the staunchest friends of the status he said it was the worst thing he knew against the existing condition of things he went on now didnt you well i think it would look better than that girl theyve got there in circusclothes they all laughed putney had a different form of derision for the victory of the soldiers monument every time he spoke of it and it would suggest what those poor fellows really died for that we could have more and more northwicks and a whole northwick system of things heigh you see billy i dont have to be so hard on the northwicks personally because i regard them as a necessary part of the system what would become of the laws and the courts if there were no rogues we must have northwicks its a pity that the northwicks should have families but i dont blame the northwicks for providing against the evil day that northwickism is sure to end in im glad the roof cant be taken from over those womens heads i respect the paternal love and foresight of j milton in deeding the property to them  its downright robbery of his creditors for them to keep it gerrish shouted  oh no it isnt billy its law you must respect the law and the rights of property youll be wanting the strikers to burn down the shoeshops the next time we have trouble here youre getting awfully incendiary billy  putney carried the laugh against gerrish but there were some of the group and there were many people in hatboro including most of the women who felt the want of exemplary measures in dealing with northwicks case these ladies did not see the sense of letting those girls live on just as if nothing had happened in a house that their fathers crimes had forfeited to his victims while plenty of honest people did not know where they were going to sleep that night or where the next mouthful of victuals was to come from it was not really the houseless and the hungry who complained of this injustice it was not even those who toiled for their daily bread in the hatboro shops who said such things they were too busy and then too tired to think much about them and the noise of northwicks misdeeds died first amid the din of machinery it was in the close stoveheated parlors of the respectable citizens behind the windows that had so long commanded envious views of the northwicks going by in their carriages and sledges and among women of leisure and conscience that his infamy endured and that the injuries of his creditors cried out for vengeance on those daughters of his they had always thought themselves too good to speak to other folks such women could not understand what the ponkwasset mills company meant by not turning those girls right out of doors and perhaps they could not have been taught why the company had no power to do this or why the president at least had no wish to do it when they learned that his family still kept up friendly relations with the northwick girls they were not without their suspicions which were not long in becoming their express belief that the hilarys were sharing in the booty they were not cruel and would not really have liked to see the northwick girls suffer if it had come to that but they were greedy of the vengeance promised upon the wicked and they had no fear of judging or of meting with the fullest measure  in the freer air of the streets and stores and offices their husbands were not so eager in fact it might be said that no man was eager but gerrish after the first excitement and the successive shocks of sensation imparted by the newspapers had passed there came over the men of hatboro a sort of resignation which might or might not be regarded as proof of a general demoralization the defalcation had startled them but it could not be said to have surprised any one it was to be expected of a man in northwicks position it happened every day somewhere and the day had come when it should happen there they did not say god was good and that mahomet was his prophet but they were fatalists all the same they accepted the accomplished fact and reflecting that the disaster did not really concern them many of them regarded it dispassionately even jocosely they did not care for a lot of rich people in boston who had been supplying northwick with funds to gamble in stocks it was not as if the hatboro bank had been wrecked and hardworking folks had lost their deposits they could look at the matter with an impartial eye and in their hearts they obscurely believed that any member of the ponkwasset company would have done the same thing as northwick if he had got the chance beyond that they were mostly interested in the question whether northwick had perished in the railroad accident or had put up a job on the public and was possessing his soul in peace somewhere in rogues rest as putney called the dominion of canada putney represented the party in favor of northwicks survival and gates the provision man led the opposite faction when putney dropped in to order his marketing he usually said something like well joel hows cremation this morning  just booming squire that stocks coming up right along bound to be worth a hundred cents on the dollar before hayin yet this or something like it was what gates usually answered but one morning he asked heard how it stands with the ponkwasset folks i suppose they saypaper doesthat the reason the president hung off from making a complaint was that he didnt rightly see how he could have the ashes indicted he believes in it any way  well said putney the fathers of new england all died in the blessed hope of infant damnation but that didnt prove it  thats something so squire guess you got me there said gates  i can understand old hilarys not wanting to push the thing under the circumstances and i dont blame him but the law must have its course hilarys got his duty to do i dont want to do it for him     xxi   hilary could not help himself though when he took the legal steps he was obliged to it seemed to him that he was wilfully urging on the persecution of that poor young girl and that poor old maid it was really ghastly to go through the form of indicting a man who so far as any one could prove to the contrary had passed with his sins before the tribunal that searches hearts and judges motives rather than acts but still the processes had to go on and hilary had to prompt them it was all talked over in hilarys family where he was pitied and forgiven in that affection which keeps us simple and sincere in spite of the masks we wear to the world his wife and his children knew how kind he was and how much he suffered in this business which from the first he had tried to be so lenient in when he wished to talk of it they all agreed that matt must not vex him with his theories and his opinions and when he did not talk of it no one must mention it  hilary felt the peculiar hardships of his position all the more keenly because he had a conscience that would not permit him to shirk his duty he had used his influence the weight of his character and business repute to control the action of the board towards northwick when the defalcation became known and now he was doubly bound to respond to the wishes of the directors in proceeding against him most of them believed that northwick was still alive those who were not sure regarded it as a public duty to have him indicted at any rate and they all voted that hilary should make the necessary complaint then hilary had no choice but to obey another man in his place might have resigned but he could not for he knew that he was finally responsible for northwicks escape  he made it no less his duty to find out just how much hardship it would work northwicks daughters and he tried to lend them money but suzette answered for both that her father had left them some money when he went away and hilary could only send louise to explain how he must formally appear in the legal proceedings he allowed louise to put whatever warmth of color she wished into his regrets and into his advice that they should consult a lawyer it was not businesslike if it were generally known it might be criticised but in the last resort with a thing like that hilary felt that he could always tell his critics to go to the deuce and fall back upon a good conscience  it seemed to louise at first that suzette was unwilling to separate her father from his office or fully to appreciate his forbearance she treated her own fathers course as something above suspicion as something which he was driven to by enemies whom he would soon have returned to put to confusion if he had lived it made no difference to her and adeline what was done their father was safe now and some day his name would be cleared adeline added that they were in the home where he had left them it was their house and no one could take it from them  louise compassionately assented to everything she thought suzette might have been a little more cordial in the way she received her fathers regrets but she remembered that suzette was always undemonstrative and she did not blame her after her first disappointment she could see the sort of neglect that was already falling upon the house the expression in housekeeping terms of the despair that was in their minds the sisters did not cry but louise cried a good deal in pity for their forlornness and at last her tears softened them into something like compassion for themselves they had her stay to lunch rather against her will but she thought she had better stay the lunch was so badly cooked and so meagre that louise fancied they were beginning to starve themselves and wanted to cry into her teacup the woman who waited wore such dismal black and went about with her eyes staring and her mouth tightly pursed and smelt faintly of horses it was mrs newton she had let louise in when she came and she was the only servant whom the girl saw  suzette said nothing about their plans for the future and louise did not like to ask her she felt as if she was received under a flag of truce and that there could be no confidence between them both of the sisters seemed to stand on the defensive with her but when she started to come away suzette put on her hat and jacket and said she would go to the avenue gate with her and meet simpson who was coming to take louise back to the station  it was a clear day of middle march the sun rode high in a blue sky and some jays bragged and jeered in the spruces the frost was not yet out of the ground but the shaded road was dry underfoot  they talked at arms length of the weather and then suzette said abruptly of course louise your father will have to do what they want him to againstpapa i understand that  oh sue  dont i should wish him to know that i wasnt stupid about it  im sure louise adventured he would do anything to help you  suzette put by the feeble expression of mere good feeling we dont believe papa has done anything wrong or anything he wouldnt have made right if he had lived we shall not let them take his property from us if we can help it  of course not im sure papa wouldnt wish you to  it would be confessing that they were right and we will never do that but i dont blame your father and i want him to know it  louise stopped short and kissed suzette in her affectionate optimism it seemed to her for the moment that all the trouble was over now she had never realized anything hopelessly wrong in the affair it was like a misunderstanding that could be explained away if the different people would listen to reason  sue released herself and said looking away from her friend it has been hard he is dead but we havent even been allowed to see him laid in the grave  oh perhaps louise sobbed out he isnt dead so many people think he isnt  suzette drew away from her in stern offence do you think that if he were alive he would leave us without a worda sign  no no he couldnt be so cruel i didnt mean that he is dead and i shall always say it  they walked on without speaking but at the gate suzette offered to return louises embrace the tears stood in her eyes as she said i would like to send my love to your motherif she would care for it  care for it  and tell your brother i can never forget what he did for us  he can never forget that you let him do it said louise with eager gratitude he would have liked to come with me if he hadnt thought it might seem intrusive  intrusive your brother sue spoke the words as if matt were of some superior order of beings  the intensity of feeling she put into her voice brought another gush of tears into louises eyes matt is good and i will tell him what you say he will like to hear it they looked down the road but they could not see simpson coming yet dont wait sue she pleaded do go back you will be all worn out  no i will stay till your carriage comes said suzette and they remained a moment silent together  then louise said matt has got a new fad a young man that writes on the newspapers  the newspapers suzette repeated with an intimation of abhorrence  oh but he isnt like the others louise hastened to explain very handsome and interesting and pale and sick he is going to be a poet but hes had to be a reporter hes awfully clever but matt says hes awfully poor and he has had such a hard time now they think he wont have to interview people any morehe came to interview papa the first time and poor papa was very blunt with him and then so sorry hes got some other kind of newspaper place i dont know what matt liked what he wrote aboutabout yourtroubles sue  where was it asked sue they were all wickedly false and cruel  his wasnt cruel it was in the abstract  yes i remember but he said papa had taken the money sue answered unrelentingly  did he i thought he only said if he did i dont believe he said more matt wouldnt have liked it so much if he had hes in such bad health but hes awfully clever  the hack came in sight over the rise of ground with simpson driving furiously as he always did when he saw people louise threw her arms round her friend again let me go back and stay with you sue or come home with me you and miss northwick we shall all be so glad to have you and i hate so to leave you here alone it seems so dreadful  yes but its easier to bear it here than anywhere else some day all the falsehood will be cleared up and then we shall be glad that we bore it where he left us we have decided what we shall do adeline and i we shall try to let the house furnished for the summer and live in the lodge here  louise looked round at the cottage by the avenue gate and said it would be beautiful  weve never used it for any one yet suzette continued and we can move back into the house in the winter  this again seemed to louise an admirable notion and she parted from her friend in more comfort than she could have imagined when they met she carried her feeling of elation home with her and was able to report sue in a state of almost smiling prosperity and of perfect resignation if not acquiescence in whatever the company should make hilary do she figured her father in his reluctance as a sort of ally of the northwicks and she was disappointed that he seemed to derive so little pleasure from sues approval but he generally approved of all that she could remember to have said for him to the northwicks though he did not show himself so appreciative of the situation as matt she told her brother what sue had said when she heard of his unwillingness to intrude upon her and she added that now he must certainly go to see her     xxii   a day or two later when matt hilary went to hatboro he found wade in his study at the church and he lost no time in asking him wade what do you know of the miss northwicks have you seen them lately  wade told him how little he had seen miss northwick and how he had not seen suzette at all then matt said i dont know why i asked you because i knew all this from louise she was up here the other day and they told her what i am really trying to get at is whether you know anything more about how that affair with jack wilmington stands do you know whether he has tried to see her since the trouble about her father came out  adeline northwick had dropped from the question as usual and it really related so wholly to suzette in the thoughts of both the young men that neither of them found it necessary to limit it explicitly  i feel quite sure he hasnt said wade though i cant answer positively  then that settles it matt walked away to one of wades gothic windows and looked out when he turned and came back to his friend he said if he had ever been in earnest about her i think he would have tried to see her at such a time dont you  i cant imagine his not doing it i never thought him a cad  no nor i  he would have done it unlessunless that woman has some hold that gives her command of him hes shown great weakness to say the least but i dont believe theres anything worse what do the village people believe  all sorts of lurid things some of them others believe that the affair is neither more nor less than it appears to be its a thing that could be just what it is in no other country in the world its the phase that our civilization has contributed to the physiognomy of scandal just as the exile of the defaulter is the phase we have contributed to the physiognomy of crime public opinion here isnt severe upon mrs wilmington or mr northwick  im not prepared to quarrel with it on that account said matt with the philosophical serenity which might easily be mistaken for irony in him the book we get our religion from teaches leniency in the judgment of others  it doesnt teach cynical indifference wade suggested  perhaps that isnt what people feel said matt  i dont know sometimes i dread to think how deeply our demoralization goes in certain directions  matt did not follow the lure to that sort of speculative inquiry he and wade were fond of he said with an abrupt return to the personal ground then you dont think jack wilmington need be any further considered in regard to her  in regard to miss sue northwick i dont know whether i quite understand what you mean  i mean is it anybodys dutyyours or mineto go to the man and find him out what he really thinks what he really feels i dont mean make an appeal to him that would be unworthy of her but perhaps hes holding back from a mistaken feeling of delicacy of remorse when if he could be made to see that it was his right his privilege to be everything to her now that a man could be to a woman and infinitely more than any man could hope to be to a happy or fortunate womanwhat do you think he could be reparation protection safety everything  wade shook his head it would be useless wilmington knows very well that such a girl would never let him be anything to her now when he had slighted her fancy for him before even if he were ever in love with her which i doubt he couldnt do it  no i suppose not said matt after a little pause he added then i must go myself  go yourself what do you mean wade asked  some one must try to make them understand just how they are situated i dont think louise did i dont think she knew herself how the legal proceedings would affect them and i think id better go and make it perfectly clear  i can imagine it wont be pleasant said wade  no said matt i dont expect that but i inferred from what she said to louise that she would be willing to see me and i think i had better go  he put his conviction interrogatively and wade said heartily why of course its the only thing and matt went away with a face which was cheerful with goodwill if not the hope of pleasure  he met suzette in the avenue dressed for walking and coming forward with the magnificent haughty movement she had as she caught sight of him she started and then almost ran toward him oh you she said and she shrank back a little and then put her hand impetuously out to him  he took it in his two and bubbled out are you walking somewhere are you well is your sister at home dont let me keep you may i walk with you  her smile clouded im only walking here in the avenue how is louise did she get home safely it was good of her to come here it isnt the place for a gay visit  oh miss northwick it was good of you to see her and we were very happyrelievedto find that you didnt feel aggrieved with any of us for what must happen and i hope you dont feel that ive taken an advantage of your kindness in coming  oh no  ive just been to see wade matt reddened consciously but it doesnt seem quite fair to have met you where you had no choice but to receive me  i walk here every morning she returned evasively i have nowhere else i never go out of the avenue adeline goes to the village sometimes but i cant meet people  i know said matt with caressing sympathy and his head swam in the sudden desire to take her in his arms and shelter her from that shame and sorrow preying upon her her eyes had a trouble in them that made him ache with pity he recognized as he had not before that they were the translation in feminine terms of her fathers eyes poor wade he went on without well knowing what he was saying told me that hehe was very sorry he had not been able to see youto do anything  what would have been the use no one can do anything we must bear our burden but we neednt add to it by seeing people who believe thatthat my father did wrong  matts breath almost left him he perceived that the condition on which she was bearing her sorrow was the refusal of her shame perhaps it could not have been possible for one of her nature to accept it and it required no effort in her to frame the theory of her fathers innocence perhaps no other hypothesis was possible to her and evidence had nothing to do with the truth as she felt it  the greatest comfort we have is that none of you believe it and your father knew my father better than any one else i was afraid i didnt make louise understand how much i felt that and how much adeline did it was hard to tell her without seeming to thank you for something that was no more than my fathers due but we do feel it both of us and i would like your father to know it i dont blame him for what he is going to do its necessary to establish my fathers innocence to have the trial i was very unjust to your father that first day when i thought he believed those things against papa we appreciate his kindness in every way but we shall not get any lawyer to defend us  matt was helplessly silent before this wild confusion of perfect trust and hopeless error he would not have known where to begin to set her right he did not see how he could speak a word without wounding her through her love her pride  she hurried on walking swiftly as if to keep up with the rush of her freed emotions we are not afraid but that it will come out so that our fathers name who was always so perfectly upright and so good to every one will be cleared and those who have accused him so basely will be punished as they deserve  she had so wholly misconceived the situation and the character of the impending proceedings that it would not have been possible to explain it all to her but he could not leave her in her error and he made at last an effort to enlighten her  i think my father was right in advising you to see a lawyer it wont be a question of the charges against your fathers integrity but of his solvency the proceedings will be against his estate and you mustnt allow yourselves to be taken at a disadvantage  she stopped what do we care for the estate if his good name isnt cleared up  im afraidim afraid matt entreated that you dont exactly understand  if my father never meant to keep the money then the trial will show the girl returned  but a lawyerindeed you ought to see a lawyercould explain how such a trial would leave that question where it was it wouldnt be the case against your father but against you  against us what do they say we have done  matt could have laughed at her heroic misapprehension of the affair if it had not been for the pity of it nothing nothing but they can take everything here that belonged to your fathereverything on the place to satisfy his creditors the question of his wrongdoing wont enter i cant tell you how but you ought to have a lawyer who would defend your rights in the case  if they dont pretend weve done anything then they cant do anything to us  they can take everything your father had in the world to pay his debts  then let them take it said the girl if he had lived he would have paid them we will never admit that he did anything for us to be ashamed of that he ever wilfully wronged any one  matt could see that the profession of her fathers innocence was essential to her he could not know how much of it was voluntary a pure effect of will in fulfilment of the demands of her pride and how much was real belief he only knew that whatever it was his wish was not to wound her or to molest her in it but to leave what should be sacred from human touch to the mystery that we call providence it might have been this very anxiety that betrayed him for a glance at his face seemed to stay her  dont you think i am right mr hilary  yes yes matt began and he was going to say that she was right in every way but he found that his own truth was sacred to him as well as her fiction and he said ive no right to judge your father its the last thing i should be willing to do i certainly dont believe he ever wished to wrong any one if he could have helped it  thank you said the girl that was not what i asked you i know what my father meant to do and i didnt need any reassurance im sorry to have troubled you with all these irrelevant questions and i thank you very much for the kind advice you have given me  oh dont take it so he entreated simply i do wish to be of use to youall the use that the best friend in the world can be and i see that i have wounded you dont take my words amiss im sure you couldnt take my will so if you knew it if the worst that anybody has said about your father were ten times true it couldnt change my will or  thank you thank you she said perversely i dont think we understand each other mr hilary its scarcely worth while to try i think i must say goodby my sister will be expecting me she nodded and he stood aside lifting his hat she dashed by him and he remained staring after her till she vanished in the curve of the avenue she suddenly reappeared and came quickly back toward him i wanted to say that no matter what you think or say i shall never forget what you have done and i shall always be grateful for it she launched these words fiercely at him as if they were a form of defiance and then whirled away and was quickly lost to sight again     xxiii   that evening adeline said to her sister at the end of the meagre dinner they allowed themselves in these days elbridge says the hay is giving out and we have got to do something about those horses that are eating their heads off in the barn and the cows theres hardly any feed for them  we must take some of the money and buy feed said suzette passively adeline saw by her eyes that she had been crying she did not ask her why each knew why the other cried  im afraid to said the elder sister its going so fast as it is that i dont know what we shall do pretty soon i think we ought to sell some of the cattle  we cant we dont know whether theyre ours  not ours  they may belong to the creditors we must wait till the trial is over  adeline made no answer they had disputed enough about that trial which they understood so little adeline had always believed they ought to speak to a lawyer about it but suzette had not been willing even when a man came that morning with a paper which he said was an attachment and left it with them they had not agreed to ask advice for one thing they did not know whom to ask northwick had a lawyer in boston but they had been left to the ignorance in which most women live concerning such matters and they did not know his name  now adeline resolved to act upon a plan of her own that she had kept from suzette because she thought suzette would not like it her sister went to her room after dinner and then adeline put on her things and let herself softly out into the night she took that paper the man had left and she took the deeds of the property which her father had given her soon after her mother died while sue was a little girl he said that the deeds were recorded and that she could keep them safely enough and she had kept them ever since in the box where her old laces were and her mothers watch that had never been wound up since her death  adeline was not afraid of the dark on the road or in the lonely villagestreets but when she rang at the lawyer putneys door her heart beat so with fright that it seemed as if it must jump out of her mouth she came to him because she had always heard that in spite of his sprees he was the smartest lawyer in hatboro and she believed that he could protect their rights if any one could at the same time she wished justice to be done though they should suffer and she came to putney partly because she knew he had always disliked her father and she reasoned that such a man would be less likely to advise her against the right in her interest than a friendlier person  putney came to the door himself as he was apt to do at night when he was in the house and she saw him control his surprise at sight of her can i seeseesee you a moment she stammered out about somesome law business  certainly said putney with grave politeness will you come in he led the way into the parlor where he was reading when she rang and placed a chair for her and then shut the parlor door and waited for her to offer him the papers that rattled in her nervous clutch  its this one that i want to show you first she said and she gave him the writ of attachment a man left it this noon and we dont know what it means  it means said putney that your fathers creditors have brought suit against his estate and have attached his property so that you cannot sell it or put it out of your hands in any way if the court declares him insolvent then everything belonging to him must go to pay his debts  but what can we do we cant buy anything to feed the stock and they will suffer cried adeline  i dont think long said putney some one will be put in charge of the place and then the stock will be taken care of by the creditors  and will they turn us out can they take our house it is our housemine and my sisters here are the deeds that my father gave me long ago and he said they were recorded her voice grew shrill  putney took the deeds and glanced at the recorders endorsement before he read them he seemed to adeline a long time and she had many fears till he handed them back to her the land and the houses and all the buildings are yours and your sisters miss northwick and your fathers creditors cant touch them  the tears started from adelines eyes she fell weakly back in her chair and let them run silently down her worn face after a while putney said gently was this all you wanted to ask me  that is all adeline answered and she began blindly to put her papers together he helped her how much is there to pay she asked with an anxiety she could not keep out of her voice  nothing i havent done you any legal service almost any man you showed those papers to could have told you as much as i have she tried to gasp out some acknowledgments and protests as he opened the doors for her at the outer threshold he said why youre alone  yes im not at all afraid  i will go home with you putney caught his hat from the rack and plunged into a shabby overcoat that dangled under it  adeline tried to refuse but she could not she was trembling so that it seemed as if she could not have set one foot before the other without help she took his arm and stumbled along beside him through the quiet early spring night  after a while he said miss northwick theres a little piece of advice i should like to give you  well she quavered meekly  dont let anybody lead you into the expense of trying to fight this case with the creditors it wouldnt be any use your father was deeply involved  he had been unfortunate but he didnt do anything wrong adeline hastened to put in nervously  it isnt a question of that said putney with a smile which he could safely indulge in the dark but he owed a great deal of money and his creditors will certainly be able to establish their right to everything but the real estate  my sister never wished to have anything to do with the trial we intended just to let it go  thats the best way putney said  but i wanted to know whether they could take the house and the place from us  that was right and i assure you they cant touch either if you get anxious come to me againas often as you like  i will indeed mr putney said the old maid submissively she let him walk home with her and up the avenue till they came in sight of the house then she plucked her hand away from his arm and thanked him with a pathetic little titter i dont know what suzette would say if she knew i had been to consult you she suggested  its for you to tell her said putney seriously but youd better act together you will need all your joint resources in that way  oh i shall tell her said adeline im not sorry for it and i think just as you do mr putney  well im glad you do said putney as if it were a favor  when he reached home his wife asked where in the world have you been ralph  oh just philandering round in the dark a little with adeline northwick  ralph what do you mean  he told her and they were moved and amused together at the strange phase their relation to the northwicks had taken to think of her coming to you of all people in the world for advice in her trouble  yes said putney but i was always a great friend of her fathers you know ellen  ralph  oh i may have spent my whole natural life in denouncing him as demoralization incarnate and a curse to the community but i always liked him ellen yes i loved j milton and i was merely waiting for him to prove himself a firstclass scoundrel to find out just how much i loved him ive no doubt but if we could have him among us again in the attractive garb of the statesprison inmates i should be hand and glove with brother northwick     xxiv   adelines reasons for going to putney in their trouble had to avail with suzette against the prejudice they had always felt towards him in the tangible and immediate pressure that now came upon them they were glad to be guided by his counsel they both believed it was dictated by a knowledge of law and a respect for justice and by no regard for them they had a comfort in it for this reason and they freely relied upon it as in some sort the advice of an honest and faithful enemy they remembered that the last evening he was with them their father had spoken leniently of putneys infirmity and admiringly of his wasted ability now each step they took was at his suggestion they left the great house before the creditors were put in possession of the personal property and went to live in the porters lodge at the gate of the avenue which they furnished with the few things they could claim for their own out of their former belongings and from the ready money suzette had remaining in her name at the bank they abandoned everything of value in the house they had left even to their richer dresses and their jewels they preferred to do this and putney approved he saw that it saved them more than it cost them in their helpless pride  the newtons continued in their quarters unmolested the furniture was theirs and the building belonged to the northwick girls as the newtons called them mrs newton went every day to help them to get going in their new place and elbridge and she lived there for a few weeks with them till they said they should not be afraid to stay alone he stood guard over their rights as far as he could ascertain them in the spoliation that had to come he locked the avenue gate against the approach of those who came to the assignees sale and made them enter and take away their purchases by the farm road and in all lawful ways he rendered himself obstructive and inconvenient  his deference to the law was paid entirely through putney whose smartness inspired elbridge with a respect he felt for no other virtue in man putney arranged with him to take the northwick place and manage it on shares for the northwick girls he got for him two of the old horses which elbridge wanted for his work and one of the cheaper cows the rest of the stock was sold to gentleman farmers round about who had fancies for costly cattle the horses good bad and indifferent were sent to a salestable in boston the greenhouses were stripped of all that was valuable in them and nothing was left upon the place of its former equipment except the few farm implements a cart or two and an ancient carryall that putney bid off for newtons use  then when all was finished he advertised the house to let for a term of years and failing a permanent tenant before the season opened he rented it to an adventurous landlady who proposed to fill it with summer boarders and who engaged to pay a rental for it monthly in advance that would enable the northwick girls to live on in the porters lodge without fear of want for the future putney imagined a scheme for selling off some of the land next the villas of south hatboro in lots to suit purchasers that summer sojourn had languished several years in uncertainty of its own fortunes but now by a caprice of the fashion which is sending people more and more to the country for the spring and fall months it was looking up decidedly property had so rapidly appreciated there that putney thought of asking so much a foot for the northwick lands instead of offering it by the acre  in proposing to become a land operator in behalf of his clients he had to reconcile his practice with theories he had held concerning unearned landvalues and he justified himself to his crony dr morrell on the ground that these might be justly taken from such rich and idle people as wanted to spend the spring and fall at south hatboro the more land at a high price you could get into the hands of the class south hatboro was now attracting and make them pay the bulk of the town tax the better for the land that working men wanted to get a living on in helping the northwick girls to keep all they could out of the clutches of their fathers creditors he held that he was only defending their rights and any fight against a corporation was a kind of holy war he professed to be getting on very comfortably with his conscience and he promised that he would not let it worry other people to mr gerrish he made excuses for taking charge of the affairs of two friendless women when he ought to have joined gerrish in punishing them for their fathers sins as any respectable man would he asked gerrish to consider the sort of fellow he had always been drinking up his own substance while gerrish was thriftily devouring other peoples houses and begged him to make allowance for him  the anomalous relation he held to the northwicks afforded him so much excitement and enjoyment that he passed his devils dividend as he called his quarterly spree he kept straight longer than his fellow citizens had known him to do for many years but putney was one of those men who could not be credited by people generally with the highest motives he too often made a mock of what people generally regarded as the highest motives he puzzled and affronted them and as none of his most intimate friends could claim that he was respectable in the ordinary sense of the word people generally attributed interested motives or at least cynical motives to him adeline northwick profited by a call she made upon dr morrell for advice about her dyspepsia to sound him in regard to putneys management of her affairs and if the doctors powders had not so distinctly done her good she might not have been able to rely upon the assurance he gave her that putney was acting wisely and most disinterestedly toward her and her sister  he has such a strange way of talking sometimes she said  but she clung to putney and relied upon him in everything not so much because she implicitly trusted him as because she knew no one else to trust the kindness that mr hilary had shown for them in the first of their trouble had of course become impossible to both the sisters he had in fact necessarily ceased to offer it directly and sue had steadily rejected all the overtures louise made her since they last met louise wanted to come again to see her but sue evaded her proposals at last she would not answer her letters and their friendship outwardly ceased louise did not blame her she accounted for her and pitied and forgave her she said it was what she herself would do in sues place but probably if she had continued herself she would not have done what sue did even in sues place she remembered sue with a tender constancy when she could no longer openly approach her without hurting more than she helped and before the day of the assignees sale came she thought out a scheme which wade carried into effect with putneys help those things of their own that the sisters had meant to sacrifice were bidden off and restored to them in such a way that it was not possible for them to refuse to take back the dresses the jewels the particular pieces of furniture which louise associated with them  each of the sisters dealt with the event in her sort adeline simply exulted in getting her things again sue gave all hers into adelines keeping and bade her never let her see them     part second     i   northwick kept up the mental juggle he had used in getting himself away from hatboro and as far as ponkwasset junction he made believe that he was going to leave the main line and take the branch road to the mills he had a thousandmile ticket and he had no baggage check to define his destination he could step off and get on where he pleased at first he let the conductor take up the mileage on his ticket as far as ponkwasset junction but when he got there he kept on with the train northward in the pretence that he was going on as far as willoughby junction to look after some business of his quarries he verified his pretence by speaking of it to the conductor who knew him he was not a person to take conductors into his confidence but he felt obliged to account to the man for his apparent change of mind he was at some trouble to make it seem casual and insignificant and he wondered if the conductor meant to insinuate anything by saying in return that it was a pretty brisk day to be knocking round much in a stone quarry northwick smiled in saying it was rather he watched the conductor to see if he should betray any particular interest in the matter when he left him but the conductor went on punching the passengers tickets and seemed to forget northwick as soon as he left him at the next station northwick followed him out on the platform to find if he sent any telegram off when he had once given way to this anxiety which he knew to be perfectly stupid and futile he had to yield to it at every station he took his bag with him each time he left the car and he meant not to go back if he saw the conductor telegraphing it was intensely cold and in spite of the fierce heat of the stove at the end of the car the frost gathered thickly on the windows the train creaked when it stopped and started as if it were crunching along on a bed of dry snow the noises of the wheels seemed at times to lose their rhythmical cadence and then northwick held his breath for fear one of them might be broken he had a dread of accident such as he had never felt before his life had never seemed so valuable to him as now he reflected that it was so because it was to be devoted now to retrieving the past in a new field under new conditions his life in this view was not his own it was a precious trust which he held for others first for his children and then for those whom he was finally to save from loss by the miscarriage of his enterprises he justified himself anew in what he was intending it presented itself as a piece of selfsacrifice a sacred duty which he was bound to fulfil all the time he knew that he was a defaulter who had used the money in his charge and tampered with the record so as to cover up the fact and that he was now absconding and was carrying off a large sum of money that was not morally his at one of the stations where he got out to see whether the conductor was telegraphing he noticed the conductor eyeing his bag curiously and he knew that he believed there was money in it northwick felt a thrill of gratified cunning in realizing how mistaken the conductor was but he was willing the fellow should think he was carrying up money to pay off his quarry hands  he was impatient to reach the junction where this conductor would leave the train and it would continue northward in the charge of another man he seldom went beyond willoughby on that road and the new conductor would hardly know him he meant to go on to blackbrook junction and take the new england central there for montreal but he saw the conductor go to the telegraph office at willoughby junction and it suddenly occurred to him that he must not go to montreal by a route so direct that any absconding defaulter would be expected to take it he had not the least proof that the conductors dispatch had anything to do with him but he could not help acting as if it had he said goodday to the conductor as he passed him and he went out of the station with his bag as if he were going up into the town he watched till he saw the conductor go off in another direction and then he came back and got aboard the train just as it was drawing out of the station he knew that he was not shadowed in any way but his consciousness of stealth was such that he felt as if he were followed and that he must act so as to baffle and mislead pursuit  at blackbrook where the train stopped for dinner he was aware that no one knew him and he ate hungrily he felt strengthened and encouraged and he began to react against the terror that had possessed him he perceived that it was senseless and ridiculous that the conductor could not possibly have been telegraphing about him from willoughby and there was as yet no suspicion abroad concerning him he might go freely anywhere by any road  but he had now let the new england central train leave without him and it only remained for him to push on to wellwater where he hoped to connect with the boston train for montreal on the union and dominion road he remembered that this train divided at wellwater and certain cars ran direct to quebec up through sherbrooke and lennoxville he meant to go from montreal to quebec but now he questioned whether he had better not go straight on from wellwater when he recalled the long allnight ride without a sleeper which he had once made on that route many summers before he said to himself that in his shaken condition he must not run the risk of such a hardship if he were to get sick from it or die it would be as bad as a railroad accident the word now made him think of what hilary had said hilary who had called him a thief he would show hilary whether he was a thief or not give him time he would make him eat his words and he figured hilary retracting and apologizing in the presence of the whole board hilary apologized handsomely and northwick forgave him while it was also passing through his mind that he must reduce the risks of railroad accident to a minimum by shortening the time they reduced the risk of ocean travel in that way by reducing the time and logically the fastest ship was the safest if he could get to montreal from wellwater in four or five hours when it would take him twelve hours to get to quebec it was certainly his duty to go to montreal first of all he must put himself out of danger of every kind he must not even fatigue himself too much and he decided to telegraph on to wellwater and secure a seat in the pullman car to montreal he had been travelling all day in the ordinary car and he had found it very rough  it suddenly occurred to him that he must now assume a false name and he reflected that he must take one that sounded like his own or else he would not answer promptly and naturally to it he chose warwick and he kept saying it over to himself while he wrote his dispatch to the stationmaster at wellwater asking him to secure a chair in the pullman he was pleased with the choice he had made it seemed like his own name when spoken and yet very unlike when written but while he congratulated himself on his quickness and sagacity he was aware of something detached almost alien in the operation of his mind it did not seem to be working normally he could govern it but it was like something trying to get away from him like a headstrong restive horse the notion suggested the colt that had fallen lame he wondered if elbridge would look carefully after it and then he thought of all the other horses a torment of heartbreaking homesickness seized him his love for his place his house his children seemed to turn against him and to tear him and leave him bleeding like the evil spirit in the demoniac among the tombs he was in such misery with his longing for his children that he thought it must show in his face and he made a feint of having to rise and arrange his overcoat so that he could catch sight of himself in the mirror at the end of the car his face betrayed nothing it looked as it always did like the face of a kindly respectable man a financially reliable face the face of a leading citizen he gathered courage and strength from it to put away the remorse that was devouring him if that was the way he looked that was the way he must be and he could only be leaving those so dear to him for some good purpose he recalled that his purpose was to clear the name they bore from the cloud that must fall upon it to rehabilitate himself to secure his creditors from final loss this was a good purpose the best purpose that a man in his place could have he recollected that he was to be careful of his life and health because he had dedicated himself to this purpose  he determined to keep this purpose steadily in mind not to lose thought of it for an instant it was his only refuge then a new anguish seized him a doubt that swiftly became certainty and he knew that he had signed that dispatch northwick and not warwick he saw just how his signature looked on the yellow manilla paper of the telegraph blank now he saw what a fool he had been to think of sending any dispatch he cursed himself under his breath and in the same breath he humbly prayed to god for some way of escape his terror made it certain to him that he would be arrested as soon as he reached wellwater that would be the next stop the conductor told him when he halted him with the question on his way through the cars the conductor said they were behind time and northwick knew by the frantic pull of the train that they were running to make up the loss it would simply be death to jump from the car and he must not die he must run the risk in his prayer he bargained with god that if he would let him escape he would give every thought every breath to making up the loss of his creditors he half promised to return the money he was carrying away and trust to his own powers his business talent in a new field to retrieve himself he resolved to hide himself as soon as he reached wellwater it would be dark and he hoped that by this understanding with providence he could elude the officer in getting out of the car but if there were two one at each end of the car  there was none and northwick walked away from the station with the other passengers who were going to the hotel near the station for supper in the dim light of the failing day and the village lamps he saw with a kind of surprise the deep snow and felt the strong still cold of the winterland he had been journeying into the white drifts were everywhere the vague level of the frozen lake stretched away from the hotel like a sea of snow on its edge lay the excursion steamer in which northwick had one summer made the tour of the lake with his family long ago  he was only a few miles from the canadian frontier with a rebound from his anxiety he now exulted in the safety he had already experienced he remained tranquilly eating after the departure of the montreal train was cried and when he was left almost alone the headwaiter came to him and said your trains just going sir  thank you he answered im going out on the quebec line he wanted to laugh in thinking how he had baffled fate now if any inquiry were made for him it would be at the montreal train before it started or at the next station which was still within the american border on that line but on the train for quebec which would reach stanstead in half an hour he would be safe from conjecture even thanks to that dispatch asking for a chair on the montreal pullman the quebec train was slow in starting but he did not care he walked up and down the platform and waited patiently he no longer thought with anxiety of the long allnight ride before him if he did not choose to keep straight on to quebec he could stop at lenoxville or sherbrooke and take up his journey again the next day at stanstead he ceased altogether to deal with the past in his thoughts he was now safe from it beyond any possible peradventure and he began to plan for the future he had prepared himself for the allnight ride if he should decide to take it with a cup of strong coffee at wellwater and he was alert in every faculty his mind worked nimbly and docilely now with none of that perversity which had troubled him during the day with the fear that he was going wrong in it his thought was clear and quick and it obeyed his will like a part of it that sense of duality in himself no longer agonized him he took a calm and prudent survey of the work before him and he saw how essential it was that he should make no false step but should act at every moment with the sense that he was merely the agent of others in the effort to retrieve his losses     ii   at stanstead a party of three gentlemen came into the car and their talk presently found its way through northwicks revery at first as an interruption an annoyance and afterwards as a matter of intensifying personal interest to him they were in very good spirits and they made themselves at home in the car there were only a few other passengers they were going to montreal as he easily gathered and some friends were to join them at the next junction and go on with them they talked freely of an enterprise which they wished to promote in montreal and they were very confident of it if they could get the capital one of them said it was a thing that would have been done long ago if the yankees had been in it well we may strike a rich defaulter in montreal another said and they all laughed their laughter shocked northwick it seemed immoral he remembered that though he might seem a defaulter he was a man with a sacred trust and a high purpose but he listened eagerly if their enterprise were one that approved itself to his judgment the chance of their discussing it before him might be a leading of providence which he would be culpable to refuse providence had answered his prayer in permitting him to pass the american frontier safely and northwick must not be derelict in fulfilling his part of the agreement the canadians borrowed the brakemans lantern and began to study a map which they spread out on their knees the one who seemed first among them put his finger on a place in the map and said that was the spot it was in the region just back of chicoutimi gold had always been found there but not in paying quantity it cost more to mine it than it was worth but with the application of his new process of working up the tailings there was no doubt of the result it was simply wealth beyond the dreams of avarice  northwick had heard that song before and he fell back in his seat with a smile which was perhaps too cynical for a partner of providence but which was natural in a man of his experience he knew something about processes to utilize the tailings of gold mines which would not otherwise pay for working he had paid enough for his knowledge so much that if he still had the purchasemoney he need not be going into exile now and beginning life under a false name in a strange land  by and by he found himself listening again and he heard the canadian saying and theres timber enough on the tract to pay twice over what it will cost even if the mine wasnt worth a penny  well we might go down and see the timber any way said one of the party who had not yet spoken much and then we could take a look at markhams soapmine too unless he added you had to tunnel under a hundred feet of snow to get at it a good deal like diggin the north pole up by the roots wouldnt it be  oh no oh no said he who seemed to be markham with the optimism of an enthusiast theres no trouble about it weve got some shanties that we put up about the mouth of the hole in the ground we made in the autumn and you can see the hole without digging at all or at least you could in the early part of january when i was down there  the hole hadnt run away  no it was just where we left it  well thats encouragin but i say markham how do you get down there in the winter  oh very easily simplest thing in the world lots of fellows in the lumber trade do it all winter long do it by sleigh from st annes about twenty miles below quebecfrom quebec you have your choice of train or sleigh but i prefer to make a clean thing of it and do it all by sleigh i take it by easy stages and so i take the long route there is a short cut but the stops are far between you make your twenty miles to st anne from quebec one day eighteen to st joachim the next thirtynine to baie st paul the next twenty to malbaie the next then forty to tadoussac then eighteen to rivière marguerite you can do something every day at that rate even in the new snow but on the ice of the saguenay to haha bay theres a pull of sixty miles youre at chicoutimi eleven miles farther before you know it good feed and good beds all along you wrap up and you dont mind of course markham concluded it isnt the climate of stanstead as if the climate of stanstead were something like that of st augustine  well it sounds a mere bagatelle said the more talkative of the other two but it takes a week of steady travel  what is a week on the way to golconda if golcondas yours when you get there said markham why watkins the young spruce and poplar alone on that tract are worth twice the price i ask for the whole a pulpmill which you could knock together for a few shillings on one of those magnificent waterpowers would make you all millionnaires in a single summer  and what would it do in the winter when your magnificent waterpower was restin  work harder than ever my dear boy and set an example of industry to all the lazy habitans in the country you could get your fuel for the cost of cutting and you could feed your spruce and poplar in under your furnace and have it come out paper pulp at the other end of the mill  watkins and the other listener laughed with loud hawhaws at markhams drolling and watkins said i say markham werent you born on the other side of the line  no but my father was and i wish hed stayed there till i came then id be going round with all the capitalists of wall street fighting for a chance to put their money into my mine instead of wearing out the knees of my trousers before you canucks begging you not to slap your everlasting fortune in the face  they now all roared together again and at sherbrooke they changed cars  northwick had to change too but he did not try to get into the same car with them he wanted to think to elaborate in his own mind the suggestion for his immediate and remoter future which he had got from their talk and he dreaded the confusion and possibly he dreaded the misgiving that might come from hearing more of their talk he thought he knew now just what he wanted to do and he did not wish to be swerved from it  he felt eager to get on but he was not impatient he bore very well the long waits that he had to make both at sherbrooke and richmond but when the train left the junction for quebec at last he settled himself in his seat with a solider content than he had felt before and gave himself up to the pleasure of shaping the future that was so obediently plastic in his fancy the brakeman plied the fierce stove at the end of the car with fuel and northwick did not suffer from the cold that strengthened and deepened with the passing night outside though he was not overcoated and booted for any such temperature as his fellowtravellers seemed prepared for they were all canadians and they talked now and then in their broadvowelled french but their voices were low and they came and went quietly at the country stations the car was old and worn and badly hung but in spite of all northwick drowsed in the fervor of the glowing stove and towards morning he fell into a long and dreamless sleep  he woke from it with a vigor and freshness that surprised him and found the train pulling into the station at pointe levis the sun burned like a soft lamp through the thick frost on the carwindow when he emerged he found it a cloudless splendor on a world of snow the vast landscape which he had seen in summer all green from the edge of the mighty rivers to the hilltops losing themselves in the blue distance showed rounded and diminished in the immeasurable drifts that filled it and that hid the streams in depths almost as great above their ice as those of the currents below the villages of the habitans sparkled from tinned roof and spire and the city before him rose from shore and cliff with a thousand plumes of silvery smoke in and out among the frozen shipping swarmed an active life that turned the rivers into highroads and speckled the expanse of glistening white with single figures and groups of men and horses  it was all gay and bizarre and it gave northwick a thrill of boyish delight he wondered for a moment why he had never come to quebec in winter before and brought his children he beckoned to the walnutfaced driver of one of the carrioles which waited outside the station to take the passengers across the river and tossed his bag into the bottom of the little sledge he gave the name of a hotel in the upper town and the driver whipped his tough longfetlocked pony over the space of ice which was kept clear of snow by diligent sweeping with firtree tops and then up the steep incline of mountain hill the streets were roadways from housefront to housefront smooth elastic levels of thicklybedded triplyfrozen snow and the foot passengers muffled to the eyes against the morning cold came and went among the vehicles in the middle of the street or crept along close to the housewalls to keep out of the light avalanches of an overnight snow that slipped here and there from the steep tin roofs  northwicks unreasoned gladness grew with each impression of the beauty and novelty it quickened associations of his earliest days and of the winter among his native hills he felt that life could be very pleasant in this latitude he relinquished the notion he had cherished at times of going to south america with his family in case he should finally fail to arrange with the company for his safe return home he forecast a future in quebec where he could build a new home for his children among scenes that need not be all so alien this did not move him from his fixed intention to retrieve himself though it gave him the courage of indefinitely expanded possibilities he was bent upon the scheme he had in mind and as soon as he finished his breakfast he went out to prepare for it     iii   the inn he had chosen was one which he remembered from former visits to quebec as having seemed a resort of old world folk of humble fortunes he got a room and went to it long enough to count the money he had with him and find it safe then he took one of the notes from the others and went to a brokers to get it changed  the amount seemed to give the broker pause but he concerned himself only with the genuineness of the greenback and after a keen glance at northwicks unimpeachable face he paid over the thousand dollars in canadian bills we used to make your countrymen give us something over he said with a smile in recognition of northwicks nationality  yes thats all changed now returned northwick do i look so very american he asked  oh i dont know that said the broker with an airy english inflection i suppose its your hard hat as much as anything we all wear fur caps in such weather  ah thats a good idea said northwick he spoke easily but with a nether torment of longing to look at the newspaper lying open on the counter he could see that it was the morning paper there might be something about him in it the thought turned him faint but he knew that if the paper happened to have anything about him in it any rumor of his offence any conjecture of his flight he could not bear it he could bear to keep himself deaf and blind to the self he had put behind him but he could not bear anything less the papers seemed to thrust themselves upon him newsboys followed him up in the street with them he saw them in all the shops where he went for the fur cap and fur overcoat he bought for the underclothing and changes of garments that he had to provide for the belt he got to put his money in this great sum which he dared not bank must be carried about with him it must not leave him night or day it must be buckled into the chamois belt and worn round his waist sleeping and waking the belt was really for gold but the fortytwo thousanddollar notes which were not a great bulk would easily go into it  he returned to his hotel and changed them to it and put the belt on then he felt easier and he looked up the landlord to ask about the route he wished to take he found as he expected that it was one very commonly travelled by lumber merchants going down into the woods to look after their logging camps some took a sleigh from quebec but the landlord said it was just as well to go by train to st anne and save that much sleighing you would get enough of it then northwick thought so too and after the early dinner they gave him he took the cars for st anne  he was not tired he was curiously buoyant and strong he thought he might get a nap on the way but he remained vividly awake and even that night he did not sleep much he felt again that pulling of his mind as if it were something separate from him and were struggling to get beyond the control of his will the hotel in the little native village was very good in its way he had an excellent supper and an easy bed but he slept brokenly and he was awake long before the early breakfast which he had ordered for his start next day the landlord wished to persuade him that there was no need of such great haste it was only eighteen miles to st joachim where he was to make his first stop and the road was so good that he would get there in a few hours he had better stop and visit the church and see the sick peoples offerings which they left there every year in gratitude to the saint for healing them of their maladies the landlord said it was a pity he could not come some time at the season of the pilgrimage his countrymen often came then northwick perceived that in spite of his fur cap and overcoat and his great canadian boots he was easily recognizable for an american to this man though he could not definitely decide whether his landlord was french or irish and could not tell whether it was in earnest or in irony that he invited him to try st anne for any trouble he happened to be suffering from but he winced at the suggestion while his heart leaped at the fantastic thought of hanging that moneybelt at her altar and so easing himself of all his pains he grotesquely imagined the american defaulters in canada making a pilgrimage to st anne and devoting emblems of their moral disease to her forged notes bewitched accounts false statements at the same time with that part of him which seemed obedient he asked the landlord if he knew of the gold discoveries on the chicoutimi river and tried to account for himself as an american speculator going to look into the matter in his own way and at his own time  in spite of his uncertainty about the landlord in some ways northwick found him a kindly young fellow he treated northwick with a young fellows comfortable deference for an elderly man and helped him forget the hurts to his respectability which rankled so when he remembered them he explained the difference between the two routes from malbaie on and advised him to take the longer which lay through a more settled district where he would be safer in case of any mischance but if he liked to take the shorter he told him there were good campes or loghouse stations every ten or fifteen miles where he would find excellent meals and beds and be well cared for by people who kept them in the winter for travellers ladies sometimes made the journey on that route which the government had lately opened and the mails were carried that way he could take passage with the mailcarriers  this fact determined northwick he shrank from trusting himself in government keeping though he knew he would be safe in it he said he would go by tadoussac and the landlord found a carriole driver with a tough little canadian horse who agreed to go the whole way to chicoutimi with him  after an early lunch the man came with the lowbodied sledge set on runners of solid wood and deeply bedded with bearskins for the lap and back the day was still and sunny like the day before and the air which drove keenly against his face with the rush of the carriole sparkled with particles of frost that sometimes filled it like a light shower of snow the drive was so short that he reached st joachim at noon and he decided to push on part of the way to baie st paul after dinner his host at st joachim approved of that you goin have snow tonight and big drift tomorrow he said and he gave his driver the name of an habitant whom they could stop the night with the driver was silent and he looked sinister northwick thought how easily the man might murder him on that lonely road and make off with the money in his belt how probably he would do it if he dreamed such wealth was within his grasp but the man did not notice him after their journey began except once to turn round and say look out you nose you goin freeze him for the rest he talked to his horse which was lazy and which he kept urging forward with marche donc marche donc finally shortened to ch donc ch donc and repeated and repeated at regular intervals like the tolling of a bell it made northwick think of a bellbuoy off a ledge of rocks which he had spent a summer near he wished to ask the man to stop but he reflected that the waves would not let him stop he had to keep tolling  northwick started he must be going out of his mind or else he was drowsing perhaps he was freezing and this was the beginning of the death drowse but he felt himself warm under his furs where he touched himself and he knew he had merely been dreaming he let himself go again and arrived at his own door in hatboro he saw the electric lights through the long piazza windows and he was going to warn elbridge again about that colts shoes then he heard a sharp foxlike barking and found that his carriole had stopped at the cabin of the habitant who was to keep him over night the open doorway was filled with children the wildlooking dogs leaping at his horses nose were in a frenzy of curiosity and suspicion  northwick rose from his nap refreshed physically but with a desolate and sinking heart the vision of his home had taken all his strength away with it but from his surface consciousness he returned the greeting of the man with a pipe in his mouth and what looked like a blue stocking on his head who welcomed him it was a poor place within but it had a comfort and kindliness of its own and it was well warmed from the great oblong stove of castiron set in the partition of the two rooms the meal that the housewife got him was good and savory but he had no relish for it and he went early to bed he did not understand much french and he could not talk with the people but he heard them speak of him as an old man with a sort of surprise and pity at his being there he felt this surprise and pity too it seemed such a wild and wicked thing that he should be driven away from his home and children at his age he tried to realize what had done it  the habitant had given northwick his best bed in his large room he went with his wife into the other and they took two or three of the younger children the rest all scattered up into the loft each bade the guest a wellmannered goodnight before northwick slept he heard his host get up and open the outer door some indians came in and lay down before the fire with the carriole driver     iv   in the morning northwick did not want to rise but he forced himself and that day he made the rest of the stage to baie st paul it snowed but he got through without much interruption the following day however the drifts had blocked the roads so that he did not make the twenty miles to malbaie till after dark he found himself bearing the journey better than he expected he was never so tired again as that first day after st anne he did not eat much or sleep much but he felt well the worst was that the breach between his will and his mind seemed to grow continually wider he had a sense of the rift being like a chasm stretching farther and farther the one side from the other at first his mind worked clearly but disobediently then he began to be aware of a dimness in its record of purposes and motives at times he could not tell where he was going or why he reverted with difficulty to the fact that he had wished to get as far as possible not only beyond pursuit but beyond the temptation to return voluntarily and give himself up he knew in those days before the treaty that he was safe from extradition but he feared that if a detective approached he would yield to him and go back especially as he could not always keep before himself the reasons for not going back when from time to time these reasons escaped him it seemed as if nothing could be done to him in case he went home and restored to the company the money he had brought away it needed a voluntary operation of logic to prove that this partial restitution would not avail that he would be arrested and convicted he would not be allowed to go on living with his children in his own house he would be taken from them and put in prison  he made an early start for tadoussac after a wakeful night his driver wished to break the forty mile journey midway but northwick would not consent the road was not so badly drifted as before and they got through a little after nightfall northwick remembered the place because it was here that the saguenay steamer lay so long before starting up the river he recognized in the vague nightlight the contour of the cove and the hills above it with the villages scattered over them it was twenty years since he had made that trip with his wife who had been nearly as long dead but he recalled the place distinctly and its summer effect it did not seem much lonelier now than it seemed in the summer the lamps shone from the windows where he had seen them then when he walked about a little just after supper the village store had a group of habitans and halfbreeds about its stove and there was as much show of life in the streets as there used to be at the same hour and season in the little white mountain village where his boyhood was passed it did not seem so bad if chicoutimi was no worse he could live there well enough till he could rehabilitate himself he imagined bringing his family there after his mills had got successfully going then probably other people from the outside world would be living there  he ate a hearty supper but again he did not sleep well and in the night he was feverish he thought how horrible it would be if he were to fall sick there he might die before he could get word to his children and they reach him he thought of going back to quebec and sailing for europe and having his children join him there they could sell the place at hatboro and with what it brought and with what he had they could live comfortably in some cheap country which had no extradition treaty with the united states he remembered reading of a defaulter who went to a little republic called san marino somewhere in italy and was safe there he found the president treading his own grape vats and it cost nothing to live there though it was dull and the exile became so homesick that he returned and gave himself up he wondered that he had not thought of that place before then he reflected that no ships could make their way from quebec to the sea before may at the earliest he would be arrested if he left any american port or arrested as soon as he reached england he remembered the advertisement of a line of steamships between quebec and brazil he must wait for the st lawrence to open and go to brazil and in the morning must go back to quebec  but in the morning he felt so much better that he decided to keep on to chicoutimi he could not bear the thought of being found out by detectives at quebec and by reporters who would fill the press with paragraphs about him he must die to the world to his family before he could hope to revisit either  the morning was brilliant with sunlight and the glare of the snow hurt his eyes he went to the store to get some glasses to protect them and he bought some laudanum to make him sleep that night if he should be wakeful again it was sixty miles to haha bay but the road on the frozen river was good and he could do a long stretch of it from rivière marguerite he should travel on the ice of the saguenay and the going would be smooth and easy  all the landscape seemed dwarfed since he saw it in that faroff summer the tops of the interminable solitudes that walled the river in on both sides appeared lower as if the snow upon them weighed them down but doubtless they had grown beyond their real height in his memory they had lost the mystery of the summer aspect when they were dimmed with rain or swathed in mist all their outlines were in plain sight and the forests that clothed them from the shore to their summits were not that unbroken gloom which they had seemed the snow shone through their stems and the inky river at their feet lay a motionless extent of white as his carriole slipped lightly over it northwick had a fantastic sense of his own minuteness and remoteness he thought of the photograph of a lunar landscape that he had once seen greatly magnified and of a fly that happened to traverse the expanse of plasterlike white between the ranges of extinct volcanoes  at times the cliffs rose from the river too sheer for the snow to lodge on then their rocky faces shone harsh and stern and sometimes the springs that gushed from them in summer were frozen in long streams of ice like the tears bursting from the source of some titanic grief these monstrous icicles blearing the visage of the rock which he figured as nothing but icicles affected northwick with an awe that he nowhere felt except when his driver slowed his carriole in front of the great capes trinity and eternity and silently pointed at them with his whip he had no need to name them the fugitive would have known them in another planet it was growing late the lonely day was waning to the lonely night while they halted the scream of a catamount broke from the woods skirting the bay between the capes and repeated itself in the echo that wandered from depth to depth of the frozen wilderness and seemed to die wailing away at the point where it first tore the silence  here and there at long intervals they passed a point or a recess where a sawmill stood with a few log houses about it and with signs of human life in the smoke that rose weakly on the thin dry air from their chimneys or in the figures that appeared at the doorways as the carriole passed at the next of these beyond the capes the driver proposed to stop and pass the night and northwick consented he felt worn out by his days journey his nerves were spent as if by a lateral pressure of the lifeless desert he had been travelling through and by the stress of his thoughts the intensity of his reveries his mind ran back against his will and dwelt with his children by this time long before this time they must be wild with anxiety about him by this time their shame must have come to poison their grief he realized it all and he realized that he could not must not help them he must not go back to them if ever he was to live for them again but at last he asked why he should live why he should not die there was laudanum enough in that bottle to kill him  as he walked up from the carriole at the rivers edge to the door of the sawmillers cabin he drew the cork of the vial and poured out the poison it followed him a few steps a black dribble of murder on the snow that the millers dog smelt at and turned from in offence that night he could not sleep again toward morning when all the house was snoring he gave way to the sobs that were bursting his heart he heard the sleepers men and dogs start a little in their dreams then they were still and he fell into a deep sleep  they let him sleep late and he had a dream of himself which must have been caused by the nascent consciousness of the going and coming around him people were talking of him and one said how old he was and another looked at his long white beard which flowed down over the blanket as far as his waist he told them that he wore it so that they should not know him when he got home and he showed them how he could take it off and put it on at pleasure he started awake and found his carriole driver standing over him  you got you sleep hout no  what time is it said northwick stupidly scanning the man to make sure that it was he and waiting for a full sense of the situation to reach him  nine oclock said the man and he turned away  northwick got up and found the place empty of the men and dogs a woman who looked like a halfbreed brought him his breakfast of fried venison and beancoffee her little one held by her skirt and stared at him he thought of elbridges baby that he had seen die it seemed ages ago he offered the child a shilling it shyly turned its face into its mothers dress the driver said e don know what money is yet but the mother seemed to know she showed her teeth and took it for the child northwick sat a moment thinking what a strange thing it was not to know what money was it had never occurred to him before he asked himself a queer question what was money the idea of it seemed to go to pieces as a printed word does when you look steadily at it and to have no meaning it affected him as droll fantastic like a piece of childish makebelieve when the woman took some more money from him for his meals and lodging but that was the way the world was worked you could get anything done for money it was the question of demand and supply nothing more he tried to think where money came in when he went out to see elbridges sick boy when elbridge left the dead child to drive him to the station it was something else that came in there but that thing and money were the same after all he had proved his love for his children by making money for them if he had not loved them so much he would not have tried to get so much money and he would not have been where he was  his mind fought away from his control as the sledge slipped along over the frozen river again it was very cold but the full sun on his head afflicted him like heat it was the blaze of light that beat up from the snow too his head felt imponderable and yet he could not hold it up it was always sinking forward and he woke from naps without being sure that he had been asleep  he intended to push through that day to chicoutimi but his start was so late that it seemed to him as if they would never get to haha bay when they arrived late in the afternoon all sense of progress thither faded away it was as if the starting and stopping were one or contained in the same impulse it might be so if he kept on eleven miles further to chicoutimi but he would not be able to feel it so at the beginning the wish could involve its accomplishment only at the end he said to himself that this was unreasonable it was a poor rule that would not work both ways  this ran through his mind in the presence of the old man who bustled out of the door of the cabin where his carriole had stopped it was larger than most of the other cabins of the place which northwick remembered curiously well some with their logs bare and some sheathed in birchbark he remembered this man too when his white moustache which branched into either ear was a glistening brown and the droop of his left eyelid was more like a voluntary wink but the gayety of his face was the same and his welcome was so cordial that a fear of recognition went through northwick he knew the man for the talkative canadian who had taken him and his wife a drive over the hills around the bay in the morning when their boat arrived and afterwards stopped with them at this cabin and had them in to drink a glass of milk northwicks wife liked the man and said she would like to live in such a house in such a place and should not be afraid of the winter that he told her was so terrible it was almost as if her spirit were there but northwick said to himself that he must not let the man know that he had ever seen him before the resolution cost him something for he felt so broken and weak that he would have liked to claim his kindness as an old acquaintance he would have liked to ask if he still caught wild animals for showmen and how his trade prospered if he had always lived at haha bay since they met but he was the more decided to ignore their former meeting because the man addressed him in english at once and apparently knew him for an american perhaps other defaulters had been there before perhaps the mines had brought americans there prospecting  good morning sir cried the canadian i am glad to see you let me elp you hout sir well it is a pleasure to speak a little english with some one the english close hup with the river in the autumn but it open early this year i ope you are a sign of many americans they are the life of our country without the americans we could not live no sir not a day come in come in you will find you room ready for you sir  northwick hung back suspiciously were you expecting me he asked  no one cried the man with a shrug and opening of the hands but hall the travellers they stop with bird and where there are honly two rooms eat with one stove between the walls their room is always ready do me the pleasure he set the door open and bowed northwick in baptiste he called to the driver over his shoulder take you orse to the stable he added a long queue of unintelligible french to his english and the driver responded hall right  i am the only person at haha bay who speaks english he said in the same terms he had used twenty years before when he presented himself to northwick and his wife on their steamboat and asked them if they would like to drive before breakfast but you must know me birdoiseau you have been here before  no said northwick with one lie for all the man with his cheer and gayety was even terribly familiar and northwick could have believed that the room and the furniture in it were absolutely unchanged there was the little window that he knew opened on the poor vegetable garden with its spindling corn and its beans for soup and coffee there was the chair his wife had sat in to look out on the things but for the frost on the pane he could doubtless see them growing now  he sank into the chair and said to himself that he should die there and it would be as well it would be easy he felt very old and weak and he did not try to take off the wraps which he had worn in the sledge he wished that he might fall so into his grave and be done with it     v   bird walked up and down the room talking he seemed overjoyed with the chance and as if he could not forego it for a moment well sir i wish that i could say as much but i have been here forty years hoff and on i am born at quebecin his tremulous inattention northwick was aware that the man had said the same thing to him all those years before with the same sidelong glance for the effect of the fact upon himand i came here when i was twenty now i am sixty hall the americans know me i used to go into the bush with them for bear lots of bear in the bush when i first came now they get pretty scarce i have the best moosedog but i dont care much for the hunting now i am too hold thats a fact i am sixty and forty winters i ave pass at haha bay you know why it is call haha bay it is the hecho well i dont hear much haha nowadays round this bay but it is pretty here in the summer yes very pretty prettier than chicoutimi and more gold in the ills  he let his bold gay eye rest confidently on northwick as if to say he knew what had brought him there and he might as well own the fact at once and northwick tried to get his mind to grapple with his real motive but his mind kept pulling away from him like that unruly horse and he could not manage it he knew in that self which seemed apart from his mind that it would be a very good thing to let the man suppose he was there to look into the question of the mines but there was something else that seemed to go with that intention something like a wish to get away from the past so remotely and so completely that no rumor of it should reach him till he was willing to let it to be absent from all who had known him so long that no one of them would know him if he saw him he was there not only to start a pulpmill but to grow a beard that should effectually disguise him he recalled how he had looked with that long beard in his dream he put his hand to his chin and felt the eight days stubble there and he wondered how much time it would take to grow such a beard  bird went on talking i know that chicoutimi company i told markham about the gold when he was here for bear he is smart but he dont know heverything you think he can make it pay with that invention i doubt me there is one place in those ills and bird came closer to northwick and dropped his voice where you dont ave to begin with the tailings i know the place but whats the good all the same you want capital  he went to the shelf in the wall above the stove and took a pipe which he filled with tobacco and then he drew some coals out on the stove hearth but before he dropped one of them on his pipe with his horny thumb and finger he asked politely you hobject to the smoking  northwick said he did not and bird said it is one of three things you can do here in the winter smoke the pipe cut the wood court the ladies northwick remembered his saying that before too and how it had made his wife laugh i used to do all three now i smoke the pipe well while you are young it is all right and it is fun in the woods but i was always omesick for quebec more or less you know what it is to be omesick  the word pierced northwick through the vagary which clothed his consciousness like a sort of fog and made his heart bleed with selfpity  well i been omesick forty years and i dont know what for any more i been back to quebec it is not the same you know ow they pull down those city gate what they want to do that for the gate did not keep the stranger hout it let them in and there were too many people dead now i think i am omesick just to get away from here if i had some capitalten fifteen thousand dollarsi would hopen that mine and take out my hundred two hundred thousand dollar and then goodby haha bay i would make it hecho like it never hecho before i dont want nothing to work up the tailings of my mine me there is gold enough there to pay and i can hire those habitans cheap like dirt what is their time worth the bush is cut away they got nothing to do it is the time of a setting en as you americans say their time  bird smoked away for a little while in silence and then he seemed aware for the first time that northwick had not taken off his wraps and he said hospitably i ope you will spend the night with me here  northwick said thank you i dont know is it far to chicoutimi he knew but he asked hoping the man would exaggerate the distance and then he would not have to go  it is eleven mile but the road is bad drifted  i will wait till tomorrow said northwick and he began to unswathe and unbutton but so feebly that bird noticed  allow me he said putting down his pipe and coming to his aid he was very gentle and lighthanded like a woman but northwick felt one touch on the pouch of his belt and refused further help  he let his host carry his two bags into the next room for him the bag that he had brought with the few things from home when he pretended that he was coming away for a day or two and the bag that he had got in quebec to hold the things he had to buy there when bird set them down beside his bed he could not bear to see the bag from home and he pushed it under out of sight then he tumbled himself on the bed and pulled the bearskin robe that he found on it up over him and fell into a thin sleep that was not so different from his dim waking that he was sure it had been sleep when bird came back with a lamp  been aving a little nap he asked looking gayly down on northwicks bewildered face well that is all right we have supper now pretty soon you hungry well in a alfhour  he went out again and northwick after some efforts made out to rise his skull felt sore and his arms as if they had been beaten with hard blows but after he had bathed his face and hands in the warm water bird had brought with the lamp he found himself better though he was still wrapped in that cloudy uncertainty of himself and of his sleeping or waking he saw some pictures about on the coarse white walls the seven stations of the cross in colored prints a lithograph of indians burning a jesuit priest over the beds head hung a chromo of our lady with seven swords piercing her heart beside the bed was a parian crucifix with the figure of christ writhing on it  these things made northwick feel very far and strange his simple and unimaginative nature could in nowise relate itself to this alien faith this alien language he heard soft voices of women in the next room the first that he had heard since he last heard his daughters a girls voice singing was severed by a door that closed and then opened to let it be heard a few notes more and again closed  but he found bird still alone in the next room when he returned to it well now we go to supper as soon as father Étienne comes he is our curateour ministerhere and he eats with me when he heat anywhere i tell im e hought to have my appetite if he wants to keep up his spiritual strength the body is the foundation of the soul no well you let that foundation tumble hin and then where you got you soul heigh but father Étienne speaks very good english heducate at rome i am the only other educated man at haha bay you dont appen to have some papers in you bag french english it is the same  papers no said northwick with horror and suspicion what is in the papers  that is what i like to find hout said bird spreading his hands with a shrug  the outer door opened and a young man in a priests long robe came in bird introduced his guest and northwick shook hands with the priest who had a smooth regular face with beautiful innocent eyes like a girls he might have been twentyeight or twentynine he had the spare figure of a man under thirty who leads an active life his features were refined by study and the thought of others when he smiled the innocence of his face was more than girlish it was childlike points of light danced in his large soft dark eyes an effect of trusting alluring kindness came from his whole radiant visage  northwick felt its charm with a kind of fear he shrank away from the priest and at the table he left the talk to him and his host they supped in a room opening into a sort of wing beyond it was a small kitchen from which an elderly woman brought the dishes and where that girl whom he heard singing kept trilling away as if she were excited like a canary by the sound of the frying meat  bird said by way of introduction that the woman was his niece but he did not waste time on her he began to talk up his conjecture as to northwicks business with the priest as if it were an ascertained fact northwick fancied his advantage in leaving him to it they discussed the question of gold in the hills which the young father treated as an old story of faded interest and bird entered into with the fervor of fresh excitement the priest spoke of the poor return from the mines at chaudière but bird claimed that it was different here northwick did not say anything he listened and watched them as if they were a pair of confidencemen trying to work him the priest seemed to be anxious to get the question off the personal ground into the region of the abstract and northwick believed that this was part of his game a ruse to throw him from his guard and commit him to something he made up his mind to get away as early as he could in the morning he did not think it was a safe place  very well the priest cried at one point suppose you had the capital you wish and suppose you had taken out all the gold you say is there and you were rich what would you do  what i do bird struck the table with his fist leave haha bay tomorrow morning  and where would you go  go to quebec to london to paris to rome to the devil keep going  the young father laughed a laugh as innocent as his looks and turned with a sudden appeal to northwick tell me a little about the rich men in your land of millionnaires how do they find their happiness in what what is the secret of joy that they have bought with their money  i dont know what you mean said northwick with a recoil deeper into himself after the first flush of alarm at being addressed  where do they live  northwick hesitated and the priest laid his hand on birds shoulder as if to restrain a burst of information from him  i suppose most of them live in new york  all the time  no they generally have a house at the seaside at newport or bar harbor for the summer and one at lenox or tuxedo for the fall and they go to florida for the winter or nice then they have their yachts  the land is not large enough for their restlessness they roam the sea my son said the young priest to the old hunter you can have all the advantage of riches at the expense of a gypsies van he laughed again in friendly delight at birds supposed discomfiture and touched him lightly delicately as before it is the same in europe i have seen it there too bird was going to speak but the priest stayed him a moment but how did your rich people get their millions not like those rich people in europe by inheritance  very few said northwick sensible of a remnant of the pride he used to feel in the fact hidden about somewhere in his consciousness they made it  how excuse me  by manufacturing by speculating in railroad stocks by mining by the rise in landvalues  what causes the land to rise in value  the demand for it the necessity  oh the need of others and when a man gains in stocks some other man loses no do the manufacturers pay the operatives all they earn are the miners very well paid and comfortable i have read that they are miserable is it so  northwick was aware that there were good and valid answers to all these questions which the priest seemed to be asking rather for the confusion of bird than as an expression of his own opinions but in his dazed intelligence he could not find the answers  bird roared out haw do not regard him he is a man of the other worldan angela mere imbecileabout business the priest threw himself back in his chair and laughed tolerantly showing his beautiful teeth all those rich men they give work to the poor if i had a few thousand dollars to hopen up that place in the ill i would furnish work to every man in haha bayto hundreds are the miners more miserable than those habitans eh  the good god seems to think so returned the priest seriously at least he has put the gold in the rocks so that you cannot get it out what would you give the devil to help you he asked with a smile  when i want to make a bargain with the devil i dont come to you père Étienne i go to a notary you ever hear sir said bird turning to northwick about that notary at montreal  i think i will go to bed said northwick abruptly i am not feeling very welli am very tired that is he had suddenly lost account of what and where he was it seemed to him that he was both there and at hatboro that there were really two northwicks and that there was a third self somewhere in space conscious of them both  it was this third northwick whom bird and the priest would have helped to bed if he had suffered them but who repulsed their offers he made shift to undress himself while he heard them talking in french with lowered voices in the next room their debate seemed at an end after a little while he heard the door shut as if the priest had gone away afterwards he appeared to have come back     vi   the talk went on all night in northwicks head between those two frenchmen who pretended to be of contrary opinions but were really leagued to get the better of him and lure him on to put his money into that mine in the morning his fever was gone but he was weak and he could not command his mind could not make it stay by him long enough to decide whether any harm would come from remaining over a day before he pushed on to chicoutimi he tried to put in order or sequence the reasons he had for coming so deep into the winter and the wilderness but when he passed from one to the next the former escaped him  bird looked in with his blue woollen bonnet on his head and his pipe in his mouth and he removed each to ask how northwick was and whether he would like to have some breakfast perhaps he would like a cup of tea and some toast  northwick caught eagerly at the suggestion and in a few minutes the tea was brought him by a young girl whom bird called virginie he said she was his grandniece and he hoped that her singing had not disturbed the gentleman she always sang one could hardly stop her but she meant no harm he stayed to serve northwick himself and northwick tried to put away the suspicion birds kindness roused in him he was in such need of kindness that he did not wish to suspect it nevertheless he watched bird narrowly as he put the milk and sugar in his tea and he listened warily when he began to talk of the priest and to praise him it was a pleasure bird said for one educated man to converse with another and father Étienne and he often maintained opposite sides of a question merely for the sake of the discussion it was like a game of cards where there were no stakes you exercised your mind  northwick understood this too little to believe it when he talked he talked business even the jokes among the men he was used to meant business  then you havent really found any gold in the hills he asked slyly  my faith yes said bird but he added sadly perhaps it would not pay to mine it i will show you when you get up better not go to chicoutimi today it is snowing  snowing northwick repeated then i cant go  stop in bed till dinner that is the best bird suggested try to get some sleep sleep is youth when we wake we are old again but some of the youth stick to our fingers no he smiled gayly and went out closing the door softly after him and northwick drowsed in a dream bird came back to him with some specimens from his gold mine northwick could see that the yellow metal speckling the quartz was nothing but copper pyrites but he thought it best to pretend that he believed it gold for bird while he stood over him with a lamp in one hand was feeling with the other for the buckle of northwicks belt as he sat up in bed he woke in fright and the fear did not afterwards leave him in the fever which now began he had his lucid intervals when he was aware that he was wisely treated and tenderly cared for and that his host and all his household were his devoted watchers and nurses when he knew the doctor and the young priest in their visits but all this he perceived cloudily and as with a thickness of some sort of stuff between him and the fact while the illusion of his delirium always the same was always poignantly real then the morning came when he woke from it when the delirium was past and he knew what and where he was the truth did not dawn gradually upon him but possessed him at once his first motion was to feel for his belt and he found it gone he gave a deep groan  the blue woollen bonnet of the old hunter appeared through the open doorway with the pipe under the branching gray moustache the eyes of the men met  well said bird you are in you senses at last northwick did not speak but his look conveyed a question which the other could not misinterpret he smiled you want you belt he disappeared and then reappeared this time full length and brought the belt to northwick you think you are among some yankee defalcator he asked for sole resentment of the suspicion which northwicks anguished look must have imparted count it i think you find it hall right but as the sick man lay still and made no motion to take up the belt where it lay across his breast bird asked you want me to count it for you  northwick faintly nodded and bird stood over him and told the thousanddollar bills over one by one and then put them back in the pouch of the belt  now i think you are going to get well the doctor e say to let you see you money the first thing shall i put it hon you  northwick looked at the belt it seemed to him that the bunch the bills made would hurt him and he said weakly you keep it for me  hall right said bird and he took it away he went out with a proud air as if he felt honored by the trust northwick had explicitly confirmed and sat down in the next room so as to be within call  northwick made the slow recovery of an elderly man and by the time he could go out of doors without fear of relapse there were signs in the air and in the earth of the spring which when it comes to that northern land possesses it like a passion the grass showed green on the low bare hills as the snow uncovered them the leaves seemed to break like an illumination from the trees the south wind blew back the birds with its first breath the jays screamed in the woods the canadian nightingales sang in the evening and the early morning when he woke and thought of his place at hatboro where the robins broods must be halfgrown by that time it was then the time of the appleblossoms there with his homesick inward vision he saw the billowed tops of his orchard all pinkwhite he thought how the apples smelt when they first began to drop in august on the clean straw that bedded the orchard aisles it seemed to him that if he could only be there again for a moment he would be willing to spend the rest of his life in prison as it was he was in prison it did not matter how wide the bounds were that kept him from his home he hated the vastness of the half world where he could come and go unmolested this bondage that masked itself as such ample freedom to be shut out was the same as to be shut in  in the first days of his convalescence while he was yet too weak to leave his room he planned and executed many returns to his home he went back by stealth and disguised by the beard which had grown in his sickness and tried to see what change had come upon it but he could never see it different from what it was that clear winter night when he escaped from it this baffled and distressed him and strengthened the longing at the bottom of his heart actually to return he thought that if he could once look on the misery he had brought upon his children he could bear it better he complexly flattered himself that it would not be so bad in reality as it was in fancy sometimes when this wish harassed him he said to himself to still it that as soon as the first boat came up the river from quebec he would go down with it and arrange to surrender himself to the authorities and abandon the struggle  but as he regained his health he began to feel that this was a rash and foolish promise he thought he saw a better way out of his unhappiness it appeared a misfortune once more and not so much a fault of his he was restored to this feeling in part by the respect the distinction which he enjoyed in the little village and which pleasantly recalled his consequence among the millpeople at ponkwasset when he was declared out of danger he began to receive visits of polite sympathy from the heads of families who smoked round him in the evening and predicted a renewal of his youth by the fever he had come through safely their prophecies were interpreted by bird and père Étienne as with one or other of these he went to repay their visits everywhere the inmates of the simple clean little houses had begun early to furbish them up for the use of their summer boarders while they got ready the shanties behind them for their own occupancy but everywhere northwick was received with that pathetic deference which the poor render to those capable of bettering their condition the secret of the treasure he had brought with him remained safe with the doctor and the priest and with bird who had discovered it with them but bird was not the man to conceal from his neighbors the fact that his guest was a great american capitalist who had come to develop the mineral agricultural and manufacturing interests of haha bay on the american scale and to enrich the whole region buying land of those who wished to sell and employing all those who desired to work if he was impatient for the verification of these promises by northwick he was too polite to urge it and did nothing worse than brag to him as he bragged about him he probably had his own opinion of northwicks reasons for the silence he maintained concerning himself in all respects he knew from the tag fastened to the bag northwick had bought in quebec that his name was warwick and he knew from northwick himself that he was from chicago beyond this if he conjectured that he was the victim of financial errors he smoothly kept his guesses to himself and would not mar the chances of good that northwick might do with his money by hinting any question of its origin the american defaulter was a sort of hero in birds fancy he had heard much of that character he would have experienced no shock at realizing him in northwick he would have accounted for northwick and excused him to himself if need be the doctor observed a professional reticence his affair was with northwicks body which he had treated skilfully he left his soul to père Étienne who may have had his diffidence his delicacy in dealing with it as the soul of a protestant and a foreigner     vii   it took the young priest somewhat longer than it would have taken a man of northwicks own language and nation to perceive that his gentlemanly decorum and grave repose of manner masked a complete ignorance of the things that interest cultivated people and that he was merely and purely a business man a figment of commercial civilization with only the crudest tastes and ambitions outside of the narrow circle of moneymaking he found that he had a pleasure in horses and cattle and from hints which northwick let fall regarding his life at home that he was fond of having a farm and a conservatory with rare plants but the flowers were possessions not passions he did not speak of them as if they afforded him any artistic or scientific delight the young priest learned that he had put a good deal of money in pictures but then the pictures seemed to have become investments and of the nature of stocks and bonds he found that this curious american did not care to read the english books which bird offered to lend him out of the little store of gifts and accidents accumulated in the course of years from bountiful or forgetful tourists the books in french père Étienne proposed to him northwick said he did not know how to read he showed no liking for music except a little for the singing of birds niece virginie but when the priest thought he might care to understand that she sang the ballads which the first voyagers had brought from france into the wilderness or which had sprung out of the joy and sorrow of its hard life he saw that the fact said nothing to northwick and that it rather embarrassed him the american could not take part in any of those discussions of abstract questions which the priest and the old woodsman delighted in and which they sometimes tried to make him share he apparently did not know what they meant it was only when père Étienne gave him up as the creature of a civilization too ugly and arid to be borne that he began to love him as a brother when he could make nothing of northwicks mind he conceived the hope of saving his soul  père Étienne felt sure that northwick had a soul and he had his misgivings that it was a troubled one he too had heard of the american defaulter who has a celebrity of his own in canada penetrating to different men with different suggestion and touching here and there a pure and unworldly heart such as père Étienne bore in his breast with commiseration the young priest did not conceive very clearly of the make and manner of the crime he suspected the elusive and mysterious stranger of committing but he imagined that the great sum of money he knew him possessed of was spoil of some sort and he believed that northwicks hesitation to employ it in any way was proof of an uneasy conscience in its possession why had he come to that lonely place in midwinter with a treasure such as that and why did he keep the money by him instead of putting it in a bank père Étienne talked these questions over with bird and the doctor and he could find only one answer to them he wondered if he ought not to speak to northwick and delicately offer him the chance to unburden his mind to such a friend as only a priest could be to such a sinner but he could not think of any approach sufficiently delicate northwick was not a catholic and the church had no hold upon him besides he had a certain plausibility and reserve of demeanor that forbade suspicion as well as the intimacy necessary to the good which père Étienne wished to do the lonely and silent man northwick was in those days much occupied with a piece of writing which he always locked carefully into his bag when he left his room and which he copied in part or in whole again and again burning the rejected drafts in the hearthfire that had now superseded the stove and stirring the carbonized paper into ashes so that no word was left distinguishable on it  one day there came up the river a bateau from tadoussac bringing the news that the ice was all out of the st lawrence it will not be long time now said bird before we begin to see you countrymen the steamboats come to haha bay in the last of june  northwick responded to the words with no visible sensation his sphinxlike reticence vexed bird more and more and intolerably deepened the mystification of his failure to do any of the things with his capital which bird had promised himself and his fellowcitizens he no longer talked of going to chicoutimi that was true and there was not the danger of his putting his money into markhams enterprise there but neither did he show any interest or any curiosity concerning birds discovery of the precious metal at haha bay bird had his delicacy as well as père Étienne and he could not thrust himself upon his guest even with the intention of making their joint fortune  a few days later there came to père Étienne a letter which when he read it superseded the interest in northwick which bird felt gnawing him like a perpetual hunger it was from the curé at rimouski where père Étiennes family lived and it brought word that his mother who had been in failing health all winter could not long survive and so greatly desired to see him that his correspondent had asked their superior to allow him to replace père Étienne at haha bay while he came to visit her leave had been given and père Étienne might expect his friend very soon after his letter reached him  where is rimouski northwick asked when he found himself alone with the priest that evening  it is on the st lawrence it is the last and first point where the steamers touch in going and coming between quebec and liverpool père Étienne had been weeping and his heart was softened and emboldened by the anxiety he felt it is my native villagewhere i lived till i went to make my studies in the laval university it is going home for me perhaps they will let me remain there he added by an irresistible impulse of pity and love i wish you were going home too mr warwick  i wish i were said northwick with a heavy sigh but i cantyet  this is a desert for you père Étienne pressed on i can see that i have seen how solitary you are  yes its lonesome northwick admitted  my son said the young priest to the man who was old enough to be his father and he put his hand on northwicks where it lay on his knee as they sat side by side before the fire is there something you could wish to say to me something i might do to help you  in a moment all was open between them and they knew each others meaning yes said northwick and he felt the wish to trust in the priest and to be ruled by him well up like a tide of hot blood from his heart it sank back again this pure soul was too innocent too unversed in the world and its ways to know his offence in its right proportion to know it as northwick himself knew it to be able to account for it and condone it the affair if he could understand it at all would shock him he must blame it as relentlessly as northwicks own child would if her love did not save him with the next word he closed that which was open between them a rift in his clouds that heaven itself had seemed to look through i have a lettera letter that i wish you would take and mail for me in rimouski  i will take it with great pleasure said the priest but he had the sadness of a deep disappointment in his tone  northwick was disappointed too almost injured he had something like a perception that if père Étienne had been a coarser commoner soul he could have told him everything and saved his own soul by the confession  about a month after the priests departure the first steamboat came up the saguenay from quebec by this time bird was a desperate man northwick was still there in his house with all that money which he would not employ in any way at once a temptation and a danger if it should in any manner become known the wandering poor who are known to the piety of the habitans as the brethren of christ were a terror to bird in their visits when they came by day to receive the charity which no one denies them he felt himself bound to keep a watchful eye on this old yankee who was either a rascal or a madman and perhaps both and to see that no harm came to him and when he heard the tramps prowling about at night and feeling for the alms that kind people leave outdoors for them he could not sleep the old hunter neglected his wildbeast traps and suffered his affairs to fall into neglect but it was not his failing appetite or his broken sleep alone that wore upon him the disappointment with his guest that was spreading through the community involved bird and he thought his neighbors looked askance at him as if they believed he could have moved northwick to action if he would northwick could not have moved himself he was like one benumbed he let the days go by and made no attempt to realize the schemes for the retrieval of his fortunes that had brought him to that region  the sound of the steamboats whistle was a joyful sound to bird he rose and went into northwicks room northwick was awake he had heard the whistle too  now mr warwick or what you name said bird with trembling eagerness that is the boat i want you take you money and go hout my ouse yes sir now pack you things dont wait for breakfast you get breakfast on board go     viii   the letter which père Étienne posted for northwick at rimouski was addressed to the editor of the boston events and was published with every advantage which scareheading could invent a young journalist newly promoted to the management was trying to give the countingroom proofs of his efficiency in the line of the events greatest successes and he wasted no thrill that the sensation in his hands was capable of imparting to his readers yet the effect was disappointing not only in the figure of the immediate sales but in the cumulative value of the recognition of the fact that the events had been selected by northwick as the best avenue for approaching the public the abstract in copying and commenting upon the letter skilfully stabbed its esteemed contemporary with an acknowledgment of its prime importance as the organ of the american defaulters in canada other papers after questioning the document as a fake made common cause in treating it as a matter of little or no moment in fact there had been many defalcations since northwicks the average of one a day in the despatches of the associated press had been fully kept up and several of these had easily surpassed his in the losses involved and in the picturesqueness of the circumstances people generally recalled with an effort the supremely tragic claim of his case through the rumor of his death in the railroad accident those who distinctly remembered it experienced a certain disgust at the mans willingness to shelter himself so long in the doubt to which it had left not only the public but his own family concerning his fate  the evening after the letter appeared hilary was dining one of those belated englishmen who sometimes arrive in boston after most houses are closed for the summer on the hill and the back bay mrs hilary and louise were already with matt at his farm for a brief season before opening their own house at the shore and hilary was living en garçon there were only men at the dinner and the talk at first ran chiefly to question of a sufficient incentive for northwicks peculations its absence was the fact which all concurred in owning in deference to his guests ignorance of the matter hilary went rapidly over it from the beginning and as he did so the perfectly typical character of the man and of the situation appeared in clear relief he ended by saying it isnt at all a remarkable instance there is nothing peculiar about it northwick was well off and he wished to be better off he had plenty of other peoples money in his hands which he controlled so entirely that he felt as if it were his own he used it and he lost it then he was found out and ran away thats all  then as i understand said the englishman with a strong impression that he was making a joke this mr northwick was not one of your most remarkable men  everybody laughed obligingly and hilary said he was one of our least remarkable men then spurred on by that perverse impulse which we americans often have to make the worst of ourselves to an englishman he added the defaulter seems to be taking the place of the selfmade man among us northwicks a type a little differentiated from thousands of others by the rumor of his death in the first place and now by this unconsciously hypocritical and nauseous letter hes what the commonplace american egotist must come to more and more in finance now that he is abandoning the career of politics and wants to be rich instead of great  really said the englishman  among hilarys guests was charles bellingham a bachelor of pronounced baldness who said he would come to meet hilarys belated englishman in quality of bearleader to his cousininlaw old bromfield corey a society veteran of that period when even the swell in boston must be an intellectual man he was not only old but an invalid and he seldom left town in summer and liked to go out to dinner whenever he was asked bellingham came to the rescue of the national repute in his own fashion i cant account for your not locking up your spoons hilary when you invited me unless you knew where you could steal some more  ah it isnt quite like a gentlemans stealing a few spoons old corey began in the gentle way he had and with a certain involuntary sibilation through the gaps between his front teeth its a much more heroic thing than an ordinary theft and i cant let you belittle it as something commonplace because it happens every day so does death so does birth but theyre not commonplace  theyre not so frequent as defalcation with us quiteespecially birth suggested bellingham  no corey went on every fact of this sort is preceded by the slow and long decay of a moral nature and that is of the most eternal and tragical interest andhere corey broke down in an old mans queer whimpering laugh as the notion struck himif its very common with us i dont know but we ought to be proud of it as showing that we excel all the rest of the civilized world in the proportion of decayed moral natures to the whole population but i wonder he went on that it doesnt produce more moralists of a sanative type than it has our bad teeth have given us the best dentists in the world our habit of defalcation hasnt resulted yet in any ethical compensation sewell here used to preach about such things but ill venture to say we shall have no homily on northwick from him next sunday  the rev mr sewell suffered the thrust in patience what is the use he asked with a certain sadness the preachers voice is lost in his soundingboard nowadays when all the sunday newspapers are crying aloud from twentyeight pages illustrated  perhaps they are our moralists corey suggested  perhaps sewell assented  by the way hilary said bellingham did you ever know who wrote that article in the abstract when northwicks crookedness first appeared  yes said hilary it was a young fellow of twentyfour or five  come off said bellingham in a slang phrase then making its way into merited favor whats become of him i havent seen anything else like it in the abstract  no and im afraid youre not likely to the fellow was a reporter on the paper at the time but he happened to have looked up the literature of defalcation and they let him say his say  it was a very good say  better than any other he had in him they let him try again on different things but he wasnt up to the work so the managing editor saidand he was a friend of the fellows he was too literary i believe  and whats become of him asked corey  you might get him to read to you said bellingham to the old man he added to the company corey uses up a fresh reader every three months he takes them into his intimacy and then he finds their society oppressive  why hilary answered with a little hesitation he was out of health and matt had him up to his farm  is he matts only beneficiary corey asked with a certain tone of tolerant liking for matt i thought he usually had a larger colony at vardley  well he has said hilary but when his mother and sister are visiting him he has to reduce their numbers he cant very well turn his family away  he might board them out said bellingham  do you suppose asked sewell as if he had not noticed the turn the talk had taken that northwick has gone to europe  ive no doubt he wishes me to suppose so said hilary and of course weve had to cable the authorities to look out for him at moville and liverpool but i feel perfectly sure hes still in canada and expects to make terms for getting home again he must be horribly homesick  yes sewell suggested  yes not because hes a man of any delicacy of feeling or much real affection for his family ive no doubt hes fond of them in a way but hes fonder of himself you can see all through his letter that hes trying to make interest for himself and that hes quite willing to use his children if it will tell on the public sympathies he knows very well that theyre provided for they own the place at hatboro he deeded it to them long before his crookedness is known to have begun and his creditors couldnt touch it if they wished to if he had really that fatherly affection for them which he appeals to in others he wouldnt have left them in doubt whether he was alive or dead for four or five months and then dragged them into an open letter asking forbearance in their name and promising for their sake to right those he had wronged the thing is thoroughly indecent  since the fact of northwicks survival had been established beyond question by the publication of his letter hilarys mind in regard to him had undergone a great revulsion it relieved itself with a sharp rebound from the oppressive sense of responsibility for his death which he seemed to have incurred in telling northwick that the best thing for him would be a railroad accident now that the man was not killed hilary could freely declare he made a great mistake in not getting out of the world as many of us believed he had i confess i had rather got to believe it myself but he ought at least to have had the grace to remain dead to the poor creatures he had dishonored till he could repay the people he had defrauded  ah i dont know about that said sewell  no why not  because it would be a kind of romantic deceit that hed better not keep up  he seems to have kept it up for the last four or five months said hilary  thats no reason he should continue to keep it up sewell persisted perhaps he never knew of the rumor of his death  ah that isnt imaginable there isnt a hole or corner left where the newspapers dont penetrate nowadays  not in boston but if he were in hiding in some little french village down the st lawrence  isnt that as romantic as the other notion parson crowed old corey  no i dont think so said the minister the cases are quite different he might have a morbid shrinking from his own past and the wish to hide from it as far as he could that would be natural but to leave his children to believe a rumor of his death in order to save their feelings would be against nature it would be purely histrionic a motive from the theatre that is perfectly false  pretty hard on hilary who invented it bellingham suggested and they all laughed  i dont know said hilary the man seems to be posing in other ways you would think from his letter that he was a sort of martyr to principle and that hed been driven off to canada by the heartless creditors whom hes going to devote his life to saving from loss if he cant do it in a few months or years he may not be a conscious humbug but hes certainly a humbug take that pretence of his that he would come back and stand his trial if he believed it would not result in greater harm than good by depriving him of all hope of restitution  why theres a sort of crazy morality in that said corey  perhaps said bellingham the solution of the whole matter is that northwick is cracked  ive no doubt hes cracked to a certain extent said sewell as every wrongdoer is you know the swedenborgians believe that insanity is the last state of the wicked  i suppose observed old corey thoughtfully youd be very glad to have him keep out of your reach hilary  what a question said hilary youre as bad as my daughter she asked me the same thing  i wish i were no worse said the old man  you speak of his children said the englishman hasnt he a wife  no two daughters one an old maid and the other a young girl whom my daughter knew at school hilary answered  i saw the young lady at your house once said bellingham in a certain way  yes shes been here a good deal first and last  rather a highstepping young person i thought said bellingham  she is a proud girl hilary admitted rather imperious in fact  ah whats the pride of a young girl said corey something that comes from her love and goes to it no separable quality nothing thats for herself  well im not sure of that said hilary in this case it seems to have served her own turn its enabled her simply and honestly to deny the fact that her father ever did anything wrong  thats rather fine corey remarked as if tasting it  and what will it enable her to do now that hes come out and confessed the frauds himself the englishman asked  hilary shrugged for answer he said to bellingham charles i want you to try some of these crabs i got them for you  why this is touching hilary said bellingham getting his fat head round with difficulty to look at them in the dish the man was bringing to his side but i dont know that i should have refused them even if they had been got for corey     ix   they did not discuss northwicks letter at the dinnerparties in hatboro because socially speaking they never dined there but the stores the shops the parlors buzzed with comment on it it became a part of the forms of salutation the color of the days joke gates the provision man had to own the error of his belief in northwicks death he found his account in being the only man to own that he ever had such a belief he was a comfort to those who said they had always had their doubts of it the ladies of south hatboro who declared to a woman that they had never believed it respected the simple heart of a man who acknowledged that he had never questioned it such a man was not one to cheat his customers in quantity or quality that stood to reason his faith restored him to the esteem of many  mr gerrish was very bitter about the double fraud which he said northwick had practised on the community in having allowed the rumor of his death to gain currency he denounced him to mrs munger making an early errand from south hatboro to the village to collect public opinion as a person who had put himself beyond the pale of public confidence and whose professions of repentance for the past and good intention for the future he tore to shreds it is said and i have no question correctly that hell is paved with good intentionsif you will excuse me mrs munger when mr northwick brings forth fruits meet for repentancewhen he makes the first payment to his creditorsi will believe that he is sorry for what he has done and not till then  that is true said mrs munger i wonder what mr putney will have to say to all this can he feel that his skirts are quite clean acting that way as the family counsel of the northwicks after all he used to say against him  mr gerrish expressed his indifference by putting up a roll of muslin on the shelf while he rejoined i care very little for the opinions of mr putney on any subject  in some places mrs munger encountered a belief which she did not discourage that the northwick girls had known all along that their father was alive and had been in communication with him through putney most probably in the light of this conjecture the lawyers character had a lurid effect which it did not altogether lose when jack wilmington said bluntly what of it hes their counsel hes not obliged to give the matter away hes obliged to keep it  but isnt it very inconsistent mrs munger urged after all he used to say against mr northwick  i suppose its a professional not a personal matter said wilmington  and then their putting on mourning just think of it mrs munger appealed to mrs wilmington who was listening to her nephews savagery of tone and phrase with the lazy pleasure she seemed always to feel in it  yes do you suppose they meant it for a blind  why thats what people think now dont they  oh i dont know what do you think jack  i think theyre a pack of fools he blurted out like a man who avenges on the folly of others the hurt of his own conscience he cast a look of brutal contempt at mrs munger who said she thought so too  it is too bad the way people allow themselves to talk she went on to be sure sue northwick has never done anything to make herself loved in hatboronot among the ladies at least  mrs wilmington gave a spluttering laugh and said and i suppose its the ladies who allow themselves to talk as they do i cant get the men in my family to say a word against her  jack scowled his blackest it would be a pitiful scoundrel that did her misfortunes ought to make her sacred to every one that has the soul of a man  well so it does that is just what i was saying the trouble is that they dont make her sacred to every one that has the soul of a woman mrs wilmington teased  i know it doesnt jack returned in helpless scorn as he left mrs munger alone to his aunt  do you suppose he still cares anything for her mrs munger asked with cosey confidentiality  who knows mrs wilmington rejoined indolently it would be very poetical wouldnt it if he were to seize the opportunity to go back to her  beautiful sighed mrs munger i do like a manly man  she drove home through the village slowly hoping for a chance of a further interchange of conjectures and impressions but she saw no one she had not already talked with till she met dr morrell driving out of the avenue from his house she promptly set her phaeton across the road so that he could not get by if he were rude enough to wish it  doctor she called out what do you think of this extraordinary letter of mr northwicks  dr morrells boyish eyes twinkled you mean that letter in the events do you think northwick wrote it  why dont you doctor she questioned back with a note of personal grievance in her voice  im not very well acquainted with his style then you think he did write it of course there are always various opinions but i understood you thought he was burned in that accident last winter  now doctor said mrs munger with the pout which putney said always made him want to kill her youre just trying to tease me i know you are im going to drive right in and see mrs morrell she will tell me what you think  i dont believe you can see her said the doctor she isnt at all well  oh im sorry for that i dont understand what excuse she has though with a physician for her husband you must turn homoeopathy dr morrell do you think its true that jack wilmington will offer himself to sue northwick now that its come to the worst with her wouldnt it be romantic  very said the doctor he craned his head out of the buggy as if to see whether he could safely drive into the ditch and pass mrs munger he said politely as he started dont disturb yourself i can get by  she sent a wail of reproach after him and then continued toward south hatboro as she passed the lodge at the gate of the northwick avenue where the sisters now lived she noted that the shades were closely drawn they were always drawn on the side toward the street but mrs munger thought it interesting that she had never noticed it before and in the dearth of material she made the most of it both for her own emotion and for the sensation of others when she reached south hatboro  behind the drawn shades that mrs munger noted adeline northwick sat crying over the paper that elbridge newton had pushed under the door that morning it was limp from the nervous clutch and tremor of her hands and wet with her tears but she kept reading her fathers letter in it and trying to puzzle out of it some hope or help he must be crazy he must be crazy she moaned more to herself than to suzette who sat rigidly and silently by he couldnt have been so cruel if he had been in his right mind he couldnt he was always so good to us and so thoughtful he must have known that we had given him up for dead long ago and he has let us go on grieving for him all this time its just as if he had come back from death and the first he did was to tell us that everything they said against him was true and that everything we said and believed was all wrong how could he do it how could he do it we bore to think he was dead yes we bore that and we didnt complain but this is more than any one can ask us to bear oh suzette what can we say now what can we say after hes confessed himself that he took the money and that he has got part of it yet but i know he didnt i know he hasnt hes crazy oh poor poor father dont you think he must be crazy and where is he why dont he write to us and tell us what he wants us to do does he think we would tell any one where he was that shows hes out of his mind i always thought that if he could come back to life somehow hed prove that they had lied about him and now oh it isnt as if it were merely the company that was concerned or what people said but its as if our own father that we trusted so much had broken his word to us that is what kills me  the day passed they sent mrs newton away when she came to help them at dinner they locked their doors and shut themselves in from the world as mourners do with death adelines monologue went on with the brief responses which she extorted from suzette and at last it ceased as if her heart had worn itself out in the futile repetition of its griefs  then suzette broke her silence with words that seemed to break from it of themselves in their abrupt irrelevance to what adeline had last said we must give it up  give what up adeline groaned back  the houseand the farmand this hovel everything it isnt ours  not ours  no that letter makes it theirsthe peoples whose money he took we must send for mr putney and tell him to give it to them he will know how  adeline looked at her sisters face in dismay she gasped out why but mr putney says its ours and nobody can touch it  that was before now it is theirs and if we kept it from them we should be stealing it how do we know that father had any right to give it to us when he did  suzette  i keep thinking such things and i had better say them unless i want to go out of my senses once i would have died before i gave it up because he left it to us and now it seems as if i couldnt live till i gave it up because he left it to us no i can never forgive him if he is my father i can never speak to him again or see him never he is dead to me now  the words seemed to appeal to the contrarymindedness that lurks in such natures as adelines why i dont see what there is so wrong about fathers letter she began it just shows what i always said that his mind was affected by his business troubles and that he wandered away because he couldnt get them straight and now its preyed so upon him that hes beginning to believe the things they say are true and to blame himself thats the way i look at it  adeline suzette commanded with a kind of shriek be still you know you dont believe that  adeline hesitated between her awe of her sister and her wish to persist in a theory which now that she had formulated it for suzettes confusion she found effective for her own comfort she ventured at last it is what i said the first thing and i shall always say it suzette and i have a right  say what you please i shall say nothing but this property doesnt belong to us till father comes back to prove it  comes back adeline gasped why theyll send him to states prison  they wont send him to states prison if hes innocent and if he isnt  suzette dont you dare  but that has nothing to do with it we must give up what doesnt belong to us will you go for mr putney or shall i go im not afraid to be seen if you dont like to go i can hold up my head before the whole world now i know what we ought to do and were going to do it but if we kept this place after that letter i couldnt even look you in the face again she continued to adelines silence why we neednt either of us go i can get elbridge to go she made as if to leave the room  wait i cant let youyet i havent thought it out said adeline  not thought it out suzette went back and stood over her where she sat in her rockingchair  no said adeline shrinking from her fierce look but with a gathering strength of resistance in her heart because youve been thinking of it you expect me to do what you say in an instant the place was mothers and when she died it came to me and i hold it in trust for both of us thats what mr putney says even supposing that father did use their moneyand i dont believe he didi dont see why i should give up mothers property to them she waited a moment before she said and i wont  is half of it mine asked suzette  i dont know yes i suppose so  im of age and i shall give up my half im going to send for mr putney she went out of the room and came back with her hat and gloves on and her jacket over her arm she had never been so beautiful or so terrible listen to me adeline she said im going out to send elbridge for mr putney and when he comes i am not going to have any squabbling before him you can do what you please with your half of the property but im going to give up my half to the company now if you dont promise youll freely consent to what i want to do with my own i will never come back to this house or ever see you again or speak to you do you promise  oh well i promise said adeline forlornly with a weak dribble of tears you can take your half of the place that mother owned and give it to the men that are trying to destroy fathers character but i shall never say that i wanted you should do it  so that you dont say anything against it i dont care what else you say suzette put on her jacket and stood buttoning it at her soft throat i do it and i do it for mothers sake and for fathers i care as much for them as you do  in the evening putney came and she told him she wished him to contrive whatever form was necessary to put her fathers creditors in possession of her half of the estate my sister doesnt feel as i do about it she ended she thinks they have no right to it and we ought to keep it but she has agreed to let me give my half up  putney went to the door and threw out the quid of tobacco which he had been absently chewing upon while she spoke you know he explained that the creditors have no more claim on this estate in law than they have on my house and lot  i dont know i dont care for the law  the case isnt altered at all you know by the fact that your father is still living and your title isnt affected by any of the admissions made in the letter he has published  i understand that said the girl  well said putney i merely wanted to make sure you had all the bearings of the case the thing can be done of course theres nothing to prevent any one giving any one else a piece of property  he remained silent for a moment as if doubtful whether to say more and adeline asked and do you believe that if we were to give up the property theyd let father come back  putney could not control a smile at her simplicity the creditors have got nothing to do with that miss northwick your father has been indicted and hes in contempt of court as long as he stays away there cant be any question of mercy till he comes back for trial  but if he came back she persisted our giving up the property would make them easier with him  a corporation has no bowels of compassion miss northwick i shouldnt like to trust one the company has no legal claim on the estate unless you think it has a moral claim youd better hold on to your property  and do you think it has a moral claim  putney drew a long breath well thats a nice question he stroked his trousers down over his little thin leg as he sat i have some peculiar notions about corporations i dont think a manufacturing company is a benevolent institution exactly it isnt even a sanitarium it didnt come for its health it came to make money and it makes it by a profit on the people who do its work and the people who buy its wares practically its just like everything else that earns its bread by the sweat of its capitalneither better nor worse launched in this direction putney recalled himself with an effort from the prospect of an irrelevant excursion in the fields of speculative economy but as i understand the question is not so much whether the ponkwasset mills have a moral claim as whether you have a moral obligation and there i cant advise you would have to go to a clergyman i can only say that if the property were mine i should hold on to it and let the company be damned or whatever could happen to a body that hadnt a soul for that purpose  putney thrust his hand into his pocket for his tobacco and then recollected himself and put it back  there suzette said adeline  suzette had listened in a restive silence while putney was talking with her sister she said in answer to him i dont want advice about that i wished to know whether i could give up my part of the estate to the company and if you would do it for me at once  oh certainly said putney i will go down to boston tomorrow morning and see their attorney  their attorney i thought you would have to go to mr hilary  he would send me to their lawyer i suppose but i can go to him first if you wish  yes i do wish it said the girl i dont understand about the company and i dont care for it i want to offer the property to mr hilary dont say anything but just that i wished to give it up and my sister consented dont say a single word more no matter what he asks you will you  i will do exactly what you say answered putney but you understand i suppose dont you that in order to make the division the whole place must be sold  suzette looked at him in surprise adeline wailed out the whole place sold  yes how else could you arrive at the exact value  i will keep the house and the grounds and suzette may have the farm  putney shook his head i dont believe it could be done perhaps  well then said adeline i will never let the place be sold in the world i she caught suzettes eye and faltered and then went on piteously i didnt know what we should have to do when i promised but ill keep my promise yes i will we neednt sign the papers tonight need we mr putney itll do in the morning  oh yes just as well said putney itll take a little time to draw up the writings  but you can send word to mr hilary at once suzette asked  oh yes if you wish  i do  it wont be necessary  i wish it  since the affair must so soon be known to everybody putney felt justified in telling his wife when he went home if that poor old girl freely consented it must have been at the point of the hairpin of course the young one is right to obey her conscience but as a case of conscience what do you think of it ellen and do you think one ought to make any one else obey ones conscience  thats a hard question ralph and im not sure that shes right why should she give up her property if it was hers so long ago before the frauds began suppose he were not their father and the case stood just as it does  ah theres something very strange about the duty of blood  blood i think suzette northwicks case of conscience is a case of pride said mrs putney i dont believe she cares anything about the right and wrong of it she just wishes to stand well before the world she would do anything for that shes as hard  thats what the world will say ive no doubt putney admitted     x   the next morning adeline came early to her sisters bed and woke her i havent slept all nighti dont see how you couldand i want you shouldnt let mr putney send that letter to mr hilary just yet i want to think it over first  you want to break your promise asked suzette wide awake at the first word  adeline began to cry i want to think it seems such a dreadful thing to sell the place and why need you hurry to send off a letter to mr hilary about it wont it be time enough when mr putney has the writings ready i think it will look very silly to send word beforehand i could see that mr putney didnt think it was businesslike  you want to break your promise suzette repeated  no i dont want to break my promise but i do want to do whats right and i want to do what i think is right im almost sick i want elbridge should stop for the doctor on his way to mr putneys she broke into a convulsive sobbing oh suzette do give me a little more time wont you and as soon as i can see it as you do  they heard the rattling of a key in the back door of the cottage and they knew it was elbridge coming to make the fire in the kitchen stove as he always did against the time his wife should come to get breakfast suzette started up from her pillow and pulled adelines face down on her neck so as to smother the sound of her sobs hush dont let him hear and i wouldnt let any one know for the world that we didnt agree you can think it over all day if you want and ill stop mr putney from writing till you think as i do but be still now  yes yes i will adeline whispered back and i wont quarrel with you sue i know we shall think alike in the end only dont hurry me and let elbridge get the doctor to come im afraid im going to be down sick  she crept sighing back to bed and after a little while suzette came dressed to look after her i think im going to get a little sleep now she said but dont forget to stop mr putney  suzette went out into the thin sweet summer morning air and walked up and down the avenue between the lodge and the empty mansion she had not slept either it was from her first drowse that adeline had wakened her but she was young and the breath of the cool southwest wind was a bath of rest to her fevered senses she felt herself grow stronger in it and she tried to think what she ought to do if her purpose of the day before still seemed so wholly and perfectly just it seemed very difficult and she began to ask herself whether she had a right to compel adelines consent to it she felt the perplexities of the world where good and evil are often so mixed that when the problem passes from thoughts to deeds the judgment is darkened and the will palsied till now the wrong had always appeared absolutely apart from the right for the first time she perceived that a great right might involve a lesser wrong and she was daunted but she meant to fight out her fight wholly within herself before she spoke with adeline again  that day matt hilary came over from his farm to see wade whom he found as before in his study at the church and disposed to talk over northwicks letter its a miserable affair humiliating heartsickening that poor souls juggle with his conscience is a most pathetic spectacle i cant bring myself to condemn him very fiercely but while others may make allowance for him its ruinous for him to excuse himself thats truly perdition dont you feel that wade asked  yes yes matt assented with a kind of absence but there is something else i wanted to speak with you about and i suppose its this letter thats made it seem rather urgent now you know when i asked you once about jack wilmington  wade shook his head there isnt the least hope in that direction im sure there isnt if he had cared anything for the girl he would have shown it long ago  i quite agree with you said matt and that isnt what i mean but if it would have been right and well for him to come forward at such a time why shouldnt some other man who does love her he hurried tremulously on wade let me ask you one thing more you have seen her so much more than i and i didnt knowis it possibleperhaps i ought to ask if you are at allif you care for her  for miss northwick what an idea not the least in the world why do you ask  because i do said matt i care everything for her so much that when i thought of my love for her i could not bear that it should be a wrong to any living soul or that it should be a shadows strength between her and any possible preference and i came here with my mind made up that if you thought jack wilmington had still some right to a hearing from her i would stand back if there were any hopes for him from himself or from her i should be a fool not to stand back and i thoughti thought that if you old fellowbut now its all rightall right  matt wrung the hand which wade yielded him with a dazed air at first a great many things went through wades mind which he silenced on their way to his lips it would not do to impart to matt the impressions of a cold and arrogant nature which the girl had sometimes given him and which matt could not have received in the times of trouble and sorrow when he had chiefly seen her matts confession was a shock wade was scarcely less dismayed by the complications which it suggested but he could no more impart his misgivings than his impressions he could no more tell matt that his father would be embarrassed and compromised by his passion than he could tell him that he did not think sue northwick was worthy of it he was in the helpless predicament that confidants often find themselves in but his final perception of his impossibilities enabled him to return the fervid pressure of matts hand and even to utter some of those incoherencies which serve the purpose when another wishes to do the talking  of course said matt im ridiculous i know that i havent got anything to found my hopes on but the fact that theres nothing in my way to the one insuperable obstacle to the fact that she doesnt and cant really care a straw for me but just now that seems a mere bagatelle he laughed with a nervous joy and he kept talking as he walked up and down wades study i dont know that i have the hope of anything and i dont see how im to find out whether i have or not for the present you know wade he went on with a simplehearted sweetness which wade found touching im twentyeight years old and i dont believe ive ever been in love before little fancies of course summer flirtations every one has them but never anything serious anything like this and i could see at home that they would be glad to have had me married i rather think my father believes that a good sensible wife would bring me back to faith in commercial civilization he laughed out his relish of the notion but went on gravely poor father this whole business has been a terrible trial to him  wade wondered at his ability to separate the thought of suzette from the thought of her father he inferred from his ability to do so that he must have been thinking of her a great deal but he asked isnt it all rather sudden matt wade put on a sympathetic yet diplomatic smile for the purpose of this question  not for me said matt he added not very consequently i suppose it must have happened to me the first moment i saw her here that day louise and i came up about the accident i couldnt truly say that she had ever been out of my mind a moment since no theres nothing sudden about it though i dont suppose these things usually take a great deal of time matt ended philosophically  wade left the dangerous ground he found himself on he asked and your family do they know of yourfeeling  not in the least matt answered radiantly it will come on them like a thunderclap if it ever comes on them at all he added despondently  wade had his own belief that there was no cause for despondency in the aspect of the affair that matt was looking at but he could not offer to share his security with matt who continued to look serious and said presently i suppose my father might think it complicated his relation to the northwicks trouble and i have thought that too it makes it very difficult my father is to be considered you know wade i think there are very few men like my father  there are none matt said wade  i dont mean hes perfect and i think his ideas are wrong most of them but his conduct is as right as the conduct of any quicktempered man ever was in the world i know him and i dont believe a son ever loved his father more and so i want to consider him all i can  ah i know that my dear fellow  but the question is how far can i consider him there are times said matt and he reddened and laughed consciously when it seems as if i couldnt consider him at all the times when i have some faint hope that she will listen to me or wont think me quite a brute to speak to her of such a thing at such a moment then there are other times when i think he ought to be considered to the extreme of giving her up altogether but those are the times when i know that i shall never have her to give up then its an easy sacrifice  i understand said wade responding with a smile to matts selfsatire  matt went on and as he talked he sometimes walked to wades window and looked out sometimes he stopped and confronted him across his desk its cowardly in a way not to speak at onceto leave her to suffer it out to the end alone but i think thats what i owe to my father no real harm can come to her from waiting i risk the unfair chance i might gain by speaking now when she sorely needs help but if ever she came to think she had given herself through that needno it wouldnt do my father can do more for her if he isnt hampered by my feeling and louise can be her friendwhat do you think wade ive tried to puzzle it out and this is the conclusion ive come to is it rather coldblooded i know it isnt at all like the lovemaking in the books i suppose i ought to go and fling myself at her feet in defiance of all the decencies and amenities and obligations of life but somehow i cant bring myself to do it ive thought it all conscientiously over and i think i ought to wait  i think so too matt i think your decision is a just mans and its a true lovers too it does your heart as much honor as your head and wade gave him his hand now with no mental reservation  do you really think so caryl that makes me very happy i was afraid it might look calculating and selfinterested  you selfinterested matt  oh i know but is it considering my duty too much my love too little if i love her hasnt she the first claim upon me before father and mother brother and sister before all the world  if you are sure she loves you yes  matt laughed ah thats true i hadnt thought of that little condition perhaps it changes the whole situation well i must go now ive just run over from the farm to see you  i inferred that from your peasant garb said wade with a smile at the rough farm suit matt had on his face refined it and made it look mildly improbable besides said wade as if the notion he recurred to were immediately relevant to matts dress unless you are perfectly sure of yourself beyond any chance of change you owe it to her as well as yourself to take time before speaking  i am perfectly sure and i shall never change said matt with a shade of displeasure at the suggestion if there were nothing but that i should not take a moment of time he relented and smiled again in adding but i have decided now and i shall wait and im very much obliged to you old fellow for talking the matter over with me and helping me to see it in the right light  oh my dear matt said wade in deprecation  yes and oh by the way ive got hold of a young fellow that i think you could do something for wade do you happen to remember the article on the defalcation in the boston abstract  yes i do remember that didnt it treat the matter if i recall it very humanelytoo humanely perhaps  perhaps from one point of view too humanely well its the writer of that articlea young fellow not twentyfive yet as completely at odds with life as any one i ever saw he has a great deal of talent and no health or money so hes toiling feebly for a living on a daily newspaper instead of making literature he was a reporter up to the time he wrote that article but the managing editor is a man who recognizes quality hes fond of maxwellthats the fellows nameand since then hes given him a chance in the office at social topics but he hasnt done very well the fact is the boys too literary and hes out of health and he needs rest and the comfort of appreciative friendship i want you to meet him ive got him up at my place out of the east winds youll be interested in him as a typethe artistic type cynicised by the hard conditions of lifenewspaper conditions and then economic conditions  matt smiled with satisfaction in what he felt to be his very successful formulation of maxwell  wade said he should be very glad to meet him and if he could be of any use to him he should be even more glad but his mind was still upon matts love affair and as they wrung each others hands once more he said i think youve decided so wisely matt and justly and unselfishly  its involuntary unselfishness if its unselfishness at all said matt he did not go wade stood bareheaded with him at the outer door of his study after awhile he said with embarrassment wade do you think it would seem unfeelingor out of taste at allif i went to see her at such a time  why i cant imagine your doing anything out of taste matt  dont be so smooth caryl you know what i mean louise sent some messages by me to her will you take them or  i certainly see no reason why you shouldnt deliver miss hilarys messages yourself  well i do said matt but you neednt be afraid     xi   matt took the lower road that wound away from wades church toward the northwick place but as he went he kept thinking that he must not really try to see suzette it would be monstrous at such a time out of all propriety of all decency it would be taking advantage of her helplessness to intrude upon her the offer of help and of kindness which every instinct of her nature must revolt from there was only one thing that could justify his coming and that was impossible unless he came to tell her that he loved her and to ask her to let him take her burden upon him to share her shame and her sorrow for his loves sake he had no right to see her at moments it seemed as if that were right and he could do it no matter how impossible and then he almost ran forward but only to check himself to stop short and doubt whether not to turn back altogether by such faltering progresses he found himself in the northwick avenue at last and keeping doggedly on from the mansion which the farm road had brought him to until he reached the cottage at the avenue gate on the threshold drooped a figure that the sight of set his heart beating with a stifling pulse in his throat and he floundered on till he made out that this languid figure was adeline he could have laughed at the irony the mockery of the anticlimax if it had not been for the face that the old maid turned upon him at the approach of his footfalls and the pleasure that lighted up its pathos when she recognized him  oh mr hilary she said and then she could not speak for the twitching of her lips and the trembling of her chin  he took her hand in silence and it seemed natural for him to do that reverent and tender thing which is no longer a part of our custom he bent over it and kissed the chill bony knuckles  she drew her hand away to find her handkerchief and wipe her tears i suppose youve come to see suzette but shes gone up to the village to talk with mr putney hes our lawyer  yes said matt  i presume i dont need to talk to you about thatletter i thinkand i believe suzette will think so too in the endthat his mind is affected and he just accuses himself of all these things because theyve been burnt into it so how are your father and mother and your sister  she broke off with these questions he could see to stay herself in what she wished to say they are all well father is still in boston but mother and louise are at the farm with me they sent their love and they are anxious to know if there is anything  thank you will you sit down here its so close indoors she made room for him on the threshold but he took the step below  i hope miss suzette is well  why thank you not very well there isnt anything really the matter but we didnt either of us sleep very well last night we were excited i dont know as i ought to tell you she began i dont suppose its a thing you would know about any way but ive got to talk to somebody  miss northwick said matt if there is anything in the world that i can do for you or that you even hope i can do i beg you to let me hear it i should be glad beyond all words to help you  oh i dont know as anything can be done she began after the fresh gush of tears which were her thanks but suzette and i have been talking it over a good deal and we thought we would like to see your father about it you see suzette cant feel right about our keeping the place here if fathers really done what he says hes done we dont believe he has but if he has he has got to be found somewhere and made to give up the money he says he has got suzette thinks we ought to give up the money we have got in the bankfifteen hundred or two thousand dollarsand she wanted i should let her give up her half of the place here and at first i did say she might but come to find out from mr putney the whole place would have to be sold before it could be divided and i couldnt seem to let it that was what wedisputed about yes we had a dispute but its all right now or it will be when we get the company to say they will stop the lawsuit against father if he will give up the money hes got and we will give up the place mr putney seemed to think the company couldnt stop it but i dont see why a rich corporation like that couldnt do almost anything it wanted to with its money  her innocent corruption did not shock matt nor her scheme for defeating justice but he smiled forlornly at the hopelessness of it im afraid mr putney is right he was silent and then at the despair that came into her face he hurried on to say but i will see my father miss northwick i will go down to see him at once and if anything can be honorably and fairly done to save your father i am sure he will try to do it for your sake but dont expect anything he said getting to his feet and putting out his hand to her  no no i wont she said with gratitude that wrung his heart andwont you wait and see suzette  matt reddened no i think not now but perhaps i will come back andandi will come soon again goodby  mr hilary she called after him he ran back to her ifif your father dont think anything can be done i dont want he should say anything about it  oh no certainly not  and mr hilary dont you let suzette know i spoke to you ill tell her  why of course  on his way to boston the affair seemed to grow less and less impossible to matt but he really knew nothing of the legal complications and when he proposed it to his father old hilary shook his head i dont believe it could be done the mans regularly indicted and hes in contempt of court as long as he doesnt present himself for trial thats the way i understand it but ill see our counsel whose scheme is this  i dont know miss northwick told me of it but i fancied miss suzette  yes said hilary it must have cost her almost her life to give up her faith in that pitiful rascal  but after she had done that it would cost her nothing to give up the property and as i understood miss northwick that was her sisters first impulse she wished to give up her half of the estate unconditionally but miss northwick wouldnt consent and they compromised on the conditions she told me of  well said hilary i think miss northwick showed the most sense but of course sues a noble girl she almost transfigures that old scoundrel of a father of hers that fellowjack wilmingtonought to come forward now and show himself a man if he is one any man might be proud of such a girls loveand they say she was in love with him but he seems to have preferred to dangle after his uncles wife he isnt good enough for her and probably he always knew it  matt profited by the musing fit that came upon his father to go and look at the picture over the mantel it was not a new picture but he did not feel that he was using his father quite frankly and he kept looking at it for that reason  if those poor creatures gave up their property what would they do theyve absolutely nothing else in the world  i fancy said matt that isnt a consideration that would weigh with suzette northwick  no if theres anything in heredity the father of such a girl must have some good in him of course they wouldnt be allowed to suffer  do you mean that the company would regard the fact that it had no legal claim on the property and would recognize it in their behalf  the company hilary roared the company has no right to that property moral or legal but we should act as if we had if it were unconditionally offered to us we ought to acknowledge it as an act of charity to us and not of restitution but every man jack of us would hold out for a right to it that didnt exist and we should take it as part of our due and i should be such a coward that i couldnt tell the board what i thought of our pusillanimity  it seems rather hard for men to act magnanimously in a corporate capacity or even humanely said matt but i dont know but there would be an obscure and negative justice in such action it would be right for the company to accept the property if it was right for northwicks daughter to offer it and i think it is most unquestionably right for her to do that  do you matt well well said hilary willing to be comforted perhaps youre right you must send louise and your mother over to see her  well perhaps not just now shes proud and sensitive and perhaps it might seem intrusive at this juncture  intrusive nonsense shell be glad to see them send them right over  matt knew this was his fathers way of yielding the point and he went away with his promise to say nothing of the matter they had talked of till he heard from putney after that would be time enough to ascertain the whereabouts of northwick which no one knew yet not even his own children  what his father had said in praise of suzette gave his love for her unconscious approval but at the same time it created a sort of comedy situation and matt was as far from the comic as he hoped he was from the romantic in his mood when he thought of going direct to her he hated to be going like the hero of a novel to offer himself to the heroine at the moment her fortunes were darkest but he knew that he was only like that outwardly and inwardly was simply and humbly her lover who wished in any way or any measure he might to be her friend and helper he thought he might put his offer in some such form as would leave her free to avail herself a little if not much of his longing to comfort and support her in her trial but at last he saw that he could do nothing for the present and that it would be cruel and useless to give her more than the tried help of a faithful friend he did not go back to hatboro as he longed to do he went back to his farm and possessed his soul in such patience as he could     xii   suzette came back from putneys office with such a disheartened look that adeline had not the courage to tell her of matts visit and the errand he had undertaken for her the lawyer had said no more than that he did not believe anything could be done he was glad they had decided not to transfer their property to the company without first trying to make interest for their father with it that was their right and their duty and he would try what could be done but he warned suzette that he should probably fail  and then what did he think we ought to do adeline asked  he didnt say suzette answered  i presume adeline went on after a little pause that you would like to give up the property anyway well you can do it suzette the joy she might have expected did not show itself in her sisters face and she added ive thought it all over and i see it as you do now only she quavered i do want to do all i can for poor father first  yes said suzette spiritlessly mr putney said we ought  sue said adeline after another little pause i dont know what youll think of me for what ive done mr hilary has been here  mr hilary  yes he came over from his farm  oh i thought you meant his father the color began to mount into the girls cheeks  louise and mrs hilary sent their love and they all want to do anything they can andand i told mr hilary what we were going to try andhe said he would speak to his father about it andoh suzette im afraid ive done more than i ought  suzette was silent and then no she said i cant see what harm there could be in it  he said adeline pursued with joyful relief he wouldnt let his father speak to the rest about it till we were ready and i know hell do all he can for us dont you  sue answered i dont see what harm it can do for him to speak to his father i hope adeline she added with the severity adeline had dreaded you didnt ask it as a favor from him  no no i didnt indeed sue it came naturally he offered to do it  well said suzette with a sort of relaxation and she fell back in the chair where she had been sitting  i dont see said adeline with an anxious look at the girls worn face but what wed both better have the doctor  ah the doctor cried suzette what can the doctor do for troubles like ours she put up her hands to her face and bowed herself on them and sobbed with the first tears she had shed since the worst had come upon them  the companys counsel submitted putneys overtures as he expected to the states attorney in the hypothetical form and the states attorney as putney expected dealt with the actuality he said that when northwicks friends communicated with him and ascertained his readiness to surrender the money he had with him and to make restitution in every possible way it would be time to talk of a nolle prosequi in the meantime by the fact of absconding he was in contempt of court he must return and submit himself for trial and take the chance of a merciful sentence  there could be no other answer he said and he could give none for putney to carry back to the defaulters daughters  suzette received it in silence as if she had nerved herself up to bear it so adeline had faltered between her hopes and fears but she had apparently decided how she should receive the worst if the worst came  well then she said we must give up the place you can get the papers ready mr putney  i will do whatever you say miss northwick  yes and i dont want you to think that i dont want to do it its my doing now and if my sister was all against it i should wish to do it all the same  matt hilary learned from his father the result of the conference with the states attorney and he came up to hatboro the next day to see putney on his fathers behalf and to express the wish of his family that mr putney would let them do anything he could think of for his clients he got his message out bunglingly with embarrassed circumlocution and repetition but this was what it came to in the end  putney listened with sarcastic patience shifting the tobacco in his mouth from one thin cheek to the other and letting his fierce blue eyes burn on matts kindly face  well sir he said what do you think can be done for two women brought up as ladies who choose to beggar themselves  is it so bad as that matt asked  why you can judge for yourself my present instructions are to make their whole estate over to the ponkwasset mills company  but i thoughti thought they might have something besidessomething  there was a little money in the bank that northwick placed there to their credit when he went away but ive had their instructions to pay that over to your company too i suppose they will accept it  it isnt my company said matt ive nothing whatever to do with itor any company but ive no doubt theyll accept it  they cant do otherwise said the lawyer with a humorous sense of the predicament twinkling in his eyes and that will leave my clients just nothing in the world until mr northwick comes home with that fortune he proposes to make in the meantime they have their chance of starving to death or living on charity and i dont believe said putney breaking down with a laugh theyve the slightest notion of doing either  matt stood appalled at the prospect which the brute terms brought before him he realized that after all there is no misery like that of want and that yonder poor girl had chosen something harder to bear than her fathers shame  of course he said they mustnt be allowed to suffer we shall count upon you to see that nothing of that kind happens you can contrive somehow not to let them know that they are destitute  why said putney putting his leg over the back of a chair into its seat for his greater ease in conversation i could if i were a lawyer in a novel but what do you think i can do with two women like these who follow me up every inch of the way and want to know just what i mean by every step i take youre acquainted with miss suzette i suppose  yes said matt consciously  well do you suppose that such a girl as that when she had made up her mind to starve wouldnt know what you were up to if you pretended to have found a lot of money belonging to her under the cupboard  the company must do something said matt desperately they have no claim on the property none whatever  now youre shouting putney put a comfortable mass of tobacco in his mouth and began to work his jaws vigorously upon it  they mustnt take itthey wont take it cried matt  putney laughed scornfully     xiii   matt made his way home to his farm by a tiresome series of circuitous railroad connections across country he told his mother of the new shape the trouble of the northwicks had taken and asked her if she could not go to see them and find out some way to help them  louise wished to go instantly to see them she cried out over the noble action that suzette wished to do she knew it was all suzette  yes it is noble said mrs hilary but i almost wish she wouldnt do it  why mamma  it complicates matters they could have gone on living there very well as they were and the company doesnt need it but now where will they go what will become of them  louise had not thought of that and she found it shocking  i suppose matt said that the company would let them stay where they are for the present and that they wont be actually houseless but they propose now to give up the money that their father left for their support till he could carry out the crazy schemes for retrieving himself that he speaks of in his letter and then they will have nothing to live on  i knew suzette would do that said louise before that letter came out she always said that her father never did what the papers said but that cut the ground from under her feet and such a girl could have no peace till she had given up everythingeverything  something must be done said mrs hilary have theyhas suzetteany plans  none but that of giving up the little money they have left in the bank said matt forlornly  well mrs hilary commented with a sort of magisterial authority theyve all managed as badly as they could  well mother they hadnt a very hopeful case to begin with said matt and louise smiled  i suppose your poor father is worried almost to death about it mrs hilary pursued  he was annoyed but i couldnt see that he had lost his appetite i dont think that even his worriment is the first thing to be considered though  no of course not matt i was merely trying to think i dont know just what we can offer to do but we must find out yes we must go and see them they dont seem to have any one else it is very strange that they should have no relations they can go to mrs hilary meditated upon a hardship which she seemed to find personal well we must try what we can do she said relentingly after a moments pause  they talked the question of what she could do futilely over and at the end mrs hilary said i will go there in the morning and i think i shall go from there to boston and try to get your father off to the shore  oh said louise  yes i dont like his being in town so late  poor papa did he look very much wasted away matt why dont you get him to come up here  hes been asked said matt  yes i know he hates the country louise assented she rose and went to the glass door standing open on the piazza where a syringa bush was filling the dull warm air with its breath we must all try to think what we can do for suzette  her mother looked at the doorway after she had vanished through it and listened a moment to her voice in talk with some one outside the two voices retreated together and louises laugh made itself heard farther off she is a light nature sighed mrs hilary  yes matt admitted thinking he would rather like to be of a light nature himself at that moment but i dont know that there is anything wrong in it it would do no good if she took the matter heavily  oh i dont mean the northwicks entirely said mrs hilary but she is so in regard to everything i know she is a good child but im afraid she doesnt feel things deeply matt i dont believe i like this protégé of yours  maxwell  yes hes too intense  arent you a little difficult mother matt asked you dont like louises lightness and you dont like maxwells intensity i think hell get over that hes sick poor fellow he wont be so intense when he gets better  oh yes very likely mrs hilary paused and then she added abruptly i hope louises sympathies will be concentrated on sue northwick for awhile now  i thought they were that already said matt im sure louise has shown herself anxious to be her friend ever since her troubles began i hadnt supposed she was so attached to herso constant  shes romantic but shes worldly she likes the world and its ways there never was a girl who liked better the pleasure the interest of the moment i dont say shes fickle but one thing drives another out of her mind she likes to live in a dream she likes to makebelieve just now shes all taken up with an idyllic notion of country life because shes here in june with that sick young reporter to patronize but shes the creature of her surroundings and as soon as she gets away shell be a different person altogether shes a strange contradiction mrs hilary sighed if she would only be entirely worldly it wouldnt be so difficult but when her mixture of unworldliness comes in its quite distracting she waited a moment as if to let matt ask her what she meant but he did not and she went on shes certainly not a simple characterlike sue northwick for instance  matt now roused himself is she a simple character he asked with a show of indifference  perfectly said his mother she always acts from pride that explains everything she does  i know she is proud matt admitted finding a certain comfort in openly recognizing traits in sue northwick that he had never deceived himself about he had a feeling too that he was behaving with something like the candor due his mother in saying i could imagine her being imperious even arrogant at times and certainly she is a wilful person but i dont see he added why we shouldnt credit her with something better than pride in what she proposes to do now  she has behaved very well said mrs hilary and much better than could have been expected of her fathers daughter  matt felt himself getting angry at this scanty justice but he tried to answer calmly surely mother there must be a point where the blame of the innocent ends i should be very sorry if you went to miss northwick with the idea that we were conferring a favor in any way it seems to me that she is indirectly putting us under an obligation which we shall find it difficult to discharge with delicacy  arent you rather fantastic matt  im merely trying to be just the company has no right to the property which she is going to give up  we are not the company  father is the president  well and he got mr northwick a chance to save himself and he abused it and ran away and if she is not responsible for her father why should you feel so for yours but i think you may trust me matt to do what is right and propereven what is delicatewith miss northwick  oh yes i didnt mean that  you said something like it my dear  then i beg your pardon mother i certainly wasnt thinking of her alone but she is proud and i hoped you would let her feel that we realize all that she is doing  im afraid said mrs hilary with a final sigh that if i were quite frank with her i should tell her she was a silly headstrong girl and i wished she wouldnt do it     xiv   the morning which followed was that of a warm lulling luxuriant june day whose high tides of life spread to everything maxwell felt them in his weak pulses where he sat writing at an open window of the farmhouse and early in the forenoon he came out on the piazza of the farmhouse with a cushion clutched in one of his lean hands his soft hatbrim was pulled down over his dull dreamy eyes where the faroff look of his thinking still lingered louise was in the hammock and she lifted herself alertly out of it at sight of him with a smile for his absent gaze  have you got through  ive got tired or rather ive got bored i thought i would go up to the camp  youre not going to lie on the ground there she asked with the importance and authority of a woman who puts herself in charge of a sick man as a woman always must when there is such a man near her  i would be willing to be under it such a day as this he said but ill take the shawl if thats what you mean i thought it was here  ill get it for you said louise and he let her go into the parlor and bring it out to him she laid it in a narrow fold over his shoulder he thanked her carelessly and she watched him sweep languidly across the buttercupped and dandelioned grass of the meadowland about the house to the dark shelter of the pine grove at the north the sun struck full upon the long levels of the boughs and kindled their needles to a glistening mass underneath the ground was red and through the warmlooking twilight of the sparse wood the gray canvas of a tent showed matt often slept there in the summer and so the place was called the camp there was a hammock between two of the trees just beyond the low stone wall and louise saw maxwell get into it  matt came out on the piazza in his blue woollen shirt and overalls and high boots and his cork helmet topping all  you look like a cultivated cowboy that had gobbled an english tourist matt said his sister have you got anything for me  matt had some letters in his hands which the man had just brought up from the postoffice no but there are two for maxwell  i will carry them to him if youre busy hes just gone over to the camp  well do said matt he gave them to her and he asked how do you think he is this morning  he must be pretty well hes been writing ever since breakfast  i wish he hadnt said matt he ought really to be got away somewhere out of the reach of newspapers ill see louise how do you think a girl like sue northwick would feel about an outright offer of help at such a time as this  how help its very difficult to help people said louise wisely especially when theyre not able to help themselves poor sue i dont know what she will do if jack wilmingtonbut he never really cared for her and now i dont believe she cares for him no it couldnt be  no the idea of love would be sickening to her now  louise opened her eyes why i dont know what you mean matt if she still cared for him i cant imagine any time when she would rather know that he cared for her  but her pridewouldnt she feel that she couldnt meet him on equal terms  oh pride stuff do you suppose that a girl who really cared for a person would think of the terms she met them on when it comes to such a thing as that there is no pride and proud girls and meek girls are just alikelike cats in the dark  do you think so asked matt the sunny glisten which had been wanting to them before came into his eyes  i know so said louise why do you think that jack wilmington still  no no i was just wondering i think i shall run down to boston tomorrow and see fatheror no mother wont be back till tomorrow evening well i will talk with you at dinner about it  matt went off to his mowing and louise heard the cackle of his machine before she reached the camp with maxwells letters  dont get up she called to him when he lifted himself with one arm at the stir of her gown over the pineneedles merely two letters that i thought perhaps you might want to see at once  he took them and glancing at one of them threw it out on the ground this is from ricker he said opening the other if youll excuse me and he began to read it well that is all right he said when he had run it through he can manage without me a little while longer but a few more days like this will put an end to my loafing i begin to feel like work for the first time since i came up here  the good air is beginning to tell said louise sitting down on the board which formed a bench between two of the trees fronting the hammock but if you hurry back to town now you will spoil everything you must stay the whole summer  you rich people are amusing said maxwell turning himself on his side and facing her you think poor people can do what they like  i think they can do what other people like said the girl if they will try what is to prevent your staying here till you get perfectly well  the uncertainty whether i shall ever get perfectly well for one thing said maxwell watching with curious interest the play of the light and shade flecks on her face and figure  i know you will get well if you stay she interrupted  and for another thing he went on the high and holy duty we poor people feel not to stop working for a living as long as we live its a caste pride poverty obliges as well as nobility  oh pshaw pride obliges too its your wicked pride youre worse than rich people as you call us a great deal prouder rich people will let you help them  so would poor people if they didnt need help you can take a gift if you dont need it you can accept an invitation to dinner if youre surfeited to loathing but you cant let any one give you a meal if youre hungry you rich people are like children compared with us poor folks you dont know life you dont know the world i should like to do a girl brought up like you in the ignorance and helplessness of riches  you would make me hateful  i would make you charming  well do me then  ah you wouldnt like it  why  becausei found it out in my newspaper work when i had to interview people and write them uppeople dont like to have the good points they have recognized they want you to celebrate the good points they havent got if a man is amiable and kind and has something about him that wins everybodys heart he wants to be portrayed as a very dignified and commanding character full of inflexible purpose and indomitable will  i dont see said louise why you think im weak and lowminded and undignified  maxwell laughed did i say something of that kind  you meant it  if ever i have to interview you i shall say that under a mask of apparent incoherency and irrelevance miss hilary conceals a profound knowledge of human nature and a gift of divination which explores the most unconscious opinions and motives of her interlocutor how would you like that  pretty well because i think its true but i shouldnt like to be interviewed  well youre safe from me my interviewing days are over i believe if i keep on getting better at the rate ive been going the last week i shall be able to write a play this summer besides doing my work for the abstract if i could do that and it succeeded the riddle would be read for me  what do you mean  i mean that i should have a handsome income and could give up newspaper work altogether  could you how glorious said louise with the sort of maternal sympathy she permitted herself to feel for the sick youth how much would you get for your play  if it was only reasonably successful it would be worth five or six thousand dollars a year  and is that a handsome income she asked with mounting earnestness  he pulled himself up in the hammock to get her face fully in view and asked how much do you think ive been able to average up to this time  i dont know im afraid i dont know at all about such things but i should like to  maxwell let himself drop back into the hammock i think i wont humiliate myself by giving the figures id better leave it to your imagination youll be sure to make it enough  why should you be ashamed of it if its ever so little she asked but i know its your pride its like sue northwick wanting to give up all her property because her father wrote that letter and said he had used the companys money and matt says it isnt his property at all and the company has no right to it if she gives it up she and her sister will have nothing to live on and they wont let themselves be helpedany more thanthanyou will  no we began with that people who need help cant let you help them dont they know where their father is  no but of course they must now before long  maxwell said after the silence that followed upon this i should like to have a peep into that mans soul  horrors why should you asked louise  it would be such splendid material if he is fond of his children  he and sue dote upon each other i dont see how she can endure him he always made me feel creepy  then he must have written that letter to conciliate public feeling and to make his children easier about him and his future and now if you could see him when he realizes that hes only brought more shame on them and forced them to beggar themselvesit would be a tremendous situation  but i shouldnt like to see him at such a time it seems to me thats worse than interviewing mr maxwell  there was a sort of recoil from him in her tone which perhaps he felt it seemed to interest rather than offend him you dont get the artistic point of view  i dont want to get it if thats it and if your play is going to be about any such thing as that  it isnt said maxwell i failed on that i shall try a comic motive  oh said louise in the concessive tone people use when they do not know but they have wronged some one she spiritually came back to him but materially she rose to go away and leave him she stooped for the letter he had dropped out of the hammock and gave it him dont you want this  oh thank you id forgotten it he glanced at the superscription its from pinney you ought to know pinney miss hilary if you want the true artistic point of view  is he a literary man  pinney did you read the account of the defalcation in the eventswhen it first came out all illustrations  that i dont wonder you didnt care to read his letter or perhaps hes your friend  pinneys everybodys friend said maxwell with an odd sort of relish hes delightful i should like to do pinney hes a type louise stood frowning at the mere notion of pinney hes not a bad fellow miss hilary though he is a remorseless interviewer he would be very good material he is a mixture of motives like everybody else but he has only one ambition he wants to be the greatest newspaper man of his generation the ladies nearly always like him he never lets five minutes pass without speaking of his wife hes so proud of her he cant keep still  i should think she would detest him  she doesnt shes quite as proud of him as he is of her its affecting to witness their devotionor it would be if it were not such a bore  i cant understand you said louise leaving him to his letter     xv   part of matt hilarys protest against the status in which he found himself a swell was to wash his face for dinner in a tin basin on the back porch like the farmhands when he was alone at the farm he had the hands eat with him when his mother and sister were visiting him he pretended that the table was too small for them all at dinner and tea though he continued to breakfast with the hands because the ladies were never up at his hour the hands knew well enough what it meant but they liked matt  louise found him at the rollertowel after his emblematic ablutions oh is it so near dinner she asked  yes where is maxwell  i left him up at the camp she walked a little way out into the groundivy that matted the backyard under the scattering spruce trees  matt followed and watched the homing and departing bees around the hives in the deep redclovered grass near the wall  those fellows will be swarming before long he said with a measure of the good comradeship he felt for all living things  i dont see said louise plucking a tender green shoot from one of the fir boughs overhead why mr maxwell is so hard  is he hard asked matt well perhaps he is  he is very sneering and bitter said the girl i dont like it  ah hes to blame for that matt said but as for his hardness that probably comes from his having had to make such a hard fight for what he wants to be in life that hardens people and brutalizes them but somehow we mostly admire them and applaud them for their success against odds if we had a true civilization a man wouldnt have to fight for the chance to do the thing he is fittest for that is to be himself but im glad you dont like maxwells hardness i dont myself  he seems to look upon the whole world as material as he calls it he doesnt seem to regard people as fellow beings as you do matt or even as servants or inferiors he hasnt so much kindness for them as that  well thats the odious side of the artistic nature said matt smiling tolerantly but hell probably get over that hes very young he thinks he has to be relentlessly literary now  hes older than i am said louise  he hasnt seen so much of the world  he thinks hes seen a great deal more i dont think hes half so nice as we supposed i should call him dangerous  oh i shouldnt say that exactly matt returned but he certainly hasnt our traditions ill just step over and call him to dinner  oh no let me try if i can blow the horn she ran to where the long tin tube hung on the porch and coming out with it again set it to her lips and evoked some stertorous and crumby notes from it do you suppose he saw me she asked running back with the horn  matt could not say but maxwell had seen her and had thought of a poem which he imagined illustrated with the figure of a tall beautiful girl lifting a long tin horn to her lips with outstretched arms he did not know whether to name it simply the dinner horn or grotesquely hebe calling the gods to nectar he debated the question as he came lagging over the grass with his cushion in one hand and pinneys letter still opened in the other he said to matt who came out to get the cushion of him heres something id like to talk over with you when youve the time  well after dinner said matt  pinneys letter was a long one written in pencil on one side of long slips of paper like printers copy the slips were each carefully folioed in the upper right hand corner but the language was the language of pinneys life and not the decorative diction which he usually addressed to the public on such slips of paper  i guess it began ive got onto the biggest thing yet maxwell the events is going to send me to do the social science congress which meets in quebec this year and im going to take mrs pinney along and have a good time shes got so she can travel firstrate now and the change will do her and the baby both good i shall interview the social science wiseacres and do their proceedings of course but the thing that im onto is northwick ive always felt that northwick kind of belonged to yours truly anyway i was the only man that worked him up in any sort of shape at the time the defalcation came out and ive got a little idea that i think will simply clean out all competition that letter of his set me to thinking as soon as i read it and my wife and i both happened on the idea at the same time clear case of telepathy our idea is that northwick didnt go to europeof course he didntbut hes just holding out for terms with the company i dont believe hes got off with much money but if he was going into business with it in canada he would have laid low till hed made his investments so my theory is that hes got all the money he took with him except his living expenses i believe i can find northwick and i am not going to come home without trying hard i am going to have a detectives legal outfit and i flatter myself i can get northwick over the frontier somehow and restore him to the arms of his anxious friends of the ponkwasset company i dont know yet just how i shall do it but i guess i shall do it i shall have mrs pinneys advice and counsel and shes a team but i shall have to leave her and the baby at quebec while im roaming round in rimouski and the wilderness generally and i shall need active help  now i liked some things in that abstract article of yours it was snappy and literary and all that and it showed grasp of the subject it showed a humane and merciful spirit toward our honored friend that could be made to tell in my little game if i could get the use of it so ive concluded to let you in on the ground floor if you want to go into the enterprise with me if you dont dont give it away thats all my idea is that northwick can be got at quicker by two than by one but we have not only got to get at him but we have got to get him and get him on this side of jordan i guess we shall have to do that by moral suasion mostly and thats where your massive and penetrating intellect will be right on deck you wont have to play a part either if you believe that his only chance of happiness on earth is to come home and spend the rest of his life in states prison you can conscientiously work him from that point of view seriously maxwell i think this is a great chance if theres any of that money he speaks of we shall have our pickings and then as a mere scoop if we get at northwick at all whether we can coax him over the line or not we will knock out the fellow that fired the ephesian dome so that hell never come to time in all eternity  i mean business maxwell i havent mentioned this to anybody but my wife yet and if you dont go in with me nobody shall i want you old boy and im willing to pay for you if this thing goes through i shall be in a position to name my own place and price on the events i expect to be managing editor before the years out and then i shall secure the best talent as leading writer which his name is brice e maxwell and dont you forget it  now you think it over maxwell theres no hurry take time weve got to wait till the soc sci congress meets anyway and weve got to let the professional pursuit die out this letter of northwicks will set a lot of detectives after him and if they cant find him or cant work him after theyve found him theyll get tired and give him up for a bad job then will be the time for the gifted amateur to step in and show what a free and untrammelled press can do to punish vice and reward virtue     xvi   maxwell explained to matt as he had explained to louise that pinney was the reporter who had written up the northwick case for the events he said after matt had finished reading the letter i thought you would like to know about this i dont regard pinneys claim on my silence where youre concerned in fact i dont feel bound to him anyway  thank you said matt then i suppose his proposal doesnt tempt you  why yes it does but not as he imagines i should like such an adventure well enough because it would give me a glimpse of life and character that i should like to know something about but the reporter business and the detective business wouldnt attract me  no i should suppose not said matt what sort of fellow personally is thispinney  oh he isnt bad he is a regular type said maxwell with tacit enjoyment of the typicality of pinney he hasnt the least chance in the world of working up into any controlling place in the paper they dont know much in the events office but they do know pinney hes a great liar and a braggart and he has no more notion of the immunities of private life thanwell perhaps its because he would as soon turn his life inside out as not and in fact would rather but hes very domestic and very kindhearted to his wife it seems they have a baby now and ive no doubt pinney is a pattern to parents hes always advising you to get married but hes a born bohemian hes the most harmless creature in the world so far as intentions go and quite softhearted but he wouldnt spare his dearest friend if he could make copy of him it would be impossible i should say he was first a newspaper man and then a man hes an awfully common nature and hasnt the first literary instinct if i had any mystery or mere privacy that i wanted to guard and i thought pinney was on the scent of it i shouldnt have any more scruple in setting my foot on him than i would on that snake  a little reptile allured by their immobility had crept out of the stone wall which they were standing near and lay flashing its keen eyes at them and running out its tongue a forked thread of tremulous scarlet maxwell brought his heel down upon its head as he spoke and ground it into the earth  matt winced at the anguish of the twisting and writhing thing ah i dont think i should have killed it  i should said maxwell  then you think one couldnt trust him  yes if you put your foot on him in some sort of agreement and kept it there why of course any man can be held but dont let pinney have room to wriggle  they turned and walked away matt keeping the image of the tormented snake in his mind it somehow mixed there with the idea of pinney and unconsciously softened him toward the reporter  would there be any harm he asked after a while in my acting on a knowledge of this letter in behalf of mr northwicks family  not a bit said maxwell i make you perfectly free of it as far as im concerned and it cant hurt pinney even if he ought to be spared he wouldnt spare you  i dont know said matt that i could justify myself in hurting him on that ground i shall be careful about him i dont at all know that i shall want to use it but it has just struck me that perhapsbut i dont know i should have to talk with their attorneyi will see about it and i thank you very much mr maxwell  look here mr hilary said maxwell use pinney all you please and all you can but i warn you he is a dangerous tool he doesnt mean any harm till hes tempted and when its done he doesnt think its any harm he isnt to be trusted an instant beyond his selfinterest and yet he has flashes of unselfishness that would deceive the very elect good heavens cried maxwell if i could get such a character as pinneys into a story or a play i wouldnt take odds from any man living  his notion whatever it was grew upon matt so that he waited more and more impatiently for his mothers return in order to act upon it when she did get back to the farm she could only report from the northwicks that she had said pretty much what she thought she would like to say to suzette concerning her wilfulness and obstinacy in wishing to give up her property but matt inferred that she had at the same time been able to infuse so much motherly comfort into her scolding that it had left the girl consoled and encouraged she had found out from adeline that their great distress was not knowing yet where their father was apparently he thought that his published letter was sufficient reassurance for the time being perhaps he did not wish them to get at him in any way or to have his purposes affected by any appeal from them perhaps as adeline firmly believed his mind had been warped by his sufferinghe must have suffered greatlyand he was not able to reason quite sanely about the situation mrs hilary spoke of the dignity and strength which both the sisters showed in their trial and present stress she praised suzette especially she said her trouble seemed to have softened and chastened her she was really a noble girl and she had sent her love to louise they had both wished to be remembered to every one adeline especially wished to be remembered to you matt she said they should never forget your kindness  matt got over to hatboro the next day and went to see putney who received him with some ironical politeness when matt said he had come hoping to be useful to his clients the miss northwicks  well we all hope something of that kind mr hilary you were here on a mission of that kind before but may i ask why you think i should believe you wish to be useful to them  why  yes your father is the president of the company mr northwick had his little embarrassment with and the natural presumption would be that you could not really be friendly toward his family  but we are friendly all of us my father would do them any service in his power consistent with his duty totohis business associates  ah thats just the point and you would all do anything you could for them consistent with your duty to him thats perfectly rightperfectly natural but you must see that it doesnt form a ground of common interest for us i talked with you about the miss northwicks affairs the other daytoo much i think but i cant today i shall be glad to converse with you on any other topicdiscuss the ways of god to man or any little interest of that kind but unless i can see my way clearer to confidence between us in regard to my clients affairs than i do at present i must avoid them  it was absurd but in his high goodwill toward adeline and in his latent tenderness for suzette matt was hurt by the lawyers distrust somewhat as you are hurt when the cashier of a strange bank turns over your check and says you must bring some one to recognize you it cost matt a pang it took him a moment to own that putney was right then he said of course i must offer you proof somehow that ive come to you in good faith i dont know exactly how i shall be able to do it would the assurance of my friend mr wade the rector of st michaels  the name seemed to affect putney pleasantly he smiled and then he said brother wade is a good man and his words usually carry conviction but this is a serious subject mr hilary he laughed and concluded earnestly you must know that i cant talk with you on any such authority i couldnt talk with mr wade himself  no no of course not matt assented and he took himself off crestfallen ashamed of his own shortsightedness  there was only one way out of the trouble and now he blamed himself for not having tried to take that way at the outset he had justified himself in shrinking from it by many plausible excuses but he could justify himself no longer he rejoiced in feeling compelled as it were to take it at least now he should not be acting from any selfish impulse and if there were anything unseemly in what he was going to do he should have no regrets on that score even in the shame of failure     xvii   matt hilary gave himself time on his way to the northwick place or at least as much time as would pass between walking and driving but that was because he was impatient and his own going seemed faster to his nerves than that of the swiftest horse could have seemed at the crest of the upland which divides hatboro from south hatboro and just beyond the avenue leading to dr morrells house he met sue northwick she was walking quickly too she was in mourning but she had put aside her long crape veil and she came towards him with her proud face framed in the black and looking the paler for it a little of her yellow hair showed under her bonnet she moved imperiously and matt was afraid to think what he was thinking at sight of her she seemed not to know him at first or rather not to realize that it was he when she did a joyful light which she did not try to hide from him flashed over her visage and mr hilary she said as simply and hospitably as if their last parting had not been on terms of enmity that nothing could clear up or explain away  he ran forward and caught her hand oh i am so glad he said i was going out to see you about somethingvery important and i might have missed you  no i was just coming to the doctors and then i was going back my sister isnt at all well and i thought shed better see the doctor  its nothing serious i hope  oh no i think shes a little worn out  i know said matt with intelligence and nothing more was said between them as to the cause or nature of adelines sickness matt asked if he might go up the doctors avenue with her and they walked along together under the mingling elm and maple tops but he deferred the matter he wished to speak of they found a little girl playing in the road near the house and sue asked is your father at home idella  mamma is at home said the child she ran forward calling toward the open doors and windows mamma mamma heres a lady  it isnt their child sue explained its the daughter of the minister who was killed on the railroad here a year or two agoa very strange man mr peck  i have heard wade speak of him said matt  a handsome and very happy looking woman came to the door and stilled the little ones boisterous proclamation to the hoarse whisper of a lady a lady as she took her hand but she did not rebuke or correct her  how do you do mrs morrell said suzette with rather a haughty distance but matt felt that she kept aloof with the pride of a person who comes from an infected house and will not put herself at the risk of avoidance i wished to see dr morrell about my sister she isnt well will you kindly ask him to call  i will send him as soon as he comes said mrs morrell giving matt that glance of liking which no good woman could withhold unless she added you would like to come in and wait for him  thank you no said suzette i must go back to her goodby  goodby said mrs morrell  matt raised his hat and silently bowed but as they turned away he said to suzette what a happy face what a lovely face what a good face  she is a very good woman said the girl she has been very kind to us but so has everybody i couldnt have believed it in fact it was only the kindness of their neighbors that had come near the defaulters daughters the harshness and the hate had kept away  why shouldnt they be kind matt demanded with his heart instantly in his throat i cant imagineat such a timedont you know that i love you he entreated as if that exactly followed there was perhaps a subtle spiritual sequence transcending all order of logic in the expression of his passion  she looked at him over her shoulder as he walked by her side and said with neither surprise nor joy how can you say such a thing to me  because it is true because i cant help it because i wish to be everything to you and i have to begin by saying that but dont answer me now you need never answer me i only wish you to use me as you would use some one who loved you beyond anything on earthas freely as that and yet not be bound or hampered by me in the least can you do that i mean can you feel this is my best friend the truest friend that any one can have and i will let him do anything and everything he wishes for me can you do thatsay that  but how could i do that i dont understand you she said faintly  dont you i am so glad you dont drive me from you  i you  i was afraidbut now we can speak reasonably about it i dont see why people shouldnt i know its shocking to speak to you of such a thing at such a time its dreadful and yet i cant feel wrong to have done it no if its as sacred as it seems to me when i think of it then it couldnt be wrong in the presence of death itself i do love you and i want you some day for my wife yes but dont answer that now if you never answer me or if you deny me at last still i want you to let me be your true lover while i can and to do everything that your accepted lover could whether you ever look at me again or not couldnt you do that  you know i couldnt she answered simply  couldnt you he asked and he fell into a forlorn silence as if he could not say anything more he forced her to take the word by asking then you are offended with me  how could i be  oh  its what any girl might be glad of  oh my  and i am not so silly as to think there can be a wrong time for it if there were you would make it right if you chose it you couldnt do anything i should think wrong and iilove you too  suzette suzette he called wildly as if she were a great way off it seemed to him his heart would burst he got awkwardly before her and tried to seize her hand  she slipped by him with a pathetic dont but you know i never could be your wife you know that  i dont know it why shouldnt you  because i couldnt bring my fathers shame on my husband  it wouldnt touch me any more than it touches you  it would touch your father and motherand louise  they all admire you and honor you they think youre everything thats true and grand  yes while i keep to myself and i shall keep to myself i know how and i shall not give way dont think it  you will do what is right i shall think that  dont praise me i cant bear it  but i love you and how can i help praising you and if you love me  i do i do with all my heart she turned and gave him an impassioned look from the height of her inapproachability  then i wont ask you to be my wife suzette i know how you feel i wont be such a liar as to pretend i dont and i will respect your feeling as the holiest thing on earth and if you wish we will be engaged as no other lovers ever were you shall promise nothing but to let me help you all i can for our loves sake and i will promise never to speak to you of our love again that shall be our secretour engagement will you promise  it will be hard for you she said with a pitying look which perhaps tried him as sorely as anything could  not if i can believe i am making it easy for you  they walked along and she said with averted eyes that he knew had tears in them i promise  and i promise too he said  she impulsively put out her left hand toward him and he held its slim fingers in his right a moment and then let it drop they both honestly thought they had got the better of that which laughs from its innumerable disguises at all stratagems and all devices to escape it  and now he said i want to talk to you about what brought me over here today i thought at first that i was only going to see your lawyer     xviii   matt felt that he need now no longer practise those reserves in speaking to sue of her father which he had observed so painfully hitherto neither did she shrink from the fact they had to deal with in the trust established between them they spoke of it all openly and if there was any difference in them concerning it the difference was in his greater forbearance toward the unhappy man they both spoke of his wrongdoing as if it were his infirmity they could not do otherwise and they both insensibly assumed his irresponsibility in a measure they dwelt in the fiction or the persuasion of a mental obliquity which would account for otherwise unaccountable things  it is what my sister has always said sue eagerly assented to his suggestion of this theory i suppose its what ive always believed too somehow or i couldnt have lived  yes yes it must be so matt insisted but now the question is how to reach him and make some beginning of the end with him i suppose its the suspense and the uncertainty that is breaking your sister down  yesthat and what we ought to do about giving up the property wequarrelled about that at first we couldnt see it alike but now ive yielded weve both yielded and we dont know what to do  we must talk all that over with your lawyer in connection with something ive just heard of he told her of pinneys scheme and he said we must see if we cant turn it to account  they agreed not to talk of her father with adeline but she began it herself she looked very old and frail as she sat nervously rocking herself in a corner of the cottage parlor and her voice had a sharp anxious note what i think is that now we know father is alive we oughtnt to do anything about the property without hearing from him it stands to reason dont you think it does mr hilary that he would know better than anybody else what we ought to do any rate i think we ought to wait and consult with him about it and see what he says the property belonged to mother in the first place and he mightnt like to have us part with it  i dont think you need trouble about that now miss northwick said matt nothing need be done about the property at present  but i keep thinking about it i want to do what sue thinks is right and to see it just in the light she does and ive told her i would do exactly as she said about it but now she wont say and so i think weve got to wait and hear from father dont you  decidedly i think you ought to do nothing now till you hear from him said matt  i knew you would said the old maid and if sue will be ruled by me shell see that it will all turn out right i know father and i know hell want to do what is sensible and at the same time honorable he is a person who could never bear to wrong any one out of a cent  well said sue we will do what mr hilary says and now try not to worry about it any more she coaxed  oh yes its well enough to say not to worry now when my minds got going on it said the old maid querulously she flung her weak frame against the chairback and she began to wipe the gathering tears but if youd agreed with me in the first place it wouldnt have come to this now im all broken down and i dont know when i shall be well again  it was a painful moment sue patiently adjusted the cushion to her sisters shoulders while adelines tongue ran helplessly on you were so headstrong and stubborn i thought you would kill me you were just like a rock and i could beat myself to pieces against you and you wouldnt move  i was wrong said the proud girl meekly  im sure adeline whimpered i hate to make an exhibition before mr hilary as much as any one but i cant help it no i cant my nerves are all gone  the doctor came and sue followed matt out of doors to leave her for the first few confidential moments sacred to the flow of symptoms alone with the physician there was a little sequestered space among the avenue firs beside the lodge with a bench toward which he led the way but the girl would not sit down she stood with her arms fallen at her side and looked him steadily in the face  its all true that she said of me i set myself like a rock against her i have made her sick and if she died i should be her murderer  he put his arms round her and folded her to his heart oh my love my love my love he lamented and exulted over her  she did not try to resist she let her arms hang at her side she said is this the way we keep our wordalready  our word was made to be broken we must have meant it so im glad we could break it so soon now i can truly help you now that you are to be my wife  she did not gainsay him but she asked what will you think when you knowyou must have known that i used to care for some else but he never cared for me it ought to make you despise me it made me despise myself but it is true i did care all the world for him once now will you say  now more than ever said the young man silencing her lips with his own and in their trance of love the world seemed to reel away from under their feet with all its sorrows and shames and leave them in midheaven  suzette adelines voice called from within suzette where are you  sue released herself and ran into the cottage she came out again in a little while and said that the doctor thought adeline had better go to bed for a day or two and have a thorough rest and relief from all excitement we mustnt talk before her any more and you mustnt stay any longer  he accepted the authority she instinctively assumed over him and found his dismissal already of the order of things he said yes ill go at once but about  she put a card into his hand you can see mr putney and whatever you and he think best will be best havent you been our good angel ever sinceoh im not half good enough for you and i shouldnt be even if there were no stain  stop he said he caught her hand and pulled her toward him  the doctor came out and said in a low voice theres nothing to be anxious about but she really must have quiet ill send mrs morrell down to see you after tea shes quiet itself  suzette submitted and let matt take her hand again in parting  will you give me a lift doctor if youre going toward town  get in said the doctor  sue went indoors and the two men drove off together  matt looked at the card in his hand and read mr putney please talk to mr hilary as you would to my sister or me suzettes printed name served for signature matt put the card in his pocketbook and then he said what sort of man is mr putney doctor  mr putney said the doctor with a twinkle of his blue eyes is one of those uncommon people who have enemies he has a good many because hes a man that thinks and then says what he thinks but hes his own worst enemy because from time to time he gets drunk  a character said matt do you think hes a safe one doesnt his getting drunk from time to time interfere with his usefulness  well of course said the doctor its bad for him but i think its slowly getting better yes decidedly its very extraordinary but ever since hes been in charge of the miss northwicks interests  yes thats what i was thinking of  hes kept perfectly straight its as if the responsibilities had steadied him  but if he goes on sprees he may be on the verge of one thats gathering violence from its postponement matt suggested  i think not said the doctor after a moment but of course i cant tell  they trust him so implicitly said matt  i know said the doctor and i know that hes entirely devoted to them the fact is putneys a very dear friend of mine  oh excuse me  no no the doctor stayed matts apologies i understand just what you mean he disliked their father very much he was principled against him as a merely rich man with mischievous influence on the imaginations of all the poor people about him who wanted to be like him  oh thats rather good said matt  do you think so asked the doctor looking round at him well i supposed you would be all the other way well what i was saying was that putney looks upon these poor girls as their fathers chief victims i think he was touched by their coming to him and has pitied them the impression is that hes managed their affairs very well i dont know about such things but i know hes managed them honorably i would stake my life on it and i believe hell hold out straight to the last i suppose the doctor conjectured at the end that they will try to get at northwick now and arrange with his creditors for his return  i dont mind telling you said matt that its been tried and failed the states attorney insists that he shall come back and stand his trial first of all  oh said the doctor  of course thats right from the legal point of view but in the meantime nobody knows where mr northwick is  i suppose said the doctor it would have been better for him not to have written that letter  its hard to say matt answered i thought so too at first i thought it was cowardly and selfish of him to take away his childrens superstition about his honesty you knew that they held to that through all  most touching thing in the world said the doctor leaning forward to push a fly off his horse with the limp point of his whip that poor old maid has talked it into me till i almost believed it myself  i dont know that i should hold him severely accountable and im not sure now that i should condemn him for writing that letter it must have been a great relief to him in a way you may say he had to do it its conceivable that if he had kept it on his mind any longer his mind would have given way as it is they have now the comfort of another superstitionif it is a superstition what do you think doctor do you believe that there was a mental twist in him  there seems to be in nearly all these defaulters what they do is so senselessso insane i suppose thats the true theory of all crime but it wont do to act upon it yet awhile  no  the doctor went on after a pause with a laugh of enjoyment at the notion above all it wont do to let the defaulters act upon that theory and apply for admission to the insane asylums instead of taking the express for canada when theyre found out  oh no said matt he wondered at himself for being able to analyze the offence of suzettes father so coldbloodedly but in fact he could not relate the thought of her to the thought of him in his sin at all he could only realize their kindred in her share of his suffering     xix   putney accepted suzettes authorization of matt with apparent unconsciousness of anything but its immediate meaning and they talked pinneys scheme intimately over together in the end it still remained a question whether the energies of such an investigator could be confined to the discovery of northwicks whereabouts whether his newspaper instincts would not be too strong for any sense of personal advantage that could be appealed to in him they both believed that it would not be long before northwick followed up the publication of his letter by some communication with his family  but time began to go by again and northwick made no further sign the flurry of activity which his letter had called out in the detectives came to nothing their search was not very strenuous northwicks creditors were of various minds as to the amount of money he had carried away with him every one knew that if he chose to stay in canada he could not be molested there and it seemed very improbable that he could be persuaded to put himself within reach of the law the law had no terms to offer him and there was really nothing to be done  putney forecast all this in his talk with matt when he held that they must wait northwicks motion he professed himself willing to wait as long as northwick chose though he thought they would not have to wait long and he contended for a theory of the mans whole performance which he said he should like to have tested before a jury  matt could not make out how much he really meant by saying that northwick could be defended very fairly on the ground of insanity and that he would enjoy managing such a defence it was a common thing to show that a murderer was insane why not a defaulter tilted back in his chair with one leg over the corner of his table and changing the tobacco in his mouth from one cheek to the other as he talked the lawyer outlined the argument which he said could be made very effective there was the fact to begin with that northwick was a very wealthy man and had no need of more money when he began to speculate putney held that this want of motive could be made a strong point and that the reckless almost open way in which northwick used the companys money when he began to borrow was proof in itself of unsound mind apparently he had no sense whatever of meum and tuum especially tuum then the total collapse of the man when he was found out his flight without an effort to retrieve himself although his shortage was by no means hopelessly vast and could have been almost made up by skilful use of the credit that northwick could command was another evidence of shaken reason but besides all this there was his behavior since he left home he had been absent nearly five months and in that time he had made no attempt whatever to communicate with his family although he must have known that it was perfectly safe for him to do so he was a father who was almost dotingly fond of his children and singularly attached to his home yet he had remained all that time in voluntary exile and he had left them in entire uncertainty as to his fate except so far as they could accept the probability of his death by a horrible casualty this inversion of the natural character of a man was one of the most striking phenomena of insanity and putney for the purpose of argument maintained that it could be made to tell tremendously with a jury  matt was unable to enjoy the sardonic metaphysics of the case with putney he said gravely that he had been talking of the matter with dr morrell and he had no doubt that there was a taint of insanity in every wrongdoer some day he believed the law would take cognizance of the fact  i dont suppose the time is quite ripe yet though i think i could make out a strong case for brother northwick said putney he seemed to enter into it more fully as if he had a mischievous perception of matts uneasiness and chose to torment him but then apparently he changed his mind and dealt with other aspects of their common interest so seriously and sympathetically that matt parted from him with a regret that he could not remove the last barrier between them and tell the lawyer that he concerned himself so anxiously in the affairs of that wretched defaulter because his dearest hope was that the daughter of the criminal would some day be his wife  but matt felt that this fact must first be confided to those who were nearest him and how to shape it in terms that would convey the fact and yet hide the repulsiveness he knew in it was the question that teased him all the way back to vardley like some tiresome riddle he understood why his love for suzette northwick must be grievous to his father and mother how embarrassing how disappointing how really in some sort disastrous and yet he felt that if there was anything more sacred than another in the world for him it was that love he must be true to it at whatever cost and in every event and he must begin by being perfectly frank with those whom it would afflict and confessing to himself all its difficulties and drawbacks he was not much afraid of dealing with his father they were both men and they could look at it from the mans point of view besides his father really cared little what people would say after the first fever of disgust if he did not change wholly and favor it vehemently he would see so much good in it that he would be promptly and finally reconciled  but matt knew that his mother was of another make and that the blow would be much harder for her to bear his problem was how to lighten it sometimes he thought he had better not try to lighten it but let it fall at once and trust to her affection and good sense for the rest but when he found himself alone with her that night he began by making play and keeping her beyond reach he was so lost in this perverse effort that he was not aware of some such effort on her part till she suddenly dropped it and said matt there is something i wish to speak to you aboutvery seriously  his heart jumped into his throat but he said well and she went on  louise tells me that you think of bringing this young man down to the shore with you when you come to see us next week  maxwell i thought the change might do him good yes said matt with a cowardly joy in his escape from the worst he feared he thought she was going to speak to him of suzette  she said i dont wish you to bring him i dont wish louise to see him again after she leaves this placeever again she is fascinated with him  fascinated  i cant call it anything else i dont say that shes in love but theres no question but shes allowed her curiosity to run wild and her fancy to be taken the two strongest things in herin most girls i want to break it all up  but do you think  i know it isnt that shes with him at every moment but that her thoughts are with him when theyre apart he puzzles her he piques her shes always talking and asking about him its their difference in everything that does it i dont mean to say that her heart is touched and i dont intend it shall be so you mustnt ask him to the shore with you and if youve asked him already you must get out of it if you think he needs sea air you can get him board at some of the resorts but not near us she asked in default of any response from her son you dont think matt it would be well for the acquaintance to go on  no i dont mother youre quite right as to that said matt if youre not mistaken in supposing  im not you may depend upon it and im glad you can see the matter from my point of view it is all very well for you to have your queer opinions and even to live them i think its all ridiculous but your father and i both respect you for your sincerity though your course has been a great disappointment to us  i know that mother said matt groaning in spirit to think how much worse the disappointment he was meditating must be and feeling himself dishonest and cowardly through and through  but i feel sure mrs hilary went on that when its a question of your sister you would wish her life to be continued on the same plane and in the surroundings she had always been used to  i should think that best certainly for a girl of louises ideas said matt trying to get his own to the surface  ideas cried his mother she has no ideas she merely has impulses and her impulses are to do what people wish but her education and breeding have been different from those of such a young man and she would be very unhappy with him they never could quite understand each other no matter how much they were in love i know he is very talented and all that and i shouldnt at all mind his being poor i never minded cyril wades being poor when i thought he had taken her fancy because he was one of ourselves and this young manmatt you cant pretend that with all his intellectual qualities hes what one calls a gentleman with his origin and bringing up his coarse experiences all his trials and struggles even with his successes he couldnt be and louise could not be happy with him for that very reason he might have all the gifts all the virtues under the sun i dont deny that he has  he has some very serious faults matt interrupted  we all have said mrs hilary tolerantly but he might be a perfect sainta heroa martyr and if he wasnt what one calls a gentleman dont you see we cant be frank about such things here because we live in a republic but  we get there just the same said matt with unwonted slang  yes said his mother that is what i mean  and youre quite right as to the facts mother he got up and began to walk about the long low livingroom of the farmhouse where they were sitting louise had gone to direct her maid in packing for her flitting to the seaside in the morning matt could see a light in the ellchamber where maxwell was probably writing the selfmade man can never be the society equal of the societymade man he may have more brains more money more virtue but hes a kind of inferior and he betrays his inferiority in every worldly exigency and if hes successful hes so because hes been stronger fiercer harder than others in the battle of life thats one reason why i say that there oughtnt to be any battle of life maxwell has the defects of his disadvantagesi see that hes often bitter and cynical and cruel because he has had to fight for his bread he isnt louises social equal i quite agree with you there mother and if she wants to live for society he would be always in danger of wounding her by his inferiority to other people of her sort im sorry for maxwell but i dont pity him especially he bears the penalty of his misfortunes but he is strong enough to bear it let him stand it but there are othersweaker unhappiermother you havent asked me yet aboutthe northwicks matt stopped in front of her chair and looked down into her lifted face where the satisfaction his acquiescence in her views concerning louise was scarcely marred by her perception that he had not changed his mind at all on other points she was used to his way of thinking and she gratefully resolved to be more and more patient with it and give him time for the change that was sure to come she interpreted the look of stormy wistfulness he wore as an expression of his perplexity in the presence of the contradictory facts and theories  no she said i expected to do that you know ive seen them so very lately and with this about louise on my mindhow are they that poor adelineim afraid its killing her were you able to do anything for them  ah i dont know the young man sighed they have to suffer for their misfortunes too  it seems to be the order of providence said mrs hilary with the resignation of the philosophical spectator  no matt protested its the disorder of improvidence theres nothing of the divine will in consequences so unjust and oppressive those women are perfectly innocent theyve only wished to do right and tried to do it but theyre under a ban the same as if they had shared their fathers guilt they have no friends  well matt said his mother with dignity i think you can hardly say that im sure that as far as we are concerned we have nothing to reproach ourselves with i think weve gone to the extreme to show our goodwill how much further do you want us to go come i dont like your saying this  i beg your pardon i certainly dont blame you or louise or father i blame myselffor cowardiceforfor unworthiness in being afraid to sayto tell youmother he burst out suddenly after a halt ive asked suzette northwick to marry me  matt had tried to imagine himself saying this to his mother and the effect it would have ever since he had left suzettes absorbing presence all through his talk with putney and all the way home and now throughout what he and his mother had been saying of maxwell and louise but it always seemed impossible and more and more impossible so that when he found the words spoken in his own voice it seemed wholly incredible     xx   the effect of a thing is never quite what we have forecast mrs hilary heard matts confession without apparently anything of his tumult in making it women after all dwell mainly in the region of the affections even the most worldly women have their likes and dislikes and the question of the sort matt had sprung upon his mother is first a personal question with them she was not a very worldly woman but she liked her place in the world and she preferred conformity and similarity the people she was born of and bred with were the nicest kind of people and she did not see how any one could differ from them to advantage their ideas were the best or they would not have had them she herself did not wish to have other ideas but her family was more far more to her than her world was she knew that in his time her husband had not had the ideas of her world concerning slavery but she had always contrived to honor the ideas of both since her son had begun to disagree with her world concerning what he called the industrial slavery she contrived without the sense of inconsistency to suffer him and yet remain with the world she represented in her maternal tolerance the principle actuating the church which includes the facts as fast as they accomplish themselves without changing any point of doctrine  then you mean matt she asked that you are going to marry her  yes said matt that is what i mean and then something in his mothers way of taking it nettled him on sues behalf but i dont know that my marrying her necessarily followed from my asking her i expected her to refuse me  men always do i dont know why said mrs hilary but in this case i cant imagine it  cant imagine it i can imagine it matt retorted but his mother did not seem to notice his resentment  then if its quite settled you dont wish me to say anything  i wish you to say everything motherall that you feel and thinkabout her and the whole affair but i dont wish you to thinki cant let you thinkthat she has ever by one look or word allowed me to suppose that my offer would be welcome  oh i didnt mean that said mrs hilary she would be too proud for that but ive no doubt it was welcome matt fretted in silence but he allowed his mother to go on she is a very proud girl and ive no doubt that what shes been through has intensified her pride  i dont suppose shes perfect said matt im not perfect myself but i dont conceal her faults from myself any more than i do my own i know shes proud i dont admire pride but i suppose that with her it cant be helped  i dont know that i object to it said mrs hilary it doesnt always imply hardness it goes with very good things sometimes that hauteur of hers is very effective ive seen it carry her through with people who might have been disposed to look down on her for some reasons  i shouldnt value it for that matt interrupted  no but she made it serve her instead of her want of those family connections that every one else has  she will have all of ours i hope mother matt broke in with a smile but his mother would not be diverted from the point she was making  and that it always seemed so odd she shouldnt have im sure that to see her come into a room you would think half boston or all the princes of the blood were her cousins shes certainly a magnificent creature  matt differed with his mother from the ground up in all her worldly reasons for admiring suzette but her praises filled his heart to overflowing tears stood in his eyes and his voice trembled  she isshe isangelically  well not just that type perhaps said mrs hilary but she is a good girl no one can help respecting her and i think shes even more to be respected for yielding to that poor old maid sister of hers about their property than for wishing to give it up  yes matt breathed gratefully  but there there is the real skeleton matt suzette would grace the highest position but her father what will people say  need we mind that mother  not perhaps so much if things had remained as they wereif he had never been heard from again but that letter of his and what will he do next he may come home and offer to stand his trial  i would respect him for that cried matt passionately  matt  it isnt a thing i should urge him to do he may not have the strength for it but if he had it would be the best thing he could do and i should be glad to stand by him  and drag us all through the mire surely my son whatever you feel about your mother and sister you cant wish your poor father to suffer anything more on that wretchs account  wish no and heaven knows how deeply anxious i am about the effect my engagement may have on father im afraid it will embarrass himcompromise him even  as to that i cant say said mrs hilary you and he ought to know best one thing is certain there wont be any opposition on his part or mine my son that you wont see yourself is reasonable  oh i am sure of that mother and i cant tell you how deeply i feel  your father appreciates suzette as fully as i do but i dont believe he could stand any more quixotism from you matt and if you intend to make your marriage a preliminary to getting your fatherinlaw into states prison you may be very sure your father wont approve of your marriage  matt laughed at the humor of the proposition which his mother did not perceive so keenly  i dont intend that exactly  and im satisfied as it is he wont be easy about it till the thing is hushed up or dies out of itself if its let alone  but father cant let it alone said matt its his duty to follow it up at every opportunity i dont want you to deceive yourself about the matter i want you to understand just how it will be i have tried to face it squarely and i know how it looks i shall try to make suzette see it as i do and im sure she will i dont think her father is guiltier than a great many other people who havent been found out but he has been found out and he ought for the sake of the community to be willing to bear the penalty the law inflicts that is his only hope his salvation his duty fathers duty is to make him bear it whether hes willing or not its a much more odious duty  i dont understand you matt saying your fathers part is more odious than a selfconfessed defaulters  no i dont say  then i think youd better go to your father and reconcile your duty with his if you can i wash my hands of the affair it seems to me though that youve quite lost your head the world will look very differently i can assure you at a woman whose father died in canada nobody could remember just why from what it will on one whose father was sent to states prison for taking money that didnt belong to him  matt flung up his arms oh the world the world i wont let the world enter i will never let suzette face its mean and cruel prejudices she will come here to the farm with me and we will live down the memory of what she has innocently suffered and we will let the world go its way  and dont you think the world will follow you here dont you suppose it is here ready to welcome you home with all those prejudices you hope you can shun every old gossip of the neighborhood will point suzette out as the daughter of a man who is serving his term in jail for fraud the great world forgets but this little world around you here would remember it as long as either of you lived no the day you marry suzette northwick you must make up your mind to follow her father into exile or else to share his shame with her at home  ive made up my mind to share that shame at home i never could ask her to run from it  then for pitys sake let that miserable man alone wherever he is or if you can get at him beg him to stay away and keep still till he dies goodnight  mrs hilary rose from her own chair and stooped over matt where he had sunk in his and kissed his troubled forehead he thought he had solved one part of his problem but her words showed him that he had not rightly seen it in that light of love which had really hid it in dazzling illusions  the difficulty had not yielded at all when he met his father with it he thought it had only grown tougher and knottier and he hardly knew how to present it his mother had not only promised not to speak to his father of the affair she had utterly refused to speak of it and matt instantly perceived that the fact he announced was somehow far more unexpected to his father than it had seemed to his mother  but hilary received it with a patience a tenderness for his son in all his amazement that touched matt more keenly than any other fashion of meeting it could have done he asked if it were something that matt had done or had merely made up his mind some time to do and when matt said it was something he had done his father was silent a moment then he said i shall have to take some action about it  how action  why you must see my dear boy that as soon as this thing becomes knownand you wish it to be known of course  of course  it will be impossible for me to continue holding my present relation to northwick  northwick  as president of the board im ex officio his enemy and persecutor it wouldnt be right it wouldnt be decent for me to continue that after it was known that you were going to marry his daughter it wouldnt be possible i must resign i must withdraw from the board altogether i havent the stuff in me to do my official duty at such a cost so id better give up my office and get rid of my duty  that will be a great sacrifice for you father said matt  it wont bring me to want exactly if you mean moneywise  i didnt mean moneywise but i know youve always enjoyed the position so much  hilary laughed uneasily well it hasnt been a bed of roses since we discovered northwicks obliquitiesexcuse me  matt blushed oh i know hes oblique as such things go  in fact his father resumed i shall be glad to be out of it and i dont think therell be much opposition to my going out i know that theres a growing feeling against me in the board i have tried to carry water on both shoulders ive made the effort honestly but the effect hasnt been good i couldnt keep my heart out of it from the very first i pitied that poor devils children so that i got him and gave him all the chance i could  that was perfectly right it was the only businesslike  it wasnt businesslike to hope that even if justice were defeated he might somehow anyhow escape the consequences of his crime and im afraid this is what ive hoped in spite of myself said hilary  this was so probably true that matt could not help his father deny it he could only say i dont believe youve ever allowed that hope to interfere with the strict performance of your duty at any moment  no but ive had the hope and others have had the suspicion that ive had it ive felt that and im glad that its coming to an end im not ashamed of your choice matt im proud of it the thing gave me a shock at first because i had to face the part i must take but shes all kinds of a splendid girl the board knows what she wished to do and why she hasnt done it no one can help honoring her and i dont believe people will think the less of any of us for your wanting to marry her but if they do they may do it and be damned  hilary shook himself together with greater comfort than he had yet felt upon this conclusion but he lapsed again after the long handpressure that he exchanged with his son  we must make it our business now to see that no man loses anything by thatwe must get at him somehow of course they have no more notion where he is than we have  no not the least said matt i think its the uncertainty thats preying upon miss northwick  the mans behaving like a confounded lunatic said hilary  the word reminded matt of putney and he said thats their lawyers theory of him  oh youve seen him have you odd chap  yes i saw him when i was up there afterafterat the request of suzette i wished to talk with him about the scheme that maxwells heard of from a brother reporter and matt now unfolded pinneys plan to his father and showed his letter  hilary looked from it at his son you dont mean that this is the blackguard who wrote that account of the defalcation in the events  yes the same fellow but as to blackguard  well then matt i dont see how we can employ him it seems to me it would be a kind of insult to those poor girls  i had thought of that i felt that but after all i dont think he knew how much of a blackguard he was making of himself maxwell says he wouldnt know and besides we cant help ourselves if he doesnt go for us he will go for himself we must employ him hes a species of condottiere we can buy his allegiance with his service and we must forego the sentimental objection ive gone all over it and thats the only conclusion  hilary fumed and rebelled but he saw that they could not help themselves that they could not do better he asked and what did their lawyer think of it  he seemed to think we had better let it alone for the present better wait and see if mr northwick would not try to communicate with his family  im not so sure of that said hilary if this fellow is such a fellow as you say i dont see why we shouldnt make use of him at once  make use of him to get mr northwick back said matt i think it would be well for him to come back but voluntarily  come back said hilary whose civic morality flew much lower than this nonsense and stir the whole filthy mess up in the courts i mean make use of this fellow to find him and enable us to find out just how much money he has left and how much we have got to supply in order to make up his shortage  matt now perceived the extent of his fathers purpose and on its plane he honored it  father youre splendid  stuff im in a corner what else is there to do what less could we do whats the money for if it isnt to hilary choked with the emotion that filled him at the sight of his sons face  every father likes to have his grownup son think him a good man it is the sweetest thing that can come to him in life far sweeter than a daughters faith in him for a son knows whether his father is good or not at the bottom of his soul hilary cared more for his sons opinion than most fathers matt was a crank but because he was a crank hilary valued his judgment as something ideal  after a moment he asked can this fellow be got at  oh i imagine very readily  what did maxwell say about him generally  generally that hes not at all a bad kind of fellow hes a reporter by nature and hes a detective upon instinct hes done some amateur detective work as many reporters doaccording to maxwells account the two things run togetherand hes very shrewd and capable in his way hes going into it as a speculation and of course he wants it to be worth his while maxwell says his expectation of newspaper promotion is mere brag they know him too well to put him in any position of control hes a mixture like everybody else hes devotedly fond of his wife and he wants to give her and the baby a change of air  my idea hilary interrupted would be not to wait for the social science convention but to send this  pinney  pinney at once will you see him  if you have made up your mind  ive made up my mind but handle the wretch carefully and for heavens sake bind him by all thats sacredif theres anything sacred to himnot to give the matter away let him fix his price and offer him a pension for his widow afterwards     xxi   mrs hilary was a large woman of portly frame the prophecy in amplitude of what her son might come to be if he did not carry the activities of youth into his later life she for her part was long past such activities and yet she was not a woman to let the grass grow upon any path she had taken she appointed the afternoon of the day following her talk with matt for leaving the farm and going to the shore louise was to go with her and upon the whole she judged it best to tell her why when the girl came to say goodnight and to announce that her packing was finished  but what in the world are we in such a hurry for mamma all of a sudden  we are in a hurry becausedont you really know louisebecause in the crazy atmosphere of this house one loses the sense ofof proportionof differences  arent you ratheremersonian mamma  do you think so my dear matts queer notions infect everybody i dont blame you particularly and the simple life he makes people leadby leading it himself more than anything elsemakes you think that you could keep on living just as simply if you wished everywhere  its very sweetits so restful sighed the girl it makes you sick of dinners and ashamed of dances  but you must go back to them you must go back to the world you belong to and youd better not carry any queer habits back with you  you are rather sphinxlike mamma such habits for instance as  as mr maxwell the girls face changed her mother had touched the quick she went on looking steadily at her daughter you know he wouldnt do there  no he wouldnt said louise promptly so mournfully though that her mothers heart relented  ive seen that youve become interested in him louise that your fancy is excited he stimulates your curiosity i dont wonder at it he is very interesting he makes you feel his power more than any other young man ive met he charms your imagination even when he shocks your taste  yes all that said louise desolately  but he does shock your taste  sometimesnot always  often enough though to make the difference that im afraid youll lose the sense of louise i should be very sorry if i thought you were at allin love with that young man  it seemed a question louise let her head droop and answered with another how should i know he hasnt asked me  this vexed her mother dont be trivial dont be childish my dear you dont need to be asked though im exceedingly glad he hasnt asked you for now you can get away with a good conscience  im not sure yet that i want to get away said the girl dreamily  yes you are my dear her mother retorted you know it wouldnt do at all it isnt a question of his poverty your father has money enough its a question of his social quality and of all those little nothings that make up the whole of happiness in marriage he would be different enough being merely a man but being a man born and reared in as different a world from yours as if it were another planeti want you to think over all the girls you knowall the people you knowand see how many of them have married out of their own set their own circlewe might almost say their own family there isnt one  ive not said i wished to marry him mamma  no but i wish you to realize just what it would be  it would be something rather distinguished if his dreams came true louise suggested  well of course mrs hilary admitted she wished to be very very reasonable very very just it was the only thing with a girl like louise perhaps with any girl it would be distinguished in a way but it wouldnt be distinguished in the society way the only way youve professed to care for i know that weve always been an intellectual community and newyorkers and that kind of people think or profess to think that we make a great deal of literary men we do invite them somewhat but i pass whole seasons without meeting them and i dont know that you could say that they are of society even when they are in it if such a man has society connections hes in society but hes there on account of his connections not on account of his achievements this young man may become very distinguished but hell always be rather queer and he would put a society girl at odds with society his distinction would be public it wouldnt be social  matt doesnt think society is worth minding louise said casually  but you do returned her mother and matt says that a man of this young mans traditions might mortify you before society people  did matt say that louise demanded angrily i will speak to matt about that i should like to know what he means by it i should like to hear what he would say  very likely he would say that the society people were not worth minding you know his nonsense if you agree with matt ive nothing more to say louise not a word you can marry a mechanic or a daylaborer in that case without loss of selfrespect ive only been talking to you on the plane where ive always understood you wished to be taken but if you dont then i cant help it you must understand though and understand distinctly that you cant live on two levels the world wont let you either you must be in the world and of it entirely or you must discard its criterions and form your own and hover about in a sort of bohemian limbo on its outskirts or you must give it up altogether mrs hilary rose from the lounge where she had been sitting and said now im going to bed and i want you to think this all carefully over louise i dont blame you for it and i wish nothing but your good and happinessyours and matts both but i must say youve been pretty difficult children to provide for do you know what matt has been doing mrs hilary had not meant to speak of it but she felt an invincible necessity of doing so at last  something new about the northwicks  very decidedlyor about one of them hes offered himself to suzette  how grand how perfectly magnificent then she can give up her property at once and matt can take care of her and adeline both  or your father can for him matt has not the crime of being a capitalist on his conscience his idea seems to be to get suzette to live here on the farm with him  i dont believe shed be satisfied with that said louise but could she bear to face the world wouldnt she always be thinking what people thought  i felt that i ought to suggest that to matt though really when it comes to the practical side of the matter people wouldnt care much what her father had beenthat is society people wouldnt as society people she would have the education and the traditions of a lady and she would have matts name its nonsense to suppose there wouldnt be talk but i dont believe there would be anything that couldnt be lived down the fact is said mrs hilary giving her daughter the advantage of a species of soliloquy i think we ought to be glad matt has let us off so easily ive been afraid that he would end by marrying some farmers daughter and bringing somebody into the family who would say want to know and how and whatsay through her nose suzette is indefinitely better than that no matter what her father is but i must confess that it was a shock when matt told me they were engaged  why were you surprised mamma said louise i thought all along that it would come to that i knew in the first place matts sympathy would be roused and you know thats the strongest thing in him and then suzette is a beautiful girl shes perfectly regal and shes just matts opposite every way and of course he would be taken with her im not a bit surprised why its the most natural thing in the world  it might be very much worse sighed mrs hilary as soon as he has seen your father we must announce it and face it out with people fortunately its summer and a great many have gone abroad this year  louise began to laugh even mr northwick is abroad  yes and i hope hell stay there said mrs hilary wincing  it would be quite like matt wouldnt it to have him brought home in chains long enough to give away the bride  louise said her mother  louise began to cry oh you think its nothing she said stormily for matt to marry a girl whose father ran away with other peoples money but a man who has fought his way honestly is disgraceful no matter how gifted he is because he hasnt the traditions of a society man  i wont condescend to answer your unjust nonsense my dear said mrs hilary i will merely ask you if you wish to marry mr maxwell  i will take care of myself cried the girl in open if not definite rebellion she flung from the room and ran upstairs to her chamber which looked across at the chamber where maxwells light was burning she dropped on her knees beside the window and bowed herself to the light that swam on her tears a golden mist and pitied and entreated it and remained there till the lamp was suddenly quenched and the moon possessed itself of the night in unbroken splendor  after breakfast which she made late the next morning she found maxwell waiting for her on the piazza  are you going over to the camp she asked  i was after i had said goodby he answered  oh were not going for several hours yet we shall take the noon train mammas decided she possessed herself of the cushion stuffed with spruce sprays that lay on the piazzasteps and added i will go over with you they had hitherto made some pretence one to the other for being together at the camp but this morning neither feigned any reason for it louise stopped when she found he was not keeping up with her and turned to him and waited for him to reach her i wanted to speak with you mr maxwell and i expect you to be very patient and tractable she said this very authoritatively she ended by asking will you  it depends upon what it is i am always docile if i like a thing  well you ought to like this  oh thats different thats often infuriating  they went on and then paused at the low stone wall between the pasture and the pines  before i say it you must promise to take it in the right way she said  he asked teasingly why do you think i wont  becausebecause i wish you to so much  and am i such a contraryminded person that you cant trust me to behave myself under ordinary provocation  you may think the provocation is extraordinary  well lets see he got himself over the wall and allowed her to scramble after him  she asked herself whether if he had the traditions of a society man he would have done that but somehow when she looked at his dreamy face rapt in remote thought that beautified it from afar she did not care for his neglect of small attentions she said to herself that if a woman could be the companion of his thoughts that would be enough she did not go into the details of arranging association with thoughts so far off as maxwells she did not ask herself whether it would be easy or possible she put the cushion into the hammock for a pillow but he chose to sit beside her on the bench between the pinetree boles and the hammock swayed empty in the light breeze that woke the seasong of the boughs over them  i dont know exactly how to begin she said after a little silence  if youll tell me what you want to say he suggested ill begin for you  no thank you ill begin myself do you remember the other day when we were here and were talking of the difference in peoples pride  purse pride and poverty pride yes i remember that  i didnt like what you said then or rather what you were  have you begun now why didnt you  becausebecause you seemed very worldly  and do you object to the world i didnt make it said maxwell with his scornful smile but ive no criticisms of the creator to offer i take the world as i find it and as soon as i get a little stronger im going back to it but i thought you were rather worldly yourself miss hilary  i dont know i dont believe i am very dont you think the kind of life matts trying to live is better  your brother is the best man i ever knew  oh isnt he magnificent  but life means business even literary life as i understand it means business  and cant you thinkcant you wishfor anything better than the life that means business she asked she almost entreated why should you ever wish to go back to the world if you could live in the country away from society and all its vanity and vexation of spirit why wouldnt you rather lead a literary life that didnt mean business  but how are you proposing a public subscription or a fairy godmother asked maxwell  no merely the golden age im just supposing the case said louise you were born in arcady you know she added with a wistful smile  arcady is a good place to emigrate from said maxwell with a smile that was not wistful its like vermont where i was born too and if i owned the whole of arcady i should have no use for it till i had seen what the world had to offer then i might like it for a few months in the summer  yes she sighed faintly and suddenly she rose and said i must go and put the finishing touches goodby mr maxwellshe mechanically gave him her hand i hope you will soon be well enough to get back to the world again  thank you he said in surprise but the great trial you were going to make of my patience my docility  she caught away her hand oh that wasnt anything ive decided not goodby dont go through the empty form of coming back to the house with me ill take your adieus to mamma she put the cushion into the hammock you had better stay and try to get a nap and gather strength for the battle of life as fast as you can  she spoke so gayly and lightly that maxwell with all his subtlety felt no other mood in her he did not even notice till afterwards that she had said nothing about their meeting again he got into the hammock and after a while he drowsed with a delicious poetic sense of her capricious charm as she drifted back to the farmhouse over the sloping meadow he visioned a future in which fame had given him courage to tell her his love  mrs hilary knew from her daughters face that something had happened but she knew also that it was not what she dreaded     part third     i   matt hilary saw pinney and easily got at the truth of his hopes and possibilities concerning northwick he found that the reporter really expected to do little more than to find his man and make a newspaper sensation out of his discovery he was willing to forego this in the interest of northwicks family if it could be made worth his while he said he had always sympathized with his family and mrs pinney had and he would be glad to be of use to them he was so far from conceiving that his account of the defalcation in the events could have been displeasing to them that he bore them none of an offenders malice he referred to his masterpiece in proof of his interest and he promptly agreed with matt as to the terms of his visit to canada and its object  it was in fact the more practicable because since he had written to maxwell there had been a change in his plans and expectations pinney was disappointed in the events people they had not seen his proposed excursion as he had the failure of northwicks letter as an enterprise had dashed their interest in him and they did not care to invest in pinneys scheme even so far as to guarantee his expenses this disgusted pinney and turned his thoughts strongly toward another calling it was not altogether strange to him he had already done some minor pieces of amateur detective work and acquitted himself with gratifying success and he had lately seen a private detective who attested his appreciation of pinneys skill by offering him a partnership his wife was not in favor of his undertaking the work though she could not deny that he had some distinct qualification for it the air of confidence which he diffused about him unconsciously and which often served him so well in newspaper life was in itself the most valuable property that a detective could have she said this and she did not object to the profession itself except for the dangers that she believed it involved she did not wish pinney to incur these and she would not be laughed out of her fears when he told her that there were lines of detective work that were not half so dangerous in the long run as that of a reporter subject to assignment she only answered that she would much rather he kept along on the newspaper but this offer to look up northwick in behalf of his family was a different affair that would give them a chance for their outing in canada and pay them better than any newspaper enterprise they agreed to this and upon how much good it would do the baby and they imagined how mrs pinney should stay quietly at quebec while pinney went about looking up his man if that was necessary  and then he said if i find him and all goes well and i can get him to come home with me by moral suasion i can butter my bread on both sides theres a reward out for him and i guess i will just qualify as a detective before we start so as to be prepared for emergencies  lorenzo pinney screamed his wife dont you think of such a wicked thing so dishonorable  how wicked how dishonorable demanded pinney  im ashamed to have to tell you if you dont see and i wont but if you go as a detective go as a detective and if you go as their friend to help them and serve them then go that way but dont you try to carry water on both shoulders if you do i wont stir a step with you so there  ah said pinney i understand i didnt catch on at first well you neednt be afraid of my mixing drinks ill just use the old fellow for practice very likely he may lead to something else in the defaulter line you wont object to that  no i wont object to that  they had the light preparations of young housekeepers to make and they were off to the field of pinneys work in a very few days after he had seen matt and told him that he would talk it over with his wife at quebec he found board for his family at the same hotel where northwick had stopped in the winter but it had kept no recognizable trace of him in the name of warwick on its register pinney passed a week of search in the city where he had to carry on his investigations with an eye not only to northwicks discovery but to his concealment as well if he could find him he must hide him from the pursuit of others and he went about his work in the journalistic rather than the legal way he had not wholly severed his connection as the newspaper phrase is with the events he had a fast and loose relation with it pending a closer tie with his friend the detective which authorized him to keep its name on his card and he was soon friends with all the gentlemen of the local press they did not understand in their oldfashioned quiet ideal of newspaper work the vigor with which pinney proposed to enjoy the leisure of his vacation in exploiting all the journalistic material relating to the financial exiles resident in their city but they had a sort of local pride in their presence and with their help pinney came to know all that was to be known of them the colony was not large but it had its differences its distinctions which the citizens were very well aware of there are defaulters and defaulters and the blame is not in all cases the same nor the breeding of the offenders pinney learned that there were defaulters who were in society and not merely because they were defaulters for large sums and were of good social standing at home but because there were circumstances that attenuated their offence in the eyes of the people of their city of refuge they judged them by their known intentions and their exigencies as the justice they had fled from could not judge them there were other defaulters of a different type and condition whose status followed them embezzlers who had deliberately planned their misdeeds and who had fallen from no domestic dignity in their exclusion from respectable association abroad these pinney saw in their walks about the town and he was not too proud for the purposes of art to make their acquaintance and to study in their vacancy and solitude the dulness and weariness of exile they did not consort together but held aloof from one another and professed to be ignorant each of the affairs of the rest pinney sympathized in tone if not in sentiment with them but he did not lure them to the confidence he so often enjoyed they proved to be men of reticent temper when frankly invited to speak of their history and their hopes in the interest of the reputations they had left behind them they said they had no statement to make  it was not from them that pinney could hope to learn anything of the man he was seeking northwick was not of their order morally or socially and from the polite circles where the more elect of the exiles moved pinney was himself excluded by the habits of his life and by the choice of the people who formed those circles this seemed to pinney rather comical and it might have led him to say some satirical things of the local society if it had been in him to say bitter things at all as it was it amused his inexhaustible amiability that an honest man like himself should not be admitted to the company of even the swellest defaulters when he was willing to seek it he regretted that it should be so mainly because northwick could have been heard of among them if at all and when all his other efforts to trace him at quebec failed he did not linger there in fact he had not expected to find him there but he had begun his search at that point because he must stop there on his way to rimouski where northwicks letter to the events was posted this postmark was the only real clue he had but he left no stone unturned at quebec lest northwick should be under it by the time he came to the end of his endeavors mrs pinney and the baby were on such friendly terms with the landlady of the hotel where they were staying that pinney felt as easy at parting from them as he could ever hope to feel his soft heart of husband and father was torn at leaving them behind but he did not think it well to take them with him not knowing what rimouski might be like or how long he might be kept remote from an englishspeaking or englishpractising doctor he got a passage down the river on one of the steamers for liverpool and with many vows in compliance with his wifes charges that he would not let the vessel by any chance carry him on to europe he rent himself away she wagged the babys hand at him from the window where she stood to watch him getting into the calash and the vision of her there shone in his tears as the calash dashed wildly down mountain hill street and whirled him through the lower town on to the steamers landing he went to his stateroom as soon as he got aboard that he might give free course to his heartache and form resolutions to be morally worthy of getting back alive to them and of finding them well he would if he could have given up his whole enterprise and he was only supported in it by remembering what she had said in praise of its object she had said that if he could be the means of finding their father for those two poor women she should think it the greatest thing that ever was and more to be glad of than if he could restore him to his creditors pinney had laughed at this womanish view of it he had said that in either case it would be business and nothing else but now his heart warmed with acceptance of it as the only right view he pledged himself to it in anticipative requital of the providence that was to bring them all together again alive and well good as he had felt himself to be when he thought of the love in which he and his wife were bound he had never experienced so deep and thorough a sense of desert as in this moment he must succeed if only to crown so meritorious a marriage with the glory of success and found it in lasting prosperity     ii   these emotions still filled pinney to the throat when at last he left his cabin and went forward to the smokingroom where he found a number of veteran voyagers enjoying their cigars over the cards which they had already drawn against the tedium of the ocean passage some were not playing but merely smoking and talking with glasses of clear pale strawcolored liquid before them in a group of these the principal speaker seemed to be an american the two men who chorused him were canadians they laughed and applauded with enjoyment of what was national as well as what was individual in his talk  well i never saw a man as mad as old oiseau when he told about that fellow and how he tried to start him out every day to visit his soapmine in the ill as he called it and how the fellow would slip out of it day after day week after week till at last oiseau got tired and gave him the bounce when the first boat came up in the spring he tried to make him believe it would be good for his health to go out prospecting with him let alone making his everlasting fortune but it was no good and all the time oiseau was afraid he would fall into my hands and invest with me i make you a present of im mr markham says he i ave no more use for him if you find him  one of the canadians said i dont suppose he really had anything to invest  why yes that was the curious thing about it he had a belt full of thousanddollar bills round him they found it when he was sick and old oiseau was so afraid that something would happen to him and he would be suspected of it that he nursed him like a brother till he got well and as soon as he was able to get away he bounced him  and what do you suppose was the matter with him that he wouldnt even go to look at oiseaus soapmine  well said the american closing his eyes for the better enjoyment of the analysis and giving a long slow pull at his cigar there might have been any one of several things my idea is that he was a defaulter and the thousanddollar billsthere were forty or fifty of them oiseau sayswere part of the money he got away with then very likely he had no faith in oiseauknew it was probably a soapmine and was just putting him off till he could get away himself or maybe his fever left him a little cracked and he didnt know exactly what he was about then again if my theory of what the man was is true i think that kind of fellow gets a twist simply from what hes done a good many of them must bring money away with them and there are business openings everywhere but you never hear of their going into anything over here  that is odd said the canadian  or would be if it were not so common its the rule here and i dont know an exception the defaulter never does anything with his money except live on it meigs who built those railroads on the andes is the only one who ever showed enterprise and i never understood that it was a private enterprise with him anyway the american defaulter who goes to canada never makes any effort to grow up with the country he simply rests on his laurels or else employs his little savings to negotiate a safe return no sir theres something in defalcation that saps a mans business energies and i dont suppose that old fellow would have been able to invest in oiseaus gold mine if it had opened at his feet and he could have seen the sovereigns ready coined in it he just couldnt i can understand that state of mind though i dont pretend to respect it i can imagine just how the man trembled to go into some speculation and didnt dare to must have been an old hand at it too but it seems as if the money he steals becomes sacred to a man when he gets away with it and he cant risk it  i rather think you could have overcome his scruples markham if you could have got at him said the canadian  perhaps markham assented but i guess i can do better with our stock in england  pinney had let his cigar go out in his excitement he asked markham for a light though there were plenty of matches and markham accepted the request as an overture to his acquaintance  brother yank he suggested  boston  going over  only to rimouski you dont happen to know the name of that defaulter do you  no i dont said markham  i had an idea i knew who it was said pinney  markham looked sharply at him after somebody in rimouski  well not just in that sense exactly if you mean as a detective but im a newspaper man and this is my holiday and im working up a little article about our financiers in exile while im resting my names pinney  markham can fill you up with the latest facts said the canadian going out and hes got a gold mine that beats oiseaus hollow but dont trust him too far i know him hes a partner of mine  that accounts for me said markham with the tolerant light of a muchjoked joker in his eyes with pinney alone he ceased to talk the american which seemed to please his canadian friend and was willing soberly to tell all he knew about oiseaus capitalist whom he merely conjectured to be a defaulter he said the man called himself warwick and professed to be from chicago and then pinney recalled the name and address in the register of his quebec hotel and the date which was about that of northwicks escape but i never dreamt of his using half of his real name and he told markham what the real name was and then he thought it safe to trust him with the nature of his special mission concerning northwick  is there any place on board where a man could go and kick himself he asked  do it here as well as anywhere said markham breaking his cigarash off but pinneys alluring confidence and his simplehearted acknowledgment of his lack of perspicacity had told upon him he felt the fascinating need of helping pinney which pinney was able to inspire in those who respected him least and he said there was a priest who knew this man when he was at haha bay and i believe he has a parish nowyes he has i remember oiseau told meat rimouski youd better look him up  look him up said pinney in a frenzy ill live with him before im in rimouski twenty seconds  he had no trouble in finding père Étienne but after the first hopeful encounter with the sunny surface sweetness of the young priest he found him disposed to be reserved concerning the mr warwick he had known at haha bay it became evident that père Étienne took pinney for a detective and however willing he might have been to save a soul for paradise in the person of the man whose unhappiness he had witnessed he was clearly not eager to help hunt a fugitive down for states prison  even when pinney declared his true character and mission the priests caution exacted all the proofs he could give and made him submit his authorization to an englishspeaking notary of the priests acquaintance then he owned that he had seen mr warwick since their parting at haha bay mr warwick had followed him to rimouski after several weeks and père Étienne knew where he was then living but he was still so anxious to respect the secrecy of a man who had trusted him as far as northwick had that it required all the logic and all the learning of the notary to convince him that mr warwick if he were the largest defaulter ever selfbanished was in no danger of extradition at pinneys hands it was with many injunctions and upon many promises that at last he told pinney where mr warwick was living and furnished him with a letter which was at once warrant and warning to the exile  pinney took the first train back toward quebec he left it at st andré and crossed the st lawrence to malbaie he had no trouble there in finding the little hostelry where mr warwick lodged but pinneys spirit though not of the greatest delicacy had become sensitized toward the defaulter through the scrupulous regard for him shown by père Étienne no loss than by the sense of holding almost a filial relation to him in virtue of his childrens authorization so his heart smote him at the ghastly look he got when he advanced upon warwick where he sat at the inndoor in the morning sun and cheerily addressed him mr northwick i believe  it was the first time northwick had heard his real name spoken since putney had threatened him in the station the dark february morning when he fled from home the name he had worn for the last five months was suddenly no part of him though till that moment it had seemed as much so as the white beard which he had suffered to hide his face  i dont expect you to answer me said pinney feeling the need of taking as well as giving time till youve looked at this letter and of course ive no wish to hurry you if im mistaken and it isnt mr northwick you wont open the letter  he handed him not the letter which père Étienne had given him but the letter suzette northwick had written her father and pinney saw that he recognized the handwriting of the superscription he saw the letter tremble in the old mans hand and heard its crisp rustle as he clutched it to keep it from falling to the ground he could not bear the sight of the longing and the fears that came into his face no hurry no hurry he said kindly and turned away     iii   when pinney came back from the little turn he took northwick was still holding the unopened letter in his hand he stood looking at it in a kind of daze and he was pale and seemed faint  why mr northwick said pinney why dont you read your letter if it hadnt been yours dont i know that youd have given it back to me at once  it isnt that said the man who was so much older and frailer than pinney had expected to find him butare they well is itbad news  no pinney exulted theyre firstrate you neednt be afraid to read the letter pinneys exultation came partly from his certainty that it was really northwick and partly from the pleasure he felt in reassuring him he sympathized with him as a father his pleasure was not marred by the fact that he knew nothing of the state of northwicks family and built his assertion upon the probability that the letter would contain nothing to alarm or afflict him like a glass of water he suggested seeing northwick sit inert and helpless on the steps of the innporch apparently without the force to break the seal of the letter or a little brandy pinney handed him the neat leathercovered flask his wife had reproached him for buying when they came away from home she said he could not afford it but he was glad he had got it now and he unscrewed the stopple with pride in handing it to northwick you look sick  i havent been very well northwick admitted and he touched the bottle with his lips it revived him and pinney now saw that if he would leave him again he would open the letter there was little in it but the tender assurance suzette gave him of their love and the anxiety of adeline and herself to know how and where he was she told him that he was not to feel troubled about them that they were well and unhappy only for him but he must not think they blamed him or had ever done so as soon as they were sure they could reach him she said they would write to him again adeline wrote a few lines with her name to say that for some days past she had not been quite well but that she was better and had nothing to wish for but to hear from him  when pinney came back a second time he found northwick with the letter open in his hand  well sir he said with the easy respectfulness toward northwick that had been replacing ever since he talked with matt hilary the hailfellow manner he used with most men and that had now fully established itself youve got some noble scenery about here he meant to compliment northwick on the beauty of the landscape as people ascribe merit to the inhabitants of a flourishing city  northwick by his silence neither accepted nor disclaimed the credit of the local picturesqueness and pinney ventured to add but you seem to take it out in nature mr northwick the place is pretty quiet sir  northwick paid no heed to this observation either but after sitting mute so long that pinney began to doubt whether he was ever going to speak at all he began to ask some guarded and chary questions as to how pinney had happened to find him pinney had no unwillingness to tell and now he gave him the letter of père Étienne with a eulogy of the priests regard for northwicks interest and safety he told him how markhams talk had caught his attention and northwick tacitly recognized the speculator but when pinney explained that it was the postmark on his letter to the events that gave him the notion of going to rimouski he could see that northwick was curious to know the effect of that letter with the public at first he thought he would let him ask but he perceived that this would be impossible for northwick and he decided to say that letter was a great sensation mr northwick the satisfaction that lighted up northwicks eyes caused pinney to add i guess it set a good many people thinking about you in a different way it showed that there was something to be said on both sides and i believe it made friends for you sir yes sir pinney had never believed this till the moment he spoke but then it seemed so probable he had that he easily affirmed it i dont believe mr northwick he went on but what this trouble could be patched up somehow so that you could come back if you wanted to give em time to think it over a little  as soon as he said this the poison of that ulterior purpose which his wife had forbidden him began to work in pinneys soul he could not help feeling what a grand thing it would be if he could go back with northwick in his train and deliver him over a captive of moral suasion to his countrys courts whatever the result was whether the conviction or the acquittal of northwick the process would be the making of pinney it would carry him to such a height in the esteem of those who knew him that he could choose either career and whether as a reporter or a detective it would give his future the distinction of one of the most brilliant pieces of work in both sorts pinney tried his best to counteract the influence of these ideas by remembering his promises to his wife but it was difficult to recall his promises with accuracy in his wifes absence and he probably owed his safety in this matter more to northwicks temperament than to any virtue of his own  i think i understand how that would be said the defaulter coldly and he began very cautiously to ask pinney the precise effect of his letter as pinney had gathered it from print and hearsay it was not in pinneys nature to give any but a rosecolored and illusory report of this but he felt that northwick was sizing him up while he listened and knew just when and how much he was lying this heightened pinneys respect for him and apparently his divination of pinneys character had nothing to do with northwicks feeling toward him so far as pinney could make out it was friendly enough and as their talk went on he imagined a growing trustfulness in it northwick kept his inferences and conclusions to himself his natural reticence had been intensified by the solitude of his exile it stopped him short of any expression concerning pinneys answers and pinney had to construct northwicks opinions from his questions his own cunning was restlessly at work exploring northwicks motives in each of these and it was not at fault in the belief it brought him that northwick clearly understood the situation at home he knew that the sensation of his offence and flight were past and that so far as any public impulse to punish him was concerned he might safely go back but he knew that the involuntary machinery of the law must begin to operate upon him as soon as he came within its reach and he could not learn from pinney that anything had been done to block its wheels the letter from his daughters threw no light upon this point it was an appeal for some sign of life and love from him nothing more they or the friends who were advising them had not thought it best to tell him more than that they were well and anxious to hear from him and pinney really knew nothing more about them he had not been asked to hatboro to see them before he started and with all the will he had to invent comfortable and attractive circumstances for them he was at a disadvantage for want of material the most that he could conjecture was that mr hilarys family had not broken off their friendly relations with them he had heard old hilary criticised for it and he told northwick so  i guess hes been standing by you mr northwick as far as he consistently could he said and northwick ventured to reply that he expected that it was young hilary who brought me the letter and talked the whole thing up with me pinney added  northwick had apparently not expected this but he let no more than the fact appear he kept silent for a time then he said and you dont know anything about the way theyre living  no i dont said pinney with final candor but i should say they were living along there about as usual mr hilary didnt say but what they were i guess you havent got any cause to be uneasy on that score my idea is mr northwick that they wanted to leave you just as free as they could about themselves they wanted to find out your whereabouts in the land of the living first of all you know that till that letter of yours came out there were a good many that thought you were killed in that accident at wellwater the day you left home  northwick started what accident what do you mean he demanded  why didnt you know about it didnt you see the accounts they had a name like yours amongst the missing and people who thought you were not in it said it was a little job you had put up there was a despatch engaging a pullman seat signed t w northwick  ah i knew it said northwick i knew that i must have signed my real name  well of course said pinney soothingly a man is apt to do that when he first takes another its natural  i never heard of the accident i saw no papers for months i wouldnt and then i was sickthey must have believed i was dead  well sir said pinney i dont know that that follows my wife and myself talked that up a good deal at the time and we concluded that it was about an even thing you see its pretty hard to believe that a friend is dead even when youve seen him die and i dont understand how people that lose friends at a distance can ever quite realize that theyre gone i guess that even if the ladies went upon the theory of the accident there was always a kind of a merciful uncertainty about it and that was my wifes notion too but thats neither here nor there now mr northwick here you are alive and well in spite of all theories to the contrarythough they must have been pretty well exploded by your letter to the eventsand the question is what answer are you going to let me take back to your family you want to send some word dont you my instructions were not to urge you at all and i wont but if i was in your place i know what i should do  northwick did not ask him what it was he would do he fell into a deep silence which it seemed to pinney he would never break and his face became such a blank that all pinneys subtlety was at fault it is doubtful indeed if there was anything definite or directed in the mute misery of northwicks soul it was not a sharp anguish such as a finer souls might have been but it was a real misery of a measure and a quality that he had not felt before now he realized how much he must have made his children suffer perhaps it wrung him the more keenly because it seemed to be an expression of the divine displeasure which he flattered himself he had appeased and was a fatal consequence of his guilt it was a terrible suggestion of the possibility that after all providence might not have been a party to the understanding between them and that his goodwill toward those he had wronged had gone for nothing he had blamed himself for not having tried to retrieve himself and make their losses good it was no small part of his misery now to perceive that anything he might have done would have gone for nothing in this onesided understanding he fetched a long unconscious sigh  why its all over now mr northwick said pinney with a certain amusement at the simpleheartedness of this sigh whose cause he did not misinterpret the question is now about your getting back to them  getting back you know i cant go back said northwick with bitter despair and an openness that he had not shown before  far beneath and within the senses that apprehend the obvious things pinney felt the unhappy man beginning to cling to him he returned joyously i dont know about that now see here mr northwick you believe that im here as your friend dont you that i want to deal in good faith with you northwick hesitated and pinney pursued your daughters letter ought to be a guaranty of that  yes northwick admitted after another hesitation  well then what im going to say is in your interest and youve got to believe that i have some authority for saying it i cant tell you just how much for i dont know as i know myself exactly but i think you can get back if you work it right of course you cant get back for nothing its going to cost you something its going to cost you all youve brought with youpinney watched northwicks impassive face for the next change that should pass upon it he caught it and addedand more but i happen to know that the balance will be forthcoming when its needed i cant say how i know it for i dont exactly know how i know it but i do know it and you know that its for you to take the first step you must say how much money you brought with you and where it is and how it can be got at i should think said pinney with a drop in his earnestness and as if the notion had just occurred to him you would want to see that place of yours again  northwick gave a gasp in the anguish of homesickness the words brought upon him in a flash of what was like a luminous pang he saw it all as it looked the night he left it in the white landscape under the high bare wintry sky you dont know what youre talking about he said with a kind of severity  no pinney admitted i dont suppose any one can begin to appreciate it as you do but i was there just after you skipped  then i was the kind of man who would skip northwick swiftly reflected  and i must say i would take almost any chance of getting back to a place like that why he said with an easy caressing cordiality you cant have any idea how completely the things blown over why sir ill bet you could go back to hatboro now and be there twentyfour hours before anybody would wake up enough to make trouble for you mind i dont say thats what we want you to do we couldnt make terms for you half as well with you on the ground we want you to keep your distance for the present and let your friends work for you like a candidate for the presidency pinney added with a smile hello whos this  a little french maid barefooted blackeyed curlyheaded shyly approached northwick and said diner monsieur  that means dinner northwick gravely interpreted i will ask you to join me  oh thank you i shall be very glad said pinney rising with him they had been sitting on the steps of a structure that pinney now noticed was an oddity among the barksheathed cabins of the little hamlet why whats this  its the studio of an american painter who used to come here he hasnt been here for several years  i suppose you expect to light out if he comes pinney suggested in the spirit of good fellowship towards northwick now thoroughly established in him  he couldnt do me any harm if he wanted to answered northwick with unresentful dignity  no pinney readily acquiesced and i presume youd be glad to hear a little english after all the french you have around  the landlord speaks a little and the priest he is a friend of father Étienne  oh i see said pinney he noticed that northwick walked slowly and weakly he ventured to put his hand under his elbow and northwick did not resent the help offered him  i had a very severe sickness during the latter part of the winter he explained and it pulled me down a good deal  at rimouski i presume said pinney  no said northwick briefly     iv   over the simple dinner which pinney praised for the delicacy of the local lamb and northwick ate of so sparingly northwick talked more freely he told pinney all about his flight and his winter journey up toward the northern verge of the civilized world the picturesque details of this narrative and their capability of distribution under attractive catchheads almost maddened the reporters soul in pinney with longing to make newspaper material of northwick on the spot but he took his honor in both hands and held fast to it only he promised him that if the time ever came when that story could be told it should be both fortune and fame to him  they sat long over their dinner at last pinney pulled out his watch what time did you say the boat for quebec got along here  northwick had not said of course but he now told pinney he knew the time well in the homesickness which mounted to a paroxysm as that hour each day came and went  we must get there some time in the night then said pinney still looking at his watch then lets understand each other about this am i to tell your family where you are or what look here he broke off suddenly why dont you come up to quebec with me youll be just as safe there as you are here you know that and now that your whereabouts are bound to be known to your friends you might as well be where they can get at you by telegraph in case of emergency come what do you say  northwick said simply yes i will go with you  well now youre shouting said pinney cant i help you to put your traps together i want to introduce you to my wife she takes as much interest in this thing as i do and shell know how to look after you a great deal betterget you to quebec once shes the greatest little nurse in this world and as you say you dont seem over and above strong i hope you dont object to children weve got a baby but its the best baby ive heard that child cry just once since it was born and that was when it first realized that it was in this vale of tears i believe we all do that but our baby finished up the whole cryingbusiness on that occasion  with pinney these statements led to others until he had possessed northwick of his whole autobiography he was in high content with himself and his joy overflowed in all manner of affectionate services to northwick which northwick accepted as the mourner entrusts his helplessness to the ghastly kindness of the undertaker and finds in it a sort of human sympathy if northwick had been his own father pinney could not have looked after him with tenderer care in putting his things together for him and getting on board the boat and making interest with the clerk for the best stateroom he did not hesitate to describe him as an american financier he enjoyed saying that he was in canada for his health and that he must have an extra room the clerk gave up the captains as all the others were taken and pinney occupied it with northwick it was larger and pleasanter than the other rooms and after pinney got northwick to bed he sat beside him and talked northwick said that he slept badly and liked to have pinney talk pinney could see that he was uneasy when he left the room and glad when he got back he made up his mind that northwick was somehow a very sick man he lay quite motionless in the lower berth where pinney made him comfortable his hands were folded on his breast and his eyes were closed sometimes pinney as he talked on thought the man was dead and there were times when he invented questions that northwick had to answer yes or no before he felt sure that he was still alive his breath went and came so softly pinney could not hear it  pinney told him all about his courtship and married life and what a prize he had drawn in mrs pinney he said she had been the making of him and if he ever did amount to anything he should owe it to her they had their eye on a little place out of town out wollaston way and pinney was going to try to get hold of it he was tired of being mewed up in a flat and he wanted the baby to get its feet on the ground when it began to walk he wanted to make his rent pay part of his purchase he considered that it was every mans duty to provide a permanent home for his family as soon as he began to have a family and he asked northwick if he did not think a permanent home was the thing  northwick said he thought it was and after he said that he sighed so deeply that pinney said oh i beg your pardon he had in fact lost the sense of northwicks situation and now he recurred to it with a fresh impulse of compassion if his compassion was mixed with interest with business as he would have said it was none the less a genuine emotion and pinney was sincere enough in saying he wished it could be fixed so that northwick could get back to his home at his time of life he needed it  and i dont believe but what it could be fixed he said i dont know much about the points of the case but i should say that with the friends youve got you wouldnt have a great deal of trouble i presume there are some legal forms you would have to go through with but those things can always be appealed and continued and nolle prossed and all that till there isnt anything of them in the end of course it would have been different if they could have got hold of you in the beginning but now said pinney forgetting what he had already said of it the whole thing has blown over so that that letter of yours from rimouski hardly started a ripple in boston i cant say how it was in hatboro no sir i dont believe that if you went back now and your friends stood by you as they ought toi dont believe youd get more than a mere nominal sentence if you got that  northwick made no reply but pinney fancied that his words were having weight with him and he went on i dont know whether youve ever kept the run of these kind of things but a friend of mine has and he says there isnt one case in ten where the law carries straight you see public feeling has got a good deal to do with it and when the people get to feeling that a man has suffered enough the courts are not going to be hard on him no sir ive seen it time and again in my newspaper experience the public respects a mans sufferings and if public opinion cant work the courts it can work the governors council fact is i looked into that business of yours a little after you left mr northwick and i couldnt see exactly why you didnt stay and try to fix it up with the company i believe you could have done it and that was the impression of a good many other newspaper men and theyre pretty good judges theyve seen a lot of life its exciting and its pleasant newspaper work is said pinney straying back again into the paths of autobiography but ive got about enough of it myself the worst of it is there aint any outcome to it the chances of promotion are about as good as they are in the u s army when the reservations are quiet so im going into something else id like to tell you about it if you aint too sleepy  i am rather tired said northwick with affecting patience  oh well then i guess well postpone it till tomorrow itll keep my it dont seem as i was going back to my wife and baby it seems too good to be true every time i leave em i just bet myself i shant get back alive or if i do that i shant find em safe and sound and im just as sure ill win every time as if id never lost the bet yet  pinney undressed rapidly and before he climbed into the berth over northwicks he locked the door and put the key under his pillow northwick did not seem to notice him but a feeling of compunction made him put the key back in the door i guess id better leave it there after all he said itll stop a key from the outside well sir goodnight he added to northwick and climbed to his berth with a light heart toward morning he was wakened by a groaning from the lower berth and he found northwick in great pain he wished to call for help but northwick said the pain would pass and asked him to get him some medicine he had in his handbag and when he had taken that he was easier but he held fast to pinneys hand which he had gripped in one of his spasms and he did not loose it till pinney heard him drawing his breath in the long respirations of sleep then pinney got back to his berth and fell heavily asleep  he knew it was late when he woke the boat was at rest and must be lying at her landing in quebec he heard the passengers outside hurrying down the cabin to go ashore when he had collected himself and recalled the events of the night he was almost afraid to look down at northwick lest he should find him lying dead in his berth when he summoned courage to look he found the berth empty  he leaped out upon the floor and began to throw himself into his clothes he was reassured for a moment by seeing northwicks travellingbag in the corner with his own but the handbag was gone he rushed out as soon as he could make himself decent and searched every part of the boat where northwick might probably be but he was not to be seen  he asked a steward how long the boat had been in and the steward said since six oclock it was then eight  northwick was not waiting for pinney on the wharf and he climbed disconsolately to his hotel in the upper town he bet as a last resource that northwick would not be waiting there for him to give him a pleasant surprise and he won his disastrous wager  it did not take his wife so long to understand what had happened as pinney thought it would she went straight to the heart of the mystery  did you say anything about his going back  whyin a general way pinney admitted ruefully  then of course that made him afraid of you you broke your word ren and its served you right  his wife was walking to and fro with the baby in her arms and she said it was sick and she had been up all night with it she told pinney he had better go out and get a doctor  it was all as different from the return pinney had planned as it could be  i believe the old fool is crazy he said and he felt that this was putting the mildest possible construction upon northwicks behavior  he seems to have known what he was about anyway said mrs pinney coldly the baby began to cry oh do go for the doctor     v   the day was still far from dawning when northwick crept up the silent avenue in the dark of its firs toward his empty house and stealthily began to seek for that home in it which had haunted his sleeping and waking dreams so long he had a kind of ecstacy in the risk he ran a wild pleasure mixed with the terror he felt in being what and where he was he wanted to laugh when he thought of the perfect ease and safety of his return at the same time a thrilling anxiety pierced him through and through and made him take all the precautions of a thief in the night  a thief in the night that was the phrase which kept repeating itself to him till he said it over under his breath as he put off his shoes and stole up the piazzasteps and began to peer into the long windows at the blackness within he did not at once notice that the shutters were open with an effect of reckless security or indifference which struck a pang to his heart when he realized it he felt the evil omen of this faltering in the vigilance which had once guarded his home and which he had been the first to break down and lay it open to spoil and waste he tried the windows he must get in somehow and he did not dare to ring at the door or to call out he must steal into his house as he had stolen out of it  one of the windows yielded the long glass door gave inward and he stepped on the carpetless floor of the library then the fact of the change that must have passed upon the whole house enforced itself and he felt a passionate desire to face and appropriate the change in every detail he lit one of the little taper matches that he had with him and hollowing his hands around it let its glimmer show him the desolation of the dismantled and abandoned rooms he passed through the doors set wide between library and drawingroom and diningroom and hall and then from his dying taper he lit another and mounted the stairs he had no need to seek his daughters rooms to satisfy himself that the whole place was empty they were gone but he had a fantastic expectation that in his own room he might find himself there was nothing there either it was as if he were a ghost come back in search of the body it had left behind any one that met him he thought might well be more frightened than he and yet he did not lose the sense of risk to himself  he had an expectation born of long custom and persisting in spite of the nakedness of the place otherwise that he should see the pictured face of his wife where it had looked so mercifully at him that last night from the portrait above the mantel he sighed lightly to find it gone her chair was gone from the baywindow where he had stood to gaze his last over the possessions he was abandoning he let his little taper die out by the hearth and then crept toward the glimmer of the window and looked out again the conservatories and the dairies and the barns showed plain in the gray of the moonless starless night in the coachmans quarters a little point of light appeared for a moment through the window and then vanished  northwick knew from this that the place was inhabited unless some homeless tramp like himself was haunting it and it went through his confusion that he must speak to newton and caution him about tramps sleeping in the barns anywhere they might set them on fire his mind reverted to his actual condition and he wondered how long he could come and go as a vagrant without being detected if it were not for the action against vagrants which he had urged upon the selectmen the summer before he might now come and go indefinitely but he was not to blame it was because mrs morrell had encouraged the tramps by her reckless charity that something had to be done and now it was working against him it was hard he remembered reading of a man who had left his family one day and taken a room across the street and lived there in sight of them unknown till he died and now he could not have passed his own door without danger of arrest as a vagrant he struck another match and looked at himself in the mirror framed as a window at one side of the bay he believed that with the long white beard he wore and his hair which he had let grow his own children would not have known him  it was bitter but his mind suddenly turned from the thought with a lightness it had and he remembered that now he did not know where his children lived he must find out somehow he had come to see them and he could not go back without he must hurry to find them and be gone again before daylight he crept out to the stairs and struck a match to light himself down and he carried it still burning toward the window he had left open behind him in the library as soon as he stepped out on the piazza he found himself gripped fast in the arms of a man  ive got you what you doing in here id like to know who are you anyway you thief just hold that lantern up to his face a minute lectra  northwick had not tried to resist he had not struggled he had known elbridge newtons voice at the first word he saw the figure of a woman beside him stooping over the lantern and he knew that it was mrs newton but he made no sort of appeal to either he did not make the least sound or movement the habit of his whole life was reticence especially in emergencies and this habit had been strengthened and deepened by the solitude in which he had passed the last halfyear if a knife had been put to his throat he would not have uttered a cry for mercy but his silence was so involuntary that it seemed to him he did not breathe while mrs newton was turning up the wick of the lantern for a good look at him when the light was lifted to his face northwick felt that they both knew him through the disguise of his white beard elbridges grip fell from him and let him stand free well ill be dumned said elbridge  his wife remained holding the lantern to northwicks face what are you going to do with him she asked at last as if northwick were not present he stood so dumb and impassive  i d know as i know said newton overpowered by the peculiar complications of the case he escaped from them for the moment in the probable inference i presume he was lookin for his daughters didnt you know he turned to northwick with a sort of apologetic reproach lightin matches that way in the house here you might set it on fire and youd be sure to make people think there was somebody there anyhow  northwick made no answer to this question and newton looked him carefully over in the light of the lantern i swear hes in his stockin feet you look round and see if you can find his shoes anywhere lectra you got the light newton seemed to insist upon this because it relieved him to delegate any step in this difficult matter to another  his wife cast the light of her lantern about and found the shoes by the piazzasteps and as northwick appeared no more able to move than to speak elbridge stooped down and put on his shoes for him where he stood when he lifted himself he stared again at northwick as if to make perfectly sure of him and then he said with a sigh of perplexity you go ahead a little ways lectra with the lantern i presume weve got to take him to em and his wife usually voluble and wilful silently obeyed  want to see your daughters he asked northwick and at the silence which was his only response newton said well i dont know as i blame him any for not wantin to commit himself you dont want to be afraid he added to northwick that anybodys goin to keep you against your will you know  well i guess not said mrs newton finding her tongue at last if they was to double and treble the reward id slap em in the face first bring him along elbridge  as northwick no more moved than spoke newton took him by the arm and helped him down the piazzasteps and into the dark of the avenue tunnelled about their feet by the light of the lantern as they led and pushed their helpless capture toward the lodge at the avenue gate  northwick had heard and understood them he did not know what secret purpose their pretence of taking him to his children might not cover but he was not capable of offering any resistance and when he reached the cottage he sank passively on the steps he shook in every nerve while elbridge pounded on the door till a window above was lifted and adelines frightened voice quavered out who is it what is it  mrs newton took the words out of her husbands mouth its us miss northwick if youre sure youre awake  oh yes i havent been asleep  then listen said mr newton in a lowered tone and dont be scared dont call outdont speak loud theres somebody herecome down and let him in  northwick stood up he heard the fluttered rush of steps on the stairs inside the door opened and adeline caught him in her arms with choking joyful sobs oh father oh father oh i knew it i knew it oh oh oh where was he how did you find him  she did not heed their answers she did not realize that she was shutting them out when she shut herself in with her father but they understood     vi   northwick stared round him in the light of the lamp which adeline turned up he held fast by one of her hands whats he going to do has he gone for the officer is he going to give me up  who elbridge newton well i guess his wife hasnt forgot what you did for them when their little boy died if he has and i guess he hasnt gone for any officer where did you see him  in the house i was there  but how did he know it  i had to have a light to see by  oh my goodness if anybody else had caught you i dont know what i should have done i dont see how you could be so venturesome  i thought you were there i had to come back i couldnt stand it any longer when that fellow came with your letter  oh he found you she cried joyfully i knew he would find you and i said sosit down father do she pushed him gently into a cushioned rockingchair its mothers chair dont you remember it always stood in the baywindow in your room where she put it louise hilary bought it at the salei know she bought itand gave it to me it was because the place was mothers that i wouldnt let suzette give it up to the company  he did not seem to understand what she was saying he stared at her piteously and he said with an effort adeline i didnt know about that accident i didnt know you thought i was dead or i  no of course you didnt i always told suzette you didnt dont you suppose i always believed in you father we both believed in you through it all and when that letter of yours came out in the paper i knew you were just overwrought  northwick rose and looked fearfully round him again and then came closer to her with his hand in his breast he drew it out with the roll of banknotes in it heres that money i took away with me i always kept it in my belt but it hurt me there i want you should take care of it for me and we can make terms with them to let me stay  oh they wont let you stay weve tried it over and over and the court wont let you they say you will have to be tried and they will put you in prison  northwick mechanically put the money back  well let them said the broken man i cant stand it any longer i have got to stay he sank into the chair and adeline broke into tears  oh i cant let you you must go back think of your good name that theres never been any disgrace on  whatwhats that northwick quavered at the sound of footsteps overhead  why its suzette of course and i hadnt called her said adeline breaking off from her weeping she ran to the foot of the stairs and called huskily suzette suzette come down this instant come down come down come down she bustled back to her father you must be hungry aint you father ill get you a cup of tea over my lamp here the water heats as quick and youll feel stronger after that dont you be afraid of anything theres nobody here but suzette mrs newton comes to do the work in the morning they used to stay with us but we dont mind it a bit being alone here i did want to go into the farmhouse when we left our own but suzette couldnt bear to live right in sight of our home all the time she said it would be worse than being afraid but we havent been afraid and the newtons come all the time to see if we want anything and now that youve got back she stopped and stared at him in a daze and then turned to her lamp again as if unable to cope with the situation i havent been very well lately but im getting better and if only we could get the court to let you come back i should be as well as ever i dont believe but what mr hilary will make it out yet father she dropped her voice and glanced round suzettes engaged to young mr hilaryoh hes the best young manand i guess theyre going to be married just as soon as we can arrange it about you i thought id tell you before she came down  northwick did not seem to have taken the fact in or else he could not appreciate it rightly do you suppose he whispered back that shell speak to me  speak to you  i didnt know she was always so proud but now ive brought back the money all but the little ive had to use  there was a rustle of skirts on the stairs suzette stood a moment in the doorway looking at her father as if not sure he was real then she flung herself upon him and buried her face in his white beard and kissed him with a passion of grief and love she sank into his lap with a long sigh and let her head fall on his shoulder all that was not simply father and daughter was for the moment annulled between them  adeline looked on admiring while she kept about heating the water over her lamp and they all took up fitfully the broken threads of their lives and tried to piece them again into some sort of unity  adeline did most of the talking she told her father how friends seemed to have been raised up for them in their need when it was greatest she praised herself for the inspiration she had in going to putney for advice because she remembered how her father had spoken of him that last night and for refusing to give up the property to the company she praised putney for justifying and confirming her at every step and for doing everything that could be done about the court she praised the hilarys all of them for their constancy to her father throughout and she said she believed that if mr hilary could have had his way there never would have been any trouble at all about the accounts and she wanted her father to understand just how the best people felt about him he listened vaguely to it all a clock in the next room struck four and northwick started to his feet i must go  go adeline echoed  why must you go said suzette clinging about him  they were all silent in view of the necessity that stared them in the face  then adeline roused herself from the false dream of safety in which her words had lulled her she wailed out hes got to go oh suzette let him go hes got to go to prison if he stays  its prison there said northwick let me stay  no no i cant let you stay oh how hard i am to make you go what makes you leave it all to me suzette its for you as much as anything i do it  then dont do it if father wants to stay if he thinks he had better or if he will feel easier he shall stay and you neednt think of me i wont let you think of me  but what would they saymr hilary sayif they sent father to prison  suzettes eyes glowed let them say what they will i know i can trust him but if he wants to give me up for that he may if father wishes to stay he shall and nothing that they can do to him will ever make him different to us if he tells us that he didnt mean anything wrong that will be enough and people may say what they please and think what they please  northwick listened with a confused air he looked from one to the other as if beaten back and forth between them he started violently when adeline almost screamed out oh you dont know what youre talking about father tell her you dont wish to stay  i must go suzette i had better go  here drink this tea now and it will give you a little strength adeline pressed the cup on him that she had been getting ready through all and made him drain it now then hurry hurry hurry father say goodby youve got to go nowyes youve got tobut it wont be for long youve seen us and youve found out were alive and well and now we can writebe sure you write father when you get back there or youd better telegraphand we can arrangei know we canfor you to come home and stay home  home home northwick murmured  it seems as if he wanted to kill me adeline sobbed into her hands she took them away well stay then she said  no no ill go said northwick youre not to blame adeline its all rightall for the best ill go  and let us know where you are when you get there this time father said adeline  yes i will  and we will come to you there suzette put in we can live together in canada as well as here  northwick shook his head its not the same i cant get used to it their business methods are different i couldnt put my capital into any of their enterprises ive looked the whole ground over andand i want to get back into our place  he said these things vaguely almost dryly but with an air of final conviction as after much sober reflection he sat down but adeline would not let him be well then well help you to think out some way of getting back after were all there together go itll soon begin to be light and im afraid somebodyll see you and stop you but oh my goodness how are you going you cant walk and if you try to start from our depot theyll know you some one and theyll arrest you what shall we do  i came over from east hatboro tonight said northwick i am going back there to get the morning train this was the way he had planned and he felt the strength of a fixed purpose in returning to his plan in words  but its three miles adeline shrieked you can never get there in the world in time for the train oh why didnt i tell elbridge to come for you i must go and tell him to get ready right away  no ill go said suzette adeline  adeline flung the door open and started back with a cry from the dark vanlike vehicle before the door which looked like the black maria or an undertakers wagon in the pale light  its me said elbridges voice from the front of it and elbridges head dimly showed itself i got to thinkin maybe youd want the carryall and i didnt know but what id better go and hitch up anyway  oh well we did cried adeline with an hysterical laugh here now father get right in dont lose a second kiss suzette goodby be sure you get him to east hatboro in time for the fourforty elbridge she helped her father shaking and stumbling into the shelter of the curtained carryall if anybody tries to stop you  id like to see anybody try to stop me said elbridge and he whipped up his horse then he leaned back toward northwick and said im going to get the black colts time out of the old mare  which mare is it northwick asked     vii   on his way home from the station elbridge newton began to have some anxieties he had no longer occasion for any about northwick he was safe on his way back to canada and elbridges anxieties were for himself he was in the cold fit after his act of ardent generosity he had no desire to entangle himself with the law by his act of incivism in helping northwick to escape and he thought it might be well to put himself on the safe side by seeing putney about it and locking the stable after the horse was stolen  he drove round by the lawyers house and stopped at his gate just as putney pushed his lawnmower up to it in his exercise of the instrument before breakfast  elbridge leaned out of the carryall and asked in a low confidential voice if j milton northwick was to come back here on the sly say to see his family and i was to help him git off again would i be lible  why asked putney  because i just done it said elbridge desperately  just done it shouted putney why confound you he suddenly brought his voice down do you mean to tell me the fellows been back here and you didnt let me know  i hadnt any orders to do it elbridge weakly urged  orders the devil putney retorted id a given a hundred dollars to see that man and talk with him come now tell me all you know about it dont miss a thing after a few words from newton he broke out found him in the house and i was down there prowling round the place myself not three hours before go on great scott just think of it  putney was at one of those crises of his life when his drinkdevil was besetting him with sore temptation and for the last twentyfour hours he had been fighting it with the ruses and pretences which he had learned to employ against it but he felt that he was losing the game though he was playing for much greater stakes than usual he had held out so long since his last spree that if he lost now he would defeat hopes that were singularly precious and sacred to him the hopes that those who loved him best and distrusted him most and forgave him soonest had begun to cherish it would not break his wifes heart she was used to his lapses but it would wring it more cruelly than usual if he gave way now  when the fiend thrust him out of his house the night before he knew that she knew of it though she let him go in that fearful company and made no effort to keep him he was so strait an agnostic that as he boasted he had no superstitions even but his relation to the northwicks covered the period of his longest resistance of temptation and by a sort of instinctive brute impulse he turned his step towards the place where they lived as if there might be rescue for him in the mere vicinity of those women who had appealed to him in their distress as to a faithful enemy his professional pride his personal honor were both involved in the feeling that he must not fail them their implicit reliance had been a source of strength to him he was always hoping for some turn of affairs which would enable him to serve them or rather to serve adeline for he cared little for suzette or only secondarily and since pinney had gone upon his mission to canada he was daily looking for this chance to happen he must keep himself for that and not because of them alone but because those dearest to him had come tacitly to connect his resistance of the tempter with his zeal for the interests of his clients with no more reasoned motives than these he had walked over the northwick place calling himself a fool for supposing that some virtue should enter into him out of the ground there and yet finding a sort of relief in the mere mechanical exercise the novelty of exploring by night the property grown so familiar to him by day and so strangely mixed up with the great trial and problem of his own usefulness  he listened by turns with a sinking and a rising heart as newton now dug the particulars of his adventure out of himself at the end he turned to go into the house  well what do you say squire putney elbridge called softly after him  say  you know about what i done  keep your mouth shut about what you done i should like to see you sent to jail though for what you didnt do  elbridge felt a consolatory quality in putneys resentment and putney already busy with the potentialities of the future was buoyed up by the strong excitement of what had actually happened rather than finally cast down by what he had missed he took three cups of the blackest coffee at breakfast and he said to the mute anxious face of his wife well ellen i seem to be pulling through somehow     viii   adeline was in a flutter of voluble foreboding till elbridge came back she asked suzette whether she believed their father would get away she said she knew that elbridge would miss the train with that slow old mare and their father would be arrested weak as she was from the sickbed she had left to welcome him she dressed herself carefully so as to be ready for the worst she was going to jail with him if they brought him back she had made up her mind to that from time to time she went out and looked up the road to see if elbridge was coming back alone or whether the officers were bringing her father she expected they would bring him first to his family she did not know why suzette tried to keep her indoors to make her lie down she refused with wild upbraidings she declared that suzette had never cared anything for her father she had wanted to give their mothers property away to please the hilarys and now that she was going to marry matt hilary she was perfectly indifferent to everything else she asked suzette what had come over her  elbridge drove first to the stable and put up his horse when he came back then he walked to the lodge to report  is he safe did he get away where is he adeline shrieked at him before he could get a word out  hes all right miss northwick elbridge answered soothingly hes on his way back to canady again  then ive driven him away she lamented ive hunted him out of his home and i shall never see him any more send for him send for him bring him back i tell you go right straight after him and tell him i said to come back what are you standing there for  she fell fainting elbridge helped suzette carry her upstairs to her bed and then ran to get his wife to stay with them while he went for the doctor  matt hilary had been spending the night at the rectory with wade and he walked out to take leave of suzette once more before he went home he found the doctor just driving away miss northwick seems not so well said the doctor im very glad you happen to be here on all accounts i shall come again later in the day  matt turned from the shadow of mystery the doctors manner left and knocked at the door it was opened by suzette almost before he touched it  come in she said in a low voice whose quality fended him from her almost as much as the conditional look she gave him the excited babble of the sick woman overhead mixed with mrs newtons nasal attempts to quiet her broke in upon their talk  mr hilary said suzette formally are you willing my father should come back no matter what happens  if he wishes to come back you know what i have always said  and you would not care if they put him in prison  i should care very much  you would be ashamed of me  no never what has it to do with you  then she pursued he has come back he has been here she flashed all the fact upon him in vivid rapid phrases and he listened with an intelligent silence that stayed and comforted her as no words could have done before she had finished his arms were round her and she felt how inalienably faithful he was and now adeline is raving to have him come back again and stay she thinks she drove him away she will die if something cant be done she says she would not let him stay becausebecause you would be ashamed of us she says i would be ashamed  suzette sue adeline called down from the chamber above dont you let mr hilary go before i get there i want to speak to him and while they stared helplessly at each other they heard her saying to mrs newton yes i shall too im perfectly rested now and i shall go down i should think i knew how i felt i dont care what the doctor said and if you try to stop me she came clattering down the stairs in the boots which she had pulled loosely on and as soon as she showed her excited face at the door she began ive thought out a plan mr hilary and i want you should go and see mr putney about it you ask him if it wont do they can get father let out on bail when he comes back and i can be his bail and then when theres a trial they can take me instead of him it wont matter to the court which they have as long as they have somebody now you go and ask mr putney i know hell say so for hes thought just as i have about fathers case all along will you go  will you go up and lie down again adeline if mr hilary will go suzette asked like one dealing with a capricious child  what do you all want me to lie down for adeline turned upon her im perfectly well and do you suppose i can rest with such a thing on my mind if you want me to rest youd better let him go and find out what mr putney says i think wed better all go to canada and bring father back with us he isnt fit to travel alone or with strangers he needs some one that understands his ways and im going to him just as soon as mr putney approves of my plan and i know he will but i dont want mr hilary to lose any time now i want to be in quebec about as soon as father is will you go  yes miss northwick said matt taking her tremulous hand ill go to mr putney and ill see my father again and whatever can be done to save your father any further suffering or yourself  i dont care for myself she said plucking her hand away im young and strong and i can bear it but its father im so anxious about  she began to cry and at a look from suzette matt left them as he walked along up toward the village in mechanical compliance with adelines crazy wish he felt more and more the deepening tragedy of the case and the inadequacy of all compromises and palliatives there seemed indeed but one remedy for the trouble and that was for northwick to surrender himself and for them all to meet the consequences together he realized how desperately homesick the man must have been to take the risks he had run in stealing back for a look upon the places and the faces so dear to him his heart was heavy with pity for him one might call him coward and egotist all one would at the end remained the fact of a love which if it could not endure heroically was still a deep and strong affection doubtless the deepest and strongest thing in the mans weak and shallow nature it might be his truest inspiration and if it prompted him to venture everything and to abide by whatever might befall him for the sake of being near those he loved and enjoying the convicts wretched privilege of looking on them now and then who should gainsay him  matt took wade in on his way to putneys office to lay this question before him and he answered it for him in the same breath certainly no one less deeply concerned than the mans own flesh and blood could forbid him  im not sure said wade that even his own flesh and blood would have a supreme right there it may be that love and not duty is the highest thing in life oh i know how we reason it away and say that true love is unselfish and can find its fruition in the very sacrifice of our impulses and we are fond of calling our impulses blind but god alone knows whether they are blind the reasoned sacrifice may satisfy the higher soul but what about the simple and primitive natures which it wont satisfy  for answer matt told how northwick had come back at the risk of arrest for an hour with his children and was found in the empty house that had been their home and brought to them how he had besought them to let him stay but they had driven him back to his exile matt explained how he was on his way to the lawyer at adelines frantic demand to go all over the case again and see if something could not be done to bring northwick safely home he had himself no hope of finding any loophole in the law through which the fugitive could come and go if he returned matt felt sure that he would be arrested and convicted but he was not sure that this might not be the best thing for all you know he said ive always believed that if he could voluntarily submit himself to the penalty of his offence the penalty would be the greatest blessing for him on earth the only blessing for his ruined life  yes wade answered we have always thought alike about that and perhaps this torment of longing for his home and children may be the divine means of leading him to accept the only mercy possible with god for such a sufferer if there were no one but him concerned we could not hesitate in urging him to return but the innocent who must endure the shame of his penalty with him  they are ready for that would it be worse than what they have learned to endure  perhaps not but i was not thinking of his children alone you yourself matt your family  matt threw up his arms impatiently and made for the door theres no question of me and if they could not endure their portionthe mere annoyance of knowing the slight for them in the minds of vulgar peoplei should be ashamed of them  well you are right matt said his friend god bless you and guide you added the priest  the lawyer had not yet come to his office and matt went to find him at his house putney had just finished his breakfast and they met at his gate and he turned back indoors with matt well you know whats happened i see he said after the first glance at matts face  yes i know and now what can be done are you sure weve considered every point isnt there some chance  putney shook his head and then bit off a piece of tobacco before he began to talk ive been over the whole case in my mind this morning and im perfectly certain there isnt the shadow of a chance of his escaping trial if he gives himself up thats what you mean i suppose  yes thats what i mean said matt with a certain disappointment he supposed he had nerved himself for the worst but he found he had been willing to accept something short of it  at times im almost sorry he got off said putney if we could have kept him and surrendered him to the law i believe we could have staved off the trial though we couldnt have prevented it and i believe we could have kept him out of states prison on the ground of insanity matt started impatiently oh i dont mean that it could be shown that he was of unsound mind when he used the companys funds and tampered with their books though i have my own opinion about that but i feel sure that hes of unsound mind at present and i believe we could show it so clearly in court that the prosecution would find it impossible to convict we could have him sent to the insane asylum and that would be a creditable exit from the affair in the public eye it would have a retroactive effect that would popularly acquit him of the charges against him  putney could not forego a mischievous enjoyment of matts obvious discomfort at this suggestion his fierce eyes blazed but he added seriously why shouldnt he have the advantage of the truth if that is the truth about him and i believe it is i think it could be honestly and satisfactorily proved from his history ever since the defalcation came out that his reason is affected his whole conduct so far as i know it shows it and i should like a chance to argue the case in court and i feel pretty sure i shall yet im just as certain as i sit here that he will come back again he cant keep away and another time he may not fall into the hands of friends it will be a good while before any rumor of last nights visit gets out but it will get out at last and then the detectives will be on the watch for him perhaps it will be just as well for us if he falls into their hands if we produced him in court it might be more difficult to work the plea of insanity but i do think the mans insane and i should go into the case with a full and thorough persuasion on that point did he tell them where to find him in canada  he promised to let them know  i doubt if he does said putney he means to try coming back again the secrecy hes kept as to his whereaboutsthe perfectly needless and motiveless secrecy as far as his children are concernedwould be a strong point in favor of the theory of insanity yes sir i believe the thing could be done and i should like to do it if the pressure of our life produces insanity of the homicidal and suicidal type theres no reason why it shouldnt produce insanity of the defalcational type the conditions tend to produce it in a proportion that is simply incalculable and i think its time that jurisprudence recognized the fact of such a mental disease say as defalcomania if the fight for money and material success goes on with the opportunities that the accumulation of vast sums in a few hands afford what is to be the end  matt had no heart for the question of metaphysics or of economics whichever it was that would have attracted him in another mood he went back to suzette and addressed himself with her to the task of quieting her sister adeline would be satisfied with nothing less than the assurance that putney agreed with her that her father would be acquitted if he merely came back and gave himself up she had changed to this notion in matts absence and with the mental reservation which he permitted himself he was able to give the assurance she asked then at last she consented to go to bed and wait for the doctors coming before she began her preparations for joining her father in canada she did not relinquish that purpose she felt sure that he never could get home without her and suzette must come too     ix   the fourth morning when pinney went down into the hotel office at quebec after a trying night with his sick child and its anxious mother he found northwick sitting there he seemed to pinney a part of the troubled dream he had waked from  well where under the sun moon and stars have you been he demanded taking the chance that this phantasm might be flesh and blood  a gleam of gratified slyness lit up the haggardness of northwicks face ive been at homeat hatboro  come off said pinney astounded out of the last remnant of deference he had tried to keep for northwick he stood looking incredulously at him a moment come in to breakfast and tell me about it if i could only have it for a scoop  northwick ate with wolfish greed and as the victuals refreshed and fortified him he came out with his story slowly bit by bit pinney listened with mute admiration well sir he said its the biggest thing i ever heard of but his face darkened i suppose you know it leaves me out in the cold i came up here he explained as the agent of your friends to find you and i did find you but if youve gone and given the whole thing away i cant ask anything for my services  northwick seemed interested and even touched by the hardship he had worked to pinney they dont know where i am now he suggested  are you willing i should take charge of the case from this on asked pinney  yes onlydont leave me said northwick with tremulous dependence  you may be sure i wont let you out of my sight again said pinney he took a telegraphic blank from his breast pocket and addressed it to matt hilary our friend here all right with me at murdocks hotel he counted the words to see that there were no more than ten then he called a waiter and sent the despatch to the office tell em to pay it and set it down against me tell em to rush it  pinney showed himself only less devoted to northwick than to his own wife and child his walks and talks were all with him and as the baby got better he gave himself more and more to the intimacy established with him and northwick seemed to grow more and more reliant on pinneys filial cares mrs pinney shared these as far as the baby would permit and she made the silent refugee at home with her she had her opinion of his daughters who did not come to him now that they knew where he was but she concealed it from him and helped him answer suzettes letters when he said he was not feeling quite well enough to write himself adeline did not write suzette always said she was not quite well but was getting better then in one of suzettes letters there came a tardy confession that adeline was confined to her bed she was tormented with the thought of having driven him away and suzette said she wished her to write and tell him to come back or to let them come to him she asked him to express some wish in the matter so that she could show his answer to adeline suzette wrote that mr hilary had come over from his farm and was staying at elbridge newtons to be constantly near them and in fact matt was with them when adeline suddenly died they had not thought her dangerously sick till the very day of her death when she began to sink rapidly  in the letter that brought this news suzette said that if they had dreamed of present danger they would have sent for their father to come back at any hazard and she lamented that they had all been so blind the newtons would stay with her till she could join him in quebec or if he wished to return she and matt were both of the same mind about it they were ready for any event but matt felt that he ought to know there was no hope of his escaping a trial if he returned and that he ought to be left perfectly free to decide adeline would be laid beside her mother  the old man broke into a feeble whimper as mrs pinney read him the last words pinney walking softly up and down with the baby in his arms whimpered too  i believe he could be got off if he went back he said to his wife in a burst of sympathy when northwick had taken his letter away to his own room  the belief generous in itself began to mix with selfinterest in pinneys soul he conscientiously forbore to urge northwick to return but he could not help portraying the flattering possibilities of such a course before they parted for pinneys own return he confided his ambition for the future to northwick and as delicately as he could he suggested that if northwick ever did make up his mind to go back he could not find a more interested and attentive travellingcompanion northwick seemed to take the right view of the matter the business view and pinney thought he had arranged a difficult point with great tact but he modestly concealed his success from his wife they both took leave of the exile with affection and mrs pinney put her arms round his neck and kissed him he promised her that he would take good care of himself in her absence pinney put a business address in his hand at the last moment  northwick seemed to have got back something of his moral force after these people who had so strangely become his friends left him to his own resources once more he began to dream of employing the money he had with him for making more and paying back the ponkwasset companys forced loans he positively forbade suzettes coming to him as she proposed after adelines funeral he telegraphed to prevent her undertaking the journey and he wrote saying he wished to be alone for a while and to decide for himself the question of his fate he approved of matts wish that they should be married at once and he replied to matt with a letter decently observant of the peculiar circumstances recognizing the reluctance his father and mother might well feel and expressing the hope that he was acting with their full and free consent if this letter could have been produced in court it would have told heavily against putneys theory of a defence on the ground of insanity it was so clear and just and reasonable though perhaps an expert might have recognized a mental obliquity in its affirmation of northwicks belief that matts father would yet come to see his conduct in its true light and to regard him as the victim of circumstances which he really was  among the friends of the hilarys there was misgiving on this point of their approval of matts marriage some of them thought that the parents hands had been forced in the blessing they gave it old bromfield corey expressed a general feeling to hilary with senile frankness hilary you seem to have disappointed the expectation of the admirers of your iron firmness i tell em thats what you keep for your enemies but they seem to think that in matts case you ought to have been more of a roman father  im just going to become one said hilary with the good temper proper to that moment of the dinner mrs hilary and louise are taking me over to rome for the winter  you dont say so you dont say said corey i wish my family would take me boston is gradually making an old man of me im afraid it will end by killing me     x   northwick after the pinneys went home lapsed into a solitude relieved only by the daily letters that suzette sent him he shrank from the offers of friendly kindness on the part of people at the hotel who pitied his loneliness and he began to live in a dream of his home again he had relinquished that notion of attempting a new business life which had briefly revived in his mind the same causes that had operated against it in the beginning controlled and defeated it now he felt himself too old to begin life over his energies were spent such as he had been he had made himself very slowly and cautiously in familiar conditions he had never been a man of business dash and he could not pick himself up and launch himself in a new career as a man of different make might have done even at his age perhaps there had been some lesion of the will in that fever of his at haha bay which disabled him from forming any distinct purpose or from trying to carry out any such purpose as he did form perhaps he was in his helplessness merely of that refugeetype which exile moulds men to a thing of memories and hopes without definite aims or plans  as the days passed he dwelt in an outward inertness while his dreams and longings incessantly rehabilitated the home whose desolation he had seen with his own eyes it would be better to go back and suffer the sentence of the law and then go to live again in the place which in spite of his senses he could only imagine clothed in the comfort and state that had been stripped from it elbridges talk on the way to west hatboro about the sale and what had become of the horses and cattle and the plants went for no more than the evidence of his own eyes that they were all gone he did not realize except in the shocks that the fact imparted at times that death as well as disaster had invaded his home adeline was for the most part still alive in his fond reveries she was present and part of that home as she had always been  he began to flatter himself that if he went back he could contrive that compromise with the court which his friends had failed to bring about he persuaded himself that if it came to a trial he could offer evidence that would result in his acquittal but if he must undergo some punishment for the offence of being caught in transactions which were all the time carried on with impunity he told himself that interest could be used to make his punishment light in these hopeful moods it was a necessity of his drama that his transgression of the law should seem venial to him it was only when he feared the worst that he felt guilty of wrong  it could not be said that these moments of a consciousness of guilt were so frequent as ever to become confluent and to form a mood they came and went perhaps toward the last they were more frequent what seems certain is that in the end there began to mix with his longing for home a desire feeble and formless enough for expiation there began to be suggested to him from somewhere somehow something like the thought that if he had really done wrong there might be rest and help in accepting the legal penalty disproportionate and excessive as it might be he tried to make this notion appreciable to pinney when they first met after he summoned pinney to quebec he offered it as an explanation of his action  in making up his mind to return at all hazards and to take all the chances he remembered what pinney had said to him about his willingness to bear him company it was not wholly a generous impulse that prompted him to send for pinney or the selfsacrificing desire to make pinneys fortune in his new quality of detective he simply dreaded the long journey alone he wanted the comfort of pinneys society he liked pinney and he longed for the vulgar cheerfulness of his buoyant spirit he felt that he could rest upon it in the fate he was bringing himself to face he instinctively desired the kindly lying sympathy of a soul that had so much affinity with his own he telegraphed pinney to come for him and he was impatient till he came  pinney started the instant he received northwicks telegram and met him with an enthusiasm of congratulation well mr northwick this is a great thing its the right thing and its the wise thing its going to have a tremendous effect i suppose he added a little tremulously that youve thought it all thoroughly over  yes im prepared for the worst said northwick  oh there wont be any worst pinney returned gayly therell be legal means of delaying the trial your lawyer can manage that or if he cant and you have to face the music at once we can have you brought into court without the least publicity and the judge will go through with the forms and itll be all over before anybody knows anything about it ill see that theres no interviewing and that there are no reporters present therell probably be a brief announcement among the cases in court but there wont be anything painful you neednt be afraid but what im anxious about now is not to bring any influence to bear on you i promised my wife i wouldnt urge you and i wont i know im a little optimistic and if you dont see this thing exactly couleur de rose dont you do it from anything i say pinney apparently put great stress upon himself to get this out  ive looked it in the face said northwick  and your friends know youre coming back  they expect me at any time you can notify them  pinney drew a long anxious breath well he said with a sort of desperation then i dont see why we dont start at once  have you got your papers all right northwick asked  yes said pinney with a blush but you know he added respectfully i cant touch you till we get over the line mr northwick  i understand that let me see your warrant  pinney reluctantly produced the paper and northwick read it carefully over he folded it up with a deep sigh and took a long stiff envelope from his breastpocket and handed it to pinney with the warrant here is the money i brought with me  mr northwick it isnt necessary yet indeed it isnt ive every confidence in your honor as a gentleman pinneys eyes glowed with joy and his fingers closed upon the envelope convulsively but if you mean business  i mean business said northwick count it  pinney took the notes out and ran them over fortyone thousand six hundred and forty  that is right said northwick now another matter have you got handcuffs  why mr northwick what are you giving me demanded pinney id as soon put them on my own father  i want you to put them on me said northwick i intend to go back as your prisoner if i have anything to expiateand he seemed to indulge a question of the fact for the last timei want the atonement to begin as soon as possible if you havent brought those things with you youd better go out to the police station and get them while i attend to the tickets  oh i neednt go said pinney and his face burned  he was full of nervous trepidation at the start and throughout the journey he was anxious and perturbed while on northwick after the first excitement a deep quiet a stupor or a spiritual peace seemed to have fallen  by george said pinney when they started anybody to see us would think you were taking me back he was tenderly watchful of northwicks comfort he left him free to come and go at the stations from the restaurants he bought him things to tempt his appetite but northwick said he did not care to eat  they had a long night in a daycar for they found there was no sleeper on their train in the morning when the day broke northwick asked pinney what the next station was  pinney said he did not know he looked at northwick as if the possession of him gave him very little pleasure and asked him how he had slept  i havent slept said northwick i suppose im rather excited my nerves seem disordered  well of course said pinney soothingly  they were silent a moment and then northwick asked what did you say the next station was  ill ask the brakeman they could see the brakeman on the platform pinney went out to him and returned its wellwater he says we get breakfast there  then were over the line now said northwick  why yes pinney admitted reluctantly he added in a livelier note you get a mighty good breakfast at wellwater and im ready to meet it half way he turned and looked hard at northwick if i should happen to get left there what would you do would you keep on anyway is your mind still made up on that point i ask because all kinds of accidents happen and pinney stopped and regarded his captive fixedly or if you dont feel quite able to travel  let me see your warrant again said northwick  pinney relaxed his gaze with a shrug and produced the paper northwick read it all once more im your prisoner he said returning the paper you can put the handcuffs on me now  no no mr northwick pinney pleaded i dont want to do that im not afraid of your trying to get away i assure you it isnt necessary between gentlemen  northwick held out his wrists put them on please  oh well if i must protested pinney but i swear i wont lock em he glanced round to find whether any of the other passengers were noticing you can slip em off whenever you get tired of em he pushed northwicks sleeves down over them with shamefaced anxiety dont let people see the damned things for gods sake  thats good murmured northwick as if the feel of the iron pleased him  the incident turned pinney rather sick he went out on the platform of the car for a little breath of air and some restorative conversation with the brakeman when he came back northwick was sitting where he left him his head had fallen on his breast poor old fellow hes asleep pinney thought he put his hand gently on northwicks shoulder ill have to wake you here he said well be in now in a minute  northwick tumbled forward at his touch and pinney caught him round the neck and lifted his face  oh my god hes dead  the loosened handcuffs fell on the floor     xi   after they were married suzette and matt went to live on his farm and it was then that she accomplished a purpose she had never really given up she surrendered the whole place at hatboro to the company her father had defrauded she had no sentiment about the place such as had made the act impossible to adeline and must have prevented the sacrifice on suzettes part as long as her sister lived but suffering from that and from all other earthly troubles was past for adeline she was dead and suzette felt it no wrong to her memory to put out of her own hands the property which something higher than the logic of the case forbade her to keep as far as her father was concerned she took his last act as a sign that he wished to make atonement for the wrong he had committed and she felt that the surrender of this property to his creditors was in the line of his endeavor she had strengthened herself to bear his conviction and punishment if he came back and since he was dead this surrender of possessions tainted for her with the dishonesty in which the unhappy man had lived was nothing like loss it was rather a joyful relief  yet it was a real sacrifice and she was destined to feel it in the narrowed conditions of her life but she had become used to narrow conditions she had learned how little people could live with when they had apparently nothing to live for and now that in matt she had everything to live for the surrender of all she had in the world left her incalculably rich  matt rejoiced with her in her decision though he had carefully kept himself from influencing it he was poor too except for the comfortable certainty that his father could not let him want but so far as he had been able he had renounced his expectations from his fathers estate in order that he might seem to be paying northwicks indebtedness to the company doubtless it was only an appearance in the end the money his father left would come equally to himself and louise but in the meantime the restitution for northwick did cramp eben hilary more for the moment than he let his son know so he thought it well to allow matt to go seriously to work on account of it and to test his economic theories in the attempt to make his farm yield him a living it must be said that the prospect dismayed neither matt nor suzette there was that in her life which enabled her to dispense with the world and its pleasures and favors and he had long ceased to desire them  the ponkwasset directors had no hesitation in accepting the assignment of property made them by northwicks daughter as a corporate body they had nothing to do with the finer question of right involved they looked at the plain fact that they had been heavily defrauded by the former owner of the property who had inferably put it out of his hands in view of some such contingency as he had finally reached and as it had remained in the possession of his family ever since they took no account of the length of time that had elapsed since he was actually the owner they recognized the propriety of his daughters action in surrendering it and no member of the board was quixotic enough to suggest that the company had no more claim upon the property she conveyed to them than upon any other piece of real estate in the commonwealth  they considered said putney who had completed the affair on the part of suzette and was afterwards talking it over with his crony dr morrell in something of the bitterness of defeat that their first duty was to care for the interests of their stockholders who seemed to turn out all widows and orphans as nearly as i could understand it appears as if nobody but innocents of that kind live on the ponkwasset dividends and it would have been inhuman not to look after their interests well he went on breaking from this grievance theres this satisfactory thing about it somebody has done something at last that he intended to do and of course the he in question is a she she that was miss suzette is the only person connected with the whole affair thats had her way everybody elses way has come to nothing beginning with my own i can look back to the time when i meant to have the late j milton northwicks blood i was lying low for years waiting for him to do just what he did do at last and i expected somehow by the blessing of god to help run him down or bring him to justice as we say the first thing i knew i turned up his daughters counsel and was devoting myself to the interests of a pair of grassorphans with the high and holy zeal of a board of directors all i wanted was to have j milton brought to trial not so i could help send him to states prison with a band of music but so i could get him off on the plea of insanity but i wasnt allowed to have my way even in a little thing like that and of all the things that were planned for and against and round about northwick just one has been accomplished the directors failed to be in at the death and old hilary has had to resign from the board and pay the defaulters debts pinney i understand considers himself a ruined man hes left off detecting for a living and gone back to interviewing poor old adeline lived in the pious hope of making northwicks old age comfortable in their beautiful home on the money he had stolen and now that shes dead it goes to his creditors why even billy gerrish a highminded publicspirited man like william b gerrishcouldnt have his way about northwick no sir northwick himself couldnt look how he fooled away his time there in canada after he got off with money enough to start him on the high road to fortune again he couldnt budge of his own motion and the only thing he really tried to do he failed in disgracefully adeline wouldnt let him stay when he come back to buy himself off and that killed her then when he started home again to take his punishment the first thing he did was to drop dead justice herself couldnt have her way with northwick but im not sorry he slipped through her fingers there wasnt the stuff for an example in northwick i dont know that hes much of a warning he just seems to be a kind ofincident and a pretty common kind he was a mere creature of circumstanceslike the rest of us his environment made him rich and his environment made him a rogue sometimes i think there was nothing to northwick except what happened to him hes a puzzle but what do you say doc to a world where we fellows keep fuming and fizzing away with our little aims and purposes and the great ball of life seems to roll calmly along and get where its going without the slightest reference to what we do or dont do i suppose its wicked to be a fatalist but ill go a few æons of eternal punishment more and keep my private opinion that its all fate  why not call it law the doctor suggested  well i dont like to be too bold but taking it by and
