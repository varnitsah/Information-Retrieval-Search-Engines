about censorship           vague thoughts on art     about censorship  since time and again it has been proved in this country of free institutions that the great majority of our fellowcountrymen consider the only censorship that now obtains amongst us namely the censorship of plays a bulwark for the preservation of their comfort and sensibility against the spiritual researches and speculations of bolder and too active spiritsit has become time to consider whether we should not seriously extend a principle so grateful to the majority to all our institutions  for no one can deny that in practice the censorship of drama works with a smooth swiftnessa lack of delay and friction unexampled in any public office  no troublesome publicity and tedious postponement for the purpose of appeal mar its efficiency  it is neither hampered by the law nor by the slow process of popular election  welcomed by the overwhelming majority of the public objected to only by such persons as suffer from it and a negligible faction who wedded pedantically to liberty of the subject are resentful of summary powers vested in a single person responsible only to his own conscienceit is amazingly triumphantly successful  why then in a democratic state is so valuable a protector of the will the interests and pleasure of the majority not bestowed on other branches of the public being  opponents of the censorship of plays have been led by the absence of such other censorships to conclude that this office is an archaic survival persisting into times that have outgrown it  they have been known to allege that the reason of its survival is simply the fact that dramatic authors whose reputation and means of livelihood it threatens have ever been few in number and poorly organisedthat the reason in short is the helplessness and weakness of the interests concerned  we must all combat with force such an aspersion on our legislature  can it even for a second be supposed that a state which gives trial by jury to the meanest poorest most helpless of its citizens and concedes to the greatest criminals the right of appeal could have debarred a body of reputable men from the ordinary rights of citizenship for so cynical a reason as that their numbers were small their interests unjoined their protests feeble  such a supposition were intolerable  we do not in this country deprive a class of citizens of their ordinary rights we do not place their produce under the irresponsible control of one not amenable to law by any sort of political accident  that would indeed be to laugh at justice in this kingdom  that would indeed be cynical and unsound  we must never admit that there is no basic justice controlling the edifice of our civic rights  we do we must conclude that a just and wellconsidered principle underlies this despotic institution for surely else it would not be suffered to survive for a single moment  pom  pom  if then the censorship of plays be just beneficent and based on a wellconsidered principle we must rightly inquire what good and logical reason there is for the absence of censorship in other departments of the national life  if censorship of the drama be in the real interests of the people or at all events in what the censor for the time being conceives to be their interestthen censorships of art literature religion science and politics are in the interests of the people unless it can be proved that there exists essential difference between the drama and these other branches of the public being  let us consider whether there is any such essential difference  it is fact beyond dispute that every year numbers of books appear which strain the average readers intelligence and sensibilities to an unendurable extent books whose speculations are totally unsuited to normal thinking powers books which contain views of morality divergent from the customary and discussions of themes unsuited to the young person books which in fine provide the greater public with no pleasure whatsoever and either by harrowing their feelings or offending their good taste cause them real pain  it is true that precisely as in the case of plays the public are protected by a vigilant and critical press from works of this description that further they are protected by the commercial instinct of the libraries who will not stock an article which may offend their customersjust as in the case of plays the public are protected by the commonsense of theatrical managers that finally they are protected by the police and the common law of the land  but despite all these protections it is no uncommon thing for an average citizen to purchase one of these disturbing or dubious books  has he on discovering its true nature the right to call on the bookseller to refund its value  he has not  and thus he runs a danger obviated in the case of the drama which has the protection of a prudential censorship  for this reason alone how much better then that there should exist a paternal authority some no doubt will call it grandmaternalbut sneers must not be confounded with argument to suppress these books before appearance and safeguard us from the danger of buying and possibly reading undesirable or painful literature  a specious reason however is advanced for exempting literature from the censorship accorded to plays  heit is saidwho attends the performance of a play attends it in public where his feelings may be harrowed and his taste offended cheek by jowl with boys or women of all ages it may even chance that he has taken to this entertainment his wife or the young persons of his household  heon the other handwho reads a book reads it in privacy  true but the wielder of this argument has clasped his fingers round a twoedged blade  the very fact that the book has no mixed audience removes from literature an element which is ever the greatest check on licentiousness in drama  no manager of a theatrea man of the world engaged in the acquisition of his livelihood unless guaranteed by the license of the censor dare risk the presentment before a mixed audience of that which might cause an emeute among his clients  it has indeed always been observed that the theatrical manager almost without exception thoughtfully recoils from the responsibility that would be thrust on him by the abolition of the censorship  the fear of the mixed audience is ever suspended above his head  no such fear threatens the publisher who displays his wares to one man at a time  and for this very reason of the mixed audience perpetually and perversely cited to the contrary by such as have no firm grasp of this matter there is a greater necessity for a censorship on literature than for one on plays  further if there were but a censorship of literature no matter how dubious the books that were allowed to pass the conscience of no reader need ever be troubled  for that the perfect rest of the public conscience is the first result of censorship is proved to certainty by the protected drama since many dubious plays are yearly put before the playgoing public without tending in any way to disturb a complacency engendered by the security from harm guaranteed by this beneficent if despotic institution  pundits who to the discomfort of the populace foster this exemption of literature from discipline cling to the oldfashioned notion that ulcers should be encouraged to discharge themselves upon the surface instead of being quietly and decently driven into the system and allowed to fester there  the remaining plea for exempting literature from censorship put forward by unreflecting persons that it would require too many censorsbesides being unworthy is on the face of it erroneous special tests have never been thought necessary in appointing examiners of plays  they would indeed not only be unnecessary but positively dangerous seeing that the essential function of censorship is protection of the ordinary prejudices and forms of thought  there would then be no difficulty in securing tomorrow as many censors of literature as might be necessary say twenty or thirty since all that would be required of each one of them would be that he should secretly exercise in his uncontrolled discretion his individual taste  in a word this free literature of ours protects advancing thought and speculation and those who believe in civic freedom subject only to common law and espouse the cause of free literature are championing a system which is essentially undemocratic essentially inimical to the will of the majority who have certainly no desire for any such things as advancing thought and speculation  such persons indeed merely hold the faith that the people as a whole unprotected by the despotic judgments of single persons have enough strength and wisdom to know what is and what is not harmful to themselves  they put their trust in a public press and a common law which deriving from the conscience of the country is openly administered and within the reach of all  how absurd how inadequate this all is we see from the existence of the censorship on drama  having observed that there is no reason whatever for the exemption of literature let us now turn to the case of art  every picture hung in a gallery every statue placed on a pedestal is exposed to the public stare of a mixed company  why then have we no censorship to protect us from the possibility of encountering works that bring blushes to the cheek of the young person  the reason cannot be that the proprietors of galleries are more worthy of trust than the managers of theatres this would be to make an odious distinction which those very managers who uphold the censorship of plays would be the first to resent  it is true that societies of artists and the proprietors of galleries are subject to the prosecution of the law if they offend against the ordinary standards of public decency but precisely the same liability attaches to theatrical managers and proprietors of theatres in whose case it has been found necessary and beneficial to add the censorship  and in this connection let it once more be noted how much more easily the ordinary standards of public decency can be assessed by a single person responsible to no one than by the clumsy if more open process of public protest what then in the light of the proved justice and efficiency of the censorship of drama is the reason for the absence of the censorship of art  the more closely the matter is regarded the more plain it is that there is none  at any moment we may have to look upon some painting or contemplate some statue as tragic heartrending and dubiously delicate in theme as that censured play the cenci by one shelley as dangerous to prejudice and suggestive of new thought as the censured ghosts by one ibsen  let us protest against this peril suspended over our heads and demand the immediate appointment of a single person not selected for any pretentiously artistic feelings but endowed with summary powers of prohibiting the exhibition in public galleries or places of such works as he shall deem in his uncontrolled discretion unsuited to average intelligence or sensibility  let us demand it in the interest not only of the young person but of those whole sections of the community which cannot be expected to take an interest in art and to whom the purpose speculations and achievements of great artists working not only for today but for tomorrow must naturally be dark riddles  let us even require that this official should be empowered to order the destruction of the works which he has deemed unsuited to average intelligence and sensibility lest their creators should by private sale make a profit out of them such as in the nature of the case dramatic authors are debarred from making out of plays which having been censured cannot be played for money  let us ask this with confidence for it is not compatible with common justice that there should be any favouring of painter over playwright  they are both artistslet them both be measured by the same last  but let us now consider the case of science  it will not indeed cannot be contended that the investigations of scientific men whether committed to writing or to speech are always suited to the taste and capacities of our general public  there was for example the wellknown doctrine of evolution the teachings of charles darwin and alfred russet wallace who gathered up certain facts hitherto but vaguely known into presentments irreverent and startling which at the time profoundly disturbed every normal mind  not only did religion as then accepted suffer in this cataclysm but our taste and feeling were inexpressibly shocked by the discovery so emphasised by thomas henry huxley of mans descent from apes  it was felt and is felt by many to this day that the advancement of that theory grossly and dangerously violated every canon of decency what pain then might have been averted what farreaching consequences and incalculable subversion of primitive faiths checked if some judicious censor of scientific thought had existed in those days to demand in accordance with his private estimate of the will and temper of the majority the suppression of the doctrine of evolution  innumerable investigations of scientists on subjects such as the date of the worlds creation have from time to time been summarised and inconsiderately sprung on a public shocked and startled by the revelation that facts which they were accustomed to revere were conspicuously at fault  so too in the range of medicine it would be difficult to cite any radical discovery such as the preventive power of vaccination whose unchecked publication has not violated the prejudices and disturbed the immediate comfort of the common mind  had these discoveries been judiciously suppressed or pared away to suit what a censorship conceived to be the popular palate of the time all this disturbance and discomfort might have been avoided  it will doubtless be contended for there are no such violent opponents of censorship as those who are threatened with the same that to compare a momentous disclosure such as the doctrine of evolution to a mere drama were unprofitable  the answer to this ungenerous contention is fortunately plain  had a judicious censorship existed over our scientific matters such as for two hundred years has existed over our drama scientific discoveries would have been no more disturbing and momentous than those which we are accustomed to see made on our nicely pruned and tutored stage for not only would the more dangerous and penetrating scientific truths have been carefully destroyed at birth but scientists aware that the results of investigations offensive to accepted notions would be suppressed would long have ceased to waste their time in search of a knowledge repugnant to average intelligence and thus foredoomed and have occupied themselves with services more agreeable to the public taste such as the rediscovery of truths already known and published  indissolubly connected with the desirability of a censorship of science is the need for religious censorship  for in this assuredly not the least important department of the nations life we are witnessing week by week and year by year what in the light of the security guaranteed by the censorship of drama we are justified in terming an alarming spectacle  thousands of men are licensed to proclaim from their pulpits sunday after sunday their individual beliefs quite regardless of the settled convictions of the masses of their congregations  it is true indeed that the vast majority of sermons like the vast majority of plays are and will always be harmonious with the feelingsof the average citizen for neither priest nor playwright have customarily any such peculiar gift of spiritual daring as might render them unsafe mentors of their fellows and there is not wanting the deterrent of commonsense to keep them in bounds  yet it can hardly be denied that there spring up at times menlike john wesley or general boothof such incurable temperament as to be capable of abusing their freedom by the promulgation of doctrine or procedure divergent from the current traditions of religion  nor must it be forgotten that sermons like plays are addressed to a mixed audience of families and that the spiritual teachings of a lifetime may be destroyed by ten minutes of uncensored pronouncement from a pulpit the while parents are sitting not as in a theatre vested with the right of protest but dumb and excoriated to the soul watching their children perhaps of tender age eagerly drinking in words at variance with that which they themselves have been at such pains to instil  if a set of censorsfor it would as in the case of literature indubitably require more than one perhaps one hundred and eighty but for reasons already given there should be no difficulty whatever in procuring them endowed with the swift powers conferred by freedom from the dull tedium of responsibility and not remarkable for religious temperament were appointed to whom all sermons and public addresses on religious subjects must be submitted before delivery and whose duty after perusal should be to excise all portions not conformable to their private ideas of what was at the moment suitable to the publics ears we should be far on the road toward that proper preservation of the status quo so desirable if the faiths and ethical standards of the less exuberantly spiritual masses are to be maintained in their full bloom as things now stand the nation has absolutely nothing to safeguard it against religious progress  we have seen then that censorship is at least as necessary over literature art science and religion as it is over our drama  we have now to call attention to the crowning needthe want of a censorship in politics  if censorship be based on justice if it be proved to serve the public and to be successful in its lonely vigil over drama it should and logically must be extended to all parallel cases it cannot it dare not stop short atpolitics  for precisely in this supreme branch of the public life are we most menaced by the rule and license of the leading spirit  to appreciate this fact we need only examine the constitution of the house of commons  six hundred and seventy persons chosen from a population numbering four and forty millions must necessarily whatever their individual defects be citizens of more than average enterprise resource and resolution they are elected for a period that may last five years  many of them are ambitious some uncompromising not a few enthusiastically eager to do something for their country filled with designs and aspirations for national or social betterment with which the masses sunk in the immediate pursuits of life can in the nature of things have little sympathy  and yet we find these men licensed to pour forth at pleasure before mixed audiences checked only by common law and common sense political utterances which may have the gravest the most terrific consequences utterances which may at any moment let loose revolution or plunge the country into war which often as a fact excite an utter detestation terror and mistrust or shock the most sacred domestic and proprietary convictions in the breasts of vast majorities of their fellowcountrymen  and we incur this appalling risk for the want of a single or at the most a handful of censors invested with a simple but limitless discretion to excise or to suppress entirely such political utterances as may seem to their private judgments calculated to cause pain or moral disturbance in the average man  the masses it is true have their protection and remedy against injudicious or inflammatory politicians in the law and the socalled democratic process of election but we have seen that theatre audiences have also the protection of the law and the remedy of boycott and that in their case this protection and this remedy are not deemed enough  what then shall we say of the case of politics where the dangers attending inflammatory or subversive utterance are greater a million fold and the remedy a thousand times less expeditious  our legislators have laid down censorship as the basic principle of justice underlying the civic rights of dramatists  then let censorship for all be their motto and this country no longer be ridden and destroyed by free institutions  let them not only establish forthwith censorships of literature art science and religion but also place themselves beneath the regimen with which they have calmly fettered dramatic authors  they cannot deem it becoming to their regard for justice to their honour to their sense of humour to recoil from a restriction which in a parallel case they have imposed on others  it is an old and homely saying that good officers never place their men in positions they would not themselves be willing to fill  and we are not entitled to believe that our legislators having set dramatic authors where they have been set willnow that their duty is made plainfor a moment hesitate to step down and stand alongside  but if by any chance they should recoil and thus make answer we are ready at all times to submit to the law and the peoples will and to bow to their demands but we cannot and must not be asked to place our calling our duty and our honour beneath the irresponsible rule of an arbitrary autocrat however sympathetic with the generality he may chance to be  then we would ask sirs did you ever hear of that great saying do unto others as ye would they should do unto you  for it is but fair presumption that the dramatists whom our legislators have placed in bondage to a despot are no less than those legislators proud of their calling conscious of their duty and jealous of their honour 1909     vague thoughts on art  it was on a day of rare beauty that i went out into the fields to try and gather these few thoughts  so golden and sweetly hot it was that they came lazily and with a flight no more coherent or responsible than the swoop of the very swallows and as in a play or poem the result is conditioned by the conceiving mood so i knew would be the nature of my diving dipping palethroated forktailed words  but after alli thought sitting therei need not take my critical pronouncements seriously  i have not the firm soul of the critic  it is not my profession to know things for certain and to make others feel that certainty  on the contrary i am often wronga luxury no critic can afford  and so invading as i was the realm of others i advanced with a light pen feeling that none and least of all myself need expect me to be right  what theni thoughtis art  for i perceived that to think about it i must first define it and i almost stopped thinking at all before the fearsome nature of that task  then slowly in my mind gathered this group of words  art is that imaginative expression of human energy which through technical concretion of feeling and perception tends to reconcile the individual with the universal by exciting in him impersonal emotion and the greatest art is that which excites the greatest impersonal emotion in an hypothecated perfect human being  impersonal emotion  and whati thought do i mean by that  surely i mean that is not art which while i am contemplating it inspires me with any active or directive impulse that is art when for however brief a moment it replaces within me interest in myself by interest in itself  for let me suppose myself in the presence of a carved marble bath  if my thoughts be what could i buy that for impulse of acquisition or from what quarry did it come  impulse of inquiry or which would be the right end for my head  mixed impulse of inquiry and acquisitioni am at that moment insensible to it as a work of art  but if i stand before it vibrating at sight of its colour and forms if ever so little and for ever so short a time unhaunted by any definite practical thought or impulseto that extent and for that moment it has stolen me away out of myself and put itself there instead has linked me to the universal by making me forget the individual in me  and for that moment and only while that moment lasts it is to me a work of art  the word impersonal then is but used in this my definition to signify momentary forgetfulness of ones own personality and its active wants  so arti thoughtis that which heard read or looked on while producing no directive impulse warms one with unconscious vibration nor can i imagine any means of defining what is the greatest art without hypothecating a perfect human being  but since we shall never see or know if we do see that desirable creaturedogmatism is banished academy is dead to the discussion deader than even tolstoy left it after his famous treatise what is art  for having destroyed all the old judges and academies tolstoy by saying that the greatest art was that which appealed to the greatest number of living human beings raised up the masses of mankind to be a definite new judge or academy as tyrannical and narrow as ever were those whom he had destroyed  this at all eventsi thought is as far as i dare go in defining what art is  but let me try to make plain to myself what is the essential quality that gives to art the power of exciting this unconscious vibration this impersonal emotion  it has been called beauty  an awkward worda perpetual begging of the question too current in use too ambiguous altogether now too narrow now too widea word in fact too glib to know at all what it means  and how dangerous a wordoften misleading us into slabbing with extraneous floridities what would otherwise on its own plane be art  to be decorative where decoration is not suitable to be lyrical where lyricism is out of place is assuredly to spoil art not to achieve it  but this essential quality of art has also and more happily been called rhythm  and what is rhythm if not that mysterious harmony between part and part and part and whole which gives what is called life that exact proportion the mystery of which is best grasped in observing how life leaves an animate creature when the essential relation of part to whole has been sufficiently disturbed  and i agree that this rhythmic relation of part to part and part to wholein short vitalityis the one quality inseparable from a work of art  for nothing which does not seem to a man possessed of this rhythmic vitality can ever steal him out of himself  and having got thus far in my thoughts i paused watching the swallows for they seemed to me the symbol in their swift sure curvetting all daring and balance and surprise of the delicate poise and motion of art that visits no two men alike in a world where no two things of all the things there be are quite the same  yesi thoughtand this art is the one form of human energy in the whole world which really works for union and destroys the barriers between man and man  it is the continual unconscious replacement however fleeting of oneself by another the real cement of human life the everlasting refreshment and renewal  for what is grievous dompting grim about our lives is that we are shut up within ourselves with an itch to get outside ourselves  and to be stolen away from ourselves by art is a momentary relaxation from that itching a minutes profound and as it were secret enfranchisement the active amusements and relaxations of life can only rest certain of our faculties by indulging others the whole self is never rested save through that unconsciousness of self which comes through rapt contemplation of nature or of art  and suddenly i remembered that some believe that art does not produce unconsciousness of self but rather very vivid selfrealisation  ah buti thoughthat is not the first and instant effect of art the new impetus is the after effect of that momentary replacement of oneself by the self of the work before us it is surely the result of that brief span of enlargement enfranchisement and rest  yes art is the great and universal refreshment  for art is never dogmatic holds no brief for itself you may take it or you may leave it it does not force itself rudely where it is not wanted  it is reverent to all tempers to all points of view  but it is wilfulthe very wind in the comings and goings of its influence an uncapturable fugitive visiting our hearts at vagrant sweet moments since we often stand even before the greatest works of art without being able quite to lose ourselves  that restful oblivion comes we never quite know whenand it is gone  but when it comes it is a spirit hovering with cool wings blessing us from least to greatest according to our powers a spirit deathless and varied as human life itself  and in what sort of agei thoughtare artists living now  are conditions favourable  life is very multiple full of movements facts and news with the limelight terribly turned onand all this is adverse to the artist  yet leisure is abundant the facilities for study great liberty is respectedmore or less  but there is one great reason why in this age of ours art it seems must flourish  for just as crossbreeding in natureif it be not too violentoften gives an extra vitality to the offspring so does crossbreeding of philosophies make for vitality in art  i cannot help thinking that historians looking back from the far future will record this age as the third renaissance  we who are lost in it working or looking on can neither tell what we are doing nor where standing but we cannot help observing that just as in the greek renaissance wornout pagan orthodoxy was penetrated by new philosophy just as in the italian renaissance pagan philosophy reasserting itself fertilised again an already too inbred christian creed so now orthodoxy fertilised by science is producing a fresh and fuller conception of lifea love of perfection not for hope of reward not for fear of punishment but for perfections sake slowly under our feet beneath our consciousness is forming that new philosophy and it is in times of new philosophies that art itself in essence always a discovery must flourish  those whose sacred suns and moons are ever in the past tell us that our art is going to the dogs and it is indeed true that we are in confusion  the waters are broken and every nerve and sinew of the artist is strained to discover his own safety  it is an age of stir and change a season of new wine and old bottles  yet assuredly in spite of breakages and waste a wine worth the drinking is all the time being made  i ceased again to think for the sun had dipped low and the midges were biting me and the sounds of evening had begun those innumerable fartravelling sounds of man and bird and beastso clear and intimateof remote countrysides at sunset  and for long i listened too vague to move my pen  new philosophya vigorous art  are there not all the signs of it  in music sculpture painting in fictionand drama in dancing in criticism itself if criticism be an art  yes we are reaching out to a new faith not yet crystallised to a new art not yet perfected the forms still to findthe flowers still to fashion  and how has it come this slowly growing faith in perfection for perfections sake  surely like this the western world awoke one day to find that it no longer believed corporately and for certain in future life for the individual consciousness  it began to feel i cannot say more than that there may bedeath may be the end of man or death may be nothing  and it began to ask itself in this uncertainty do i then desire to go on living  now since it found that it desired to go on living at least as earnestly as ever it did before it began to inquire why  and slowly it perceived that there was inborn within it a passionate instinct of which it had hardly till then been consciousa sacred instinct to perfect itself now as well as in a possible hereafter to perfect itself because perfection was desirable a vision to be adored and striven for a dream motive fastened within the universe the very essential cause of everything  and it began to see that this perfection cosmically was nothing but perfect equanimity and harmony and in human relations nothing but perfect love and justice and perfection began to glow before the eyes of the western world like a new star whose light touched with glamour all things as they came forth from mystery till to mystery they were ready to return  thisi thought is surely what the western world has dimly been rediscovering  there has crept into our minds once more the feeling that the universe is all of a piece equipoise supreme and all things equally wonderful and mysterious and valuable  we have begun in fact to have a glimmering of the artists creed that nothing may we despise or neglectthat everything is worth the doing well the making fairthat our god perfection is implicit everywhere and the revelation of him the business of our art  and as i jotted down these words i noticed that some real stars had crept up into the sky so gradually darkening above the pollard limetrees cuckoos who had been calling on the thorntrees all the afternoon were silent the swallows no longer flirted past but a bat was already in career over the holly hedge and round me the buttercups were closing the whole form and feeling of the world had changed so that i seemed to have before me a new picture hanging  ah  i thought art must indeed be priest of this new faith in perfection whose motto is harmony proportion balance  for by art alone can true harmony in human affairs be fostered true proportion revealed and true equipoise preserved  is not the training of an artist a training in the due relation of one thing with another and in the faculty of expressing that relation clearly and even more a training in the faculty of disengaging from self the very essence of selfand passing that essence into other selves by so delicate means that none shall see how it is done yet be insensibly unified  is not the artist of all men foe and nullifier of partisanship and parochialism of distortions and extravagance the discoverer of that jackolanterntruth for if truth be not spiritual proportion i know not what it is  truth it seems to meis no absolute thing but always relative the essential symmetry in the varying relationships of life and the most perfect truth is but the concrete expression of the most penetrating vision  life seen throughout as a countless show of the finest works of art life shaped and purged of the irrelevant the gross and the extravagant life as it were spiritually selectedthat is truth a thing as multiple and changing as subtle and strange as life itself and as little to be bound by dogma  truth admits but the one rule no deficiency and no excess  disobedient to that rulenothing attains full vitality  and secretly fettered by that rule is art whose business is the creation of vital things  that aesthete to be sure was right when he said it is style that makes one believe in a thing nothing but style  for what is style in its true and broadest sense save fidelity to idea and mood and perfect balance in the clothing of them  and i thought can one believe in the decadence of art in an age which however unconsciously as yet is beginning to worship that which art worshipsperfectionstyle  the faults of our arts today are the faults of zeal and of adventure the faults and crudities of pioneers the errors and mishaps of the explorer  they must pass through many fevers and many times lose their way but at all events they shall not go dying in their beds and be buried at kensal green  and here and there amid the disasters and wreckage of their voyages of discovery they will find something new some fresh way of embellishing life or of revealing the heart of things that characteristic of todays artthe striving of each branch of art to burst its own boundarieswhich to many spells destruction is surely of happy omen  the novel straining to become the play the play the novel both trying to paint music striving to become story poetry gasping to be music painting panting to be philosophy forms canons rules all melting in the pot stagnation broken up  in all this havoc there is much to shock and jar even the most eager and adventurous  we cannot stand these newfangled fellows  they have no form  they rush in where angels fear to tread  they have lost all the good of the old and given us nothing in its place  and yetonly out of stir and change is born new salvation  to deny that is to deny belief in man to turn our backs on courage  it is well indeed that some should live in closed studies with the paintings and the books of yesterdaysuch devoted students serve art in their own way  but the freshair world will ever want new forms  we shall not get them without faith enough to risk the old  the good will live the bad will die and tomorrow only can tell us which is which  yesi thoughtwe naturally take a too impatient view of the art of our own time since we can neither see the ends toward which it is almost blindly groping nor the few perfected creations that will be left standing amidst the rubble of abortive effort  an age must always decry itself and extol its forbears  the unwritten history of every art will show us that  consider the novelthat most recent form of art  did not the age which followed fielding lament the treachery of authors to the picaresque tradition complaining that they were not as fielding and smollett were  be sure they did  very slowly and in spite of opposition did the novel attain in this country the fulness of that biographical form achieved under thackeray  very slowly and in face of condemnation it has been losing that form in favour of a greater vividness which places before the readers brain not historical statements as it were of motives and of facts but wordpaintings of things and persons so chosen and arranged that the reader may see as if at first hand the spirit of life at work before him  the new novel has as many bemoaners as the old novel had when it was new  it is no question of better or worse but of differing formsof change dictated by gradual suitability to the changing conditions of our social life and to the ever fresh discoveries of craftsmen in the intoxication of which old and equally worthy craftsmanship isby the waytoo often for the moment mislaid the vested interests of life favour the line of least resistancedisliking and revolting against disturbance but one must always remember that a spurious glamour is inclined to gather around what is new  and because of these two deflecting factors those who break through old forms must well expect to be dead before the new forms they have unconsciously created have found their true level high or low in the world of art  when a thing is new how shall it be judged  in the fluster of meeting novelty we have even seen coherence attempting to bind together two personalities so fundamentally opposed as those of ibsen and bernard shaw dramatists with hardly a quality in common no identity of tradition or belief not the faintest resemblance in methods of construction or technique yet contemporary estimate talks of them often in the same breath they are new  it is enough  and others as utterly unlike them both  they too are new  they have as yet no label of their own then put on some one elses  and soi thought it must always be for time is essential to the proper placing and estimate of all art  and is it not this feeling that contemporary judgments are apt to turn out a little ludicrous which has converted much criticism of late from judgment pronounced into impression recordedrecreative statementa kind in fact of expression of the critics self elicited through contemplation of a book a play a symphony a picture  for this kind of criticism there has even recently been claimed an actual identity with creation  esthetic judgment and creative power identical  that is a hard saying  for however sympathetic one may feel toward this new criticism however one may recognise that the recording of impression has a wider more elastic and more lasting value than the delivery of arbitrary judgment based on rigid laws of taste however one may admit that it approaches the creative gift in so far as it demands the qualities of receptivity and reproductionis there not still lacking to this new critic something of that thirsting spirit of discovery which precedes the creationhitherto socalledof anything  criticism taste aesthetic judgment by the very nature of their task wait till life has been focussed by the artists before they attempt to reproduce the image which that imprisoned fragment of life makes on the mirror of their minds  but a thing created springs from a germ unconsciously implanted by the direct impact of unfettered life on the whole range of the creators temperament and round the germ thus engendered the creative artistever penetrating discovering selectinggoes on building cell on cell gathered from a million little fresh impacts and visions  and to say that this is also exactly what the recreative critic does is to say that the interpretative musician is creator in the same sense as is the composer of the music that he interprets  if indeed these processes be the same in kind they are in degree so far apart that one would think the word creative unfortunately used of both  but this speculationi thoughtis going beyond the bounds of vagueness let there be some thread of coherence in your thoughts as there is in the progress of this evening fast fading into night return to the consideration of the nature and purposes of art  and recognize that much of what you have thought will seem on the face of it heresy to the school whose doctrine was incarnated by oscar wilde in that admirable apotheosis of halftruths the decay of the art of lying  for therein he said no great artist ever sees things as they really are  yet that halftruth might also be put thus the seeing of things as they really arethe seeing of a proportion veiled from other eyes together with the power of expression is what makes a man an artist  what makes him a great artist is a high fervour of spirit which produces a superlative instead of a comparative clarity of vision  close to my house there is a group of pines with gnarled red limbs flanked by beechtrees  and there is often a very deep blue sky behind generally that is all i see  but once in a way in those trees against that sky i seem to see all the passionate life and glow that titian painted into his pagan pictures  i have a vision of mysterious meaning of a mysterious relation between that sky and those trees with their gnarled red limbs and life as i know it  and when i have had that vision i always feel this is reality and all those other times when i have no such vision simple unreality  if i were a painter it is for such fervent vision i should wait before moving brush this so intimate inner vision of reality indeed seems in duller moments wellnigh grotesque and hence that other glib halftruth art is greater than life itself  art is indeed greater than life in the sense that the power of art is the disengagement from life of its real spirit and significance  but in any other sense to say that art is greater than life from which it emerges and into which it must remerge can but suspend the artist over life with his feet in the air and his head in the cloudsprig masquerading as demigod  nature is no great mother who has borne us  she is our creation  it is in our brain that she quickens to life  such is the highest hyperbole of the aesthetic creed but what is creative instinct if not an incessant living sympathy with nature a constant craving like that of natures own to fashion something new out of all that comes within the grasp of those faculties with which nature has endowed us  the qualities of vision of fancy and of imaginative power are no more divorced from nature than are the qualities of commonsense and courage  they are rarer that is all  but in truth no one holds such views  not even those who utter them  they are the rhetoric the overstatement of halftruths by such as wish to condemn what they call realism without being temperamentally capable of understanding what realism really is  and whati thoughtis realism  what is the meaning of that word so wildly used  is it descriptive of technique or descriptive of the spirit of the artist or both or neither  was turgenev a realist  no greater poet ever wrote in prose nor any one who more closely brought the actual shapes of men and things before us  no more fervent idealists than ibsen and tolstoy ever lived and none more careful to make their people real  were they realists  no more deeply fantastic writer can i conceive than dostoievsky nor any who has described actual situations more vividly  was he a realist  the late stephen crane was called a realist  than whom no more impressionistic writer ever painted with words  what then is the heart of this term still often used as an expression almost of abuse  to me at all eventsi thoughtthe words realism realistic have no longer reference to technique for which the words naturalism naturalistic serve far better  nor have they to do with the question of imaginative poweras much demanded by realism as by romanticism  for me a realist is by no means tied to naturalistic techniquehe may be poetic idealistic fantastic impressionistic anything butromantic that in so far as he is a realist he cannot be the word in fact characterises that artist whose temperamental preoccupation is with revelation of the actual interrelating spirit of life character and thought with a view to enlighten himself and others as distinguished from that artist whom i call romanticwhose tempera mental purpose is invention of tale or design with a view to delight himself and others  it is a question of temperamental antecedent motive in the artist and nothing more  realistromanticist  enlightenmentdelight  that is the true apposition  to make a revelationto tell a fairytale  and either of these artists may use what form he likesnaturalistic fantastic poetic impressionistic  for it is not by the form but by the purpose and mood of his art that he shall be known as one or as the other realists indeedincluding the half of shakespeare that was realist not being primarily concerned to amuse their audience are still comparatively unpopular in a world made up for the greater part of men of action who instinctively reject all art that does not distract them without causing them to think  for thought makes demands on an energy already in full use thought causes introspection and introspection causes discomfort and disturbs the grooves of action  to say that the object of the realist is to enlighten rather than to delight is not to say that in his art the realist is not amusing himself as much as ever is the teller of a fairytale though he does not deliberately start out to do so he is amusing too a large part of mankind  for admitted that the abject and the test of art is always the awakening of vibration of impersonal emotion it is still usually forgotten that men fall roughly speaking into two flocks those whose intelligence is uninquiring in the face of art and does not demand to be appeased before their emotions can be stirred and those who having a speculative bent of mind must first be satisfied by an enlightening quality in a work of art before that work of art can awaken in them feeling  the audience of the realist is drawn from this latter type of man the much larger audience of the romantic artist from the former together with in both cases those fastidious few for whom all art is style and only style and who welcome either kind so long as it is good enough  to me theni thoughtthis division into realism and romance so understood is the main cleavage in all the arts but it is hard to find pure examples of either kind  for even the most determined realist has more than a streak in him of the romanticist and the most resolute romanticist finds it impossible at times to be quite unreal  guido reni watteau leighton were they not perhaps somewhat pure romanticists rembrandt hogarth manet mainly realists botticelli titian raphael a blend  dumas pere and scott surely romantic flaubert and tolstoy as surely realists dickens and cervantes blended  keats and swinburne romantic browning and whitmanrealistic shakespeare and goethe both the greek dramatistsrealists  the arabian nights and malory romantic the iliad the odyssey and the old testament both realism and romance and if in the vagueness of my thoughts i were to seek for illustration less general and vague to show the essence of this temperamental cleavage in all art i would take the two novelists turgenev and stevenson  for turgenev expressed himself in stories that must be called romances and stevenson employed almost always a naturalistic technique  yet no one would ever call turgenev a romanticist or stevenson a realist  the spirit of the first brooded over life found in it a perpetual voyage of spiritual adventure was set on discovering and making clear to himself and all the varying traits and emotions of human characterthe varying moods of nature and though he couched all this discovery in caskets of engaging story it was always clear as day what mood it was that drove him to dip pen in ink  the spirit of the second i think almost dreaded to discover he felt life i believe too keenly to want to probe into it he spun his gossamer to lure himself and all away from life that was his driving mood but the craftsman in him longing to be clear and poignant made him more natural more actual than most realists  so how thin often is the hedge  and how poor a business the partisan abuse of either kind of art in a world where each sort of mind has full right to its own due expression and grumbling lawful only when due expression is not attained  one may not care for a rembrandt portrait of a plain old woman a graceful watteau decoration may leave another cold but foolish will he be who denies that both are faithful to their conceiving moods and so proportioned part to part and part to whole as to have each in its own way that inherent rhythm or vitality which is the hallmark of art  he is but a poor philosopher who holds a view so narrow as to exclude forms not to his personal taste  no realist can love romantic art so much as he loves his own but when that art fulfils the laws of its peculiar being if he would be no blind partisan he must admit it the romanticist will never be amused by realism but let him not for that reason be so parochial as to think that realism when it achieves vitality is not art  for what is art but the perfected expression of self in contact with the world and whether that self be of enlightening or of fairytelling temperament is of no moment whatsoever  the tossing of abuse from realist to romanticist and back is but the swordplay of two oneeyed men with their blind side turned toward each other  shall not each attempt be judged on its own merits if found not shoddy faked or forced but true to itself true to its conceiving mood and fairproportioned part to whole so that it livesthen realistic or romantic in the name of fairness let it pass of all kinds of human energy art is surely the most free the least parochial and demands of us an essential tolerance of all its forms shall we waste breath and ink in condemnation of artists because their temperaments are not our own  but the shapes and colours of the day were now all blurred every tree and stone entangled in the dusk  how different the world seemed from that in which i had first sat down with the swallows flirting past  and my mood was different for each of those worlds had brought to my heart its proper feelingpainted on my eyes the just picture  and night that was coming would bring me yet another mood that would frame itself with consciousness at its own fair moment and hang before me  a quiet owl stole by in the geld below and vanished into the heart of a tree  and suddenly above the moorline i saw the large moon rising cinnamoncoloured it made all things swim made me uncertain of my thoughts vague with mazy feeling shapes seemed but drifts of moondust and true reality nothing save a sort of still listening to the wind  and for long i sat just watching the moon creep up and hearing the thin dry rustle of the leaves along the holly hedge  and there came to me this thought what is this universethat never had beginning and will never have an endbut a myriad striving to perfect pictures never the same so blending and fading one into another that all form one great perfected picture  and what are weripples on the tides of a birthless deathless equipoised creativepurposebut little works of art  trying to record that thought i noticed that my notebook was damp with dew  the cattle were lying down  it was too dark to see 1911
