paris   sirit becomes every man in his station to acknowledge and praise virtue wheresoever he may find it and to point it out for the admiration and example of his fellowmen  some months since when you presented to the writer of these pages a small account for coats and pantaloons manufactured by you and when you were met by a statement from your creditor that an immediate settlement of your bill would be extremely inconvenient to him your reply was mon dieu sir let not that annoy you if you want money as a gentleman often does in a strange country i have a thousandfranc note at my house which is quite at your service  history or experience sir makes us acquainted with so few actions that can be compared to yoursan offer like this from a stranger and a tailor seems to me so

have been borrowed from french originals the other stories which are in the main true have been written upon facts and characters that came within the authors observation during a residence in paris  as the remaining papers relate to public events which occurred during the same period or to parisian art and literature he has ventured to give his publication the title which it bears  london july 1

voyage menaces a mother she becomes suddenly endowed with a ferocious presence of mind and bristling up and screaming in the front of her brood and in the face of circumstances succeeds by her courage in putting her enemy to flight in like manner you will always i think find your wife if that lady be good for twopence shrill eager and illhumored before and during a great family move of this nature well the swindling hackneycoachmen are paid the mother leading on her regiment of little ones and supported by her auxiliary nursemaids are safe in the cabinyou have counted twentysix of the twentyseven parcels and have them on board and that horrid man on the paddlebox who for twenty minutes past has been roaring out now sirsays now sir no more  i never yet knew how a steamer began to move being always too busy among the trunks and children for the first halfhour to mark any of the movements of the vessel when these private arrangements are made you find yourself opposite greenwich farewell sweet sweet whitebait and quiet begins to enter your soul your wife smiles for the first time these ten days you pass by plantations of shipmasts and forests of steamchimneys the sailors are singing on board the ships the bargees salute you with oaths grins and phrases facetious and familiar the man on the paddlebox roars ease her stop her which mysterious words a shrill voice from below repeats and pipes out ease her stop her in echo the deck is crowded with groups of figures and the sun shines over all  the sun shines over all and the steward comes up to say lunch ladies and gentlemen will any lady or gentleman please to take anythink about a dozen do boiled beef and pickles and great red raw cheshire cheese tempt the epicure little dumpy bottles of stout are produced and fizz and bang about with a spirit one would never have looked for in individuals of their size and stature  the decks have a strange look the people on them that is wives elderly stout husbands nursemaids and children predominate of course in english steamboats such may be considered as the distinctive marks of the english gentleman at three or four and forty two or three of such groups have pitched their camps on the deck then there are a number of young men of whom three or four have allowed their moustaches to begin to grow since last friday for they are going on the continent and they look therefore as if their upper lips were smeared with snuff  a danseuse from the opera is on her way to paris followed by her bonne and her little dog she paces the deck stepping out in the real dancer fashion and ogling all around how happy the two young englishmen are who can speak french and make up to her and how all criticise her points and paces yonder is a group of young ladies who are going to paris to learn how to be governesses those two splendidly dressed ladies are milliners from the rue richelieu who have just brought over and disposed of their cargo of summer fashions here sits the rev mr snodgrass with his pupils whom he is conducting to his establishment near boulogne where in addition to a classical and mathematical education washing included the young gentlemen have the benefit of learning french among the french themselves accordingly the young gentlemen are locked up in a great rickety house two miles from boulogne and never see a soul except the french usher and the cook  some few french people are there already preparing to be illi never shall forget a dreadful sight i once had in the little dark dirty sixfoot cabin of a dover steamer four gaunt frenchmen but for their pantaloons in the costume of adam in paradise solemnly anointing themselves with some charm against seasicknessa few frenchmen are there but these for the most part and with a proper philosophy go to the forecabin of the ship and you see them on the foredeck is that the name for that part of the vessel which is in the region of the bowsprit lowering in huge cloaks and caps snuffy wretched pale and wet and not jabbering now as their wont is on shore i never could fancy the mounseers formidable at sea  there are of course many jews on board who ever travelled by steamboat coach diligence eilwagen vetturino muleback or sledge without meeting some of the wandering race  by the time these remarks have been made the steward is on the deck again and dinner is ready and about two hours after dinner comes tea and then there is brandyandwater which he eagerly presses as a preventive against what may happen and about this time you pass the foreland the wind blowing pretty fresh and the groups on deck disappear and your wife giving you an alarmed look descends with her little ones to the ladies cabin and you see the steward and his boys issuing from their den under the paddlebox with each a heap of round tin vases like those which are called i believe in america expectoratoons only these are larger                                        the wind blows the water looks greener and more beautiful than everridge by ridge of long white rock passes away thats ramsgit says the man at the helm and presently that theres dealits dreadful fallen off since the war and thats dover round that there pint only you cant see it and in the meantime the sun has plumped his hot face into the water and the moon has shown hers as soon as ever his back is turned and mrsthe wife in general has brought up her children and self from the horrid cabin in which she says it is impossible to breathe and the poor little wretches are by the officious stewardess and smart steward expectoratoonifer accommodated with a heap of blankets pillows and mattresses in the midst of which they crawl as best they may and from the heaving heap of which are during the rest of the voyage heard occasional faint cries and sounds of puking woe  dear dear maria is this the woman who anon braved the jeers and brutal wrath of swindling hackneycoachmen who repelled the insolence of haggling porters with a scorn that brought down their demands at least eighteenpence is this the woman at whose voice servants tremble at the sound of whose steps the nursery ay and mayhap the parlor is in order look at her now prostrate prostrateno strength has she to speak scarce power to push to her youngest oneher suffering struggling rosato push to her thethe instrumentoon  in the midst of all these throes and agonies at which all the passengers who have their own woes you yourselffor how can you help themyou are on your back on a bench and if you move all is up with you are looking on indifferentone man there is who has been watching you with the utmost care and bestowing on your helpless family the tenderness that a father denies them he is a foreigner and you have been conversing with him in the course of the morning in frenchwhich he says you speak remarkably well like a native in fact and then in english which after all you find is more convenient what can express your gratitude to this gentleman for all his goodness towards your family and yourselfyou talk to him he has served under the emperor and is for all that sensible modest and wellinformed he speaks indeed of his countrymen almost with contempt and readily admits the superiority of a briton on the seas and elsewhere one loves to meet with such genuine liberality in a foreigner and respects the man who can sacrifice vanity to truth this distinguished foreigner has travelled much he asks whither you are goingwhere you stop if you have a great quantity of luggage on boardand laughs when he hears of the twentyseven packages and hopes you have some friend at the customhouse who can spare you the monstrous trouble of unpacking that which has taken you weeks to put up nine ten eleven the distinguished foreigner is ever at your side you find him now perhaps with characteristic ingratitude something of a bore but at least he has been most tender to the children and their mamma at last a boulogne light comes in sight you see it over the bows of the vessel when having bobbed violently upwards it sinks swiftly down boulogne harbor is in sight and the foreigner says  the distinguished foreigner says says hesare eef you af no otel i sall recommend you milor to ze otel betfort in ze quay sare close to the bathingmachines and customhaoose good bets and fine garten sare tabledhôte sare à cinq heures breakfast sare in french or english stylei am the commissionaire sare and vill see to your loggish   curse the fellow for an impudent swindling sneaking french humbugyour tone instantly changes and you tell him to go about his business but at twelve oclock at night when the voyage is over and the customhouse business done knowing not whither to go with a wife and fourteen exhausted children scarce able to stand and longing for bed you find yourself somehow in the hôtel bedford and you cant be better and smiling chambermaids carry off your children to snug beds while smart waiters produce for your honora cold fowl say and a salad and a bottle of bordeaux and seltzerwater                                        the morning comesi dont know a pleasanter feeling than that of waking with the sun shining on objects quite new and although you have made the voyage a dozen times quite strange mrs x and you occupy a very light bed which has a tall canopy of red percale the windows are smartly draped with cheap gaudy calicoes and muslins there are little mean strips of carpet about the tiled floor of the room and yet all seems as gay and as comfortable as may bethe sun shines brighter than you have seen it for a year the sky is a thousand times bluer and what a cheery clatter of shrill quick french voices comes up from the courtyard under the windows bells are jangling a family mayhap is going to paris en poste and wondrous is the jabber of the courier the postilion the innwaiters and the lookerson the landlord calls out for quatre biftecks aux pommes pour le trentetroiso my countrymen i love your tastes and your waysthe chambermaid is laughing and says finissez donc monsieur pierre what can they be abouta fat englishman has opened his window violently and says dee dong garsong vooly voo me donny lo sho ou vooly voo pah he has been ringing for half an hourthe last energetic appeal succeeds and shortly he is enabled to descend to the coffeeroom where with three hot rolls grilled ham cold fowl and four boiled eggs he makes what he calls his first french breakfast  it is a strange mongrel merry place this town of boulogne the little french fishermens children are beautiful and the little french soldiers four feet high redbreeched with huge pompons on their caps and brown faces and clear sharp eyes look for all their littleness far more military and more intelligent than the heavy louts one has seen swaggering about the garrison towns in england yonder go a crowd of barelegged fishermen there is the town idiot mocking a woman who is screaming fleuve du tage at an innwindow to a harp and there are the little gamins mocking him lo these seven young ladies with red hair and green veils they are from neighboring albion and going to bathe here comes three englishmen habitués evidently of the placedandy specimens of our countrymen one wears a marine dress another has a shooting dress a third has a blouse and a pair of guiltless spursall have as much hair on the face as nature or art can supply and all wear their hats very much on one side believe me there is on the face of this world no scamp like an english one no blackguard like one of these halfgentlemen so mean so low so vulgarso ludicrously ignorant and conceited so desperately heartless and depraved  but why my dear sir get into a passiontake things coolly as the poet has observed those only is gentlemen who behave as sich with such then consort be they cobblers or dukes dont give us cries the patriotic reader any abuse of our fellowcountrymen anybody else can do that but rather continue in that goodhumored facetious descriptive style with which your letter has commencedyour remark sir is perfectly just and does honor to your head and excellent heart  there is little need to give a description of the good town of boulogne which haute and basse with the new lighthouse and the new harbor and the gaslamps and the manufactures and the convents and the number of english and french residents and the pillar erected in honor of the grand armée dangleterre so called because it didnt go to england have all been excellently described by the facetious coglan the learned dr millingen and by innumerable guidebooks besides a fine thing it is to hear the stout old frenchmen of napoleons time argue how that audacious corsican would have marched to london after swallowing nelson and all his gunboats but for cette malheureuse guerre despagne and cette glorieuse campagne dautriche which the gold of pitt caused to be raised at the emperors tail in order to call him off from the helpless country in his front some frenchmen go farther still and vow that in spain they were never beaten at all indeed if you read in the biographie des hommes du jour article soult you will fancy that with the exception of the disaster at vittoria the campaigns in spain and portugal were a series of triumphs only by looking at a map it is observable that vimeiro is a mortal long way from toulouse where at the end of certain years of victories we somehow find the honest marshal and what thenhe went to toulouse for the purpose of beating the english there to be surea known fact on which comment would be superfluous however we shall never get to paris at this rate let us break off further palaver and away at once  during this pause the ingenious reader is kindly requested to pay his bill at the hotel at boulogne to mount the diligence of laffitte caillard and company and to travel for twentyfive hours amidst much jingling of harnessbells and screaming of postilions                                        the french milliner who occupies one of the corners begins to remove the greasy pieces of paper which have enveloped her locks during the journey she withdraws the madras of dubious hue which has bound her head for the last fiveandtwenty hours and replaces it by the black velvet bonnet which bobbing against your nose has hung from the diligence roof since your departure from boulogne the old lady in the opposite corner who has been sucking bonbons and smells dreadfully of anisette arranges her little parcels in that immense basket of abominations which all old women carry in their laps she rubs her mouth and eyes with her dusty cambric handkerchief she ties up her nightcap into a little bundle and replaces it by a more becoming headpiece covered with withered artificial flowers and crumpled tags of ribbon she looks wistfully at the company for an instant and then places her handkerchief before her mouthher eyes roll strangely about for an instant and you hear a faint clattering noise the old lady has been getting ready her teeth which had lain in her basket among the bonbons pins oranges pomatum bits of cake lozenges prayerbooks peppermintwater copper money and false hairstowed away there during the voyage the jewish gentleman who has been so attentive to the milliner during the journey and is a traveller and bagman by profession gathers together his various goods the sallowfaced english lad who has been drunk ever since we left boulogne yesterday and is coming to paris to pursue the study of medicine swears that he rejoices to leave the cursed diligence is sick of the infernal journey and dd glad that the dd voyage is so nearly over enfin says your neighbor yawning and inserting an elbow into the mouth of his right and left hand companion nous voilà  nous voilÀwe are at paris this must account for the removal of the milliners curlpapers and the fixing of the old ladys teethsince the last relais the diligence has been travelling with extraordinary speed the postilion cracks his terrible whip and screams shrilly the conductor blows incessantly on his horn the bells of the harness the bumping and ringing of the wheels and chains and the clatter of the great hoofs of the heavy snorting norman stallions have wondrously increased within this the last ten minutes and the diligence which has been proceeding hitherto at the rate of a league in an hour now dashes gallantly forward as if it would traverse at least six miles in the same space of time thus it is when sir robert maketh a speech at saint stephenshe useth his strength at the beginning only and the end he gallopeth at the commencement in the middle he lingers at the close again he rouses the house which has fallen asleep he cracketh the whip of his satire he shouts the shout of his patriotism and urging his eloquence to its roughest canter awakens the sleepers and inspires the weary until men say what a wondrous orator what a capital coach we will ride henceforth in it and in no other  but behold us at paris the diligence has reached a rudelooking gate or grille flanked by two lodges the french kings of old made their entry by this gate some of the hottest battles of the late revolution were fought before it at present it is blocked by carts and peasants and a busy crowd of men in green examining the packages before they enter probing the straw with long needles it is the barrier of st denis and the green men are the customsmen of the city of paris if you are a countryman who would introduce a cow into the metropolis the city demands twentyfour francs for such a privilege if you have a hundredweight of tallowcandles you must previously disburse three francs if a drove of hogs nine francs per whole hog but upon these subjects mr bulwer mrs trollope and other writers have already enlightened the public in the present instance after a momentary pause one of the men in green mounts by the side of the conductor and the ponderous vehicle pursues its journey  the street which we enter that of the faubourg st denis presents a strange contrast to the dark uniformity of a london street where everything in the dingy and smoky atmosphere looks as though it were painted in indiainkblack houses black passengers and black sky here on the contrary is a thousand times more life and color before you shining in the sun is a long glistening line of gutternot a very pleasing object in a city but in a picture invaluable on each side are houses of all dimensions and hues some but of one story some as high as the tower of babel from these the haberdashers and this is their favorite street flaunt long strips of gaudy calicoes which give a strange air of rude gayety to the street milkwomen with a little crowd of gossips round each are at this early hour of morning selling the chief material of the parisian caféaulait gay wineshops painted red and smartly decorated with vines and gilded railings are filled with workmen taking their mornings draught that gloomylooking prison on your right is a prison for women once it was a convent for lazarists a thousand unfortunate individuals of the softer sex now occupy that mansion they bake as we find in the guidebooks the bread of all the other prisons they mend and wash the shirts and stockings of all the other prisoners they make hooksandeyes and phosphorusboxes and they attend chapel every sundayif occupation can help them sure they have enough of it was it not a great stroke of the legislature to superintend the morals and linen at once and thus keep these poor creatures continually mendingbut we have passed the prison long ago and are at the porte st denis itself  there is only time to take a hasty glance as we pass it commemorates some of the wonderful feats of arms of ludovicus magnus and abounds in ponderous allegoriesnymphs and rivergods and pyramids crowned with fleursdelis louis passing over the rhine in triumph and the dutch lion giving up the ghost in the year of our lord 1672 the dutch lion revived and overcame the man some years afterwards but of this fact singularly enough the inscriptions make no mention passing then round the gate and not under it after the general custom in respect of triumphal arches you cross the boulevard which gives a glimpse of trees and sunshine and gleaming white buildings then dashing down the rue de bourbon villeneuve a dirty street which seems interminable and the rue st eustache the conductor gives a last blast on his horn and the great vehicle clatters into the courtyard where the journey is destined to conclude  if there was a noise before of screaming postilions and cracked horns it was nothing to the babellike clatter which greets us now we are in a great court which hajji baba would call the father of diligences half a dozen other coaches arrive at the same minuteno light affairs like your english vehicles but ponderous machines containing fifteen passengers inside more in the cabriolet and vast towers of luggage on the roof others are loading the yard is filled with passengers coming or departingbustling porters and screaming commissionaires these latter seize you as you descend from your placetwenty cards are thrust into your hand and as many voices jabbering with inconceivable swiftness shriek into your ear dis way sare are you for ze otel of rhin hôtel de lamirautéhotel bristol saremonsieur lhôtel de lille sacrrrré nom de dieu laissez passer ce petit monsieur ow mosh loggish ave you sare  and now if you are a stranger in paris listen to the words of titmarshif you cannot speak a syllable of french and love english comfort clean rooms breakfasts and waiters if you would have plentiful dinners and are not particular as how should you be concerning wine if in this foreign country you will have your english companions your porter your friend and your brandyandwaterdo not listen to any of these commissioner fellows but with your best english accent shout out boldly meurice and straightway a man will step forward to conduct you to the rue de rivoli  here you will find apartments at any price a very neat room for instance for three francs daily an english breakfast of eternal boiled eggs or grilled ham a nondescript dinner profuse but cold and a society which will rejoice your heart here are young gentlemen from the universities young merchants on a lark large families of nine daughters with fat father and mother officers of dragoons and lawyers clerks the last time we dined at meurices we hobbed and nobbed with no less a person than mr moses the celebrated bailiff of chancery lane lord brougham was on his right and a clergymans lady with a train of whitehaired girls sat on his left wonderfully taken with the diamond rings of the fascinating stranger  it is as you will perceive an admirable way to see paris especially if you spend your days reading the english papers at galignanis as many of our foreign tourists do  but all this is promiscuous and not to the purpose ifto continue on the subject of hotel choosingif you love quiet heavy bills and the best tabledhôte in the city go o stranger to the hôtel des princes it is close to the boulevard and convenient for frascatis the hôtel mirabeau possesses scarcely less attraction but of this you will find in mr bulwers autobiography of pelham a faithful and complete account lawsons hotel has likewise its merits as also the hôtel de lille which may be described as a second chop meurice  if you are a poor student come to study the humanities or the pleasant art of amputation cross the water forthwith and proceed to the hôtel corneille near the odéon or others of its species there are many where you can live royally until you economize by going into lodgings on four francs a day and where if by any strange chance you are desirous for a while to get rid of your countrymen you will find that they scarcely ever penetrate  but above all o my countrymen shun boardinghouses especially if you have ladies in your train or ponder well and examine the characters of the keepers thereof before you lead your innocent daughters and their mamma into places so dangerous in the first place you have bad dinners and secondly bad company if you play cards you are very likely playing with a swindler if you dance you dance with a  person with whom you had better have nothing to do   note which ladies are requested not to readin one of these establishments daily advertised as most eligible for english a friend of the writer lived a lady who had passed for some time as the wife of one of the inmates suddenly changed her husband and name her original husband remaining in the house and saluting her by her new title     a caution to travellers   a million dangers and snares await the traveller as soon as he issues out of that vast messagerie which we have just quitted and as each man cannot do better than relate such events as have happened in the course of his own experience and may keep the unwary from the path of danger let us take this the very earliest opportunity of imparting to the public a little of the wisdom which we painfully have acquired  and first then with regard to the city of paris it is to be remarked that in that metropolis flourish a greater number of native and exotic swindlers than are to be found in any other european nursery what young englishman that visits it but has not determined in his heart to have a little share of the gayeties that go onjust for once just to see what they are like how many when the horrible gambling dens were open did resist a sight of themnay was not a young fellow rather flattered by a dinner invitation from the salon whither he went fondly pretending that he should see french society in the persons of certain dukes and counts who used to frequent the place  my friend pogson is a young fellow not much worse although perhaps a little weaker and simpler than his neighbors and coming to paris with exactly the same notions that bring many others of the british youth to that capital events befell him there last winter which are strictly true and shall here be narrated by way of warning to all  pog it must be premised is a city man who travels in drugs for a couple of the best london houses blows the flute has an album drives his own gig and is considered both on the road and in the metropolis a remarkably nice intelligent thriving young man pogsons only fault is too great an attachment to the fairthe sex as he says often will be his ruin the fact is that pog never travels without a don juan under his drivingcushion and is a prettylooking young fellow enough  sam pogson had occasion to visit paris last october and it was in that city that his love of the sex had liked to have cost him dear he worked his way down to dover placing right and left at the towns on his route rhubarb sodas and other such delectable wares as his masters dealt in the sweetest sample of castor oil smelt like a nosegaywent off like wildfirehogshead and a half at rochester eightand twenty gallons at canterbury and so on and crossed to calais and thence voyaged to paris in the coupé of the diligence he paid for two places too although a single man and the reason shall now be made known  dining at the tabledhôte at quillacqsit is the best inn on the continent of europeour little traveller had the happiness to be placed next to a lady who was he saw at a glance one of the extreme pink of the nobility a large lady in black satin with eyes and hair as black as sloes with gold chains scentbottles sable tippet worked pockethandkerchief and four twinkling rings on each of her plump white fingers her cheeks were as pink as the finest chinese rouge could make them pog knew the article he travelled in it her lips were as red as the ruby lip salve she used the very best that was clear  she was a finelooking woman certainly holding down her eyes and talking perpetually of mes trentedeux ans and pogson the wicked young dog who professed not to care for young misses saying they smelt so of breadandbutter declared at once that the lady was one of his beauties in fact when he spoke to us about her he said shes a slapup thing i tell you a reglar good one one of my sort and such was pogsons credit in all commercial rooms that one of his sort was considered to surpass all other sorts  during dinnertime mr pogson was profoundly polite and attentive to the lady at his side and kindly communicated to her as is the way with the bestbred english on their first arrival on the continent all his impressions regarding the sights and persons he had seen such remarks having been made during half an hours ramble about the ramparts and town and in the course of a walk down to the customhouse and a confidential communication with the commissionaire must be doubtless very valuable to frenchmen in their own country and the lady listened to pogsons opinions not only with benevolent attention but actually she said with pleasure and delight mr pogson said that there was no such thing as good meat in france and thats why they cooked their victuals in this queer way he had seen many soldiers parading about the place and expressed a true englishmans abhorrence of an armed force not that he feared such fellows as theselittle whippersnappersour men would eat them hereupon the lady admitted that our guards were angels but that monsieur must not be too hard upon the french her father was a general of the emperor  pogson felt a tremendous respect for himself at the notion that he was dining with a generals daughter and instantly ordered a bottle of champagne to keep up his consequence  mrs bironn maam said he for he had heard the waiter call her by some such name if you will accept a glass of champagne maam youll do me im sure great honor they say its very good and a precious sight cheaper than it is on our side of the way toonot that i care for money mrs bironn maam your health maam  the lady smiled very graciously and drank the wine  har you any relation maam if i may make so bold har you anyways connected with the family of our immortal bard  sir i beg your pardon  dont mention it maam but bironn and byron are hevidently the same names only you pronounce in the french way and i thought you might be related to his lordship his horigin maam was of french extraction and here pogson began to repeat        hare thy heyes like thy mothers my fair child       hada sole daughter of my ouse and art   oh said the lady laughing you speak of lor byron  hauthor of don juan child arold and cain a mystery said pogsoni do and hearing the waiter calling you madam la bironn took the liberty of hasking whether you were connected with his lordship thats hall and my friend here grew dreadfully red and began twiddling his long ringlets in his fingers and examining very eagerly the contents of his plate  oh no madame la baronne means mistress baroness my husband was baron and i am baroness  what ave i the honori beg your pardon maamis your ladyship a baroness and i not know it pray excuse me for calling you maam  the baroness smiled most graciouslywith such a look as juno cast upon unfortunate jupiter when she wished to gain her wicked ends upon himthe baroness smiled and stealing her hand into a black velvet bag drew from it an ivory cardcase and from the ivory cardcase extracted a glazed card printed in gold on it was engraved a coronet and under the coronet the words       baronne de florvaldelval        nÉe de melvalnorval                   rue taitbout   the grand pitt diamondthe queens own star of the gartera sample of ottoofroses at a guinea a drop would not be handled more curiously or more respectfully than this porcelain card of the baroness trembling he put it into his little russialeather pocketbook and when he ventured to look up and saw the eyes of the baroness de florvaldelval née de melvalnorval gazing upon him with friendly and serene glances a thrill of pride tingled through pogsons blood he felt himself to be the very happiest fellow on the continent  but pogson did not for some time venture to resume that sprightly and elegant familiarity which generally forms the great charm of his conversation he was too much frightened at the presence he was in and contented himself by graceful and solemn bows deep attention and ejaculations of yes my lady and no your ladyship for some minutes after the discovery had been made pogson piqued himself on his breeding i hate the aristocracy he said but thats no reason why i shouldnt behave like a gentleman  a surly silent little gentleman who had been the third at the ordinary and would take no part either in the conversation or in pogsons champagne now took up his hat and grunting left the room when the happy bagman had the delight of a têteàtête the baroness did not appear inclined to move it was cold a fire was comfortable and she had ordered none in her apartment might pogson give her one more glass of champagne or would her ladyship prefer something hot her ladyship gravely said she never took anything hot some champagne then a leetle drop she would she would o gods how pogsons hand shook as he filled and offered her the glass  what took place during the rest of the evening had better be described by mr pogson himself who has given us permission to publish his letter   quillacqs hotel pronounced killyax calais  dear

sounds well travelling you know and when she asked me if i was not an officer i couldnt say no adieu then my dear fellow till monday and vive le joy as they say the baroness says i speak french charmingly she talks english as well as you or i  your affectionate friend  s pogson   this letter reached us duly in our garrets and we engaged such an apartment for mr pogson as beseemed a gentleman of his rank in the world and the army at the appointed hour too we repaired to the diligence office and there beheld the arrival of the machine which contained him and his lovely baroness  those who have much frequented the society of gentlemen of his profession and what more delightful must be aware that when all the rest of mankind look hideous dirty peevish wretched after a forty hours coachjourney a bagman appears as gay and spruce as when he started having within himself a thousand little conveniences for the voyage which common travellers neglect pogson had a little portable toilet of which he had not failed to take advantage and with his long curling flaxen hair flowing under a sealskin cap with a gold tassel with a blue and gold satin handkerchief a crimson velvet waistcoat a light green cutaway coat a pair of barred brickdustcolored pantaloons and a neat mackintosh presented altogether as elegant and distingué an appearance as any one could desire he had put on a clean collar at breakfast and a pair of white kids as he entered the barrier and looked as he rushed into my arms more like a man stepping out of a bandbox than one descending from a vehicle that has just performed one of the laziest dullest flattest stalest dirtiest journeys in europe  to my surprise there were two ladies in the coach with my friend and not one as i had expected one of these a stout female carrying sundry baskets bags umbrellas and womans wraps was evidently a maidservant the other in black was pogsons fair one evidently i could see a gleam of curlpapers over a sallow faceof a dusky nightcap flapping over the curlpapersbut these were hidden by a lace veil and a huge velvet bonnet of which the crowning birdsofparadise were evidently in a moulting state she was encased in many shawls and wrappers she put hesitatingly a pretty little foot out of the carriagepogson was by her side in an instant and gallantly putting one of his white kids round her waist aided this interesting creature to descend i saw by her walk that she was fiveandforty and that my little pogson was a lost man  after some brief parley between themin which it was charming to hear how my friend samuel would speak what he called french to a lady who could not understand one syllable of his jargonthe mutual hackneycoaches drew up madame la baronne waved to the captain a graceful french curtsy adyou said samuel and waved his lily hand adyouaddimang  a brisk little gentleman who had made the journey in the same coach with pogson but had more modestly taken a seat in the imperial here passed us and greeted me with a how dye do he had shouldered his own little valise and was trudging off scattering a cloud of commissionaires who would fain have spared him the trouble  do you know that chap says pogson surly fellow aint he  the kindest man in existence answered i all the world knows little major british  hes a major is hewhy thats the fellow that dined with us at killyaxs its lucky i did not call myself captain before him he mightnt have liked it you know and then sam fell into a reveriewhat was the subject of his thoughts soon appeared  did you ever see such a foot and ankle said sam after sitting for some time regardless of the novelty of the scene his hands in his pockets plunged in the deepest thought  isnt she a slapup woman eh now pursued he and began enumerating her attractions as a horsejockey would the points of a favorite animal  you seem to have gone a pretty length already said i by promising to visit her tomorrow  a good lengthi believe you leave me alone for that  but i thought you were only to be two in the coupé you wicked rogue  two in the coopy oh ah yes you knowwhy that is i didnt know she had her maid with her what an ass i was to think of a noblewoman travelling without one and couldnt in course refuse when she asked me to let the maid in  of course not  couldnt you know as a man of honor but i made up for all that said pogson winking slyly and putting his hand to his little bunch of a nose in a very knowing way  you did and how  why you dog i sat next to her sat in the middle the whole way and my backs half broke i can tell you and thus having depicted his happiness we soon reached the inn where this backbroken young man was to lodge during his stay in paris  the next day at five we met mr pogson had seen his baroness and described her lodgings in his own expressive way as slapup she had received him quite like an old friend treated him to eau sucrée of which beverage he expressed himself a great admirer and actually asked him to dine the next day but there was a cloud over the ingenuous youths brow and i inquired still farther  why said he with a sigh i thought she was a widow and hang it who should come in but her husband the baron a big fellow sir with a blue coat a red ribbing and such a pair of mustachios  well said i he didnt turn you out i suppose  oh no on the contrary as kind as possible his lordship said that he respected the english army asked me what corps i was insaid he had fought in spain against usand made me welcome  what could you want more  mr pogson at this only whistled and if some very profound observer of human nature had been there to read into this little bagmans heart it would perhaps have been manifest that the appearance of a whiskered soldier of a husband had counteracted some plans that the young scoundrel was concocting  i live up a hundred and thirtyseven steps in the remote quarter of the luxembourg and it is not to be expected that such a fashionable fellow as sam pogson with his pockets full of money and a new city to see should be always wandering to my dull quarters so that although he did not make his appearance for some time he must not be accused of any lukewarmness of friendship on that score  he was out too when i called at his hotel but once i had the good fortune to see him with his hat curiously on one side looking as pleased as punch and being driven in an open cab in the champs elysées thats another tiptop chap said he when we met at length what do you think of an earls son my boy honorable tom ringwood son of the earl of cinqbars what do you think of that eh  i thought he was getting into very good society sam was a dashing fellow and was always above his own line of life he had met mr ringwood at the barons and theyd been to the play together and the honorable gent as sam called him had joked with him about being well to do in a certain quarter and he had had a game of billiards with the baron at the estaminy a very distangy place where you smoke said sam quite select and frequented by the tiptop nobility and they were as thick as peas in a shell and they were to dine that day at ringwoods and sup the next night with the baroness  i think the chaps down the road will stare said sam when they hear how ive been coming it and stare no doubt they would for it is certain that very few commercial gentlemen have had mr pogsons advantages  the next morning we had made an arrangement to go out shopping together and to purchase some articles of female gear that sam intended to bestow on his relations when he returned seven needlebooks for his sisters a gilt buckle for his mamma a handsome french cashmere shawl and bonnet for his aunt the old lady keeps an inn in the borough and has plenty of money and no heirs and a toothpick case for his father sam is a good fellow to all his relations and as for his aunt he adores her well we were to go and make these purchases and i arrived punctually at my time but sam was stretched on a sofa very pale and dismal  i saw how it had beena little too much of mr ringwoods claret i suppose  he only gave a sickly stare  where does the honorable tom live says i  honorable says sam with a hollow horrid laugh i tell you tit hes no more honorable than you are  what an impostor  no no not that he is a real honorable only  oh ho i smell a rata little jealous eh  jealousy be hanged i tell you hes a thief and the barons a thief and hang me if i think his wife is any better eightandthirty pounds he won of me before supper and made me drunk and sent me homeis that honorable how can i afford to lose forty pounds its took me two years to save it upif my old aunt gets wind of it shell cut me off with a shilling hang meand here sam in an agony tore his fair hair  while bewailing his lot in this lamentable strain his bell was rung which signal being answered by a surly come in a tall very fashionable gentleman with a fur coat and a fierce tuft to his chin entered the room pogson my buck how goes it said he familiarly and gave a stare at me i was making for my hat  dont go said sam rather eagerly and i sat down again  the honorable mr ringwood hummed and had and at last said he wished to speak to mr pogson on business in private if possible  theres no secrets betwixt me and my friend cried sam  mr ringwood paused a littlean awkward business that of last night at length exclaimed he  i believe it was an awkward business said sam dryly  i really am very sorry for your losses  thank you and so am i i can tell you said sam  you must mind my good fellow and not drink for when you drink you will play high by gad you led us in and not we you  i dare say answered sam with something of peevishness losses is losses theres no use talking about em when theyre over and paid  and paid here wonderingly spoke mr ringwood why my dear felwhat the deucehas florval been with you  d florval growled sam ive never set eyes on his face since last night and never wish to see him again  come come enough of this talk how do you intend to settle the bills which you gave him last night  bills i what do you mean  i mean sir these bills said the honorable tom producing two out of his pocketbook and looking as stern as a lion i promise to pay on demand to the baron de florval the sum of four hundred pounds october 20 1838 ten days after date i promise to pay the baron de et caetera et caetera one hundred and ninetyeight pounds samuel pogson you didnt say what regiment you were in  what shouted poor sam as from a dream starting up and looking preternaturally pale and hideous  d it sir you dont affect ignorance you dont pretend not to remember that you signed these bills for money lost in my rooms money lent to you by madame de florval at your own request and lost to her husband you dont suppose sir that i shall be such an infernal idiot as to believe you or such a coward as to put up with a mean subterfuge of this sort will you or will you not pay the money sir  i will not said sam stoutly its a dd swin  here mr ringwood sprung up clenching his ridingwhip and looking so fierce that sam and i bounded back to the other end of the room utter that word again and by heaven ill murder you shouted mr ringwood and looked as if he would too once more will you or will you not pay this money  i cant said sam faintly  ill call again captain pogson said mr ringwood ill call again in one hour and unless you come to some arrangement you must meet my friend the baron de florval or ill post you for a swindler and a coward with this he went out the door thundered to after him and when the clink of his steps departing had subsided i was enabled to look round at pog the poor little man had his elbows on the marble table his head between his hands and looked as one has seen gentlemen look over a steamvessel off ramsgate the wind blowing remarkably fresh at last he fairly burst out crying  if mrs pogson heard of this said i what would become of the three tuns for i wished to give him a lesson if your ma who took you every sunday to meeting should know that her boy was paying attention to married womenif drench glauber and co your employers were to know that their confidential agent was a gambler and unfit to be trusted with their money how long do you think your connection would last with them and who would afterwards employ you  to this poor pog had not a word of answer but sat on his sofa whimpering so bitterly that the sternest of moralists would have relented towards him and would have been touched by the little wretchs tears everything too must be pleaded in excuse for this unfortunate bagman who if he wished to pass for a captain had only done so because he had an intense respect and longing for rank if he had made love to the baroness had only done so because he was given to understand by lord byrons don juan that making love was a very correct natty thing and if he had gambled had only been induced to do so by the bright eyes and example of the baron and the baroness o ye barons and baronesses of england if ye knew what a number of small commoners are daily occupied in studying your lives and imitating your aristocratic ways how careful would ye be of your morals manners and conversation  my soul was filled then with a gentle yearning pity for pogson and revolved many plans for his rescue none of these seeming to be practicable at last we hit on the very wisest of all and determined to apply for counsel to no less a person than major british  a blessing it is to be acquainted with my worthy friend little major british and heaven sure it was that put the major into my head when i heard of this awkward scrape of poor fogs the major is on halfpay and occupies a modest apartment au quatrième in the very hotel which pogson had patronized at my suggestion indeed i had chosen it from major britishs own peculiar recommendation  there is no better guide to follow than such a character as the honest major of whom there are many likenesses now scattered over the continent of europe men who love to live well and are forced to live cheaply and who find the english abroad a thousand times easier merrier and more hospitable than the same persons at home i for my part never landed on calais pier without feeling that a load of sorrows was left on the other side of the water and have always fancied that black care stepped on board the steamer along with the customhouse officers at gravesend and accompanied one to yonder black louring towers of londonso busy so dismal and so vast  british would have cut any foreigners throat who ventured to say so much but entertained no doubt private sentiments of this nature for he passed eight months of the year regularly abroad with headquarters at paris the garrets before alluded to and only went to england for the months shooting on the grounds of his old colonel now an old lord of whose acquaintance the major was passably inclined to boast  he loved and respected like a good staunch tory as he is every one of the english nobility gave himself certain little airs of a man of fashion that were by no means disagreeable and was indeed kindly regarded by such english aristocracy as he met in his little annual tours among the german courts in italy or in paris where he never missed an ambassadors night he retailed to us who didnt go but were delighted to know all that had taken place accurate accounts of the dishes the dresses and the scandal which had there fallen under his observation  he is moreover one of the most useful persons in society that can possibly be for besides being incorrigibly duelsome on his own account he is for others the most acute and peaceable counsellor in the world and has carried more friends through scrapes and prevented more deaths than any member of the humane society british never bought a single step in the army as is well known in 14 he killed a celebrated french fireeater who had slain a young friend of his and living as he does a great deal with young men of pleasure and good old sober family people he is loved by them both and has as welcome a place made for him at a roaring bachelors supper at the café anglais as at a staid dowagers dinnertable in the faubourg st honoré such pleasant old boys are very profitable acquaintances let me tell you and lucky is the young man who has one or two such friends in his list  hurrying on fogson in his dress i conducted him panting up to the majors quatrième where we were cheerfully bidden to come in the little gentleman was in his travelling jacket and occupied in painting elegantly one of those natty pairs of boots in which he daily promenaded the boulevards a couple of pairs of tough buff gloves had been undergoing some pipeclaying operation under his hands no man stepped out so spick and span with a hat so nicely brushed with a stiff cravat tied so neatly under a fat little red face with a blue frockcoat so scrupulously fitted to a punchy little person as major british about whom we have written these two pages he stared rather hardly at my companion but gave me a kind shake of the hand and we proceeded at once to business major british said i we want your advice in regard to an unpleasant affair which has just occurred to my friend pogson  pogson take a chair  you must know sir that mr pogson coming from calais the other day encountered in the diligence a very handsome woman  british winked at pogson who wretched as he was could not help feeling pleased  mr pogson was not more pleased with this lovely creature than was she with him for it appears she gave him her card invited him to her house where he has been constantly and has been received with much kindness  i see says british  her husband the baron  now its coming said the major with a grin her husband is jealous i suppose and there is a talk of the bois de boulogne my dear sir you cant refusecant refuse  its not that said pogson wagging his head passionately  her husband the baron seemed quite as much taken with pogson as his lady was and has introduced him to some very distingué friends of his own set last night one of the barons friends gave a party in honor of my friend pogson who lost fortyeight pounds at cards before he was made drunk and heaven knows how much after  not a shilling by sacred heavennot a shilling yelled out pogson after the supper i ad such an eadach i couldnt do anything but fall asleep on the sofa  you ad such an eadach sir says british sternly who piques himself on his grammar and pronunciation and scorns a cockney  such a headache sir replied pogson with much meekness  the unfortunate man is brought home at two oclock as tipsy as possible dragged up stairs senseless to bed and on waking receives a visit from his entertainer of the night beforea lords son major a tiptop fellowwho brings a couple of bills that my friend pogson is said to have signed  well my dear fellow the things quite simplehe must pay them  i cant pay them  he cant pay them said we both in a breath pogson is a commercial traveller with thirty shillings a week and how the deuce is he to pay five hundred pounds  a bagman sir and what right has a bagman to gamble gentlemen gamble sir tradesmen sir have no business with the amusements of the gentry what business had you with barons and lords sons sirserve you right sir  sir says pogson with some dignity merit and not birth is the criterion of a man i despise an hereditary aristocracy and admire only natures gentlemen for my part i think that a british merch  hold your tongue sir bounced out the major and dont lecture me dont come to me sir with your slang about natures gentlemennatures tomfools sir did nature open a cash account for you at a bankers sir did nature give you an education sir what do you mean by competing with people to whom nature has given all these things stick to your bags mr pogson and your bagmen and leave barons and their like to their own ways  yes but major here cried that faithful friend who has always stood by pogson they wont leave him alone  the honorable gent says i must fight if i dont pay whimpered sam  what fight you do you mean that the honorable gent as you call him will go out with a bagman  he doesnt know im aim a commercial man blushingly said sam he fancies im a military gent  the majors gravity was quite upset at this absurd notion and he laughed outrageously why the fact is sir said i that my friend pogson knowing the value of the title of captain and being complimented by the baroness on his warlike appearance said boldly he was in the army he only assumed the rank in order to dazzle her weak imagination never fancying that there was a husband and a circle of friends with whom he was afterwards to make an acquaintance and then you know it was too late to withdraw  a pretty pickle you have put yourself in mr pogson by making love to other mens wives and calling yourself names said the major who was restored to good humor and pray who is the honorable gent  the earl of cinqbars son says pogson the honorable tom ringwood  i thought it was some such character and the baron is the baron de florvaldelval  the very same  and his wife a blackhaired woman with a pretty foot and ankle calls herself athenais and is always talking about her trentedeux ans why sir that woman was an actress on the boulevard when we were here in 15 shes no more his wife than i am delvals name is chicot the woman is always travelling between london and paris i saw she was hooking you at calais she has hooked ten men in the course of the last two years in this very way she lent you money didnt she yes and she leans on your shoulder and whispers play half for me and somebody wins it and the poor thing is as sorry as you are and her husband storms and rages and insists on double stakes and she leans over your shoulder again and tells every card in your hand to your adversary and thats the way its done mr pogson  ive been ad i see i ave said pogson very humbly  well sir said the major in consideration not of you sirfor give me leave to tell you mr pogson that you are a pitiful little scoundrelin consideration for my lord cinqbars sir with whom i am proud to say i am intimate the major dearly loved a lord and was by his own showing acquainted with half the peerage i will aid you in this affair your cursed vanity sir and want of principle has set you in the first place intriguing with other mens wives and if you had been shot for your pains a bullet would have only served you right sir you must go about as an impostor sir in society and you pay richly for your swindling sir by being swindled yourself but as i think your punishment has been already pretty severe i shall do my best out of regard for my friend lord cinqbars to prevent the matter going any farther and i recommend you to leave paris without delay now let me wish you a good morningwherewith british made a majestic bow and began giving the last touch to his varnished boots  we departed poor sam perfectly silent and chapfallen and i meditating on the wisdom of the halfpay philosopher and wondering what means he would employ to rescue pogson from his fate  what these means were i know not but mr ringwood did not make his appearance at six and at eight a letter arrived for mr pogson commercial traveller c c it was blank inside but contained his two bills mr ringwood left town almost immediately for vienna nor did the major explain the circumstances which caused his departure but he muttered something about knew some of his old tricks threatened police and made him disgorge directly  mr ringwood is as yet young at his trade and i have often thought it was very green of him to give up the bills to the major who certainly would never have pressed the matter before the police out of respect for his friend lord cinqbars     the fÊtes of july  in a letter to the editor of the bungay beacon   paris july 30th 1839  we have arrived here just in time for the fêtes of julyyou have read no doubt of that glorious revolution which took place here nine years ago and which is now commemorated annually in a pretty facetious manner by gunfiring studentprocessions poleclimbingforsilverspoons goldwatches and legsofmutton monarchical orations and what not and sanctioned moreover by chamberofdeputies with a grant of a couple of hundred thousand francs to defray the expenses of all the crackers gunfirings and legsofmutton aforesaid there is a new fountain in the place louis quinze otherwise called the place louis seize or else the place de la révolution or else the place de la concorde who can say whywhich i am told is to run bad wine during certain hours tomorrow and there would have been a review of the national guards and the lineonly since the fieschi business reviews are no joke and so this latter part of the festivity has been discontinued  do you not laugh o pharos of bungay at the continuance of a humbug such as thisat the humbugging anniversary of a humbug the king of the barricades is next to the emperor nicholas the most absolute sovereign in europe yet there is not in the whole of this fair kingdom of france a single man who cares sixpence about him or his dynasty except mayhap a few hangerson at the château who eat his dinners and put their hands in his purse the feeling of loyalty is as dead as old charles the tenth the chambers have been laughed at the country has been laughed at all the successive ministries have been laughed at and you know who is the wag that has amused himself with them all and behold here come three days at the end of july and cannons think it necessary to fire off squibs and crackers to blaze and fizz fountains to run wine kings to make speeches and subjects to crawl up greasy mâtsdecocagne in token of gratitude and réjouissance publiquemy dear sir in their aptitude to swallow to utter to enact humbugs these french people from majesty downwards beat all the other nations of this earth in looking at these men their manners dresses opinions politics actions history it is impossible to preserve a grave countenance instead of having carlyle to write a history of the french revolution i often think it should be handed over to dickens or theodore hook and oh where is the rabelais to be the faithful historian of the last phase of the revolutionthe last glorious nine years of which we are now commemorating the last glorious three days  i had made a vow not to say a syllable on the subject although i have seen with my neighbors all the gingerbread stalls down the champs elysées and some of the catafalques erected to the memory of the heroes of july where the students and others not connected personally with the victims and not having in the least profited by their deaths come and weep but the grief shown on the first day is quite as absurd and fictitious as the joy exhibited on the last the subject is one which admits of much wholesome reflection and food for mirth and besides is so richly treated by the french themselves that it would be a sin and a shame to pass it over allow me to have the honor of translating for your edification an account of the first days proceedingsit is mighty amusing to my thinking   celebration of the days of july  today saturday funeral ceremonies in honor of the victims of july were held in the various edifices consecrated to public worship  these edifices with the exception of some churches especially that of the petitspères were uniformly hung with black on the outside the hangings bore only this inscription 27 28 29 july 1830surrounded by a wreath of oakleaves  in the interior of the catholic churches it had only been thought proper to dress little catafalques as for burials of the third and fourth class very few clergy attended but a considerable number of the national guard  the synagogue of the israelites was entirely hung with black and a great concourse of people attended the service was performed with the greatest pomp  in the protestant temples there was likewise a very full attendance apologetical discourses on the revolution of july were pronounced by the pastors  the absence of m de quélen archbishop of paris and of many members of the superior clergy was remarked at notre dame  the civil authorities attended service in their several districts  the poles ornamented with tricolored flags which formerly were placed on notre dame were it was remarked suppressed the flags on the pont neuf were during the ceremony only halfmast high and covered with crape  et caetera et caetera et caetera  the tombs of the louvre were covered with black hangings and adorned with tricolored flags in front and in the middle was erected an expiatory monument of a pyramidical shape and surmounted by a funeral vase  these tombs were guarded by the municipal guard the troops of the line the sergens de ville town patrol and a brigade of agents of police in plain clothes under the orders of peaceofficer vassal  between eleven and twelve oclock some young men to the number of 400 or 500 assembled on the place de la bourse one of them bearing a tricolored banner with an inscription to the manes of july ranging themselves in order they marched five abreast to the marché des innocens on their arrival the municipal guards of the halle aux draps where the post had been doubled issued out without arms and the townsergeants placed themselves before the market to prevent the entry of the procession the young men passed in perfect order and without saying a wordonly lifting their hats as they defiled before the tombs when they arrived at the louvre they found the gates shut and the garden evacuated the troops were under arms and formed in battalion  after the passage of the procession the garden was again open to the public  and the evening and the morning were the first day  theres nothing serious in mortality is there from the beginning of this account to the end thereof aught but sheer open monstrous undisguised humbug i said before that you should have a history of these people by dickens or theodore hook but there is little need of professed wagsdo not the men write their own tale with an admirable sancholike gravity and naïveté which one could not desire improved how good is that touch of sly indignation about the little catafalques how rich the contrast presented by the economy of the catholics to the splendid disregard of expense exhibited by the devout jews and how touching the apologetical discourses on the revolution delivered by the protestant pastors fancy the profound affliction of the gardes municipaux the sergens de ville the police agents in plain clothes and the troops with fixed bayonets sobbing round the expiatory monuments of a pyramidical shape surmounted by funeral vases and compelled by sad duty to fire into the public who might wish to indulge in the same woe o manes of july the phrase is pretty and grammatical why did you with sharp bullets break those louvre windows why did you bayonet redcoated swiss behind that fair white façade and braving cannon musket sabre perspective guillotine burst yonder bronze gates rush through that peaceful picturegallery and hurl royalty loyalty and a thousand years of kings headoverheels out of yonder tuileries windows  it is you will allow a little difficult to saythere is however one benefit that the country has gained as for liberty of press or person diminished taxation a juster representation who ever thinks of themone benefit they have gained or nearlyabolition de la peinedemort pour délit politique no more wicked guillotining for revolutions a frenchman must have his revolutionit is his nature to knock down omnibuses in the street and across them to fire at troops of the lineit is a sin to balk it did not the king send off revolutionary prince napoleon in a coachandfour did not the jury before the face of god and justice proclaim revolutionary colonel vaudrey not guiltyone may hope soon that if a man shows decent courage and energy in half a dozen émeutes he will get promotion and a premium  i do not although perhaps partial to the subject want to talk more nonsense than the occasion warrants and will pray you to cast your eyes over the following anecdote that is now going the round of the papers and respects the commutation of the punishment of that wretched foolhardy barbés who on his trial seemed to invite the penalty which has just been remitted to him you recollect the braggarts speech when the indian falls into the power of the enemy he knows the fate that awaits him and submits his head to the knifei am the indian  well  m hugo was at the opera on the night the sentence of the court of peers condemning barbés to death was published the great poet composed the following verses        par votre ange envolée ainsi quune colombe       par le royal enfant doux et frêle roseau       grace encore une fois  grace au nom de la tombe          grace au nom du berçeau   m victor hugo wrote the lines out instantly on a sheet of paper which he folded and simply despatched them to the king of the french by the pennypost  that truly is a noble voice which can at all hours thus speak to the throne poetry in old days was called the language of the godsit is better named nowit is the language of the kings  but the clemency of the king had anticipated the letter of the poet his majesty had signed the commutation of barbés while the poet was still writing  louis philippe replied to the author of ruy blas most graciously that he had already subscribed to a wish so noble and that the verses had only confirmed his previous disposition to mercy          translated for the benefit of country gentlemen       by your angel flown away just like a dove       by the royal infant that frail and tender reed       pardon yet once more  pardon in the name of the tomb       pardon in the name of the cradle   now in countries where fools most abound did one ever read of more monstrous palpable folly in any country save this would a poet who chose to write four crackbrained verses comparing an angel to a dove and a little boy to a reed and calling upon the chief magistrate in the name of the angel or dove the princess mary in her tomb and the little infant in his cradle to spare a criminal have received a gracious answer to his nonsense would he have ever despatched the nonsense and would any journalist have been silly enough to talk of the noble voice that could thus speak to the throne and the noble throne that could return such a noble answer to the noble voice you get nothing done here gravely and decently tawdry stage tricks are played and braggadocio claptraps uttered on every occasion however sacred or solemn in the face of death as by barbés with his hideous indian metaphor in the teeth of reason as by m victor hugo with his twopennypost poetry and of justice as by the kings absurd reply to this absurd demand suppose the count of paris to be twenty times a reed and the princess mary a host of angels is that any reason why the law should not have its course justice is the god of our lower world our great omnipresent guardian as such it moves or should move on majestic awful irresistible having no passionslike a god but in the very midst of the path across which it is to pass lo m victor hugo trips forward smirking and says o divine justice i will trouble you to listen to the following trifling effusion of mine        par votre ange envolée ainsi quune c   awful justice stops and bowing gravely listens to m hugos verses and with true french politeness says mon cher monsieur these verses are charming ravissans délicieux and coming from such a célébrité littéraire as yourself shall meet with every possible attentionin fact had i required anything to confirm my own previous opinions this charming poem would have done so bon jour mon cher monsieur hugo au revoirand they partjustice taking off his hat and bowing and the author of ruy blas quite convinced that he has been treating with him dégal en égal i can hardly bring my mind to fancy that anything is serious in franceit seems to be all rant tinsel and stageplay sham liberty sham monarchy sham glory sham justiceoù diable donc la vérité vatelle se nicher                                        the last rocket of the fête of july has just mounted exploded made a portentous bang and emitted a gorgeous show of blue lights and then like many reputations disappeared totally the hundredth gun on the invalid terrace has uttered its last roarand a great comfort it is for eyes and ears that the festival is over we shall be able to go about our everyday business again and not be hustled by the gendarmes or the crowd  the sight which i have just come away from is as brilliant happy and beautiful as can be conceived and if you want to see french people to the greatest advantage you should go to a festival like this where their manners and innocent gayety show a very pleasing contrast to the coarse and vulgar hilarity which the same class would exhibit in our own countryat epsom racecourse for instance or greenwich fair the greatest noise that i heard was that of a company of jolly villagers from a place in the neighborhood of paris who as soon as the fireworks were over formed themselves into a line three or four abreast and so marched singing home as for the fireworks squibs and crackers are very hard to describe and very little was to be seen of them to me the prettiest sight was the vast orderly happy crowd the number of children and the extraordinary care and kindness of the parents towards these little creatures it does one good to see honest heavy épiciers fathers of families playing with them in the tuileries or as tonight bearing them stoutly on their shoulders through many long hours in order that the little ones too may have their share of the fun john bull i fear is more selfish he does not take mrs bull to the publichouse but leaves her for the most part to take care of the children at home  the fête then is over the pompous black pyramid at the louvre is only a skeleton now all the flags have been miraculously whisked away during the night and the fine chandeliers which glittered down the champs elysées for full half a mile have been consigned to their dens and darkness will they ever be reproduced for other celebrations of the glorious 29th of julyi think not the government which vowed that there should be no more persecutions of the press was on that very 29th seizing a legitimist paper for some real or fancied offence against it it had seized and was seizing daily numbers of persons merely suspected of being disaffected and you may fancy how liberty is understood when some of these prisoners the other day on coming to trial were found guilty and sentenced to one days imprisonment after thirtysix days detention on suspicion i think the government which follows such a system cannot be very anxious about any farther revolutionary fêtes and that the chamber may reasonably refuse to vote more money for them why should men be so mighty proud of having on a certain day cut a certain number of their fellowcountrymens throats the guards and the line employed this time nine years did no more than those who cannonaded the starving lyonnese or bayoneted the luckless inhabitants of the rue transnounainthey did but fulfil the soldiers honorable dutyhis superiors bid him kill and he killethperhaps had he gone to his work with a little more heart the result would have been different and thenwould the conquering party have been justified in annually rejoicing over the conquered would we have thought charles x justified in causing fireworks to be blazed and concerts to be sung and speeches to be spouted in commemoration of his victory over his slaughtered countrymeni wish for my part they would allow the people to go about their business as on the other 362 days of the year and leave the champs elysées free for the omnibuses to run and the tuileries in quiet so that the nursemaids might come as usual and the newspapers be read for a halfpenny apiece  shall i trouble you with an account of the speculations of these latter and the state of the parties which they represent the complication is not a little curious and may form perhaps a subject of graver disquisition the july fêtes occupy as you may imagine a considerable part of their columns just now and it is amusing to follow them one by one to read tweedledums praise and tweedledees indignationto read in the débats how the king was received with shouts and loyal vivatsin the nation how not a tongue was wagged in his praise but on the instant of his departure how the people called for the marseillaise and applauded thatbut best say no more about the fête the legitimists were always indignant at it the high philippist party sneers at and despises it the republicans hate it it seems a joke against them why continue itif there be anything sacred in the name and idea of loyalty why renew this fête it only shows how a rightful monarch was hurled from his throne and a dexterous usurper stole his precious diadem if there be anything noble in the memory of a day when citizens unused to war rose against practised veterans and armed with the strength of their cause overthrew them why speak of it now or renew the bitter recollections of the bootless struggle and victory o lafayette o hero of two worlds o accomplished cromwell grandison you have to answer for more than any mortal man who has played a part in history two republics and one monarchy does the world owe to you and especially grateful should your country be to you did you not in 90 make clear the path for honest robespierre and in 30 prepare the way for                                        the editor of the bungay beacon would insert no more of this letter which is therefore for ever lost to the public     on the french school of painting  with appropriate anecdotes illustrations and philosophical disquisitions   in a letter to mr macgilp of london   the three collections of pictures at the louvre the luxembourg and the ecole des beaux arts contain a number of specimens of french art since its commencement almost and give the stranger a pretty fair opportunity to study and appreciate the school the french list of painters contains some very good namesno very great ones except poussin unless the admirers of claude choose to rank him among great paintersand i think the school was never in so flourishing a condition as it is at the present day they say there are three thousand artists in this town alone of these a handsome minority paint not merely tolerably but well understand their business draw the figure accurately sketch with cleverness and paint portraits churches or restaurateurs shops in a decent manner  to account for a superiority over england which i think as regards art is incontestableit must be remembered that the painters trade in france is a very good one better appreciated better understood and generally far better paid than with us there are a dozen excellent schools which a lad may enter here and under the eye of a practised master learn the apprenticeship of his art at an expense of about ten pounds a year in england there is no school except the academy unless the student can afford to pay a very large sum and place himself under the tuition of some particular artist here a young man for his ten pounds has all sorts of accessory instruction models c and has further and for nothing numberless incitements to study his profession which are not to be found in englandthe streets are filled with pictureshops the people themselves are pictures walking about the churches theatres eatinghouses concertrooms are covered with pictures nature itself is inclined more kindly to him for the sky is a thousand times more bright and beautiful and the sun shines for the greater part of the year add to this incitements more selfish but quite as powerful a french artist is paid very handsomely for five hundred a year is much where all are poor and has a rank in society rather above his merits than below them being caressed by hosts and hostesses in places where titles are laughed at and a baron is thought of no more account than a bankers clerk  the life of the young artist here is the easiest merriest dirtiest existence possible he comes to paris probably at sixteen from his province his parents settle forty pounds a year on him and pay his master he establishes himself in the pays latin or in the new quarter of notre dame de lorette which is quite peopled with painters he arrives at his atelier at a tolerably early hour and labors among a score of companions as merry and poor as himself each gentleman has his favorite tobaccopipe and the pictures are painted in the midst of a cloud of smoke and a din of puns and choice french slang and a roar of choruses of which no one can form an idea who has not been present at such an assembly  you see here every variety of coiffure that has ever been known some young men of genius have ringlets hanging over their shouldersyou may smell the tobacco with which they are scented across the street some have straight locks black oily and redundant some have toupets in the famous louisphilippe fashion some are cropped close some have adopted the present modewhich he who would follow must in order to do so part his hair in the middle grease it with grease and gum it with gum and iron it flat down over his ears when arrived at the ears you take the tongs and make a couple of ranges of curls close round the whole headsuch curls as you may see under a gilt threecornered hat and in her britannic majestys coachmans state wig  this is the last fashion as for the beards there is no end of them all my friends the artists have beards who can raise them and nature though she has rather stinted the bodies and limbs of the french nation has been very liberal to them of hair as you may see by the following specimen fancy these heads and beards under all sorts of capschinese caps mandarin caps greek skullcaps english jockeycaps russian or kuzzilbash caps middleage caps such as are called in heraldry caps of maintenance spanish nets and striped worsted nightcaps fancy all the jackets you have ever seen and you have before you as well as pen can describe the costumes of these indescribable frenchmen  in this company and costume the french student of art passes his days and acquires knowledge how he passes his evenings at what theatres at what guinguettes in company with what seducing little milliner there is no need to say but i knew one who pawned his coat to go to a carnival ball and walked abroad very cheerfully in his blouse for six weeks until he could redeem the absent garment  these young men together with the students of sciences comport themselves towards the sober citizen pretty much as the german bursch towards the philister or as the military man during the empire did to the pékinfrom the height of their poverty they look down upon him with the greatest imaginable scorna scorn i think by which the citizen seems dazzled for his respect for the arts is intense the case is very different in england where a grocers daughter would think she made a misalliance by marrying a painter and where a literary man in spite of all we can say against it ranks below that class of gentry composed of the apothecary the attorney the winemerchant whose positions in country towns at least are so equivocal as for instance my friend the rev james asterisk who has an undeniable pedigree a paternal estate and a living to boot once dined in warwickshire in company with several squires and parsons of that enlightened county asterisk as usual made himself extraordinarily agreeable at dinner and delighted all present with his learning and wit who is that monstrous pleasant fellow said one of the squires dont you know replied another its asterisk the author of soandso and a famous contributor to such and such a magazine good heavens said the squire quite horrified a literary man i thought he had been a gentleman  another instance m guizot when he was minister here had the grand hotel of the ministry and gave entertainments to all the great de par le monde as brantôme says and entertained them in a proper ministerial magnificence the splendid and beautiful duchess of dash was at one of his ministerial parties and went a fortnight afterwards as in duty bound to pay her respects to m guizot but it happened in this fortnight that m guizot was minister no longer having given up his portfolio and his grand hotel to retire into private life and to occupy his humble apartments in the house which he possesses and of which he lets the greater portion a friend of mine was present at one of the exministers soirées where the duchess of dash made her appearance he says the duchess at her entrance seemed quite astounded and examined the premises with a most curious wonder two or three shabby little rooms with ordinary furniture and a minister en retraite who lives by letting lodgings in our country was ever such a thing heard of no thank heaven and a briton ought to be proud of the difference  but to our muttons this country is surely the paradise of painters and pennyaliners and when one reads of m horace vernet at rome exceeding ambassadors at rome by his magnificence and leading such a life as rubens or titian did of old when one sees m thierss grand villa in the rue st george a dozen years ago he was not even a pennyaliner no such luck when one contemplates in imagination m gudin the marine painter too lame to walk through the picturegallery of the louvre accommodated therefore with a wheelchair a privilege of princes only and accompaniednay for what i know actually trundleddown the gallery by majesty itselfwho does not long to make one of the great nation exchange his native tongue for the melodious jabber of france or at least adopt it for his native country like marshal saxe napoleon and anacharsis clootz noble people they made tom paine a deputy and as for tom macaulay they would make a dynasty of him  well this being the case no wonder there are so many painters in france and here at least we are back to them at the ecole royale des beaux arts you see two or three hundred specimens of their performances all the prizemen since 1750 i think being bound to leave their prize sketch or picture can anything good come out of the royal academy is a question which has been considerably mooted in england in the neighborhood of suffolk street especially the hundreds of french samples are i think not very satisfactory the subjects are almost all what are called classical orestes pursued by every variety of furies numbers of little wolfsucking romuluses hectors and andromaches in a complication of parting embraces and so forth for it was the absurd maxim of our forefathers that because these subjects had been the fashion twenty centuries ago they must remain so in saecula saeculorum because to these lofty heights giants had scaled behold the race of pigmies must get upon stilts and jump at them likewise and on the canvas and in the theatre the french frogs excuse the pleasantry were instructed to swell out and roar as much as possible like bulls  what was the consequence my dear friend in trying to make themselves into bulls the frogs make themselves into jackasses as might be expected for a hundred and ten years the classical humbug oppressed the nation and you may see in this gallery of the beaux arts seventy years specimens of the dulness which it engendered  now as nature made every man with a nose and eyes of his own she gave him a character of his own too and yet we o foolish race must try our very best to ape some one or two of our neighbors whose ideas fit us no more than their breeches it is the study of nature surely that profits us and not of these imitations of her a man as a man from a dustman up to Æschylus is gods work and good to read as all works of nature are but the silly animal is never content is ever trying to fit itself into another shape wants to deny its own identity and has not the courage to utter its own thoughts because lord byron was wicked and quarrelled with the world and found himself growing fat and quarrelled with his victuals and thus naturally grew illhumored did not half europe grow illhumored too did not every poet feel his young affections withered and despair and darkness cast upon his soul because certain mighty men of old could make heroical statues and plays must we not be told that there is no other beauty but classical beautymust not every little whipster of a french poet chalk you out plays henriades and suchlike and vow that here was the real thing the undeniable kalon  the undeniable fiddlestick for a hundred years my dear sir the world was humbugged by the socalled classical artists as they now are by what is called the christian art of which anon and it is curious to look at the pictorial traditions as here handed down the consequence of them is that scarce one of the classical pictures exhibited is worth much more than twoandsixpence borrowed from statuary in the first place the color of the paintings seems as much as possible to participate in it they are mostly of a misty stony green dismal hue as if they had been painted in a world where no color was in every picture there are of course white mantles white urns white columns white statuesthose obligé accomplishments of the sublime there are the endless straight noses long eyes round chins short upper lips just as they are ruled down for you in the drawingbooks as if the latter were the revelations of beauty issued by supreme authority from which there was no appeal why is the classical reign to endure why is yonder simpering venus de medicis to be our standard of beauty or the greek tragedies to bound our notions of the sublime there was no reason why agamemnon should set the fashions and remain greek text omitted to eternity and there is a classical quotation which you may have occasionally heard beginning vixere fortes c which as it avers that there were a great number of stout fellows before agamemnon may not unreasonably induce us to conclude that similar heroes were to succeed him shakspeare made a better man when his imagination moulded the mighty figure of macbeth and if you will measure satan by prometheus the blind old puritans work by that of the fiery grecian poet does not miltons angel surpass Æschylusssurpass him by many a rood  in the same school of the beaux arts where are to be found such a number of pale imitations of the antique monsieur thiers and he ought to be thanked for it has caused to be placed a fullsized copy of the last judgment of michel angelo and a number of casts from statues by the same splendid hand there is the sublime if you pleasea new sublimean original sublimequite as sublime as the greek sublime see yonder in the midst of his angels the judge of the world descending in glory and near him beautiful and gentle and yet indescribably august and pure the virgin by his side there is the moses the grandest figure that ever was carved in stone it has about it something frightfully majestic if one may so speak in examining this and the astonishing picture of the judgment or even a single figure of it the spectators sense amounts almost to pain i would not like to be left in a room alone with the moses how did the artist live amongst them and create them how did he suffer the painful labor of invention one fancies that he would have been scorched up like semele by sights too tremendous for his vision to bear one cannot imagine him with our small physical endowments and weaknesses a man like ourselves  as for the ecole royale des beaux arts then and all the good its students have done as students it is stark naught when the men did anything it was after they had left the academy and began thinking for themselves there is only one picture among the many hundreds that has to my idea much merit a charming composition of homer singing signed jourdy and the only good that the academy has done by its pupils was to send them to rome where they might learn better things at home the intolerable stupid classicalities taught by men who belonging to the least erudite country in europe were themselves from their profession the least learned among their countrymen only weighed the pupils down and cramped their hands their eyes and their imaginations drove them away from natural beauty which thank god is fresh and attainable by us all today and yesterday and tomorrow and sent them rambling after artificial grace without the proper means of judging or attaining it  a word for the building of the palais des beaux arts it is beautiful and as well finished and convenient as beautiful with its light and elegant fabric its pretty fountain its archway of the renaissance and fragments of sculpture you can hardly see on a fine day a place more riant and pleasing  passing from thence up the picturesque rue de seine let us walk to the luxembourg where bonnes students grisettes and old gentlemen with pigtails love to wander in the melancholy quaint old gardens where the peers have a new and comfortable court of justice to judge all the émeutes which are to take place and where as everybody knows is the picturegallery of modern french artists whom government thinks worthy of patronage  a very great proportion of the pictures as we see by the catalogue are by the students whose works we have just been to visit at the beaux arts and who having performed their pilgrimage to rome have taken rank among the professors of the art i dont know a more pleasing exhibition for there are not a dozen really bad pictures in the collection some very good and the rest showing great skill and smartness of execution  in the same way however that it has been supposed that no man could be a great poet unless he wrote a very big poem the tradition is kept up among the painters and we have here a vast number of large canvases with figures of the proper heroical length and nakedness the anticlassicists did not arise in france until about 1827 and in consequence up to that period we have here the old classical faith in full vigor there is brutus having chopped his sons head off with all the agony of a father and then calling for number two there is Æneas carrying off old anchises there are paris and venus as naked as two hottentots and many more such choice subjects from lemprière  but the chief specimens of the sublime are in the way of murders with which the catalogue swarms here are a few extracts from it   7 beaume chevalier de la légion dhonneur the grand dauphiness dying  18 blondel chevalier de la c zenobia found dead  36 debay chevalier the death of lucretia  38 dejuinne the death of hector  34 court chevalier de la c the death of caesar  39 40 41 delacroix chevalier dante and virgil in the infernal lake the massacre of scio and medea going to murder her children  43 delaroche chevalier joas taken from among the dead  44 the death of queen elizabeth  45 edward v and his brother preparing for death  50 hecuba going to be sacrificed drolling chevalier  51 dubois young clovis found dead  56 henry chevalier the massacre of st bartholomew  75 guérin chevalier cain after the death of abel  83 jacquand death of adelaide de comminges  88 the death of eudamidas  93 the death of hymetto  103 the death of philip of austriaand so on   you see what woful subjects they take and how profusely they are decorated with knighthood they are like the black brunswickers these painters and ought to be called chevaliers de la mort i dont know why the merriest people in the world should please themselves with such grim representations and varieties of murder or why murder itself should be considered so eminently sublime and poetical it is good at the end of a tragedy but then it is good because it is the end and because by the events foregone the mind is prepared for it but these men will have nothing but fifth acts and seem to skip as unworthy all the circumstances leading to them this however is part of the schemethe bloated unnatural stilted spouting sham sublime that our teachers have believed and tried to pass off as real and which your humble servant and other antihumbuggists should heartily according to the strength that is in them endeavor to pull down what for instance could monsieur lafond care about the death of eudamidas what was hecuba to chevalier drolling or chevalier drolling to hecuba i would lay a wager that neither of them ever conjugated greek text omitted and that their school learning carried them not as far as the letter but only to the game of taw how were they to be inspired by such subjects from having seen talma and mademoiselle georges flaunting in sham greek costumes and having read up the articles eudamidas hecuba in the mythological dictionary what a classicism inspired by rouge gaslamps and a few lines in lemprière and copied half from ancient statues and half from a naked guardsman at one shilling and sixpence the hour  delacroix is a man of a very different genius and his medea is a genuine creation of a noble fancy for most of the others mrs brownrigg and her two female prentices would have done as well as the desperate colchian with her greek text omitted m delacroix has produced a number of rude barbarous pictures but there is the stamp of genius on all of themthe great poetical intention which is worth all your execution delaroche is another man of high merit with not such a great heart perhaps as the other but a fine and careful draughtsman and an excellent arranger of his subject the death of elizabeth is a raw young performance seeminglynot at least to my taste the enfans dedouard is renowned over europe and has appeared in a hundred different ways in print it is properly pathetic and gloomy and merits fully its high reputation this painter rejoices in such subjectsin what lord portsmouth used to call black jobs he has killed charles i and lady jane grey and the dukes of guise and i dont know whom besides he is at present occupied with a vast work at the beaux arts where the writer of this had the honor of seeing hima little keenlooking man some five feet in height he wore on this important occasion a bandanna round his head and was in the act of smoking a cigar  horace vernet whose beautiful daughter delaroche married is the king of french battlepaintersan amazingly rapid and dexterous draughtsman who has napoleon and all the campaigns by heart and has painted the grenadier français under all sorts of attitudes his pictures on such subjects are spirited natural and excellent and he is so clever a man that all he does is good to a certain degree his judith is somewhat violent perhaps his rebecca most pleasing and not the less so for a little pretty affectation of attitude and needless singularity of costume raphael and michael angelo is as clever a picture as can beclever is just the wordthe groups and drawing excellent the coloring pleasantly bright and gaudy and the french students study it incessantly there are a dozen who copy it for one who copies delacroix his little scraps of woodcuts in the now publishing life of napoleon are perfect gems in their way and the noble price paid for them not a penny more than he merits  the picture by court of the death of caesar is remarkable for effect and excellent workmanship and the head of brutus who looks like armand carrel is full of energy there are some beautiful heads of women and some very good color in the picture jacquands death of adelaide de comminges is neither more nor less than beautiful adelaide had it appears a lover who betook himself to a convent of trappists she followed him thither disguised as a man took the vows and was not discovered by him till on her deathbed the painter has told this story in a most pleasing and affecting manner the picture is full of onction and melancholy grace the objects too are capitally represented and the tone and color very good decaisnes guardian angel is not so good in color but is equally beautiful in expression and grace a little child and a nurse are asleep an angel watches the infant you see women look very wistfully at this sweet picture and what triumph would a painter have more  we must not quit the luxembourg without noticing the dashing seapieces of gudin and one or two landscapes by giroux the plain of grasivaudan and the prometheus of aligny this is an imitation perhaps as is a noble picture of jesus christ and the children by flandrin but the artists are imitating better models at any rate and one begins to perceive that the odious classical dynasty is no more poussins magnificent polyphemus i only know a print of that marvellous composition has perhaps suggested the firstnamed picture and the latter has been inspired by a good enthusiastic study of the roman schools  of this revolution monsieur ingres has been one of the chief instruments he was before horace vernet president of the french academy at rome and is famous as a chief of a school when he broke up his atelier here to set out for his presidency many of his pupils attended him faithfully some way on his journey and some with scarcely a penny in their pouches walked through france and across the alps in a pious pilgrimage to rome being determined not to forsake their old master such an action was worthy of them and of the high rank which their profession holds in france where the honors to be acquired by art are only inferior to those which are gained in war one reads of such peregrinations in old days when the scholars of some great italian painter followed him from venice to rome or from florence to ferrara in regard of ingress individual merit as a painter the writer of this is not a fair judge having seen but three pictures by him one being a plafond in the louvre which his disciples much admire  ingres stands between the imperiodavidoclassical school of french art and the nambypamby mystical german school which is for carrying us back to cranach and dürer and which is making progress here  for everything here finds imitation the french have the genius of imitation and caricature this absurd humbug called the christian or catholic art is sure to tickle our neighbors and will be a favorite with them when better known my dear macgilp i do believe this to be a greater humbug than the humbug of david and girodet inasmuch as the latter was founded on nature at least whereas the former is made up of silly affectations and improvements upon nature here for instance is chevalier zieglers picture of st luke painting the virgin st luke has a monks dress on embroidered however smartly round the sleeves the virgin sits in an immense yellowochre halo with her son in her arms she looks preternaturally solemn as does st luke who is eying his paintbrush with an intense ominous mystical look they call this catholic art there is nothing my dear friend more easy in life first take your colors and rub them down cleanbright carmine bright yellow bright sienna bright ultramarine bright green make the costumes of your figures as much as possible like the costumes of the early part of the fifteenth century paint them in with the above colors and if on a gold ground the more catholic your art is dress your apostles like priests before the altar and remember to have a good commodity of crosiers censers and other such gimcracks as you may see in the catholic chapels in sutton street and elsewhere deal in virgins and dress them like a burgomasters wife by cranach or van eyck give them all long twisted tails to their gowns and proper angular draperies place all their heads on one side with the eyes shut and the proper solemn simper at the back of the head draw and gild with goldleaf a halo or glory of the exact shape of a cartwheel and you have the thing done it is catholic art tout craché as louis philippe says we have it still in england handed down to us for four centuries in the pictures on the cards as the redoubtable king and queen of clubs look at them you will see that the costumes and attitudes are precisely similar to those which figure in the catholicities of the school of overbeck and cornelius  before you take your cane at the door look for one instant at the statueroom yonder is jouffleys jeune fille confiant son premier secret à vénus charming charming it is from the exhibition of this year only and i think the best sculpture in the gallerypretty fanciful naïve admirable in workmanship and imitation of nature i have seldom seen flesh better represented in marble examine also jaleys pudeur jacquots nymph and rudes boy with the tortoise these are not very exalted subjects or what are called exalted and do not go beyond simple smiling beauty and nature but what then are we gods miltons michel angelos that can leave earth when we please and soar to heights immeasurable no my dear macgilp but the fools of academicians would fain make us so are you not and half the painters in london panting for an opportunity to show your genius in a great historical picture o blind race have you wings not a feather and yet you must be ever puffing sweating up to the tops of rugged hills and arrived there clapping and shaking your ragged elbows and making as if you would fly come down silly daedalus come down to the lowly places in which nature ordered you to walk the sweet flowers are springing there the fat muttons are waiting there the pleasant sun shines there be content and humble and take your share of the good cheer  while we have been indulging in this discussion the omnibus has gayly conducted us across the water and le garde qui veille a la porte du louvre ne défend pas our entry  what a paradise this gallery is for french students or foreigners who sojourn in the capital it is hardly necessary to say that the brethren of the brush are not usually supplied by fortune with any extraordinary wealth or means of enjoying the luxuries with which paris more than any other city abounds but here they have a luxury which surpasses all others and spend their days in a palace which all the money of all the rothschilds could not buy they sleep perhaps in a garret and dine in a cellar but no grandee in europe has such a drawingroom kings houses have at best but damask hangings and gilt cornices what are these to a wall covered with canvas by paul veronese or a hundred yards of rubens artists from england who have a national gallery that resembles a moderatesized ginshop who may not copy pictures except under particular restrictions and on rare and particular days may revel here to their hearts content here is a room half a mile long with as many windows as aladdins palace open from sunrise till evening and free to all manners and all varieties of study the only puzzle to the student is to select the one he shall begin upon and keep his eyes away from the rest  fontaines grand staircase with its arches and painted ceilings and shining doric columns leads directly to the gallery but it is thought too fine for working days and is only opened for the public entrance on sabbath a little back stair leading from a court in which stand numerous basreliefs and a solemn sphinx of polished granite is the common entry for students and others who during the week enter the gallery  hither have lately been transported a number of the works of french artists which formerly covered the walls of the luxembourg death only entitles the french painter to a place in the louvre and let us confine ourselves to the frenchmen only for the space of this letter  i have seen in a fine private collection at st germain one or two admirable single figures of david full of life truth and gayety the color is not good but all the rest excellent and one of these so muchlauded pictures is the portrait of a washerwoman pope pius at the louvre is as bad in color as remarkable for its vigor and look of life the man had a genius for painting portraits and common life but must attempt the heroicfailed signally and what is worse carried a whole nation blundering after him had you told a frenchman so twenty years ago he would have thrown the démenti in your teeth or at least laughed at you in scornful incredulity they say of us that we dont know when we are beaten they go a step further and swear their defeats are victories david was a part of the glory of the empire and one might as well have said then that romulus was a bad picture as that toulouse was a lost battle oldfashioned people who believe in the emperor believe in the théâtre français and believe that ducis improved upon shakspeare have the above opinion still it is curious to remark in this place how art and literature become party matters and political sects have their favorite painters and authors  nevertheless jacques louis david is dead he died about a year after his bodily demise in 1825 the romanticism killed him walter scott from his castle of abbotsford sent out a troop of gallant young scotch adventurers merry outlaws valiant knights and savage highlanders who with trunk hosen and buff jerkins fierce twohanded swords and

andromache may weep but her spouse is beyond the reach of physic see robin hood twangs his bow and the heathen gods fly howling montjoie saint denis down goes ajax under the mace of dunois and yonder are leonidas and romulus begging their lives of rob roy macgregor classicism is dead sir john froissart has taken dr lemprière by the nose and reigns sovereign  of the great pictures of david the defunct we need not then say much romulus is a mighty fine young fellow no doubt and if he has come out to battle stark naked except a very handsome helmet it is because the costume became him and shows off his figure to advantage but was there ever anything so absurd as this passion for the nude which was followed by all the painters of the davidian epoch and how are we to suppose yonder straddle to be the true characteristic of the heroic and the sublime romulus stretches his legs as far as ever nature will allow the horatii in receiving their swords think proper to stretch their legs too and to thrust forward their arms thus   drawing omitted   romuluss is in the exact action of a telegraph and the horatii are all in the position of the lunge is this the sublime mr angelo of bond street might admire the attitude his namesake michel i dont think would  the little picture of paris and helen one of the masters earliest i believe is likewise one of his best the details are exquisitely painted helen looks needlessly sheepish and paris has a most odious ogle but the limbs of the male figure are beautifully designed and have not the green tone which you see in the later pictures of the master what is the meaning of this green was it the fashion or the varnish girodets pictures are green gross emperors and grenadiers have universally the jaundice gerards psyche has a most decided greensickness and i am at a loss i confess to account for the enthusiasm which this performance inspired on its first appearance before the public  in the same room with it is girodets ghastly deluge and gericaults dismal medusa gericault died they say for want of fame he was a man who possessed a considerable fortune of his own but pined because no one in his day would purchase his pictures and so acknowledge his talent at present a scrawl from his pencil brings an enormous price all his works have a grand cachet he never did anything mean when he painted the raft of the medusa it is said he lived for a long time among the corpses which he painted and that his studio was a second morgue if you have not seen the picture you are familiar probably with reynoldss admirable engraving of it a huge black sea a raft beating upon it a horrid company of men dead half dead writhing and frantic with hideous hunger or hideous hope and far away black against a stormy sunset a sail the story is powerfully told and has a legitimate tragic interest so to speakdeeper because more natural than girodets green deluge for instance or his livid orestes or redhot clytemnestra  seen from a distance the latters deluge has a certain aweinspiring air with it a slimy green man stands on a green rock and clutches hold of a tree on the green mans shoulders is his old father in a green old age to him hangs his wife with a babe on her breast and dangling at her hair another child in the water floats a corpse a beautiful head and a green sea and atmosphere envelops all this dismal group the old father is represented with a bag of money in his hand and the tree which the man catches is cracking and just on the point of giving way these two points were considered very fine by the critics they are two such ghastly epigrams as continually disfigure french tragedy for this reason i have never been able to read racine with pleasurethe dialogue is so crammed with these lugubrious good thingsmelancholy antithesessparkling undertakers wit but this is heresy and had better be spoken discreetly  the gallery contains a vast number of poussins pictures they put me in mind of the color of objects in dreamsa strange hazy lurid hue how noble are some of his landscapes what a depth of solemn shadow is in yonder wood near which by the side of a black water halts diogenes the air is thunderladen and breathes heavily you hear ominous whispers in the vast forest gloom  near it is a landscape by carel dujardin i believe conceived in quite a different mood but exquisitely poetical too a horseman is riding up a hill and giving money to a blowsy beggarwench o matutini rores auraeque salubres in what a wonderful way has the artist managed to create you out of a few bladders of paint and pots of varnish you can see the matutinal dews twinkling in the grass and feel the fresh salubrious airs the breath of nature blowing free as the cornlaw man sings blowing free over the heath silvery vapors are rising up from the blue lowlands you can tell the hour of the morning and the time of the year you can do anything but describe it in words as with regard to the poussin above mentioned one can never pass it without bearing away a certain pleasing dreamy feeling of awe and musing the other landscape inspires the spectator infallibly with the most delightful briskness and cheerfulness of spirit herein lies the vast privilege of the landscapepainter he does not address you with one fixed particular subject or expression but with a thousand never contemplated by himself and which only arise out of occasion you may always be looking at a natural landscape as at a fine pictorial imitation of one it seems eternally producing new thoughts in your bosom as it does fresh beauties from its own i cannot fancy more delightful cheerful silent companions for a man than half a dozen landscapes hung round his study portraits on the contrary and large pieces of figures have a painful fixed staring look which must jar upon the mind in many of its moods fancy living in a room with davids sansculotte leonidas staring perpetually in your face  there is a little watteau here and a rare piece of fantastical brightness and gayety it is what a delightful affectation about yonder ladies flirting their fans and trailing about in their long brocades what splendid dandies are those eversmirking turning out their toes with broad blue ribbons to tie up their crooks and their pigtails and wonderful gorgeous crimson satin breeches yonder in the midst of a golden atmosphere rises a bevy of little round cupids bubbling up in clusters as out of a champagnebottle and melting away in air there is to be sure a hidden analogy between liquors and pictures the eye is deliciously tickled by these frisky watteaus and yields itself up to a light smiling gentlemanlike intoxication thus were we inclined to pursue further this mighty subject yonder landscape of claudecalm fresh delicate yet full of flavorshould be likened to a bottle of château margaux and what is the poussin before spoken of but romanée geléeheavy sluggishthe luscious odor almost sickens you a sultry sort of drink your limbs sink under it you feel as if you had been drinking hot blood  an ordinary man would be whirled away in a fever or would hobble off this mortal stage in a premature goutfit if he too early or too often indulged in such tremendous drink i think in my heart i am fonder of pretty thirdrate pictures than of your great thundering firstrates confess how many times you have read béranger and how many milton if you go to the star and garter dont you grow sick of that vast luscious landscape and long for the sight of a couple of cows or a donkey and a few yards of common donkeys my dear macgilp since we have come to this subject say not so richmond hill for them milton they never grow tired of and are as familiar with raphael as bottom with exquisite titania let us thank heaven my dear sir for according to us the power to taste and appreciate the pleasures of mediocrity i have never heard that we were great geniuses earthy are we and of the earth glimpses of the sublime are but rare to us leave we them to great geniuses and to the donkeys and if it nothing profit us aërias tentâsse domos along with them let us thankfully remain below being merry and humble  i have now only to mention the charming cruche cassée of greuze which all the young ladies delight to copy and of which the color a thought too blue perhaps is marvellously graceful and delicate there are three more pictures by the artist containing exquisite female heads and color but they have charms for french critics which are difficult to be discovered by english eyes and the pictures seem weak to me a very fine picture by bon bollongue saint benedict resuscitating a child deserves particular attention and is superb in vigor and richness of color you must look too at the large noble melancholy landscapes of philippe de champagne and the two magnificent italian pictures of léopold robert they are perhaps the very finest pictures that the french school has producedas deep as poussin of a better color and of a wonderful minuteness and veracity in the representation of objects  every one of lesueurs churchpictures is worth examining and admiring they are full of unction and pious mystical grace saint scholastica is divine and the taking down from the cross as noble a composition as ever was seen i care not by whom the other may be there is more beauty and less affectation about this picture than you will find in the performances of many italian masters with highsounding names out with it and say raphael at once i hate those simpering madonnas i declare that the jardinière is a puking smirking miss with nothing heavenly about her i vow that the saint elizabeth is a bad picturea bad composition badly drawn badly colored in a bad imitation of titiana piece of vile affectation i say that when raphael painted this picture two years before his death the spirit of painting had gone from out of him he was no longer inspired it was time that he should die  therethe murder is out my paper is filled to the brim and there is no time to speak of lesueurs crucifixion which is odiously colored to be sure but earnest tender simple holy but such things are most difficult to translate into wordsone lays down the pen and thinks and thinks the figures appear and take their places one by one ranging themselves according to order in light or in gloom the colors are reflected duly in the little camera obscura of the brain and the whole picture lies there complete but can you describe it no not if pens were fitchbrushes and words were bladders of paint with which for the present adieu  your faithful  m a t  to mr robert macgilp  newman street london     the painters bargain   simon gambouge was the son of solomon gambouge and as all the world knows both father and son were astonishingly clever fellows at their profession solomon painted landscapes which nobody bought and simon took a higher line and painted portraits to admiration only nobody came to sit to him  as he was not gaining five pounds a year by his profession and had arrived at the age of twenty at least simon determined to better himself by taking a wifea plan which a number of other wise men adopt in similar years and circumstances so simon prevailed upon a butchers daughter to whom he owed considerably for cutlets to quit the meatshop and follow him griskinissasuch was the fair creatures namewas as lovely a bit of mutton her father said as ever a man would wish to stick a knife into she had sat to the painter for all sorts of characters and the curious who possess any of gambouges pictures will see her as venus minerva madonna and in numberless other characters portrait of a ladygriskinissa sleeping nymphgriskinissa without a rag of clothes lying in a forest maternal solicitudegriskinissa again with young master gambouge who was by this time the offspring of their affections  the lady brought the painter a handsome little fortune of a couple of hundred pounds and as long as this sum lasted no woman could be more lovely or loving but want began speedily to attack their little household bakers bills were unpaid rent was due and the reckless landlord gave no quarter and to crown the whole her father unnatural butcher suddenly stopped the supplies of muttonchops and swore that his daughter and the dauber her husband should have no more of his wares at first they embraced tenderly and kissing and crying over their little infant vowed to heaven that they would do without but in the course of the evening griskinissa grew peckish and poor simon pawned his best coat  when this habit of pawning is discovered it appears to the poor a kind of eldorado gambouge and his wife were so delighted that they in the course of a month made away with her gold chain her great warmingpan his best crimson plush inexpressibles two wigs a washhand basin and ewer fireirons windowcurtains crockery and armchairs griskinissa said smiling that she had found a second father in her unclea base pun which showed that her mind was corrupted and that she was no longer the tender simple griskinissa of other days  i am sorry to say that she had taken to drinking she swallowed the warmingpan in the course of three days and fuddled herself one whole evening with the crimson plush breeches  drinking is the devilthe father that is to say of all vices griskinissas face and her mind grew ugly together her good humor changed to bilious bitter discontent her pretty fond epithets to foul abuse and swearing her tender blue eyes grew watery and blear and the peachcolor on her cheeks fled from its old habitation and crowded up into her nose where with a number of pimples it stuck fast add to this a dirty draggletailed chintz long matted hair wandering into her eyes and over her lean shoulders which were once so snowy and you have the picture of drunkenness and mrs simon gambouge  poor simon who had been a gay lively fellow enough in the days of his better fortune was completely cast down by his present ill luck and cowed by the ferocity of his wife from morning till night the neighbors could hear this womans tongue and understand her doings bellows went skimming across the room chairs were flumped down on the floor and poor gambouges oil and varnish pots went clattering through the windows or down the stairs the baby roared all day and simon sat pale and idle in a corner taking a small sup at the brandybottle when mrs gambouge was out of the way  one day as he sat disconsolately at his easel furbishing up a picture of his wife in the character of peace which he had commenced a year before he was more than ordinarily desperate and cursed and swore in the most pathetic manner o miserable fate of genius cried he was i a man of such commanding talents born for this to be bullied by a fiend of a wife to have my masterpieces neglected by the world or sold only for a few pieces cursed be the love which has misled me cursed be the art which is unworthy of me let me dig or steal let me sell myself as a soldier or sell myself to the devil i should not be more wretched than i am now  quite the contrary cried a small cheery voice  what exclaimed gambouge trembling and surprised whos therewhere are youwho are you  you were just speaking of me said the voice  gambouge held in his left hand his palette in his right a bladder of crimson lake which he was about to squeeze out upon the mahogany where are you cried he again  squeeze exclaimed the little voice  gambouge picked out the nail from the bladder and gave a squeeze when as sure as i am living a little imp spurted out from the hole upon the palette and began laughing in the most singular and oily manner  when first born he was little bigger than a tadpole then he grew to be as big as a mouse then he arrived at the size of a cat and then he jumped off the palette and turning head over heels asked the poor painter what he wanted with him  the strange little animal twisted head over heels and fixed himself at last upon the top of gambouges easelsmearing out with his heels all the white and vermilion which had just been laid on the allegoric portrait of mrs gambouge  what exclaimed simon is it the  exactly so talk of me you know and i am always at hand besides i am not half so black as i am painted as you will see when you know me a little better  upon my word said the painter it is a very singular surprise which you have given me to tell truth i did not even believe in your existence  the little imp put on a theatrical air and with one of mr macreadys best looks said        there are more things in heaven and earth gambogio       than are dreamed of in your philosophy   gambouge being a frenchman did not understand the quotation but felt somehow strangely and singularly interested in the conversation of his new friend  diabolus continued you are a man of merit and want money you will starve on your merit you can only get money from me come my friend how much is it i ask the easiest interest in the world old mordecai the usurer has made you pay twice as heavily before now nothing but the signature of a bond which is a mere ceremony and the transfer of an article which in itself is a suppositiona valueless windy uncertain property of yours called by some poet of your own i think an animula vagula blandulabah there is no use beating about the bushi mean a soul come let me have it you know you will sell it some other way and not get such good pay for your bargainand having made this speech the devil pulled out from his fob a sheet as big as a double times only there was a different stamp in the corner  it is useless and tedious to describe law documents lawyers only love to read them and they have as good in chitty as any that are to be found in the devils own so nobly have the apprentices emulated the skill of the master suffice it to say that poor gambouge read over the paper and signed it he was to have all he wished for seven years and at the end of that time was to become the property of the  provided that during the course of the seven years every single wish which he might form should be gratified by the other of the contracting parties otherwise the deed became null and nonavenue and gambouge should be left to go to the  his own way  you will never see me again said diabolus in shaking hands with poor simon on whose fingers he left such a mark as is to be seen at this daynever at least unless you want me for everything you ask will be performed in the most quiet and everyday manner believe me it is best and most gentlemanlike and avoids anything like scandal but if you set me about anything which is extraordinary and out of the course of nature as it were come i must you know and of this you are the best judge so saying diabolus disappeared but whether up the chimney through the keyhole or by any other aperture or contrivance nobody knows simon gambouge was left in a fever of delight as heaven forgive me i believe many a worthy man would be if he were allowed an opportunity to make a similar bargain  heigho said simon i wonder whether this be a reality or a dreami am sober i know for who will give me credit for the means to be drunk and as for sleeping im too hungry for that i wish i could see a capon and a bottle of white wine  monsieur simon cried a voice on the landingplace  cest ici quoth gambouge hastening to open the door he did so and lo there was a restaurateurs boy at the door supporting a tray a tincovered dish and plates on the same and by its side a tall ambercolored flask of sauterne  i am the new boy sir exclaimed this youth on entering but i believe this is the right door and you asked for these things  simon grinned and said certainly i did ask for these things but such was the effect which his interview with the demon had had on his innocent mind that he took them although he knew that they were for old simon the jew dandy who was mad after an opera girl and lived on the floor beneath  go my boy he said it is good call in a couple of hours and remove the plates and glasses  the little waiter trotted down stairs and simon sat greedily down to discuss the capon and the white wine he bolted the legs he devoured the wings he cut every morsel of flesh from the breastseasoning his repast with pleasant draughts of wine and caring nothing for the inevitable bill which was to follow all  ye gods said he as he scraped away at the backbone what a dinner what wineand how gayly served up too there were silver forks and spoons and the remnants of the fowl were upon a silver dish why the money for this dish and these spoons cried simon would keep me and mrs g for a month i wishand here simon whistled and turned round to see that nobody was peepingi wish the plate were mine  oh the horrid progress of the devil here they are thought simon to himself why should not i take them and take them he did detection said he is not so bad as starvation and i would as soon live at the galleys as live with madame gambouge  so gambouge shovelled dish and spoons into the flap of his surtout and ran down stairs as if the devil were behind himas indeed he was  he immediately made for the house of his old friend the pawnbrokerthat establishment which is called in france the mont de piété i am obliged to come to you again my old friend said simon with some family plate of which i beseech you to take care  the pawnbroker smiled as he examined the goods i can give you nothing upon them said he  what cried simon not even the worth of the silver  no i could buy them at that price at the café morisot rue de la verrerie where i suppose you got them a little cheaper and so saying he showed to the guiltstricken gambouge how the name of that coffeehouse was inscribed upon every one of the articles which he had wished to pawn  the effects of conscience are dreadful indeed oh how fearful is retribution how deep is despair how bitter is remorse for crimewhen crime is found outotherwise conscience takes matters much more easily gambouge cursed his fate and swore henceforth to be virtuous  but hark ye my friend continued the honest broker there is no reason why because i cannot lend upon these things i should not buy them they will do to melt if for no other purpose will you have half the moneyspeak or i peach  simons resolves about virtue were dissipated instantaneously give me half he said and let me gowhat scoundrels are these pawnbrokers ejaculated he as he passed out of the accursed shop seeking every wicked pretext to rob the poor man of his hardwon gain  when he had marched forwards for a street or two gambouge counted the money which he had received and found that he was in possession of no less than a hundred francs it was night as he reckoned out his equivocal gains and he counted them at the light of a lamp he looked up at the lamp in doubt as to the course he should next pursue upon it was inscribed the simple number 152 a gamblinghouse thought gambouge i wish i had half the money that is now on the table up stairs  he mounted as many a rogue has done before him and found half a hundred persons busy at a table of rouge et noir gambouges five napoleons looked insignificant by the side of the heaps which were around him but the effects of the wine of the theft and of the detection by the pawnbroker were upon him and he threw down his capital stoutly upon the 0 0  it is a dangerous spot that 0 0 or double zero but to simon it was more lucky than to the rest of the world the ball went spinning roundin its predestined circle rolled as shelley has it after goetheand plumped down at last in the double zero one hundred and thirtyfive gold napoleons louis they were then were counted out to the delighted painter oh diabolus cried he now it is that i begin to believe in thee dont talk about merit he cried talk about fortune tell me not about heroes for the futuretell me of zeroes and down went twenty napoleons more upon the 0  the devil was certainly in the ball round it twirled and dropped into zero as naturally as a duck pops its head into a pond our friend received five hundred pounds for his stake and the croupiers and lookerson began to stare at him  there were twelve thousand pounds on the table suffice it to say that simon won half and retired from the palais royal with a thick bundle of banknotes crammed into his dirty threecornered hat he had been but half an hour in the place and he had won the revenues of a prince for half a year  gambouge as soon as he felt that he was a capitalist and that he had a stake in the country discovered that he was an altered man he repented of his foul deed and his base purloining of the restaurateurs plate o honesty he cried how unworthy is an action like this of a man who has a property like mine so he went back to the pawnbroker with the gloomiest face imaginable my friend said he i have sinned against all that i hold most sacred i have forgotten my family and my religion here is thy money in the name of heaven restore me the plate which i have wrongfully sold thee  but the pawnbroker grinned and said nay mr gambouge i will sell that plate for a thousand francs to you or i never will sell it at all  well cried gambouge thou art an inexorable ruffian troisboules but i will give thee all i am worth and here he produced a billet of five hundred francs look said he this money is all i own it is the payment of two years lodging to raise it i have toiled for many months and failing i have been a criminal o heaven i stole that plate that i might pay my debt and keep my dear wife from wandering houseless but i cannot bear this load of ignominyi cannot suffer the thought of this crime i will go to the person to whom i did wrong i will starve i will confess but i will i will do right  the broker was alarmed give me thy note he cried here is the plate  give me an acquittal first cried simon almost brokenhearted sign me a paper and the money is yours so troisboules wrote according to gambouges dictation received for thirteen ounces of plate twenty pounds  monster of iniquity cried the painter fiend of wickedness thou art caught in thine own snares hast thou not sold me five pounds worth of plate for twenty have i it not in my pocket art thou not a convicted dealer in stolen goods yield scoundrel yield thy money or i will bring thee to justice  the frightened pawnbroker bullied and battled for a while but he gave up his money at last and the dispute ended thus it will be seen that diabolus had rather a hard bargain in the wily gambouge he had taken a victim prisoner but he had assuredly caught a tartar simon now returned home and to do him justice paid the bill for his dinner and restored the plate  and now i may add and the reader should ponder upon this as a profound picture of human life that gambouge since he had grown rich grew likewise abundantly moral he was a most exemplary father he fed the poor and was loved by them he scorned a base action and i have no doubt that mr thurtell or the late lamented mr greenacre in similar circumstances would have acted like the worthy simon gambouge  there was but one blot upon his characterhe hated mrs gam worse than ever as he grew more benevolent she grew more virulent when he went to plays she went to bible societies and vice versâ in fact she led him such a life as xantippe led socrates or as a dog leads a cat in the same kitchen with all his fortunefor as may be supposed simon prospered in all worldly thingshe was the most miserable dog in the whole city of paris only in the point of drinking did he and mrs simon agree and for many years and during a considerable number of hours in each day he thus dissipated partially his domestic chagrin o philosophy we may talk of thee but except at the bottom of the winecup where thou liest like truth in a well where shall we find thee  he lived so long and in his worldly matters prospered so much there was so little sign of devilment in the accomplishment of his wishes and the increase of his prosperity that simon at the end of six years began to doubt whether he had made any such bargain at all as that which we have described at the commencement of this history he had grown as we said very pious and moral he went regularly to mass and had a confessor into the bargain he resolved therefore to consult that reverend gentleman and to lay before him the whole matter  i am inclined to think holy sir said gambouge after he had concluded his history and shown how in some miraculous way all his desires were accomplished that after all this demon was no other than the creation of my own brain heated by the effects of that bottle of wine the cause of my crime and my prosperity  the confessor agreed with him and they walked out of church comfortably together and entered afterwards a café where they sat down to refresh themselves after the fatigues of their devotion  a respectable old gentleman with a number of orders at his buttonhole presently entered the room and sauntered up to the marble table before which reposed simon and his clerical friend excuse me gentlemen he said as he took a place opposite them and began reading the papers of the day  bah said he at lastsontils grands ces journaux anglais look sir he said handing over an immense sheet of the times to mr gambouge was ever anything so monstrous  gambouge smiled politely and examined the proffered page it is enormous he said but i do not read english  nay said the man with the orders look closer at it signor gambouge it is astonishing how easy the language is  wondering simon took a sheet of paper he turned pale as he looked at it and began to curse the ices and the waiter come m labbé he said the heat and glare of this place are intolerable  the stranger rose with them au plaisir de vous revoir mon cher monsieur said he i do not mind speaking before the abbé here who will be my very good friend one of these days but i thought it necessary to refresh your memory concerning our little business transaction six years since and could not exactly talk of it at church as you may fancy  simon gambouge had seen in the doublesheeted times the paper signed by himself which the little devil had pulled out of his fob  there was no doubt on the subject and simon who had but a year to live grew more pious and more careful than ever he had consultations with all the doctors of the sorbonne and all the lawyers of the palais but his magnificence grew as wearisome to him as his poverty had been before and not one of the doctors whom he consulted could give him a pennyworth of consolation  then he grew outrageous in his demands upon the devil and put him to all sorts of absurd and ridiculous tasks but they were all punctually performed until simon could invent no new ones and the devil sat all day with his hands in his pockets doing nothing  one day simons confessor came bounding into the room with the greatest glee my friend said he i have it eurekai have found it send the pope a hundred thousand crowns build a new jesuit college at rome give a hundred gold candlesticks to st peters and tell his holiness you will double all if he will give you absolution  gambouge caught at the notion and hurried off a courier to rome ventre à terre his holiness agreed to the request of the petition and sent him an absolution written out with his own fist and all in due form  now said he foul fiend i defy you arise diabolus your contract is not worth a jot the pope has absolved me and i am safe on the road to salvation in a fervor of gratitude he clasped the hand of his confessor and embraced him tears of joy ran down the cheeks of these good men  they heard an inordinate roar of laughter and there was diabolus sitting opposite to them holding his sides and lashing his tail about as if he would have gone mad with glee  why said he what nonsense is this do you suppose i care about that and he tossed the popes missive into a corner m labbé knows he said bowing and grinning that though the popes paper may pass current here it is not worth twopence in our country what do i care about the popes absolution you might just as well be absolved by your under butler  egad said the abbé the rogue is righti quite forgot the fact which he points out clearly enough  no no gambouge continued diabolus with horrid familiarity go thy ways old fellow that cock wont fight and he retired up the chimney chuckling at his wit and his triumph gambouge heard his tail scuttling all the way up as if he had been a sweeper by profession  simon was left in that condition of grief in which according to the newspapers cities and nations are found when a murder is committed or a lord ill of the gouta situation we say more easy to imagine than to describe  to add to his woes mrs gambouge who was now first made acquainted with his compact and its probable consequences raised such a storm about his ears as made him wish almost that his seven years were expired she screamed she scolded she swore she wept she went into such fits of hysterics that poor gambouge who had completely knocked under to her was worn out of his life he was allowed no rest night or day he moped about his fine house solitary and wretched and cursed his stars that he ever had married the butchers daughter  it wanted six months of the time  a sudden and desperate resolution seemed all at once to have taken possession of simon gambouge he called his family and his friends togetherhe gave one of the greatest feasts that ever was known in the city of parishe gayly presided at one end of his table while mrs gam splendidly arrayed gave herself airs at the other extremity  after dinner using the customary formula he called upon diabolus to appear the old ladies screamed and hoped he would not appear naked the young ones tittered and longed to see the monster everybody was pale with expectation and affright  a very quiet gentlemanly man neatly dressed in black made his appearance to the surprise of all present and bowed all round to the company i will not show my credentials he said blushing and pointing to his hoofs which were cleverly hidden by his pumps and shoebuckles unless the ladies absolutely wish it but i am the person you want mr gambouge pray tell me what is your will  you know said that gentleman in a stately and determined voice that you are bound to me according to our agreement for six months to come  i am replied the new comer  you are to do all that i ask whatsoever it may be or you forfeit the bond which i gave you  it is true  you declare this before the present company  upon my honor as a gentleman said diabolus bowing and laying his hand upon his waistcoat  a whisper of applause ran round the room all were charmed with the bland manners of the fascinating stranger  my love continued gambouge mildly addressing his lady will you be so polite as to step this way you know i must go soon and i am anxious before this noble company to make a provision for one who in sickness as in health in poverty as in riches has been my truest and fondest companion  gambouge mopped his eyes with his handkerchiefall the company did likewise diabolus sobbed audibly and mrs gambouge sidled up to her husbands side and took him tenderly by the hand simon said she is it true and do you really love your griskinissa  simon continued solemnly come hither diabolus you are bound to obey me in all things for the six months during which our contract has to run take then griskinissa gambouge live alone with her for half a year never leave her from morning till night obey all her caprices follow all her whims and listen to all the abuse which falls from her infernal tongue do this and i ask no more of you i will deliver myself up at the appointed time  not lord g when flogged by lord b in the housenot mr cartlitch of astleys amphitheatre in his most pathetic passages could look more crestfallen and howl more hideously than diabolus did now take another year gambouge screamed he two moreten morea century roast me on lawrences gridiron boil me in holy water but dont ask that dont dont bid me live with mrs gambouge  simon smiled sternly i have said it he cried do this or our contract is at an end  the devil at this grinned so horribly that every drop of beer in the house turned sour he gnashed his teeth so frightfully that every person in the company wellnigh fainted with the cholic he slapped down the great parchment upon the floor trampled upon it madly and lashed it with his hoofs and his tail at last spreading out a mighty pair of wings as wide as from here to regent street he slapped gambouge with his tail over one eye and vanished abruptly through the keyhole  gambouge screamed with pain and started up you drunken lazy scoundrel cried a shrill and wellknown voice you have been asleep these two hours and here he received another terrific box on the ear  it was too true he had fallen asleep at his work and the beautiful vision had been dispelled by the thumps of the tipsy griskinissa nothing remained to corroborate his story except the bladder of lake and this was spirted all over his waistcoat and breeches  i wish said the poor fellow rubbing his tingling cheeks that dreams were true and he went to work again at his portrait  my last accounts of gambouge are that he has left the arts and is footman in a small family mrs gam takes in washing and it is said that her continual dealings with soapsuds and hot water have been the only things in life which have kept her from spontaneous combustion    cartouche   i have been much interested with an account of the exploits of monsieur louis dominic cartouche and as newgate and the highways are so much the fashion with us in england we may be allowed to look abroad for histories of a similar tendency it is pleasant to find that virtue is cosmopolite and may exist among woodenshoed papists as well as honest churchofengland men  louis dominic was born in a quarter of paris called the courtille says the historian whose work lies before meborn in the courtille and in the year 1693 another biographer asserts that he was born two years later and in the maraisof respectable parents of course think of the talent that our two countries produced about this time marlborough villars mandrin turpin boileau dryden swift addison molière racine jack sheppard and louis cartoucheall famous within the same twenty years and fighting writing robbing à lenvi  well marlborough was no chicken when he began to show his genius swift was but a dull idle college lad but if we read the histories of some other great men mentioned in the above listi mean the thieves especiallywe shall find that they all commenced very early they showed a passion for their art as little raphael did or little mozart and the history of cartouches knaveries begins almost with his breeches  dominics parents sent him to school at the college of clermont now louis le grand and although it has never been discovered that the jesuits who directed that seminary advanced him much in classical or theological knowledge cartouche in revenge showed by repeated instances his own natural bent and genius which no difficulties were strong enough to overcome his first great action on record although not successful in the end and tinctured with the innocence of youth is yet highly creditable to him he made a general swoop of a hundred and twenty nightcaps belonging to his companions and disposed of them to his satisfaction but as it was discovered that of all the youths in the college of clermont he only was the possessor of a cap to sleep in suspicion which alas was confirmed immediately fell upon him and by this little piece of youthful naïveté a scheme prettily conceived and smartly performed was rendered naught  cartouche had a wonderful love for good eating and put all the applewomen and cooks who came to supply the students under contribution not always however desirous of robbing these he used to deal with them occasionally on honest principles of barter that is whenever he could get hold of his schoolfellows knives books rulers or playthings which he used fairly to exchange for tarts and gingerbread  it seemed as if the presiding genius of evil was determined to patronize this young man for before he had been long at college and soon after he had with the greatest difficulty escaped from the nightcap scrape an opportunity occurred by which he was enabled to gratify both his propensities at once and not only to steal but to steal sweetmeats it happened that the principal of the college received some pots of narbonne honey which came under the eyes of cartouche and in which that young gentleman as soon as ever he saw them determined to put his fingers the president of the college put aside his honeypots in an apartment within his own to which except by the one door which led into the room which his reverence usually occupied there was no outlet there was no chimney in the room and the windows looked into the court where there was a porter at night and where crowds passed by day what was cartouche to dohave the honey he must  over this chamber which contained what his soul longed after and over the presidents rooms there ran a set of unoccupied garrets into which the dexterous cartouche penetrated these were divided from the rooms below according to the fashion of those days by a set of large beams which reached across the whole building and across which rude planks were laid which formed the ceiling of the lower story and the floor of the upper some of these planks did young cartouche remove and having descended by means of a rope tied a couple of others to the neck of the honeypots climbed back again and drew up his prey in safety he then cunningly fixed the planks again in their old places and retired to gorge himself upon his booty and now see the punishment of avarice everybody knows that the brethren of the order of jesus are bound by a vow to have no more than a certain small sum of money in their possession the principal of the college of clermont had amassed a larger sum in defiance of this rule and where do you think the old gentleman had hidden it in the honeypots as cartouche dug his spoon into one of them he brought out besides a quantity of golden honey a couple of golden louis which with ninetyeight more of their fellows were comfortably hidden in the pots little dominic who before had cut rather a poor figure among his fellowstudents now appeared in as fine clothes as any of them could boast of and when asked by his parents on going home how he came by them said that a young nobleman of his schoolfellows had taken a violent fancy to him and made him a present of a couple of his suits cartouche the elder good man went to thank the young nobleman but none such could be found and young cartouche disdained to give any explanation of his manner of gaining the money  here again we have to regret and remark the inadvertence of youth cartouche lost a hundred louisfor what for a pot of honey not worth a couple of shillings had he fished out the pieces and replaced the pots and the honey he might have been safe and a respectable citizen all his life after the principal would not have dared to confess the loss of his money and did not openly but he vowed vengeance against the stealer of his sweetmeat and a rigid search was made cartouche as usual was fixed upon and in the tick of his bed lo there were found a couple of empty honeypots from this scrape there is no knowing how he would have escaped had not the president himself been a little anxious to hush the matter up and accordingly young cartouche was made to disgorge the residue of his illgotten gold pieces old cartouche made up the deficiency and his son was allowed to remain unpunisheduntil the next time  this you may fancy was not very long in coming and though history has not made us acquainted with the exact crime which louis dominic next committed it must have been a serious one for cartouche who had borne philosophically all the whippings and punishments which were administered to him at college did not dare to face that one which his indignant father had in pickle for him as he was coming home from school on the first day after his crime when he received permission to go abroad one of his brothers who was on the lookout for him met him at a short distance from home and told him what was in preparation which so frightened this young thief that he declined returning home altogether and set out upon the wide world to shift for himself as he could  undoubted as his genius was he had not arrived at the full exercise of it and his gains were by no means equal to his appetite in whatever professions he triedwhether he joined the gipsies which he didwhether he picked pockets on the pont neuf which occupation history attributes to himpoor cartouche was always hungry hungry and ragged he wandered from one place and profession to another and regretted the honeypots at clermont and the comfortable soup and bouilli at home  cartouche had an uncle a kind man who was a merchant and had dealings at rouen one day walking on the quays of that city this gentleman saw a very miserable dirty starving lad who had just made a pounce upon some bones and turnippeelings that had been flung out on the quay and was eating them as greedily as if they had been turkeys and truffles the worthy man examined the lad a little closer o heavens it was their runaway prodigalit was little louis dominic the merchant was touched by his case and forgetting the nightcaps the honeypots and the rags and dirt of little louis took him to his arms and kissed and hugged him with the tenderest affection louis kissed and hugged too and blubbered a great deal he was very repentant as a man often is when he is hungry and he went home with his uncle and his peace was made and his mother got him new clothes and filled his belly and for a while louis was as good a son as might be  but why attempt to balk the progress of genius louiss was not to be kept down he was sixteen years of age by this timea smart lively young fellow and what is more desperately enamored of a lovely washerwoman to be successful in your love as louis knew you must have something more than mere flames and sentimenta washer or any other woman cannot live upon sighs only but must have new gowns and caps and a necklace every now and then and a few handkerchiefs and silk stockings and a treat into the country or to the play now how are all these things to be had without money cartouche saw at once that it was impossible and as his father would give him none he was obliged to look for it elsewhere he took to his old courses and lifted a purse here and a watch there and found moreover an accommodating gentleman who took the wares off his hands  this gentleman introduced him into a very select and agreeable society in which cartouches merit began speedily to be recognized and in which he learnt how pleasant it is in life to have friends to assist one and how much may be done by a proper division of labor m cartouche in fact formed part of a regular company or gang of gentlemen who were associated together for the purpose of making war on the public and the law  cartouche had a lovely young sister who was to be married to a rich young gentleman from the provinces as is the fashion in france the parents had arranged the match among themselves and the young people had never met until just before the time appointed for the marriage when the bridegroom came up to paris with his titledeeds and settlements and money now there can hardly be found in history a finer instance of devotion than cartouche now exhibited he went to his captain explained the matter to him and actually for the good of his country as it were the thieves might be called his country sacrificed his sisters husbands property informations were taken the house of the bridegroom was reconnoitred and one night cartouche in company with some chosen friends made his first visit to the house of his brotherinlaw all the people were gone to bed and doubtless for fear of disturbing the porter cartouche and his companions spared him the trouble of opening the door by ascending quietly at the window they arrived at the room where the bridegroom kept his great chest and set industriously to work filing and picking the locks which defended the treasure  the bridegroom slept in the next room but however tenderly cartouche and his workmen handled their tools from fear of disturbing his slumbers their benevolent design was disappointed for awaken him they did and quietly slipping out of bed he came to a place where he had a complete view of all that was going on he did not cry out or frighten himself sillily but on the contrary contented himself with watching the countenances of the robbers so that he might recognize them on another occasion and though an avaricious man he did not feel the slightest anxiety about his moneychest for the fact is he had removed all the cash and papers the day before  as soon however as they had broken all the locks and found the nothing which lay at the bottom of the chest he shouted with such a loud voice here thomasjohnofficerkeep the gate fire at the rascals that they incontinently taking fright skipped nimbly out of window and left the house free  cartouche after this did not care to meet his brotherinlaw but eschewed all those occasions on which the latter was to be present at his fathers house the evening before the marriage came and then his father insisted upon his appearance among the other relatives of the brides and bridegrooms families who were all to assemble and make merry cartouche was obliged to yield and brought with him one or two of his companions who had been by the way present in the affair of the empty moneyboxes and though he never fancied that there was any danger in meeting his brotherinlaw for he had no idea that he had been seen on the night of the attack with a natural modesty which did him really credit he kept out of the young bridegrooms sight as much as he could and showed no desire to be presented to him at supper however as he was sneaking modestly down to a sidetable his father shouted after him ho dominic come hither and sit opposite to your brotherinlaw which dominic did his friends following the bridegroom pledged him very gracefully in a bumper and was in the act of making him a pretty speech on the honor of an alliance with such a family and on the pleasures of brotherinlawship in general when looking in his faceye gods he saw the very man who had been filing at his moneychest a few nights ago by his side too sat a couple more of the gang the poor fellow turned deadly pale and sick and setting his glass down ran quickly out of the room for he thought he was in company of a whole gang of robbers and when he got home he wrote a letter to the elder cartouche humbly declining any connection with his family  cartouche the elder of course angrily asked the reason of such an abrupt dissolution of the engagement and then much to his horror heard of his eldest sons doings you would not have me marry into such a family said the exbridegroom and old cartouche an honest old citizen confessed with a heavy heart that he would not what was he to do with the lad he did not like to ask for a lettre de cachet and shut him up in the bastile he determined to give him a years discipline at the monastery of st lazare  but how to catch the young gentleman old cartouche knew that were he to tell his son of the scheme the latter would never obey and therefore he determined to be very cunning he told dominic that he was about to make a heavy bargain with the fathers and should require a witness so they stepped into a carriage together and drove unsuspectingly to the rue st denis but when they arrived near the convent cartouche saw several ominous figures gathering round the coach and felt that his doom was sealed however he made as if he knew nothing of the conspiracy and the carriage drew up and his father descended and bidding him wait for a minute in the coach promised to return to him cartouche looked out on the other side of the way half a dozen men were posted evidently with the intention of arresting him  cartouche now performed a great and celebrated stroke of genius which if he had not been professionally employed in the morning he never could have executed he had in his pocket a piece of linen which he had laid hold of at the door of some shop and from which he quickly tore three suitable stripes one he tied round his head after the fashion of a nightcap a second round his waist like an apron and with the third he covered his hat a round one with a large brim his coat and his periwig lie left behind him in the carriage and when he stepped out from it which he did without asking the coachman to let down the steps he bore exactly the appearance of a cooks boy carrying a dish and with this he slipped through the exempts quite unsuspected and bade adieu to the lazarists and his honest father who came out speedily to seek him and was not a little annoyed to find only his coat and wig  with that coat and wig cartouche left home father friends conscience remorse society behind him he discovered like a great number of other philosophers and poets when they have committed rascally actions that the world was all going wrong and he quarrelled with it outright one of the first stories told of the illustrious cartouche when he became professionally and openly a robber redounds highly to his credit and shows that he knew how to take advantage of the occasion and how much he had improved in the course of a very few years experience his courage and ingenuity were vastly admired by his friends so much so that one day the captain of the band thought fit to compliment him and vowed that when he the captain died cartouche should infallibly be called to the commandinchief this conversation so flattering to cartouche was carried on between the two gentlemen as they were walking one night on the quays by the side of the seine cartouche when the captain made the last remark blushingly protested against it and pleaded his extreme youth as a reason why his comrades could never put entire trust in him psha man said the captain thy youth is in thy favor thou wilt live only the longer to lead thy troops to victory as for strength bravery and cunning wert thou as old as methuselah thou couldst not be better provided than thou art now at eighteen what was the reply of monsieur cartouche he answered not by words but by actions drawing his knife from his girdle he instantly dug it into the captains left side as near his heart as possible and then seizing that imprudent commander precipitated him violently into the waters of the seine to keep company with the gudgeons and rivergods when he returned to the band and recounted how the captain had basely attempted to assassinate him and how he on the contrary had by exertion of superior skill overcome the captain not one of the society believed a word of his history but they elected him captain forthwith i think his excellency don rafael maroto the pacificator of spain is an amiable character for whom history has not been written in vain  being arrived at this exalted position there is no end of the feats which cartouche performed and his band reached to such a pitch of glory that if there had been a hundred thousand instead of a hundred of them who knows but that a new and popular dynasty might not have been founded and louis dominic premier empereur des français might have performed innumerable glorious actions and fixed himself in the hearts of his people just as other monarchs have done a hundred years after cartouches death  a story similar to the above and equally moral is that of cartouche who in company with two other gentlemen robbed the coche or packetboat from melun where they took a good quantity of bootymaking the passengers lie down on the decks and rifling them at leisure this money will be but very little among three whispered cartouche to his neighbor as the three conquerors were making merry over their gains if you were but to pull the trigger of your pistol in the neighborhood of your comrades ear perhaps it might go off and then there would be but two of us to share strangely enough as cartouche said the pistol did go off and no 3 perished give him another ball said cartouche and another was fired into him but no sooner had cartouches comrade discharged both his pistols than cartouche himself seized with a furious indignation drew his learn monster cried he not to be so greedy of gold and perish the victim of thy disloyalty and avarice so cartouche slew the second robber and there is no man in europe who can say that the latter did not merit well his punishment  i could fill volumes and not mere sheets of paper with tales of the triumphs of cartouche and his band how he robbed the countess of o going to dijon in her coach and how the countess fell in love with him and was faithful to him ever after how when the lieutenant of police offered a reward of a hundred pistoles to any man who would bring cartouche before him a noble marquess in a coach and six drove up to the hotel of the police and the noble marquess desiring to see monsieur de la reynie on matters of the highest moment alone the latter introduced him into his private cabinet and how when there the marquess drew from his pocket a long curiously shaped dagger look at this monsieur de la reynie said he this dagger is poisoned  is it possible said m de la reynie  a prick of it would do for any man said the marquess  you dont say so said m de la reynie  i do though and what is more says the marquess in a terrible voice if you do not instantly lay yourself flat on the ground with your face towards it and your hands crossed over your back or if you make the slightest noise or cry i will stick this poisoned dagger between your ribs as sure as my name is cartouche  at the sound of this dreadful name m de la reynie sunk incontinently down on his stomach and submitted to be carefully gagged and corded after which monsieur cartouche laid his hands upon all the money which was kept in the lieutenants cabinet alas and alas many a stout bailiff and many an honest fellow of a spy went for that day without his pay and his victuals  there is a story that cartouche once took the diligence to lille and found in it a certain abbé potter who was full of indignation against this monster of a cartouche and said that when he went back to paris which he proposed to do in about a fortnight he should give the lieutenant of police some information which would infallibly lead to the scoundrels capture but poor potter was disappointed in his designs for before he could fulfil them he was made the victim of cartouches cruelty  a letter came to the lieutenant of police to state that cartouche had travelled to lille in company with the abbé de potter of that town that on the reverend gentlemans return towards paris cartouche had waylaid him murdered him taken his papers and would come to paris himself bearing the name and clothes of the unfortunate abbé by the lille coach on such a day the lille coach arrived was surrounded by police agents the monster cartouche was there sure enough in the abbés guise he was seized bound flung into prison brought out to be examined and on examination found to be no other than the abbé potter himself it is pleasant to read thus of the relaxations of great men and find them condescending to joke like the meanest of us  another diligence adventure is recounted of the famous cartouche it happened that he met in the coach a young and lovely lady clad in widows weeds and bound to paris with a couple of servants the poor thing was the widow of a rich old gentleman of marseilles and was going to the capital to arrange with her lawyers and to settle her husbands will the count de grinche for so her fellowpassenger was called was quite as candid as the pretty widow had been and stated that he was a captain in the regiment of nivernois that he was going to paris to buy a colonelcy which his relatives the duke de bouillon the prince de montmorency the commandeur de la trémoille with all their interest at court could not fail to procure for him to be short in the course of the four days journey the count louis dominic de grinche played his cards so well that the poor little widow half forgot her late husband and her eyes glistened with tears as the count kissed her hand at partingat parting he hoped only for a few hours  day and night the insinuating count followed her and when at the end of a fortnight and in the midst of a têteàtête he plunged one morning suddenly on his knees and said leonora do you love me the poor thing heaved the gentlest tenderest sweetest sigh in the world and sinking her blushing head on his shoulder whispered oh dominic je taime ah said she how noble is it of my dominic to take me with the little i have and he so rich a nobleman the fact is the old barons titles and estates had passed away to his nephews his dowager was only left with three hundred thousand livres in rentes sur létata handsome sum but nothing to compare to the rentroll of count dominic count de la grinche seigneur de la haute pigre baron de la bigorne he had estates and wealth which might authorize him to aspire to the hand of a duchess at least  the unfortunate widow never for a moment suspected the cruel trick that was about to be played on her and at the request of her affianced husband sold out her money and realized it in gold to be made over to him on the day when the contract was to be signed the day arrived and according to the custom in france the relations of both parties attended the widows relatives though respectable were not of the first nobility being chiefly persons of the finance or the robe there was the president of the court of arras and his lady a farmergeneral a judge of a court of paris and other such grave and respectable people as for monsieur le comte de la grinche he was not bound for names and having the whole peerage to choose from brought a host of montmorencies créquis de la tours and guises at his back his homme daffaires brought his papers in a sack and displayed the plans of his estates and the titles of his glorious ancestry the widows lawyers had her money in sacks and between the gold on the one side and the parchments on the other lay the contract which was to make the widows three hundred thousand francs the property of the count de grinche the count de la grinche was just about to sign when the marshal de villars stepping up to him said captain do you know who the president of the court of arras yonder is it is old manasseh the fence of brussels i pawned a gold watch to him which i stole from cadogan when i was with malbrooks army in flanders  here the duc de la roche guyon came forward very much alarmed run me through the body said his grace but the comptrollergenerals lady there is no other than that old hag of a margoton who keeps the  here the duc de la roche guyons voice fell  cartouche smiled graciously and walked up to the table he took up one of the widows fifteen thousand gold piecesit was as pretty a bit of copper as you could wish to see my dear said he politely there is some mistake here and this business had better stop  count gasped the poor widow  count be hanged answered the bridegroom sternly my name is cartouche    on some french fashionable novels  with a plea for romances in general   there is an old story of a spanish court painter who being pressed for money and having received a piece of damask which he was to wear in a state procession pawned the damask and appeared at the show dressed out in some very fine sheets of paper which he had painted so as exactly to resemble silk nay his coat looked so much richer than the doublets of all the rest that the emperor charles in whose honor the procession was given remarked the painter and so his deceit was found out  i have often thought that in respect of sham and real histories a similar fact may be noticed the sham story appearing a great deal more agreeable lifelike and natural than the true one and all who from laziness as well as principle are inclined to follow the easy and comfortable study of novels may console themselves with the notion that they are studying matters quite as important as history and that their favorite duodecimos are as instructive as the biggest quartos in the world  if then ladies the bigwigs begin to sneer at the course of our studies calling our darling romances foolish trivial noxious to the mind enervators of intellect fathers of idleness and what not let us at once take a high ground and saygo you to your own employments and to such dull studies as you fancy go and bob for triangles from the pons asinorum go enjoy your dull black draughts of metaphysics go fumble over history books and dissert upon herodotus and livy our histories are perhaps as true as yours our drink is the brisk sparkling champagne drink from the presses of colburn bentley and co our walks are over such sunshiny pleasuregrounds as scott and shakspeare have laid out for us and if our dwellings are castles in the air we find them excessively splendid and commodiousbe not you envious because you have no wings to fly thither let the bigwigs despise us such contempt of their neighbors is the custom of all barbarous tribeswitness the learned chinese tippoo sultaun declared that there were not in all europe ten thousand men the sklavonic hordes it is said so entitled themselves from a word in their jargon which signifies to speak the ruffians imagining that they had a monopoly of this agreeable faculty and that all other nations were dumb  not so others may be deaf but the novelist has a loud eloquent instructive language though his enemies may despise or deny it ever so much what is more one could perhaps meet the stoutest historian on his own ground and argue with him showing that sham histories were much truer than real histories which are in fact mere contemptible catalogues of names and places that can have no moral effect upon the reader  as thus     julius caesar beat pompey at pharsalia   the duke of marlborough beat marshal tallard at blenheim   the constable of bourbon beat francis the first at pavia   and what have we hereso many names simply suppose pharsalia had been at that mysterious period when names were given called pavia and that julius caesars family name had been john churchillthe fact would have stood in history thus     pompey ran away from the duke of marlborough at pavia   and why notwe should have been just as wise or it might be stated that     the tenth legion charged the french infantry at blenheim and    caesar writing home to his mamma said madame tout est perdu    fors lhonneur   what a contemptible science this is then about which quartos are written and sixtyvolumed biographies universelles and lardners cabinet cyclopaedias and the like the facts are nothing in it the names everything and a gentleman might as well improve his mind by learning walkers gazetteer or getting by heart a fiftyyearsold edition of the court guide  having thus disposed of the historians let us come to the point in questionthe novelists   on the titlepage of these volumes the reader has doubtless remarked that among the pieces introduced some are announced as copies and compositions many of the histories have accordingly been neatly stolen from the collections of french authors and mutilated according to the old saying so that their owners should not know them and for compositions we intend to favor the public with some studies of french modern works that have not as yet we believe attracted the notice of the english public  of such works there appear many hundreds yearly as may be seen by the french catalogues but the writer has not so much to do with works political philosophical historical metaphysical scientifical theological as with those for which he has been putting forward a pleanovels namely on which he has expended a great deal of time and study and passing from novels in general to french novels let us confess with much humiliation that we borrow from these stories a great deal more knowledge of french society than from our own personal observation we ever can hope to gain for let a gentleman who has dwelt two four or ten years in paris and has not gone thither for the purpose of making a book when three weeks are sufficientlet an english gentleman say at the end of any given period how much he knows of french society how many french houses he has entered and how many french friends he has madehe has enjoyed at the end of the year say     at the english ambassadors so many soirées   at houses to which he has brought letters so many teaparties   at cafés so many dinners   at french private houses say three dinners and very lucky too   he has we say seen an immense number of wax candles cups of tea glasses of orgeat and french people in best clothes enjoying the same but intimacy there is none we see but the outsides of the people year by year we live in france and grow gray and see no more we play écarté with monsieur de trêfle every night but what know we of the heart of the manof the inward ways thoughts and customs of trêfle if we have good legs and love the amusement we dance with countess flicflac tuesdays and thursdays ever since the peace and how far are we advanced in acquaintance with her since we first twirled her round a room we know her velvet gown and her diamonds about threefourths of them are sham by the way we know her smiles and her simpers and her rougebut no more she may turn into a kitchen wench at twelve on thursday night for aught we know her voiture a pumpkin and her gens so many rats but the real rougeless intime flicflac we know not this privilege is granted to no englishman we may understand the french language as well as monsieur de levizac but never can penetrate into flicflacs confidence our ways are not her ways our manners of thinking not hers when we say a good thing in the course of the night we are wondrous lucky and pleased flicflac will trill you off fifty in ten minutes and wonder at the bêtise of the briton who has never a word to say we are married and have fourteen children and would just as soon make love to the pope of rome as to any one but our own wife if you do not make love to flicflac from the day after her marriage to the day she reaches sixty she thinks you a fool we wont play at écarté with trêfle on sunday nights and are seen walking about one oclock accompanied by fourteen redhaired children with fourteen gleaming prayerbooks away from the church grand dieu cries trêfle is that man mad he wont play at cards on a sunday he goes to church on a sunday he has fourteen children  was ever frenchman known to do likewise pass we on to our argument which is that with our english notions and moral and physical constitution it is quite impossible that we should become intimate with our brisk neighbors and when such authors as lady morgan and mrs trollope having frequented a certain number of teaparties in the french capital begin to prattle about french manners and menwith all respect for the talents of those ladies we do believe their information not to be worth a sixpence they speak to us not of men but of teaparties teaparties are the same all the world over with the exception that with the french there are more lights and prettier dresses and with us a mighty deal more tea in the pot  there is however a cheap and delightful way of travelling that a man may perform in his easychair without expense of passports or postboys on the wings of a novel from the next circulating library he sends his imagination agadding and gains acquaintance with people and manners whom he could not hope otherwise to know twopence a volume bears us whithersoever we willback to ivanhoe and coeur de lion or to waverley and the young pretender along with walter scott up the heights of fashion with the charming enchanters of the silverfork school or better still to the snug innparlor or the jovial taproom with mr pickwick and his faithful sancho weller i am sure that a man who a hundred years hence should sit down to write the history of our time would do wrong to put that great contemporary history of pickwick aside as a frivolous work it contains true character under false names and like roderick random an inferior work and tom jones one that is immeasurably superior gives us a better idea of the state and ways of the people than one could gather from any more pompous or authentic histories  we have therefore introduced into these volumes one or two short reviews of french fiction writers of particular classes whose paris sketches may give the reader some notion of manners in that capital if not original at least the drawings are accurate for as a frenchman might have lived a thousand years in england and never could have written pickwick an englishman cannot hope to give a good description of the inward thoughts and ways of his neighbors  to a person inclined to study these in that light and amusing fashion in which the novelist treats them let us recommend the works of a new writer monsieur de bernard who has painted actual manners without those monstrous and terrible exaggerations in which late french writers have indulged and who if he occasionally wounds the english sense of propriety as what french man or woman alive will not does so more by slighting than by outraging it as with their labored descriptions of all sorts of imaginable wickedness some of his brethren of the press have done m de bernards characters are men and women of genteel societyrascals enough but living in no state of convulsive crimes and we follow him in his lively malicious account of their manners without risk of lighting upon any such horrors as balzac or dumas has provided for us  let us give an instanceit is from the amusing novel called les ailes dicare and contains what is to us quite a new picture of a french fashionable rogue the fashions will change in a few years and the rogue of course with them let us catch this delightful fellow ere he flies it is impossible to sketch the character in a more sparkling gentlemanlike way than m de bernards but such light things are very difficult of translation and the sparkle sadly evaporates during the process of decanting   a french fashionable letter  my dear victorit is six in the morning i have just come from the english ambassadors ball and as my plans for the day do not admit of my sleeping i write you a line for at this moment saturated as i am with the enchantments of a fairy night all other pleasures would be too wearisome to keep me awake except that of conversing with you indeed were i not to write to you now when should i find the possibility of doing so time flies here with such a frightful rapidity my pleasures and my affairs whirl onwards together in such a torrentuous galopade that i am compelled to seize occasion by the forelock for each moment has its imperious employ do not then accuse me of negligence if my correspondence has not always that regularity which i would fain give it attribute the fault solely to the whirlwind in which i live and which carries me hither and thither at its will  however you are not the only person with whom i am behindhand i assure you on the contrary that you are one of a very numerous and fashionable company to whom towards the discharge of my debts i propose to consecrate four hours today i give you the preference to all the world even to the lovely duchess of san severino a delicious italian whom for my special happiness i met last summer at the waters of aix i have also a most important negotiation to conclude with one of our princes of finance but nimporte i commence with thee friendship before love or moneyfriendship before everything my despatches concluded i am engaged to ride with the marquis de grigneure the comte de castijars and lord cobham in order that we may recover for a breakfast at the rocher de cancale that grigneure has lost the appetite which we all of us so cruelly abused last night at the ambassadors gala on my honor my dear fellow everybody was of a caprice prestigieux and a comfortable mirobolant fancy for a banquethall a royal orangery hung with white damask the boxes of the shrubs transformed into so many sideboards lights gleaming through the foliage and for guests the loveliest women and most brilliant cavaliers of paris orleans and nemours were there dancing and eating like simple mortals in a word albion did the thing very handsomely and i accord it my esteem  here i pause to call for my valetdechambre and call for tea for my head is heavy and ive no time for a headache in serving me this rascal of a frédéric has broken a cup true japan upon my honorthe rogue does nothing else yesterday for instance did he not thump me prodigiously by letting fall a goblet after cellini of which the carving alone cost me three hundred francs i must positively put the wretch out of doors to ensure the safety of my furniture and in consequence of this eneas an audacious young negro in whom wisdom hath not waited for yearseneas my groom i say will probably be elevated to the post of valetdechambre but where was i i think i was speaking to you of an oyster breakfast to which on our return from the park du bois a company of pleasant rakes are invited after quitting borels we propose to adjourn to the barrière du combat where lord cobham proposes to try some bulldogs which he has brought over from englandone of these oconnell lord cobham is a tory has a face in which i place much confidence i have a bet of ten louis with castijars on the strength of it after the fight we shall make our accustomed appearance at the cafe de paris the only place by the way where a man who respects himself may be seenand then away with frocks and spurs and on with our dresscoats for the rest of the evening in the first place i shall go doze for a couple of hours at the opera where my presence is indispensable for coralie a charming creature passes this evening from the rank of the rats to that of the tigers in a pasdetrois and our box patronizes her after the opera i must show my face to two or three salons in the faubourg st honoré and having thus performed my duties to the world of fashion i return to the exercise of my rights as a member of the carnival at two oclock all the world meets at the théâtre ventadour lions and tigersthe whole of our menagerie will be present evoé off we go roaring and bounding bacchanal and saturnal tis agreed that we shall be everything that is low to conclude we sup with castijars the most furiously dishevelled orgy that ever was known   the rest of the letter is on matters of finance equally curious and instructive but pause we for the present to consider the fashionable part and caricature as it is we have an accurate picture of the actual french dandy bets breakfasts riding dinners at the café de paris and delirious carnival balls the animal goes through all such frantic pleasures at the season that precedes lent he has a wondrous respect for english gentlemensportsmen he imitates their clubstheir love of horseflesh he calls his palefrenier a groom wears blue birdsseye neckcloths sports his pink out hunting rides steeplechases and has his jockey club the tigers and lions alluded to in the report have been borrowed from our own country and a great compliment is it to monsieur de bernard the writer of the above amusing sketch that he has such a knowledge of english names and things as to give a tory lord the decent title of lord cobham and to call his dog oconnell paul de kock calls an english nobleman in one of his last novels lord boulingrog and appears vastly delighted at the verisimilitude of the title  for the rugissements et bondissements bacchanale et saturnale galop infernal ronde du sabbat tout le tremblement these words give a most clear untranslatable idea of the carnival ball a sight more hideous can hardly strike a mans eye i was present at one where the four thousand guests whirled screaming reeling roaring out of the ballroom in the rue st honoré and tore down to the column in the place vendôme round which they went shrieking their own music twenty miles an hour and so tore madly back again let a man go alone to such a place of amusement and the sight for him is perfectly terrible the horrid frantic gayety of the place puts him in mind more of the merriment of demons than of men bang bang drums trumpets chairs pistolshots pour out of the orchestra which seems as mad as the dancers whiz a whirlwind of paint and patches all the costumes under the sun all the ranks in the empire all the he and she scoundrels of the capital writhed and twisted together rush by you if a man falls woe be to him two thousand screaming menads go trampling over his carcass they have neither power nor will to stop  a set of malays drunk with bhang and running amuck a company of howling dervishes may possibly in our own day go through similar frantic vagaries but i doubt if any civilized european people but the french would permit and enjoy such scenes yet our neighbors see little shame in them and it is very true that men of all classes high and low here congregate and give themselves up to the disgusting worship of the genius of the placefrom the dandy of the boulevard and the café anglais let us turn to the dandy of flicoteaus and the pays latinthe paris student whose exploits among the grisettes are so celebrated and whose fierce republicanism keeps gendarmes for ever on the alert the following is m de bernards description of him   i became acquainted with dambergeac when we were students at the ecole de droit we lived in the same hotel on the place du panthéon no doubt madam you have occasionally met little children dedicated to the virgin and to this end clothed in white raiment from head to foot my friend dambergeac had received a different consecration his father a great patriot of the revolution had determined that his son should bear into the world a sign of indelible republicanism so to the great displeasure of his godmother and the parish curate dambergeac was christened by the pagan name of harmodius it was a kind of moral tricolorcockade which the child was to bear through the vicissitudes of all the revolutions to come under such influences my friends character began to develop itself and fired by the example of his father and by the warm atmosphere of his native place marseilles he grew up to have an independent spirit and a grand liberality of politics which were at their height when first i made his acquaintance  he was then a young man of eighteen with a tall slim figure a broad chest and a flaming black eye out of all which personal charms he knew how to draw the most advantage and though his costume was such as staub might probably have criticised he had nevertheless a style peculiar to himselfto himself and the students among whom he was the leader of the fashion a tight black coat buttoned up to the chin across the chest set off that part of his person a lowcrowned hat with a voluminous rim cast solemn shadows over a countenance bronzed by a southern sun he wore at one time enormous flowing black locks which he sacrificed pitilessly however and adopted a brutus as being more revolutionary finally he carried an enormous club that was his code and digest in like manner de retz used to carry a stiletto in his pocket by way of a breviary  although of different ways of thinking in politics certain sympathies of character and conduct united dambergeac and myself and we speedily became close friends i dont think in the whole course of his three years residence dambergeac ever went through a single course of lectures for the examinations he trusted to luck and to his own facility which was prodigious as for honors he never aimed at them but was content to do exactly as little as was necessary for him to gain his degree in like manner he sedulously avoided those horrible circulating libraries where daily are seen to congregate the reading men of our schools but in revenge there was not a milliners shop or a lingères in all our quartier latin which he did not industriously frequent and of which he was not the oracle nay it was said that his victories were not confined to the left bank of the seine reports did occasionally come to us of fabulous adventures by him accomplished in the far regions of the rue de la paix and the boulevard poissonnière such recitals were for us less favored mortals like tales of bacchus conquering in the east they excited our ambition but not our jealousy for the superiority of harmodius was acknowledged by us all and we never thought of a rivalry with him no man ever cantered a hack through the champs elysées with such elegant assurance no man ever made such a massacre of dolls at the shootinggallery or won you a rubber at billiards with more easy grace or thundered out a couplet out of béranger with such a roaring melodious bass he was the monarch of the prado in winter in summer of the chaumière and mont parnasse not a frequenter of those fashionable places of entertainment showed a more amiable laisseraller in the dancethat peculiar dance at which gendarmes think proper to blush and which squeamish society has banished from her salons in a word harmodius was the prince of mauvais sujets a youth with all the accomplishments of göttingen and jena and all the eminent graces of his own country  besides dissipation and gallantry our friend had one other vast and absorbing occupationpolitics namely in which he was as turbulent and enthusiastic as in pleasure la patrie was his idol his heaven his nightmare by day he spouted by night he dreamed of his country i have spoken to you of his coiffure à la sylla need i mention his pipe his meerschaum pipe of which general foys head was the bowl his handkerchief with the charte printed thereon and his celebrated tricolor braces which kept the rallying sign of his country ever close to his heart besides these outward and visible signs of sedition he had inward and secret plans of revolution he belonged to clubs frequented associations read the constitutionnel liberals in those days swore by the constitutionnel harangued peers and deputies who had deserved well of their country and if death happened to fall on such and the constitutionnel declared their merit harmodius was the very first to attend their obsequies or to set his shoulder to their coffins  such were his tastes and passions his antipathies were not less lively he detested three things a jesuit a gendarme and a claqueur at a theatre at this period missionaries were rife about paris and endeavored to reillume the zeal of the faithful by public preachings in the churches infâmes jesuites would harmodius exclaim who in the excess of his toleration tolerated nothing and at the head of a band of philosophers like himself would attend with scrupulous exactitude the meetings of the reverend gentlemen but instead of a contrite heart harmodius only brought the abomination of desolation into their sanctuary a perpetual fire of fulminating balls would bang from under the feet of the faithful odors of impure assafoetida would mingle with the fumes of the incense and wicked drinking choruses would rise up along with the holy canticles in hideous dissonance reminding one of the old orgies under the reign of the abbot of unreason  his hatred of the gendarmes was equally ferocious and as for the claqueurs woe be to them when harmodius was in the pit they knew him and trembled before him like the earth before alexander and his famous warcry la carte au chapeau was so much dreaded that the entrepreneurs de succès dramatiques demanded twice as much to do the odeon theatre which we students and harmodius frequented as to applaud at any other place of amusement and indeed their double pay was hardly gained harmodius taking care that they should earn the most of it under the benches   this passage with which we have taken some liberties will give the reader a more lively idea of the reckless jovial turbulent paris student than any with which a foreigner could furnish him the grisette is his heroine and dear old béranger the cynicepicurean has celebrated him and her in the most delightful verses in the world of these we may have occasion to say a word or two anon meanwhile let us follow monsieur de bernard in his amusing descriptions of his countrymen somewhat farther and having seen how dambergeac was a ferocious republican being a bachelor let us see how age sense and a little government paythe great agent of conversions in francenay in englandhas reduced him to be a pompous quiet loyal supporter of the juste milieu his former portrait was that of the student the present will stand for an admirable lively likeness of       the sousprÉfet   saying that i would wait for dambergeac in his own study i was introduced into that apartment and saw around me the usual furniture of a man in his station there was in the middle of the room a large bureau surrounded by orthodox armchairs and there were many shelves with boxes duly ticketed there were a number of maps and among them a great one of the department over which dambergeac ruled and facing the windows on a wooden pedestal stood a plastercast of the roi des français recollecting my friends former republicanism i smiled at this piece of furniture but before i had time to carry my observations any farther a heavy rolling sound of carriagewheels that caused the windows to rattle and seemed to shake the whole edifice of the subprefecture called my attention to the court without its iron gates were flung open and in rolled with a great deal of din a chariot escorted by a brace of gendarmes sword in hand a tall gentleman with a cockedhat and feathers wearing a blue and silver uniform coat descended from the vehicle and having with much grave condescension saluted his escort mounted the stair a moment afterwards the door of the study was opened and i embraced my friend  after the first warmth and salutations we began to examine each other with an equal curiosity for eight years had elapsed since we had last met  you are grown very thin and pale said harmodius after a moment  in revenge i find you fat and rosy if i am a walking satire on celibacyyou at least are a living panegyric on marriage  in fact a great change and such an one as many people would call a change for the better had taken place in my friend he had grown fat and announced a decided disposition to become what french people call a bel homme that is a very fat one his complexion bronzed before was now clear white and red there were no more political allusions in his hair which was on the contrary neatly frizzed and brushed over the forehead shellshape this headdress joined to a thin pair of whiskers cut crescentwise from the ear to the nose gave my friend a regular bourgeois physiognomy waxdolllike he looked a great deal too well and added to this the solemnity of his prefectural costume gave his whole appearance a pompous wellfed look that by no means pleased  i surprise you said i in the midst of your splendor do you know that this costume and yonder attendants have a look excessively awful and splendid you entered your palace just now with the air of a pasha  you see me in uniform in honor of monseigneur the bishop who has just made his diocesan visit and whom i have just conducted to the limit of the arrondissement  what said i you have gendarmes for guards and dance attendance on bishops there are no more janissaries and jesuits i suppose the subprefect smiled  i assure you that my gendarmes are very worthy fellows and that among the gentlemen who compose our clergy there are some of the very best rank and talent besides my wife is niece to one of the vicarsgeneral  what have you done with that great tasso beard that poor armandine used to love so  my wife does not like a beard and you know that what is permitted to a student is not very becoming to a magistrate  i began to laugh harmodius and a magistratehow shall i ever couple the two words together but tell me in your correspondences your audiences your sittings with village mayors and petty councils how do you manage to remain awake  in the commencement said harmodius gravely it was very difficult and in order to keep my eyes open i used to stick pins into my legs now however i am used to it and im sure i dont take more than fifty pinches of snuff at a sitting  ah apropos of snuff you are near spain here and were always a famous smoker give me a cigarit will take away the musty odor of these piles of papers  impossible my dear i dont smoke my wife cannot bear a cigar  his wife thought i always his wife and i remember juliette who really grew sick at the smell of a pipe and harmodius would smoke until at last the poor thing grew to smoke herself like a trooper to compensate however as much as possible for the loss of my cigar dambergeac drew from his pocket an enormous gold snuffbox on which figured the selfsame head that i had before remarked in plaster but this time surrounded with a ring of pretty princes and princesses all nicely painted in miniature as for the statue of louis philippe that in the cabinet of an official is a thing of course but the snuffbox seemed to indicate a degree of sentimental and personal devotion such as the old royalists were only supposed to be guilty of  what you are turned decided juste milieu said i  i am a souspréfet answered harmodius  i had nothing to say but held my tongue wondering not at the change which had taken place in the habits manners and opinions of my friend but at my own folly which led me to fancy that i should find the student of 26 in the functionary of 34 at this moment a domestic appeared  madame is waiting for monsieur said he the last bell has gone and mass beginning  mass said i bounding up from my chair you at mass like a decent serious christian without crackers in your pocket and bored keys to whistle throughthe souspréfet rose his countenance was calm and an indulgent smile played upon his lips as he said my arrondissement is very devout and not to interfere with the belief of the population is the maxim of every wise politician i have precise orders from government on the point too and go to eleven oclock mass every sunday   there is a great deal of curious matter for speculation in the accounts here so wittily given by m de bernard but perhaps it is still more curious to think of what he has not written and to judge of his characters not so much by the words in which he describes them as by the unconscious testimony that the words all together convey in the first place our author describes a swindler imitating the manners of a dandy and many swindlers and dandies be there doubtless in london as well as in paris but there is about the present swindler and about monsieur dambergeac the student and monsieur dambergeac the souspréfet and his friend a rich store of calm internal debauch which does not let us hope and pray exist in england hearken to m de gustan and his smirking whispers about the duchess of san severino who pour son bonheur particulier c c listen to monsieur dambergeacs friends remonstrances concerning pauvre juliette who grew sick at the smell of a pipe to his naïve admiration at the fact that the souspréfet goes to church and we may set down as axioms that religion is so uncommon among the parisians as to awaken the surprise of all candid observers that gallantry is so common as to create no remark and to be considered as a matter of course with us at least the converse of the proposition prevails it is the man professing irreligion who would be remarked and reprehended in england and if the secondnamed vice exists at any rate it adopts the decency of secrecy and is not made patent and notorious to all the world a french gentleman thinks no more of proclaiming that he has a mistress than that he has a tailor and one lives the time of boccaccio over again in the thousand and one french novels which depict society in that country  for instance here are before us a few specimens do not madam be alarmed you can skip the sentence if you like to be found in as many admirable witty tales by the beforelauded monsieur de bernard he is more remarkable than any other french author to our notion for writing like a gentleman there is ease grace and ton in his style which if we judge aright cannot be discovered in balzac or soulié or dumas we have thengerfaut a novel a lovely creature is married to a brave haughty alsacian nobleman who allows her to spend her winters at paris he remaining on his terres cultivating carousing and hunting the boar the lovelycreature meets the fascinating gerfaut at paris instantly the latter makes love to her a duel takes place baron killed wife throws herself out of window gerfaut plunges into dissipation and so the tale ends  next la femme de quarante ans a capital tale full of exquisite fun and sparkling satire la femme de quarante ans has a husband and three lovers all of whom find out their mutual connection one starry night for the lady of forty is of a romantic poetical turn and has given her three admirers a star apiece saying to one and the other alphonse when yon pale orb rises in heaven think of me isadore when that bright planet sparkles in the sky remember your caroline c  un acte de vertu from which we have taken dambergeacs history contains him the husbanda wifeand a brace of lovers and a great deal of fun takes place in the manner in which one lover supplants the otherpretty morals truly  if we examine an author who rejoices in the aristocratic name of le comte horace de vielcastel we find though with infinitely less wit exactly the same intrigues going on a noble count lives in the faubourg st honoré and has a noble duchess for a mistress he introduces her grace to the countess his wife the countess his wife in order to ramener her lord to his conjugal duties is counselled by a friend to pretend to take a lover one is found who poor fellow takes the affair in earnest climaxduel death despair and what not in the faubourg st germain another novel by the same writer which professes to describe the very pink of that society which napoleon dreaded more than russia prussia and austria there is an old husband of course a sentimental young german nobleman who falls in love with his wife and the moral of the piece lies in the showing up of the conduct of the lady who is reprehendednot for deceiving her husband poor devilbut for being a flirt and taking a second lover to the utter despair confusion and annihilation of the first  why ye gods do frenchmen marry at all had père enfantin who it is said has shaved his ambrosial beard and is now a clerk in a bankinghouse been allowed to carry out his chaste just dignified social scheme what a deal of marital discomfort might have been avoidedwould it not be advisable that a great reformer and lawgiver of our own mr robert owen should be presented at the tuileries and there propound his scheme for the regeneration of france  he might perhaps be spared for our country is not yet sufficiently advanced to give such a philosopher fair play in london as yet there are no blessed bureaux de mariage where an old bachelor may have a charming young maidenfor his money or a widow of seventy may buy a gay young fellow of twenty for a certain number of bankbillets if mariages de convenance take place here as they will wherever avarice and poverty and desire and yearning after riches are to be found at least thank god such unions are not arranged upon a regular organized system there is a fiction of attachment with us and there is a consolation in the deceit the homage according to the old mot of rochefoucauld which vice pays to virtue for the very falsehood shows that the virtue exists somewhere we once heard a furious old french colonel inveighing against the chastity of english demoiselles figurezvous sir said he he had been a prisoner in england that these women come down to dinner in low dresses and walk out alone with the menand pray heaven so may they walk fancyfree in all sorts of maiden meditations and suffer no more molestation than that young lady of whom moore sings and who there must have been a famous lordlieutenant in those days walked through all ireland with rich and rare gems beauty and a gold ring on her stick without meeting or thinking of harm  now whether monsieur de vielcastel has given a true picture of the faubourg st germain it is impossible for most foreigners to say but some of his descriptions will not fail to astonish the english reader and all are filled with that remarkable naïf contempt of the institution called marriage which we have seen in m de bernard the romantic young nobleman of westphalia arrives at paris and is admitted into what a celebrated female author calls la crême de la crême de la haute volée of parisian society he is a youth of about twenty years of age no passion had as yet come to move his heart and give life to his faculties he was awaiting and fearing the moment of love calling for it and yet trembling at its approach feeling in the depths of his soul that that moment would create a mighty change in his being and decide perhaps by its influence the whole of his future life  is it not remarkable that a young nobleman with these ideas should not pitch upon a demoiselle or a widow at least but no the rogue must have a married woman bad luck to him and what his fate is to be is thus recounted by our author in the shape of   a french fashionable conversation   a lady with a great deal of esprit to whom forty years experience of the great world had given a prodigious perspicacity of judgment the duchess of chalux arbitress of the opinion to be held on all new comers to the faubourg saint germain and of their destiny and reception in itone of those women in a word who make or ruin a mansaid in speaking of gerard de stolberg whom she received at her own house and met everywhere this young german will never gain for himself the title of an exquisite or a man of bonnes fortunes among us in spite of his calm and politeness i think i can see in his character some rude and insurmountable difficulties which time will only increase and which will prevent him for ever from bending to the exigencies of either profession but unless i very much deceive myself he will one day be the hero of a veritable romance  he madame answered a young man of fair complexion and fair hair one of the most devoted slaves of the fashionhe madame la duchesse why the man is at best but an original fished out of the rhine a dull heavy creature as much capable of understanding a womans heart as i am of speaking basbreton  well monsieur de belport you will speak basbreton monsieur de stolberg has not your admirable ease of manner nor your facility of telling pretty nothings nor yourin a word that particular something which makes you the most recherché man of the faubourg saint germain and even i avow to you that were i still young and a coquette and that i took it into my head to have a lover i would prefer you  all this was said by the duchess with a certain air of raillery and such a mixture of earnest and malice that monsieur de belport piqued not a little could not help saying as he bowed profoundly before the duchesss chair and might i madam be permitted to ask the reason of this preference  o mon dieu oui said the duchess always in the same tone because a lover like you would never think of carrying his attachment to the height of passion and these passions do you know have frightened me all my life one cannot retreat at will from the grasp of a passionate lover one leaves behind one some fragment of ones moral self or the best part of ones physical life a passion if it does not kill you adds cruelly to your years in a word it is the very lowest possible taste and now you understand why i should prefer you m de belportyou who are reputed to be the leader of the fashion  perfectly murmured the gentleman piqued more and more  gerard de stolberg will be passionate i dont know what woman will please him or will be pleased by him here the duchess of chalux spoke more gravely but his love will be no play i repeat it to you once more all this astonishes you because you great leaders of the ton that you are never fancy that a hero of romance should be found among your number gerard de stolbergbut look here he comes  m de belport rose and quitted the duchess without believing in her prophecy but he could not avoid smiling as he passed near the hero of romance  it was because m de stolberg had never in all his life been a hero of romance or even an apprenticehero of romance  gerard de stolberg was not as yet initiated into the thousand secrets in the chronicle of the great world he knew but superficially the society in which he lived and therefore he devoted his evening to the gathering of all the information which he could acquire from the indiscreet conversations of the people about him his whole man became ear and memory so much was stolberg convinced of the necessity of becoming a diligent student in this new school where was taught the art of knowing and advancing in the great world in the recess of a window he learned more on this one night than months of investigation would have taught him the talk of a ball is more indiscreet than the confidential chatter of a company of idle women no man present at a ball whether listener or speaker thinks he has a right to affect any indulgence for his companions and the most learned in malice will always pass for the most witty  how said the viscount de mondragé the duchess of rivesalte arrives alone tonight without her inevitable dormillyand the viscount as he spoke pointed towards a tall and slender young woman who gliding rather than walking met the ladies by whom she passed with a graceful and modest salute and replied to the looks of the men by brilliant veiled glances full of coquetry and attack  parbleu said an elegant personage standing near the viscount de mondragé dont you see dormilly ranged behind the duchess in quality of trainbearer and hiding under his long locks and his great screen of moustaches the blushing consciousness of his good luckthey call him the fourth chapter of the duchesss memoirs the little marquise dalberas is ready to die out of spite but the best of the joke is that she has only taken poor de vendre for a lover in order to vent her spleen on him look at him against the chimney yonder if the marchioness do not break at once with him by quitting him for somebody else the poor fellow will turn an idiot  is he jealous asked a young man looking as if he did not know what jealousy was and as if he had no time to be jealous  jealous the very incarnation of jealousy the second edition revised corrected and considerably enlarged as jealous as poor gressigny who is dying of it  what gressigny too why tis growing quite into fashion egad i must try and be jealous said monsieur de beauval but see here comes the delicious duchess of bellefiore c c c   enough enough this kind of fashionable parisian conversation which is says our author a prodigious labor of improvising a chefdoeuvre a strange and singular thing in which monotony is unknown seems to be if correctly reported a strange and singular thing indeed but somewhat monotonous at least to an english reader and prodigious only if we may take leave to say so for the wonderful rascality which all the conversationists betray miss neverout and the colonel in swifts famous dialogue are a thousand times more entertaining and moral and besides we can laugh at those worthies as well as with them whereas the prodigious french wits are to us quite incomprehensible fancy a duchess as old as lady  herself and who should begin to tell us of what she would do if ever she had a mind to take a lover and another duchess with a fourth lover tripping modestly among the ladies and returning the gaze of the men by veiled glances full of coquetry and attackparbleu if monsieur de vielcastel should find himself among a society of french duchesses and they should tear his eyes out and send the fashionable orpheus floating by the seine his slaughter might almost be considered as justifiable counticide     a gamblers death   anybody who was at c school some twelve years since must recollect jack attwood he was the most dashing lad in the place with more money in his pocket than belonged to the whole fifth form in which we were companions  when he was about fifteen jack suddenly retreated from c and presently we heard that he had a commission in a cavalry regiment and was to have a great fortune from his father when that old gentleman should die jack himself came to confirm these stories a few months after and paid a visit to his old school chums he had laid aside his little schooljacket and inky corduroys and now appeared in such a splendid military suit as won the respect of all of us his hair was dripping with oil his hands were covered with rings he had a dusky down over his upper lip which looked not unlike a moustache and a multiplicity of frogs and braiding on his surtout which would have sufficed to lace a fieldmarshal when old swishtail the usher passed in his seedy black coat and gaiters jack gave him such a look of contempt as set us all alaughing in fact it was his turn to laugh now for he used to roar very stoutly some months before when swishtail was in the custom of belaboring him with his great cane  jacks talk was all about the regiment and the fine fellows in it how he had ridden a steeplechase with captain boldero and licked him at the last hedge and how he had very nearly fought a duel with sir george grig about dancing with lady mary slamken at a ball i soon made the baronet know what it was to deal with a man of the nth said jack dammee sir when i lugged out my barkers and talked of fighting across the messroom table grig turned as pale as a sheet or as  or as you used to do attwood when swishtail hauled you up piped out little hicks the foundationboy  it was beneath jacks dignity to thrash anybody now but a grownup baronet so he let off little hicks and passed over the general titter which was raised at his expense however he entertained us with his histories about lords and ladies and soandso of ours until we thought him one of the greatest men in his majestys service and until the schoolbell rung when with a heavy heart we got our books together and marched in to be whacked by old swishtail i promise you he revenged himself on us for jacks contempt of him i got that day at least twenty cuts to my share which ought to have belonged to cornet attwood of the nth dragoons  when we came to think more coolly over our quondam schoolfellows swaggering talk and manner we were not quite so impressed by his merits as at his first appearance among us we recollected how he used in former times to tell us great stories which were so monstrously improbable that the smallest boy in the school would scout them how often we caught him tripping in facts and how unblushingly he admitted his little errors in the score of veracity he and i though never great friends had been close companions i was jacks formfellow we fought with amazing emulation for the last place in the class but still i was rather hurt at the coolness of my old comrade who had forgotten all our former intimacy in his steeplechases with captain boldero and his duel with sir george grig  nothing more was heard of attwood for some years a tailor one day came down to c who had made clothes for jack in his schooldays and furnished him with regimentals he produced a long bill for one hundred and twenty pounds and upwards and asked where news might be had of his customer jack was in india with his regiment shooting tigers and jackals no doubt occasionally from that distant country some magnificent rumor would reach us of his proceedings once i heard that he had been called to a courtmartial for unbecoming conduct another time that he kept twenty horses and won the gold plate at the calcutta races presently however as the recollections of the fifth form wore away jacks image disappeared likewise and i ceased to ask or think about my college chum  a year since as i was smoking my cigar in the estaminet du grand balcon an excellent smokingshop where the tobacco is unexceptionable and the hollands of singular merit a darklooking thickset man in a greasy wellcut coat with a shabby hat cocked on one side of his dirty face took the place opposite me at the little marble table and called for brandy i did not much admire the impudence or the appearance of my friend nor the fixed stare with which he chose to examine me at last he thrust a great greasy hand across the table and said titmarsh do you forget your old friend attwood  i confess my recognition of him was not so joyful as on the day ten years earlier when he had come bedizened with lace and gold rings to see us at c school a man in the tenth part of a century learns a deal of worldly wisdom and his hand which goes naturally forward to seize the gloved finger of a millionnaire or a milor draws instinctively back from a dirty fist encompassed by a ragged wristband and a tattered cuff but attwood was in nowise so backward and the iron squeeze with which he shook my passive paw proved that he was either very affectionate or very poor you my dear sir who are reading this history know very well the great art of shaking hands recollect how you shook lord dashs hand the other day and how you shook off poor blank when he came to borrow five pounds of you  however the genial influence of the hollands speedily dissipated anything like coolness between us and in the course of an hours conversation we became almost as intimate as when we were suffering together under the ferule of old swishtail jack told me that he had quitted the army in disgust and that his father who was to leave him a fortune had died ten thousand pounds in debt he did not touch upon his own circumstances but i could read them in his elbows which were peeping through his old frock he talked a great deal however of runs of luck good and bad and related to me an infallible plan for breaking all the playbanks in europea great number of old tricksand a vast quantity of ginpunch was consumed on the occasion so long in fact did our conversation continue that i confess it with shame the sentiment or something stronger quite got the better of me and i have to this day no sort of notion how our palaver concludedonly on the next morning i did not possess a certain fivepound note which on the previous evening was in my sketchbook by far the prettiest drawing by the way in the collection but there instead was a strip of paper thus inscribed   iou five pounds john attwood late of the nth dragoons   i suppose attwood borrowed the money from this remarkable and ceremonious acknowledgment on his part had i been sober i would just as soon have lent him the nose on my face for in my then circumstances the note was of much more consequence to me  as i lay cursing my ill fortune and thinking how on earth i should manage to subsist for the next two months attwood burst into my little garrethis face strangely flushedsinging and shouting as if it had been the night before titmarsh cried he you are my preservermy best friend look here and here and here and at every word mr attwood produced a handful of gold or a glittering heap of fivefranc pieces or a bundle of greasy dusky banknotes more beautiful than either silver or goldhe had won thirteen thousand francs after leaving me at midnight in my garret he separated my poor little all of six pieces from this shining and imposing collection and the passion of envy entered my soul i felt far more anxious now than before although starvation was then staring me in the face i hated attwood for cheating me out of all this wealth poor fellow it had been better for him had he never seen a shilling of it  however a grand breakfast at the café anglais dissipated my chagrin and i will do my friend the justice to say that he nobly shared some portion of his good fortune with me as far as the creature comforts were concerned i feasted as well as he and never was particular as to settling my share of the reckoning  jack now changed his lodgings had cards with captain attwood engraved on them and drove about a prancing cabhorse as tall as the giraffe at the jardin des plantes he had as many frogs on his coat as in the old days and frequented all the flash restaurateurs and boardinghouses of the capital madame de saint laurent and madame la baronne de vaudrey and madame la comtesse de jonville ladies of the highest rank who keep a société choisie and condescend to give dinners at fivefrancs a head vied with each other in their attentions to jack his was the wing of the fowl and the largest portion of the charlotterusse his was the place at the écarté table where the countess would ease him nightly of a few pieces declaring that he was the most charming cavalier la fleur dalbion jacks society it may be seen was not very select nor in truth were his inclinations he was a careless daredevil macheath kind of fellow who might be seen daily with a wife on each arm  it may be supposed that with the life he led his five hundred pounds of winnings would not last him long nor did they but for some time his luck never deserted him and his cash instead of growing lower seemed always to maintain a certain level he played every night  of course such a humble fellow as i could not hope for a continued acquaintance and intimacy with attwood he grew overbearing and cool i thought at any rate i did not admire my situation as his follower and dependant and left his grand dinner for a certain ordinary where i could partake of five capital dishes for ninepence occasionally however attwood favored me with a visit or gave me a drive behind his great cabhorse he had formed a whole host of friends besides there was fips the barrister heaven knows what he was doing at paris and gortz the west indian who was there on the same business and flapper a medical studentall these three i met one night at flappers rooms where jack was invited and a great spread was laid in honor of him  jack arrived rather latehe looked pale and agitated and though he ate no supper he drank raw brandy in such a manner as made flappers eyes wink the poor fellow had but three bottles and jack bade fair to swallow them all however the west indian generously remedied the evil and producing a napoleon we speedily got the change for it in the shape of four bottles of champagne  our supper was uproariously harmonious fips sung the good old english gentleman jack the british grenadiers and your humble servant when called upon sang that beautiful ditty when the bloom is on the rye in a manner that drew tears from every eye except flappers who was asleep and jacks who was singing the bay of biscay o at the same time gortz and fips were all the time lunging at each other with a pair of singlesticks the barrister having a very strong notion that he was richard the third at last fips hit the west indian such a blow across his sconce that the other grew furious he seized a champagnebottle which was providentially empty and hurled it across the room at fips had that celebrated barrister not bowed his head at the moment the queens bench would have lost one of its most eloquent practitioners  fips stood as straight as he could his cheek was pale with wrath mmister gogortz he said i always heard you were a blackguard now i can prprpeperove it flapper your pistols every gegegenlmn knows what i mean  young mr flapper had a small pair of pocketpistols which the tipsy barrister had suddenly remembered and with which he proposed to sacrifice the west indian gortz was nothing loth but was quite as valorous as the lawyer  attwood who in spite of his potations seemed the soberest man of the party had much enjoyed the scene until this sudden demand for the weapons pshaw said he eagerly dont give these men the means of murdering each other sit down and let us have another song but they would not be still and flapper forthwith produced his pistolcase and opened it in order that the duel might take place on the spot there were no pistols there i beg your pardon said attwood looking much confused ii took the pistols home with me to clean them  i dont know what there was in his tone or in the words but we were sobered all of a sudden attwood was conscious of the singular effect produced by him for he blushed and endeavored to speak of other things but we could not bring our spirits back to the mark again and soon separated for the night as we issued into the street jack took me aside and whispered have you a napoleon titmarsh in your purse alas i was not so rich my reply was that i was coming to jack only in the morning to borrow a similar sum  he did not make any reply but turned away homeward i never heard him speak another word   two mornings after for none of our party met on the day succeeding the supper i was awakened by my porter who brought a pressing letter from mr gortz   dear ti wish you would come over here to breakfast theres a row about attwoodyours truly  solomon gortz   i immediately set forward to gortzs he lived in the rue du helder a few doors from attwoods new lodging if the reader is curious to know the house in which the catastrophe of this history took place he has but to march some twenty doors down from the boulevard des italiens when he will see a fine door with a naked cupid shooting at him from the hall and a venus beckoning him up the stairs on arriving at the west indians at about midday it was a sunday morning i found that gentleman in his dressinggown discussing in the company of mr fips a large plate of bifteck aux pommes  heres a pretty row said gortz quoting from his letterattwoods offhave a bit of beefsteak  what do you mean exclaimed i adopting the familiar phraseology of my acquaintancesattwood offhas he cut his stick  not bad said the feeling and elegant fipsnot such a bad guess my boy but he has not exactly cut his stick  what then  why his throat the mans mouth was full of bleeding beef as he uttered this gentlemanly witticism  i wish i could say that i was myself in the least affected by the news i did not joke about it like my friend fips this was more for proprietys sake than for feelings but for my old school acquaintance the friend of my early days the merry associate of the last few months i own with shame that i had not a tear or a pang in some german tale there is an account of a creature most beautiful and bewitching whom all men admire and follow but this charming and fantastic spirit only leads them one by one into ruin and then leaves them the novelist who describes her beauty says that his heroine is a fairy and has no heart i think the intimacy which is begotten over the winebottle is a spirit of this nature i never knew a good feeling come from it or an honest friendship made by it it only entices men and ruins them it is only a phantom of friendship and feeling called up by the delirious blood and the wicked spells of the wine  but to drop this strain of moralizing in which the writer is not too anxious to proceed for he cuts in it a most pitiful figure we passed sundry criticisms upon poor attwoods character expressed our horror at his deathwhich sentiment was fully proved by mr fips who declared that the notion of it made him feel quite faint and was obliged to drink a large glass of brandy and finally we agreed that we would go and see the poor fellows corpse and witness if necessary his burial  flapper who had joined us was the first to propose this visit he said he did not mind the fifteen francs which jack owed him for billiards but he was anxious to get back his pistol accordingly we sallied forth and speedily arrived at the hotel which attwood inhabited still he had occupied for a time very fine apartments in this house and it was only on arriving there that day that we found he had been gradually driven from his magnificent suite of rooms au premier to a little chamber in the fifth storywe mounted and found him it was a little shabby room with a few articles of rickety furniture and a bed in an alcove the light from the one window was falling full upon the bed and the body jack was dressed in a fine lawn shirt he had kept it poor fellow to die in for in all his drawers and cupboards there was not a single article of clothing he had pawned everything by which he could raise a pennydesk books dressingcase and clothes and not a single halfpenny was found in his possession        in order to account for these trivial details the reader      must be told that the story is for the chief part a fact      and that the little sketch in this page was taken from      nature the latter was likewise a copy from one found in the      manner described  he was lying as i have drawn him one hand on his breast the other falling towards the ground there was an expression of perfect calm on the face and no mark of blood to stain the side towards the light on the other side however there was a great pool of black blood and in it the pistol it looked more like a toy than a weapon to take away the life of this vigorous young man in his forehead at the side was a small black wound jacks life had passed through it it was little bigger than a mole         this refers to an illustrated edition of the work   regardez un peu said the landlady messieurs il ma gâté trois matelas et il me doit quarante quatre francs  this was all his epitaph he had spoiled three mattresses and owed the landlady fourandforty francs in the whole world there was not a soul to love him or lament him we his friends were looking at his body more as an object of curiosity watching it with a kind of interest with which one follows the fifth act of a tragedy and leaving it with the same feeling with which one leaves the theatre when the play is over and the curtain is down  beside jacks bed on his little table de nuit lay the remains of his last meal and an open letter which we read it was from one of his suspicious acquaintances of former days and ran thus   où es tu cher jack why you not come and see metu me dois de largent entends tuun chapeau une cachemire a box of the play viens demain soir je tattendrai at eight oclock passage des panoramas my sir is at his country  adieu à demain  fifine  samedi   i shuddered as i walked through this very passage des panoramas in the evening the girl was there pacing to and fro and looking in the countenance of every passerby to recognize attwood adieu À demainthere was a dreadful meaning in the words which the writer of them little knew adieu à demainthe morrow was come and the soul of the poor suicide was now in the presence of god i dare not think of his fate for except in the fact of his poverty and desperation was he worse than any of us his companions who had shared his debauches and marched with him up to the very brink of the grave  there is but one more circumstance to relate regarding poor jackhis burial it was of a piece with his death  he was nailed into a paltry coffin and buried at the expense of the arrondissement in a nook of the burialplace beyond the barrière de letoile they buried him at six oclock of a bitter winters morning and it was with difficulty that an english clergyman could be found to read a service over his grave the three men who have figured in this history acted as jacks mourners and as the ceremony was to take place so early in the morning these men sat up the night through and were almost drunk as they followed his coffin to its restingplace   moral   when we turned out in our greatcoats said one of them afterwards reeking of cigars and brandyandwater de sir we quite frightened the old buck of a parson he did not much like our company after the ceremony was concluded these gentlemen were very happy to get home to a warm and comfortable breakfast and finished the day royally at frascatis     napoleon and his system  on prince louis napoleons work   any person who recollects the history of the absurd outbreak of strasburg in which prince louis napoleon bonaparte figured three years ago must remember that however silly the revolt was however foolish its pretext however doubtful its aim and inexperienced its leader there was nevertheless a party and a considerable one in france that were not unwilling to lend the new projectors their aid the troops who declared against the prince were it was said all but willing to declare for him and it was certain that in many of the regiments of the army there existed a strong spirit of disaffection and an eager wish for the return of the imperial system and family  as to the good that was to be derived from the change that is another question why the emperor of the french should be better than the king of the french or the king of the french better than the king of france and navarre it is not our business to inquire but all the three monarchs have no lack of supporters republicanism has no lack of supporters st simoninnism was followed by a respectable body of admirers robespierrism has a select party of friends if in a country where so many quacks have had their day prince louis napoleon thought he might renew the imperial quackery why should he not it has recollections with it that must always be dear to a gallant nation it has certain claptraps in its vocabulary that can never fail to inflame a vain restless grasping disappointed one  in the first place and dont let us endeavor to disguise it they hate us not all the protestations of friendship not all the wisdom of lord palmerston not all the diplomacy of our distinguished plenipotentiary mr henry lytton bulwerand let us add not all the benefit which both countries would derive from the alliancecan make it in our times at least permanent and cordial they hate us the carlist organs revile us with a querulous fury that never sleeps the moderate party if they admit the utility of our alliance are continually pointing out our treachery our insolence and our monstrous infractions of it and for the republicans as sure as the morning comes the columns of their journals thunder out volleys of fierce denunciations against our unfortunate country they live by feeding the natural hatred against england by keeping old wounds open by recurring ceaselessly to the history of old quarrels and as in these we by gods help by land and by sea in old times and late have had the uppermost they perpetuate the shame and mortification of the losing party the bitterness of past defeats and the eager desire to avenge them a party which knows how to exploiter this hatred will always be popular to a certain extent and the imperial scheme has this at least among its conditions  then there is the favorite claptrap of the natural frontier the frenchman yearns to be bounded by the rhine and the alps and next follows the cry let france take her place among nations and direct as she ought to do the affairs of europe these are the two chief articles contained in the new imperial programme if we may credit the journal which has been established to advocate the cause a natural boundarystand among the nationspopular developmentrussian alliance and a reduction of la perfide albion to its proper insignificance as yet we know little more of the plan and yet such foundations are sufficient to build a party upon and with such windy weapons a substantial government is to be overthrown  in order to give these doctrines such as they are a chance of finding favor with his countrymen prince louis has the advantage of being able to refer to a former great professor of themhis uncle napoleon his attempt is at once pious and prudent it exalts the memory of the uncle and furthers the interests of the nephew who attempts to show what napoleons ideas really were what good had already resulted from the practice of them how cruelly they had been thwarted by foreign wars and difficulties and what vast benefits would have resulted from them ay and it is reasonable to conclude might still if the french nation would be wise enough to pitch upon a governor that would continue the interrupted scheme it is however to be borne in mind that the emperor napoleon had certain arguments in favor of his opinions for the time being which his nephew has not employed on the 13th vendemiaire when general bonaparte believed in the excellence of a directory it may be remembered that he aided his opinions by forty pieces of artillery and by colonel murat at the head of his dragoons there was no resisting such a philosopher the directory was established forthwith and the sacred cause of the minority triumphed in like manner when the general was convinced of the weakness of the directory and saw fully the necessity of establishing a consulate what were his arguments moreau lannes murat berthier leclerc lefebvregentle apostles of the truthmarched to st cloud and there with fixed bayonets caused it to prevail error vanished in an instant at once five hundred of its highpriests tumbled out of windows and lo three consuls appeared to guide the destinies of france how much more expeditious reasonable and clinching was this argument of the 18th brumaire than any one that can be found in any pamphlet a fig for your duodecimos and octavos talk about points there are none like those at the end of a bayonet and the most powerful of styles is a good rattling article from a ninepounder  at least this is our interpretation of the manner in which were always propagated the idées napoléoniennes not such however is prince louiss belief and if you wish to go along with him in opinion you will discover that a more liberal peaceable prudent prince never existed you will read that the mission of napoleon was to be the testamentary executor of the revolution and the prince should have added the legatee or more justly still as well as the executor he should be called the executioner and then his title would be complete in vendemiaire the military tartuffe he threw aside the revolutions natural heirs and made her as it were alter her will on the 18th of brumaire he strangled her and on the 19th seized on her property and kept it until force deprived him of it illustrations to be sure are no arguments but the example is the princes not ours  in the princes eyes then his uncle is a god of all monarchs the most wise upright and merciful thirty years ago the opinion had millions of supporters while millions again were ready to avouch the exact contrary it is curious to think of the former difference of opinion concerning napoleon and in reading his nephews rapturous encomiums of him one goes back to the days when we ourselves were as loud and mad in his dispraise who does not remember his own personal hatred and horror twentyfive years ago for the man whom we used to call the bloody corsican upstart and assassin what stories did we not believe of himwhat murders rapes robberies not lay to his chargewe who were living within a few miles of his territory and might by books and newspapers be made as well acquainted with his merits or demerits as any of his own countrymen  then was the age when the idées napoléoniennes might have passed through many editions for while we were thus outrageously bitter our neighbors were as extravagantly attached to him by a strange infatuationadored him like a god whom we chose to consider as a fiend and vowed that under his government their nation had attained its highest pitch of grandeur and glory in revenge there existed in england as is proved by a thousand authentic documents a monster so hideous a tyrant so ruthless and bloody that the worlds history cannot show his parallel this ruffians name was during the early part of the french revolution pittetcobourg pittetcobourgs emissaries were in every corner of france pittetcobourgs gold chinked in the pockets of every traitor in europe it menaced the life of the godlike robespierre it drove into cellars and fits of delirium even the gentle philanthropist marat it fourteen times caused the dagger to be lifted against the bosom of the first consul emperor and kingthat first great glorious irresistible cowardly contemptible bloody hero and fiend bonaparte before mentioned  on our side of the channel we have had leisure long since to reconsider our verdict against napoleon though to be sure we have not changed our opinion about pittetcobourg after fiveandthirty years all parties bear witness to his honesty and speak with affectionate reverence of his patriotism his genius and his private virtue in france however or at least among certain parties in france there has been no such modification of opinion with the republicans pittetcobourg is pittetcobourg stillcrafty bloody seeking whom he may devour and perfide albion more perfidious than ever this hatred is the point of union between the republic and the empire it has been fostered ever since and must be continued by prince louis if he would hope to conciliate both parties  with regard to the emperor then prince louis erects to his memory as fine a monument as his wits can raise one need not say that the imperial apologists opinion should be received with the utmost caution for a man who has such a hero for an uncle may naturally be proud of and partial to him and when this nephew of the great man would be his heir likewise and hearing his name step also into his imperial shoes one may reasonably look for much affectionate panegyric the empire was the best of empires cries the prince and possibly it was undoubtedly the prince thinks it was but he is the very last person who would convince a man with the proper suspicious impartiality one remembers a certain consultation of politicians which is recorded in the spellingbook and the opinion of that patriotic sage who avowed that for a real blameless constitution an impenetrable shield for liberty and cheap defence of nations there was nothing like leather  let us examine some of the princes article if we may be allowed humbly to express an opinion his leather is not only quite insufficient for those vast public purposes for which he destines it but is moreover and in itself very bad leather the hides are poor small unsound slips of skin or to drop this cobbling metaphor the style is not particularly brilliant the facts not very startling and as for the conclusions one may differ with almost every one of them here is an extract from his first chapter on governments in general  i speak it with regret i can see but two governments at this day which fulfil the mission that providence has confided to them they are the two colossi at the end of the world one at the extremity of the old world the other at the extremity of the new whilst our old european centre is as a volcano consuming itself in its crater the two nations of the east and the west march without hesitation towards perfection the one under the will of a single individual the other under liberty  providence has confided to the united states of north america the task of peopling and civilizing that immense territory which stretches from the atlantic to the south sea and from the north pole to the equator the government which is only a simple administration has only hitherto been called upon to put in practice the old adage laissez faire laissez passer in order to favor that irresistible instinct which pushes the people of america to the west  in russia it is to the imperial dynasty that is owing all the vast progress which in a century and a half has rescued that empire from barbarism the imperial power must contend against all the ancient prejudices of our old europe it must centralize as far as possible all the powers of the state in the hands of one person in order to destroy the abuses which the feudal and communal franchises have served to perpetuate the last alone can hope to receive from it the improvements which it expects  but thou france of henry iv of louis xiv of carnot of napoleonthou who wert always for the west of europe the source of progress who possessest in thyself the two great pillars of empire the genius for the arts of peace and the genius of warhast thou no further mission to fulfil wilt thou never cease to waste thy force and energies in intestine struggles no such cannot be thy destiny the day will soon come when to govern thee it will be necessary to understand that thy part is to place in all treaties thy sword of brennus on the side of civilization  these are the conclusions of the princes remarks upon governments in general and it must be supposed that the reader is very little wiser at the end than at the beginning but two governments in the world fulfil their mission the one government which is no government the other which is a despotism the duty of france is in all treaties to place her sword of brennus in the scale of civilization without quarrelling with the somewhat confused language of the latter proposition may we ask what in heavens name is the meaning of all the three what is this épée de brennus and how is france to use it where is the great source of political truth from which flowing pure we trace american republicanism in one stream russian despotism in another vastly prosperous is the great republic if you will if dollars and cents constitute happiness there is plenty for all but can any one who has read of the american doings in the late frontier troubles and the daily disputes on the slave question praise the government of the statesa government which dares not punish homicide or arson performed before its very eyes and which the pirates of texas and the pirates of canada can brave at their will there is no government but a prosperous anarchy as the princes other favorite government is a prosperous slavery what then is to be the épée de brennus government is it to be a mixture of the two society writes the prince axiomatically contains in itself two principlesthe one of progress and immortality the other of disease and disorganization no doubt and as the one tends towards liberty so the other is only to be cured by order and then with a singular felicity prince louis picks us out a couple of governments in one of which the common regulating power is as notoriously too weak as it is in the other too strong and talks in rapturous terms of the manner in which they fulfil their providential mission  from these considerations on things in general the prince conducts us to napoleon in particular and enters largely into a discussion of the merits of the imperial system our author speaks of the emperors advent in the following grandiose way  napoleon on arriving at the public stage saw that his part was to be the testamentary executor of the revolution the destructive fire of parties was extinct and when the revolution dying but not vanquished delegated to napoleon the accomplishment of her last will she said to him establish upon solid bases the principal result of my efforts unite divided frenchmen defeat feudal europe that is leagued against me cicatrize my wounds enlighten the nations execute that in width which i have had to perform in depth be for europe what i have been for france and even if you must water the tree of civilization with your bloodif you must see your projects misunderstood and your sons without a country wandering over the face of the earth never abandon the sacred cause of the french people insure its triumph by all the means which genius can discover and humanity approve  this grand mission napoleon performed to the end his task was difficult he had to place upon new principles a society still boiling with hatred and revenge and to use for building up the same instruments which had been employed for pulling down  the common lot of every new truth that arises is to wound rather than to convincerather than to gain proselytes to awaken fear for oppressed as it long has been it rushes forward with additional force having to encounter obstacles it is compelled to combat them and overthrow them until at length comprehended and adopted by the generality it becomes the basis of new social order  liberty will follow the same march as the christian religion armed with death from the ancient society of rome it for a long while excited the hatred and fear of the people at last by force of martyrdoms and persecutions the religion of christ penetrated into the conscience and the soul it soon had kings and armies at its orders and constantine and charlemagne bore it triumphant throughout europe religion then laid down her arms of war it laid open to all the principles of peace and order which it contained it became the prop of government as it was the organizing element of society thus will it be with liberty in 1793 it frightened people and sovereigns alike then having clothed itself in a milder garb it insinuated itself everywhere in the train of our battalions in 1815 all parties adopted its flag and armed themselves with its moral forcecovered themselves with its colors the adoption was not sincere and liberty was soon obliged to reassume its warlike accoutrements with the contest their fears returned let us hope that they will soon cease and that liberty will soon resume her peaceful standards to quit them no more  the emperor napoleon contributed more than any one else towards accelerating the reign of liberty by saving the moral influence of the revolution and diminishing the fears which it imposed without the consulate and the empire the revolution would have been only a grand drama leaving grand revolutions but no traces the revolution would have been drowned in the counterrevolution the contrary however was the case napoleon rooted the revolution in france and introduced throughout europe the principal benefits of the crisis of 1789 to use his own words he purified the revolution he confirmed kings and ennobled people he purified the revolution in separating the truths which it contained from the passions that during its delirium disfigured it he ennobled the people in giving them the consciousness of their force and those institutions which raise men in their own eyes the emperor may be considered as the messiah of the new ideas forand we must confess itin the moments immediately succeeding a social revolution it is not so essential to put rigidly into practice all the propositions resulting from the new theory but to become master of the regenerative genius to identify ones self with the sentiments of the people and boldly to direct them towards the desired point to accomplish such a task your fibre should respond to that of the people as the emperor said you should feel like it your interests should be so intimately raised with its own that you should vanquish or fall together  let us take breath after these big phrasesgrand round figures of speechwhich when put together amount like certain other combinations of round figures to exactly 0 we shall not stop to argue the merits and demerits of prince louiss notable comparison between the christian religion and the imperialrevolutionary system there are many blunders in the above extract as we read it blundering metaphors blundering arguments and blundering assertions but this is surely the grandest blunder of all and one wonders at the blindness of the legislator and historian who can advance such a parallel and what are we to say of the legacy of the dying revolution to napoleon revolutions do not die and on their deathbeds making fine speeches hand over their property to young officers of artillery we have all read the history of his rise the constitution of the year iii was carried old men of the montagne disguised royalists paris sections pittetcobourg above all with his moneybags thought that here was a fine opportunity for a revolt and opposed the new constitution in arms the new constitution had knowledge of a young officer who would not hesitate to defend its cause and who effectually beat the majority the tale may be found in every account of the revolution and the rest of his story need not be told we know every step that he took we know how by doses of cannonballs promptly administered he cured the fever of the sectionsthat fever which another campphysician menou declined to prescribe for we know how he abolished the directory and how the consulship came and then the empire and then the disgrace exile and lonely death has not all this been written by historians in all tonguesby memoirwriting pages chamberlains marshals lackeys secretaries contemporaries and ladies of honor not a word of miracle is there in all this narration not a word of celestial missions or political messiahs from napoleons rise to his fall the bayonet marches alongside of him now he points it at the tails of the scampering five hundrednow he charges with it across the bloody planks of arcolanow he flies before it over the fatal plain of waterloo  unwilling however as he may be to grant that there are any spots in the character of his heros government the prince is nevertheless obliged to allow that such existed that the emperors manner of rule was a little more abrupt and dictatorial than might possibly be agreeable for this the prince has always an answer readyit is the same poor one that napoleon uttered a million of times to his companions in exilethe excuse of necessity he would have been very liberal but that the people were not fit for it or that the cursed war prevented himor any other reason why his first duty however says his apologist was to form a general union of frenchmen and he set about his plan in this wise  let us not forget that all which napoleon undertook in order to create a general fusion he performed without renouncing the principles of the revolution he recalled the émigrés without touching upon the law by which their goods had been confiscated and sold as public property he reestablished the catholic religion at the same time that he proclaimed the liberty of conscience and endowed equally the ministers of all sects he caused himself to be consecrated by the sovereign pontiff without conceding to the popes demand any of the liberties of the gallican church he married a daughter of the emperor of austria without abandoning any of the rights of france to the conquests she had made he reestablished noble titles without attaching to them any privileges or prerogatives and these titles were conferred on all ranks on all services on all professions under the empire all idea of caste was destroyed no man ever thought of vaunting his pedigreeno man ever was asked how he was born but what he had done  the first quality of a people which aspires to liberal government is respect to the law now a law has no other power than lies in the interest which each citizen has to defend or to contravene it in order to make a people respect the law it was necessary that it should be executed in the interest of all and should consecrate the principle of equality in all its extension it was necessary to restore the prestige with which the government had been formerly invested and to make the principles of the revolution take root in the public manners at the commencement of a new society it is the legislator who makes or corrects the manners later it is the manners which make the law or preserve it from age to age intact  some of these fusions are amusing no man in the empire was asked how he was born but what he had done and accordingly as a mans actions were sufficient to illustrate him the emperor took care to make a host of new titlebearers princes dukes barons and what not whose rank has descended to their children he married a princess of austria but for all that did not abandon his conquestsperhaps not actually but he abandoned his allies and eventually his whole kingdom who does not recollect his answer to the poles at the commencement of the russian campaign but for napoleons imperial fatherinlaw poland would have been a kingdom and his race perhaps imperial still why was he to fetch this princess out of austria to make heirs for his throne why did not the man of the people marry a girl of the people why must he have a pope to crown himhalf a dozen kings for brothers and a bevy of aidesdecamp dressed out like so many mountebanks from astleys with dukes coronets and grand blue velvet marshals bâtons we have repeatedly his words for it he wanted to create an aristocracyanother acknowledgment on his part of the republican dilemmaanother apology for the revolutionary blunder to keep the republic within bounds a despotism is necessary to rally round the despotism an aristocracy must be created and for what have we been laboring all this while for what have bastiles been battered down and kings heads hurled as a gage of battle in the face of armed europe to have a duke of otranto instead of a duke de la tremouille and emperor stork in place of king log o lame conclusion is the blessed revolution which is prophesied for us in england only to end in establishing a prince fergus oconnor or a cardinal wade or a duke daniel whittle harvey great as those patriots are we love them better under their simple family names and scorn titles and coronets  at present in france the delicate matter of titles seems to be better arranged any gentleman since the revolution being free to adopt any one he may fix upon and it appears that the crown no longer confers any patents of nobility but contents itself with saying as in the case of m de pontois the other day le roi trouve convenable that you take the title of c  to execute the legacy of the revolution then to fulfil his providential mission to keep his placein other words for the simplest are always the bestto keep his place and to keep his government in decent order the emperor was obliged to establish a military despotism to reestablish honors and titles it was necessary as the prince confesses to restore the old prestige of the government in order to make the people respect it and he addsa truth which one hardly would expect from himat the commencement of a new society it is the legislator who makes and corrects the manners later it is the manners which preserve the laws of course and here is the great risk that all revolutionizing people runthey must tend to despotism they must personify themselves in a man is the princes phrase and according as is his temperament or dispositionaccording as he is a cromwell a washington or a napoleonthe revolution becomes tyranny or freedom prospers or falls  somewhere in the st helena memorials napoleon reports a message of his to the pope tell the pope he says to an archbishop to remember that i have six hundred thousand armed frenchmen qui marcheront avec moi pour moi et comme moi and this is the legacy of the revolution the advancement of freedom a hundred volumes of imperial special pleading will not avail against such a speech as thisone so insolent and at the same time so humiliating which gives unwittingly the whole of the emperors progress strength and weakness the six hundred thousand armed frenchmen were used up and the whole fabric falls the six hundred thousand are reduced to sixty thousand and straightway all the rest of the fine imperial scheme vanishes the miserable senate so crawling and abject but now becomes of a sudden endowed with a wondrous independence the miserable sham nobles sham empress sham kings dukes princes chamberlains pack up their plumes and embroideries pounce upon what money and plate they can lay their hands on and when the allies appear before paris when for courage and manliness there is yet hope when with fierce marches hastening to the relief of his capital bursting through ranks upon ranks of the enemy and crushing or scattering them from the path of his swift and victorious despair the emperor at last is at homewhere are the great dignitaries and the lieutenantgenerals of the empire where is maria louisa the empress eagle with her little callow king of rome is she going to defend her nest and her eaglet not she empressqueen lieutenantgeneral and court dignitaries are off on the wings of all the windsprofligati sunt they are away with the moneybags and louis stanislas xavier rolls into the palace of his fathers  with regard to napoleons excellences as an administrator a legislator a constructor of public works and a skilful financier his nephew speaks with much diffuse praise and few persons we suppose will be disposed to contradict him whether the emperor composed his famous code or borrowed it is of little importance but he established it and made the law equal for every man in france except one his vast public works and vaster wars were carried on without new loans or exorbitant taxes it was only the blood and liberty of the people that were taxed and we shall want a better advocate than prince louis to show us that these were not most unnecessarily and lavishly thrown away as for the former and material improvements it is not necessary to confess here that a despotic energy can effect such far more readily than a government of which the strength is diffused in many conflicting parties no doubt if we could create a despotical governing machine a steam autocratpassionless untiring and supremewe should advance further and live more at ease than under any other form of government ministers might enjoy their pensions and follow their own devices lord john might compose histories or tragedies at his leisure and lord palmerston instead of racking his brains to write leading articles for cupid might crown his locks with flowers and sing greek text omitted his natural anacreontics but alas not so if the despotic government has its good side prince louis napoleon must acknowledge that it has its bad and it is for this that the civilized world is compelled to substitute for it something more orderly and less capricious good as the imperial government might have been it must be recollected too that since its first fall both the emperor and his admirer and wouldbe successor have had their chance of reestablishing it fly from steeple to steeple the eagles of the former did actually and according to promise perch for a while on the towers of notre dame we know the event if the fate of war declared against the emperor the country declared against him too and with old lafayette for a mouthpiece the representatives of the nation did in a neat speech pronounce themselves in permanence but spoke no more of the emperor than if he had never been thereupon the emperor proclaimed his son the emperor napoleon ii lempereur est mort vive lempereur shouted prince lucien psha not a soul echoed the words the play was played and as for old lafayette and his permanent representatives a corporal with a hammer nailed up the door of their spoutingclub and once more louis stanislas xavier rolled back to the bosom of his people  in like manner napoleon iii returned from exile and made his appearance on the frontier his eagle appeared at strasburg and from strasburg advanced to the capital but it arrived at paris with a keeper and in a postchaise whence by the orders of the sovereign it was removed to the american shores and there magnanimously let loose who knows however how soon it may be on the wing again and what a flight it will take     the story of mary ancel   go my nephew said old father jacob to me and complete thy studies at strasburg heaven surely hath ordained thee for the ministry in these times of trouble and my excellent friend schneider will work out the divine intention  schneider was an old college friend of uncle jacobs was a benedictine monk and a man famous for his learning as for me i was at that time my uncles chorister clerk and sacristan i swept the church chanted the prayers with my shrill treble and swung the great copper incensepot on sundays and feasts and i toiled over the fathers for the other days of the week  the old gentleman said that my progress was prodigious and without vanity i believe he was right for i then verily considered that praying was my vocation and not fighting as i have found since  you would hardly conceive said the captain swearing a great oath how devout and how learned i was in those days i talked latin faster than my own beautiful patois of alsacian french i could utterly overthrow in argument every protestant heretics we called them parson in the neighborhood and there was a confounded sprinkling of these unbelievers in our part of the country i prayed half a dozen times a day i fasted thrice in a week and as for penance i used to scourge my little sides till they had no more feeling than a pegtop such was the godly life i led at my uncle jacobs in the village of steinbach  our family had long dwelt in this place and a large farm and a pleasant house were then in the possession of another uncleuncle edward he was the youngest of the three sons of my grandfather but jacob the elder had shown a decided vocation for the church from i believe the age of three and now was by no means tired of it at sixty my father who was to have inherited the paternal property was as i hear a terrible scamp and scapegrace quarrelled with his family and disappeared altogether living and dying at paris so far we knew through my mother who came poor woman with me a child of six months on her bosom was refused all shelter by my grandfather but was housed and kindly cared for by my good uncle jacob  here she lived for about seven years and the old gentleman when she died wept over her grave a great deal more than i did who was then too young to mind anything but toys or sweetmeats  during this time my grandfather was likewise carried off he left as i said the property to his son edward with a small proviso in his will that something should be done for me his grandson  edward was himself a widower with one daughter mary about three years older than i and certainly she was the dearest little treasure with which providence ever blessed a miserly father by the time she was fifteen five farmers three lawyers twelve protestant parsons and a lieutenant of dragoons had made her offers it must not be denied that she was an heiress as well as a beauty which perhaps had something to do with the love of these gentlemen however mary declared that she intended to live single turned away her lovers one after another and devoted herself to the care of her father  uncle jacob was as fond of her as he was of any saint or martyr as for me at the mature age of twelve i had made a kind of divinity of her and when we sang ave maria on sundays i could not refrain from turning to her where she knelt blushing and praying and looking like an angel as she was besides her beauty mary had a thousand good qualities she could play better on the harpsichord she could dance more lightly she could make better pickles and puddings than any girl in alsace there was not a want or a fancy of the old hunks her father or a wish of mine or my uncles that she would not gratify if she could as for herself the sweet soul had neither wants nor wishes except to see us happy  i could talk to you for a year of all the pretty kindnesses that she would do for me how when she found me of early mornings among my books her presence would cast a light upon the day how she used to smooth and fold my little surplice and embroider me caps and gowns for high feastdays how she used to bring flowers for the altar and who could deck it so well as she but sentiment does not come glibly from under a grizzled moustache so i will drop it if you please  amongst other favors she showed me mary used to be particularly fond of kissing me it was a thing i did not so much value in those days but i found that the more i grew alive to the extent of the benefit the less she would condescend to confer it on me till at last when i was about fourteen she discontinued it altogether of her own wish at least only sometimes i used to be rude and take what she had now become so mighty unwilling to give  i was engaged in a contest of this sort one day with mary when just as i was about to carry off a kiss from her cheek i was saluted with a staggering slap on my own which was bestowed by uncle edward and sent me reeling some yards down the garden  the old gentleman whose tongue was generally as close as his purse now poured forth a flood of eloquence which quite astonished me i did not think that so much was to be said on any subject as he managed to utter on one and that was abuse of me he stamped he swore he screamed and then from complimenting me he turned to mary and saluted her in a manner equally forcible and significant she who was very much frightened at the commencement of the scene grew very angry at the coarse words he used and the wicked motives he imputed to her  the child is but fourteen she said he is your own nephew and a candidate for holy ordersfather it is a shame that you should thus speak of me your daughter or of one of his holy profession  i did not particularly admire this speech myself but it had an effect on my uncle and was the cause of the words with which this history commences the old gentleman persuaded his brother that i must be sent to strasburg and there kept until my studies for the church were concluded i was furnished with a letter to my uncles old college chum professor schneider who was to instruct me in theology and greek  i was not sorry to see strasburg of the wonders of which i had heard so much but felt very loth as the time drew near when i must quit my pretty cousin and my good old uncle mary and i managed however a parting walk in which a number of tender things were said on both sides i am told that you englishmen consider it cowardly to cry as for me i wept and roared incessantly when mary squeezed me for the last time the tears came out of me as if i had been neither more nor less than a great wet sponge my cousins eyes were stoically dry her ladyship had a part to play and it would have been wrong for her to be in love with a young chit of fourteenso she carried herself with perfect coolness as if there was nothing the matter i should not have known that she cared for me had it not been for a letter which she wrote me a month afterwardsthen nobody was by and the consequence was that the letter was half washed away with her weeping if she had used a wateringpot the thing could not have been better done  well i arrived at strasburga dismal oldfashioned rickety town in those daysand straightway presented myself and letter at schneiders door over it was written        comitÉ de salut public   would you believe it i was so ignorant a young fellow that i had no idea of the meaning of the words however i entered the citizens room without fear and sat down in his antechamber until i could be admitted to see him  here i found very few indications of his reverences profession the walls were hung round with portraits of robespierre marat and the like a great bust of mirabeau mutilated with the word traître underneath lists and republican proclamations tobaccopipes and firearms at a dealtable stained with grease and wine sat a gentleman with a huge pigtail dangling down to that part of his person which immediately succeeds his back and a red nightcap containing a tricolor cockade as large as a pancake he was smoking a short pipe reading a little book and sobbing as if his heart would break every now and then he would make brief remarks upon the personages or the incidents of his book by which i could judge that he was a man of the very keenest sensibilitiesah brigand o malheureuse o charlotte charlotte the work which this gentleman was perusing is called the sorrows of werter it was all the rage in those days and my friend was only following the fashion i asked him if i could see father schneider he turned towards me a hideous pimpled face which i dream of now at forty years distance  father who said he do you imagine that citizen schneider has not thrown off the absurd mummery of priesthood if you were a little older you would go to prison for calling him father schneidermany a man has died for less and he pointed to a picture of a guillotine which was hanging in the room  i was in amazement  what is he is he not a teacher of greek an abbé a monk until monasteries were abolished the learned editor of the songs of anacreon  he was all this replied my grim friend he is now a member of the committee of public safety and would think no more of ordering your head off than of drinking this tumbler of beer  he swallowed himself the frothy liquid and then proceeded to give me the history of the man to whom my uncle had sent me for instruction  schneider was born in 1756 was a student at würzburg and afterwards entered a convent where he remained nine years he here became distinguished for his learning and his talents as a preacher and became chaplain to duke charles of würtemberg the doctrines of the illuminati began about this time to spread in germany and schneider speedily joined the sect he had been a professor of greek at cologne and being compelled on account of his irregularity to give up his chair he came to strasburg at the commencement of the french revolution and acted for some time a principal part as a revolutionary agent at strasburg  heaven knows what would have happened to me had i continued long under his tuition said the captain i owe the preservation of my morals entirely to my entering the army a man sir who is a soldier has very little time to be wicked except in the case of a siege and the sack of a town when a little license can offend nobody  by the time that my friend had concluded schneiders biography we had grown tolerably intimate and i imparted to him with that experience so remarkable in youth my whole historymy course of studies my pleasant country life the names and qualities of my dear relations and my occupations in the vestry before religion was abolished by order of the republic in the course of my speech i recurred so often to the name of my cousin mary that the gentleman could not fail to perceive what a tender place she had in my heart  then we reverted to the sorrows of werter and discussed the merits of that sublime performance although i had before felt some misgivings about my new acquaintance my heart now quite yearned towards him he talked about love and sentiment in a manner which made me recollect that i was in love myself and you know that when a man is in that condition his taste is not very refined any maudlin trash of prose or verse appearing sublime to him provided it correspond in some degree with his own situation  candid youth cried my unknown i love to hear thy innocent story and look on thy guileless face there is alas so much of the contrary in this world so much terror and crime and blood that we who mingle with it are only too glad to forget it would that we could shake off our cares as men and be boys as thou art again  here my friend began to weep once more and fondly shook my hand i blessed my stars that i had at the very outset of my career met with one who was so likely to aid me what a slanderous world it is thought i the people in our village call these republicans wicked and bloodyminded a lamb could not be more tender than this sentimental bottlenosed gentleman the worthy man then gave me to understand that he held a place under government i was busy in endeavoring to discover what his situation might be when the door of the next apartment opened and schneider made his appearance  at first he did not notice me but he advanced to my new acquaintance and gave him to my astonishment something very like a blow  you drunken talking fool he said you are always after your time fourteen people are cooling their heels yonder waiting until you have finished your beer and your sentiment  my friend slunk muttering out of the room  that fellow said schneider turning to me is our public executioner a capital hand too if he would but keep decent time but the brute is always drunk and blubbering over the sorrows of werter   i know not whether it was his old friendship for my uncle or my proper merits which won the heart of this the sternest ruffian of robespierres crew but certain it is that he became strangely attached to me and kept me constantly about his person as for the priesthood and the greek they were of course very soon out of the question the austrians were on our frontier every day brought us accounts of battles won and the youth of strasburg and of all france indeed were bursting with military ardor as for me i shared the general mania and speedily mounted a cockade as large as that of my friend the executioner  the occupations of this worthy were unremitting saint just who had come down from paris to preside over our town executed the laws and the aristocrats with terrible punctuality and schneider used to make country excursions in search of offenders with this fellow as a provostmarshal at his back in the meantime having entered my sixteenth year and being a proper lad of my age i had joined a regiment of cavalry and was scampering now after the austrians who menaced us and now threatening the emigrés who were banded at coblentz my love for my dear cousin increased as my whiskers grew and when i was scarcely seventeen i thought myself man enough to marry her and to cut the throat of any one who should venture to say me nay  i need not tell you that during my absence at strasburg great changes had occurred in our little village and somewhat of the revolutionary rage had penetrated even to that quiet and distant place the hideous fête of the supreme being had been celebrated at paris the practice of our ancient religion was forbidden its professors were most of them in concealment or in exile or had expiated on the scaffold their crime of christianity in our poor village my uncles church was closed and he himself an inmate in my brothers house only owing his safety to his great popularity among his former flock and the influence of edward ancel  the latter had taken in the revolution a somewhat prominent part that is he had engaged in many contracts for the army attended the clubs regularly corresponded with the authorities of his department and was loud in his denunciations of the aristocrats in the neighborhood but owing perhaps to the german origin of the peasantry and their quiet and rustic lives the revolutionary fury which prevailed in the cities had hardly reached the country people the occasional visit of a commissary from paris or strasburg served to keep the flame alive and to remind the rural swains of the existence of a republic in france  now and then when i could gain a weeks leave of absence i returned to the village and was received with tolerable politeness by my uncle and with a warmer feeling by his daughter  i wont describe to you the progress of our love or the wrath of my uncle edward when he discovered that it still continued he swore and he stormed he locked mary into her chamber and vowed that he would withdraw the allowance he made me if ever i ventured near her his daughter he said should never marry a hopeless penniless subaltern and mary declared she would not marry without his consent what had i to doto despair and to leave her as for my poor uncle jacob he had no counsel to give me and indeed no spirit left his little church was turned into a stable his surplice torn off his shoulders and he was only too lucky in keeping his head on them a bright thought struck him suppose you were to ask the advice of my old friend schneider regarding this marriage he has ever been your friend and may help you now as before  here the captain paused a little you may fancy continued he that it was droll advice of a reverend gentleman like uncle jacob to counsel me in this manner and to bid me make friends with such a murderous cutthroat as schneider but we thought nothing of it in those days guillotining was as common as dancing and a man was only thought the better patriot the more severe he might be i departed forthwith to strasburg and requested the vote and interest of the citizen president of the committee of public safety  he heard me with a great deal of attention i described to him most minutely the circumstance expatiated upon the charms of my dear mary and painted her to him from head to foot her golden hair and her bright blushing cheeks her slim waist and her tripping tiny feet and furthermore i added that she possessed a fortune which ought by rights to be mine but for the miserly old father curse him for an aristocrat concluded i in my wrath  as i had been discoursing about marys charms schneider listened with much complacency and attention when i spoke about her fortune his interest redoubled and when i called her father an aristocrat the worthy exjesuit gave a grin of satisfaction which was really quite terrible o fool that i was to trust him so far   the very same evening an officer waited upon me with the following note from saint just   strasburg fifth year of the republic one and indivisible 11 ventose  the citizen pierre ancel is to leave strasburg within two hours and to carry the enclosed despatches to the president of the committee of public safety at paris the necessary leave of absence from his military duties has been provided instant punishment will follow the slightest delay on the road  salut et fraternité   there was no choice but obedience and off i sped on my weary way to the capital  as i was riding out of the paris gate i met an equipage which i knew to be that of schneider the ruffian smiled at me as i passed and wished me a bon voyage behind his chariot came a curious machine or cart a great basket three stout poles and several planks all painted red were lying in this vehicle on the top of which was seated my friend with the big cockade it was the portable guillotine which schneider always carried with him on his travels the bourreau was reading the sorrows of werter and looked as sentimental as usual  i will not speak of my voyage in order to relate to you schneiders my story had awakened the wretchs curiosity and avarice and he was determined that such a prize as i had shown my cousin to be should fall into no hands but his own no sooner in fact had i quitted his room than he procured the order for my absence and was on the way to steinbach as i met him  the journey is not a very long one and on the next day my uncle jacob was surprised by receiving a message that the citizen schneider was in the village and was coming to greet his old friend old jacob was in an ecstasy for he longed to see his college acquaintance and he hoped also that schneider had come into that part of the country upon the marriagebusiness of your humble servant of course mary was summoned to give her best dinner and wear her best frock and her father made ready to receive the new state dignitary  schneiders carriage speedily rolled into the courtyard and schneiders cart followed as a matter of course the expriest only entered the house his companion remaining with the horses to dine in private here was a most touching meeting between him and jacob they talked over their old college pranks and successes they capped greek verses and quoted ancient epigrams upon their tutors who had been dead since the seven years war mary declared it was quite touching to listen to the merry friendly talk of these two old gentlemen  after the conversation had continued for a time in this strain schneider drew up all of a sudden and said quietly that he had come on particular and unpleasant businesshinting about troublesome times spies evil reports and so forth then he called uncle edward aside and had with him a long and earnest conversation so jacob went out and talked with schneiders friend they speedily became very intimate for the ruffian detailed all the circumstances of his interview with me when he returned into the house some time after this pleasing colloquy he found the tone of the society strangely altered edward ancel pale as a sheet trembling and crying for mercy poor mary weeping and schneider pacing energetically about the apartment raging about the rights of man the punishment of traitors and the one and indivisible republic  jacob he said as my uncle entered the room i was willing for the sake of our old friendship to forget the crimes of your brother he is a known and dangerous aristocrat he holds communications with the enemy on the frontier he is a possessor of great and illgotten wealth of which he has plundered the republic do you know said he turning to edward ancel where the least of these crimes or the mere suspicion of them would lead you  poor edward sat trembling in his chair and answered not a word he knew full well how quickly in this dreadful time punishment followed suspicion and though guiltless of all treason with the enemy perhaps he was aware that in certain contracts with the government he had taken to himself a more than patriotic share of profit  do you know resumed schneider in a voice of thunder for what purpose i came hither and by whom i am accompanied i am the administrator of the justice of the republic the life of yourself and your family is in my hands yonder man who follows me is the executor of the law he has rid the nation of hundreds of wretches like yourself a single word from me and your doom is sealed without hope and your last hour is come ho gregoire shouted he is all ready  gregoire replied from the court i can put up the machine in half an hour shall i go down to the village and call the troops and the law people  do you hear him said schneider the guillotine is in the courtyard your name is on my list and i have witnesses to prove your crime have you a word in your defence  not a word came the old gentleman was dumb but his daughter who did not give way to his terror spoke for him  you cannot sir said she although you say it feel that my father is guilty you would not have entered our house thus alone if you had thought it you threaten him in this manner because you have something to ask and to gain from us what is it citizentell us how much you value our lives and what sum we are to pay for our ransom  sum said uncle jacob he does not want money of us my old friend my college chum does not come hither to drive bargains with anybody belonging to jacob ancel  oh no sir no you cant want money of us shrieked edward we are the poorest people of the village ruined monsieur schneider ruined in the cause of the republic  silence father said my brave mary this man wants a price he comes with his worthy friend yonder to frighten us not to kill us if we die he cannot touch a sou of our money it is confiscated to the state tell us sir what is the price of our safety  schneider smiled and bowed with perfect politeness  mademoiselle marie he said is perfectly correct in her surmise i do not want the life of this poor drivelling old man my intentions are much more peaceable be assured it rests entirely with this accomplished young lady whose spirit i like and whose ready wit i admire whether the business between us shall be a matter of love or death i humbly offer myself citizen ancel as a candidate for the hand of your charming daughter her goodness her beauty and the large fortune which i know you intend to give her would render her a desirable match for the proudest man in the republic and i am sure would make me the happiest  this must be a jest monsieur schneider said mary trembling and turning deadly pale you cannot mean this you do not know me you never heard of me until today  pardon me belle dame replied he your cousin pierre has often talked to me of your virtues indeed it was by his special suggestion that i made the visit  it is falseit is a base and cowardly lie exclaimed she for the young ladys courage was uppierre never could have forgotten himself and me so as to offer me to one like you you come here with a lie on your lipsa lie against my father to swear his life away against my dear cousins honor and love it is useless now to deny it father i love pierre ancel i will marry no other but himno though our last penny were paid to this man as the price of our freedom  schneiders only reply to this was a call to his friend gregoire  send down to the village for the maire and some gendarmes and tell your people to make ready  shall i put the machine up shouted he of the sentimental turn  you hear him said schneider marie ancel you may decide the fate of your father i shall return in a few hours concluded he and will then beg to know your decision  the advocate of the rights of man then left the apartment and left the family as you may imagine in no very pleasant mood  old uncle jacob during the few minutes which had elapsed in the enactment of this strange scene sat staring wildly at schneider and holding mary on his knees the poor little thing had fled to him for protection and not to her father who was kneeling almost senseless at the window gazing at the executioner and his hideous preparations the instinct of the poor girl had not failed her she knew that jacob was her only protector if not of her lifeheaven bless himof her honor indeed the old man said in a stout voice this must never be my dearest childyou must not marry this man if it be the will of providence that we fall we shall have at least the thought to console us that we die innocent any man in france at a time like this would be a coward and traitor if he feared to meet the fate of the thousand brave and good who have preceded us  who speaks of dying said edward you brother jacobyou would not lay that poor girls head on the scaffold or mine your dear brothers you will not let us die mary you will not for a small sacrifice bring your poor old father into danger  mary made no answer perhaps she said there is time for escape he is to be here but in two hours in two hours we may be safe in concealment or on the frontier and she rushed to the door of the chamber as if she would have instantly made the attempt two gendarmes were at the door we have orders mademoiselle they said to allow no one to leave this apartment until the return of the citizen schneider  alas all hope of escape was impossible mary became quite silent for a while she would not speak to uncle jacob and in reply to her fathers eager questions she only replied coldly that she would answer schneider when he arrived  the two dreadful hours passed away only too quickly and punctual to his appointment the exmonk appeared directly he entered mary advanced to him and said calmly  sir i could not deceive you if i said that i freely accepted the offer which you have made me i will be your wife but i tell you that i love another and that it is only to save the lives of those two old men that i yield my person up to you  schneider bowed and said  it is bravely spoken i like your candoryour beauty as for the love excuse me for saying that is a matter of total indifference i have no doubt however that it will come as soon as your feelings in favor of the young gentleman your cousin have lost their present fervor that engaging young man has at present another mistressglory he occupies i believe the distinguished post of corporal in a regiment which is about to march toperpignan i believe  it was in fact monsieur schneiders polite intention to banish me as far as possible from the place of my birth and he had accordingly selected the spanish frontier as the spot where i was to display my future military talents  mary gave no answer to this sneer she seemed perfectly resigned and calm she only said  i must make however some conditions regarding our proposed marriage which a gentleman of monsieur schneiders gallantry cannot refuse  pray command me replied the husband elect fair lady you know i am your slave  you occupy a distinguished political rank citizen representative said she and we in our village are likewise known and beloved i should be ashamed i confess to wed you here for our people would wonder at the sudden marriage and imply that it was only by compulsion that i gave you my hand let us then perform this ceremony at strasburg before the public authorities of the city with the state and solemnity which befits the marriage of one of the chief men of the republic  be it so madam he answered and gallantly proceeded to embrace his bride  mary did not shrink from this ruffians kiss nor did she reply when poor old jacob who sat sobbing in a corner burst out and said  o mary mary i did not think this of thee  silence brother hastily said edward my good soninlaw will pardon your illhumor  i believe uncle edward in his heart was pleased at the notion of the marriage he only cared for money and rank and was little scrupulous as to the means of obtaining them  the matter then was finally arranged and presently after schneider had transacted the affairs which brought him into that part of the country the happy bridal party set forward for strasburg uncles jacob and edward occupied the back seat of the old family carriage and the young bride and bridegroom he was nearly jacobs age were seated majestically in front mary has often since talked to me of this dreadful journey she said she wondered at the scrupulous politeness of schneider during the route nay that at another period she could have listened to and admired the singular talent of this man his great learning his fancy and wit but her mind was bent upon other things and the poor girl firmly thought that her last day was come  in the meantime by a blessed chance i had not ridden three leagues from strasburg when the officer of a passing troop of a cavalry regiment looking at the beast on which i was mounted was pleased to take a fancy to it and ordered me in an authoritative tone to descend and to give up my steed for the benefit of the republic i represented to him in vain that i was a soldier like himself and the bearer of despatches to paris fool he said do you think they would send despatches by a man who can ride at best but ten leagues a day and the honest soldier was so wroth at my supposed duplicity that he not only confiscated my horse but my saddle and the little portmanteau which contained the chief part of my worldly goods and treasure i had nothing for it but to dismount and take my way on foot back again to strasburg i arrived there in the evening determining the next morning to make my case known to the citizen st just and though i made my entry without a sou i dont know what secret exultation i felt at again being able to return  the antechamber of such a great man as st just was in those days too crowded for an unprotected boy to obtain an early audience two days passed before i could obtain a sight of the friend of robespierre on the third day as i was still waiting for the interview i heard a great bustle in the courtyard of the house and looked out with many others at the spectacle  a number of men and women singing epithalamiums and dressed in some absurd imitation of roman costume a troop of soldiers and gendarmerie and an immense crowd of the badauds of strasburg were surrounding a carriage which then entered the court of the mayoralty in this carriage great god i saw my dear mary and schneider by her side the truth instantly came upon me the reason for schneiders keen inquiries and my abrupt dismissal but i could not believe that mary was false to me i had only to look in her face white and rigid as marble to see that this proposed marriage was not with her consent  i fell back in the crowd as the procession entered the great room in which i was and hid my face in my hands i could not look upon her as the wife of anotherupon her so long loved and trulythe saint of my childhoodthe pride and hope of my youthtorn from me for ever and delivered over to the unholy arms of the murderer who stood before me  the door of st justs private apartment opened and he took his seat at the table of mayoralty just as schneider and his cortège arrived before it  schneider then said that he came in before the authorities of the republic to espouse the citoyenne marie ancel  is she a minor asked st just  she is a minor but her father is here to give her away  i am here said uncle edward coming eagerly forward and bowing edward ancel so please you citizen representative the worthy citizen schneider has done me the honor of marrying into my family  but my father has not told you the terms of the marriage said mary interrupting him in a loud clear voice  here schneider seized her hand and endeavored to prevent her from speaking her father turned pale and cried stop mary stop for heavens sake remember your poor old fathers danger  sir may i speak  let the young woman speak said st just if she have a desire to talk he did not suspect what would be the purport of her story  sir she said two days since the citizen schneider entered for the first time our house and you will fancy that it must be a love of very sudden growth which has brought either him or me before you today he had heard from a person who is now unhappily not present of my name and of the wealth which my family was said to possess and hence arose this mad design concerning me he came into our village with supreme power an executioner at his heels and the soldiery and authorities of the district entirely under his orders he threatened my father with death if he refused to give up his daughter and i who knew that there was no chance of escape except here before you consented to become his wife my father i know to be innocent for all his transactions with the state have passed through my hands citizen representative i demand to be freed from this marriage and i charge schneider as a traitor to the republic as a man who would have murdered an innocent citizen for the sake of private gain  during the delivery of this little speech uncle jacob had been sobbing and panting like a brokenwinded horse and when mary had done he rushed up to her and kissed her and held her tight in his arms bless thee my child he cried for having had the courage to speak the truth and shame thy old father and me who dared not say a word  the girl amazes me said schneider with a look of astonishment i never saw her it is true till yesterday but i used no force her father gave her to me with his free consent and she yielded as gladly speak edward ancel was it not so  it was indeed by my free consent said edward trembling  for shame brother cried old jacob sir it was by edwards free consent and my nieces but the guillotine was in the courtyard question schneiders famulus the man gregoire him who reads the sorrows of werter  gregoire stepped forward and looked hesitatingly at schneider as he said i know not what took place within doors but i was ordered to put up the scaffold without and i was told to get soldiers and let no one leave the house  citizen st just cried schneider you will not allow the testimony of a ruffian like this of a foolish girl and a mad expriest to weigh against the word of one who has done such service to the republic it is a base conspiracy to betray me the whole family is known to favor the interest of the émigrés  and therefore you would marry a member of the family and allow the others to escape you must make a better defence citizen schneider said st just sternly  here i came forward and said that three days since i had received an order to quit strasburg for paris immediately after a conversation with schneider in which i had asked him his aid in promoting my marriage with my cousin mary ancel that he had heard from me full accounts regarding her fathers wealth and that he had abruptly caused my dismissal in order to carry on his scheme against her  you are in the uniform of a regiment of this town who sent you from it said st just  i produced the order signed by himself and the despatches which schneider had sent me  the signature is mine but the despatches did not come from my office can you prove in any way your conversation with schneider  why said my sentimental friend gregoire for the matter of that i can answer that the lad was always talking about this young woman he told me the whole story himself and many a good laugh i had with citizen schneider as we talked about it  the charge against edward ancel must be examined into said st just the marriage cannot take place but if i had ratified it mary ancel what then would have been your course  mary felt for a moment in her bosom and saidhe would have died tonighti would have stabbed him with this dagger         this reply and indeed the whole of the story is      historical an account by charles nodier in the revue de      paris suggested it to the writer   the rain was beating down the streets and yet they were thronged all the world was hastening to the marketplace where the worthy gregoire was about to perform some of the pleasant duties of his office on this occasion it was not death that he was to inflict he was only to expose a criminal who was to be sent on afterwards to paris st just had ordered that schneider should stand for six hours in the public place of strasburg and then be sent on to the capital to be dealt with as the authorities might think fit  the people followed with execrations the villain to his place of punishment and gregoire grinned as he fixed up to the post the man whose orders he had obeyed so oftenwho had delivered over to disgrace and punishment so many who merited it not  schneider was left for several hours exposed to the mockery and insults of the mob he was then according to his sentence marched on to paris where it is probable that he would have escaped death but for his own fault he was left for some time in prison quite unnoticed perhaps forgotten day by day fresh victims were carried to the scaffold and yet the alsacian tribune remained alive at last by the mediation of one of his friends a long petition was presented to robespierre stating his services and his innocence and demanding his freedom the reply to this was an order for his instant execution the wretch died in the last days of robespierres reign his comrade st just followed him as you know but edward ancel had been released before this for the action of my brave mary had created a strong feeling in his favor  and mary said i  here a stout and smiling old lady entered the captains little room she was leaning on the arm of a militarylooking man of some forty years and followed by a number of noisy rosy children  this is mary ancel said the captain and i am captain pierre and yonder is the colonel my son and you see us here assembled in force for it is the fête of little jacob yonder whose brothers and sisters have all come from their schools to dance at his birthday     beatrice merger   beatrice merger whose name might figure at the head of one of mr colburns politest romancesso smooth and aristocratic does it soundis no heroine except of her own simple history she is not a fashionable french countess nor even a victim of the revolution  she is a stout sturdy girl of twoandtwenty with a face beaming with good nature and marked dreadfully by smallpox and a pair of black eyes which might have done some execution had they been placed in a smoother face beatrices station in society is not very exalted she is a servant of allwork she will dress your wife your dinner your children she does beefsteaks and plain work she makes beds blacks boots and waits at tablesuch at least were the offices which she performed in the fashionable establishment of the writer of this book perhaps her history may not inaptly occupy a few pages of it  my father died said beatrice about six years since and left my poor mother with little else but a small cottage and a strip of land and four children too young to work it was hard enough in my fathers time to supply so many little mouths with food and how was a poor widowed woman to provide for them now who had neither the strength nor the opportunity for labor  besides us to be sure there was my old aunt and she would have helped us but she could not for the old woman is bedridden so she did nothing but occupy our best room and grumble from morning till night heaven knows poor old soul that she had no great reason to be very happy for you know sir that it frets the temper to be sick and that it is worse still to be sick and hungry too  at that time in the country where we lived in picardy not very far from boulogne times were so bad that the best workman could hardly find employ and when he did he was happy if he could earn a matter of twelve sous a day mother work as she would could not gain more than six and it was a hard job out of this to put meat into six bellies and clothing on six backs old aunt bridget would scold as she got her portion of black bread and my little brothers used to cry if theirs did not come in time i too used to cry when i got my share for mother kept only a little little piece for herself and said that she had dined in the fieldsgod pardon her for the lie and bless her as i am sure he did for but for him no working man or woman could subsist upon such a wretched morsel as my dear mother took  i was a thin ragged barefooted girl then and sickly and weak for want of food but i think i felt mothers hunger more than my own and many and many a bitter night i lay awake crying and praying to god to give me means of working for myself and aiding her and he has indeed been good to me said pious beatrice for he has given me all this  well time rolled on and matters grew worse than ever winter came and was colder to us than any other winter for our clothes were thinner and more torn mother sometimes could find no work for the fields in which she labored were hidden under the snow so that when we wanted them most we had them leastwarmth work or food  i knew that do what i would mother would never let me leave her because i looked to my little brothers and my old cripple of an aunt but still bread was better for us than all my service and when i left them the six would have a slice more so i determined to bid goodby to nobody but to go away and look for work elsewhere one sunday when mother and the little ones were at church i went in to aunt bridget and said tell mother when she comes back that beatrice is gone i spoke quite stoutly as if i did not care about it  gone gone where said she you aint going to leave me alone you nasty thing you aint going to the village to dance you ragged barefooted slut youre all of a piece in this houseyour mother your brothers and you i know youve got meat in the kitchen and you only give me black bread and here the old lady began to scream as if her heart would break but we did not mind it we were so used to it  aunt said i im going and took this very opportunity because you were alone tell mother i am too old now to eat her bread and do no work for it i am going please god where work and bread can be found and so i kissed her she was so astonished that she could not move or speak and i walked away through the old room and the little garden god knows whither  i heard the old woman screaming after me but i did not stop nor turn round i dont think i could for my heart was very full and if i had gone back again i should never have had the courage to go away so i walked a long long way until night fell and i thought of poor mother coming home from mass and not finding me and little pierre shouting out in his clear voice for beatrice to bring him his supper i think i should like to have died that night and i thought i should too for when i was obliged to throw myself on the cold hard ground my feet were too torn and weary to bear me any further  just then the moon got up and do you know i felt a comfort in looking at it for i knew it was shining on our little cottage and it seemed like an old friends face a little way on as i saw by the moon was a village and i saw too that a man was coming towards me he must have heard me crying i suppose  was not god good to me this man was a farmer who had need of a girl in his house he made me tell him why i was alone and i told him the same story i have told you and he believed me and took me home i had walked six long leagues from our village that day asking everywhere for work in vain and here at bedtime i found a bed and a supper  here i lived very well for some months my master was very good and kind to me but unluckily too poor to give me any wages so that i could save nothing to send to my poor mother my mistress used to scold but i was used to that at home from aunt bridget and she beat me sometimes but i did not mind it for your hardy country girl is not like your tender town lasses who cry if a pin pricks them and give warning to their mistresses at the first hard word the only drawback to my comfort was that i had no news of my mother i could not write to her nor could she have read my letter if i had so there i was at only six leagues distance from home as far off as if i had been to paris or to merica  however in a few months i grew so listless and homesick that my mistress said she would keep me no longer and though i went away as poor as i came i was still too glad to go back to the old village again and see dear mother if it were but for a day i knew she would share her crust with me as she had done for so long a time before and hoped that now as i was taller and stronger i might find work more easily in the neighborhood  you may fancy what a fête it was when i came back though im sure we cried as much as if it had been a funeral mother got into a fit which frightened us all and as for aunt bridget she skreeled away for hours together and did not scold for two days at least little pierre offered me the whole of his supper poor little man his slice of bread was no bigger than before i went away  well i got a little work here and a little there but still i was a burden at home rather than a breadwinner and at the closingin of the winter was very glad to hear of a place at two leagues distance where work they said was to be had off i set one morning to find it but missed my way somehow until it was nighttime before i arrived nighttime and snow again it seemed as if all my journeys were to be made in this bitter weather  when i came to the farmers door his house was shut up and his people all abed i knocked for a long while in vain at last he made his appearance at a window up stairs and seemed so frightened and looked so angry that i suppose he took me for a thief i told him how i had come for work who comes for work at such an hour said he go home you impudent baggage and do not disturb honest people out of their sleep he banged the window to and so i was left alone to shift for myself as i might there was no shed no cowhouse where i could find a bed so i got under a cart on some straw it was no very warm berth i could not sleep for the cold and the hours passed so slowly that it seemed as if i had been there a week instead of a night but still it was not so bad as the first night when i left home and when the good farmer found me  in the morning before it was light the farmers people came out and saw me crouching under the cart they told me to get up but i was so cold that i could not at last the man himself came and recognized me as the girl who had disturbed him the night before when he heard my name and the purpose for which i came this good man took me into the house and put me into one of the beds out of which his sons had just got and if i was cold before you may be sure i was warm and comfortable now such a bed as this i had never slept in nor ever did i have such good milksoup as he gave me out of his own breakfast well he agreed to hire me and what do you think he gave mesix sous a day and let me sleep in the cowhouse besides you may fancy how happy i was now at the prospect of earning so much money  there was an old woman among the laborers who used to sell us soup i got a cupful every day for a halfpenny with a bit of bread in it and might eat as much beetroot besides as i liked not a very wholesome meal to be sure but god took care that it should not disagree with me  so every saturday when work was over i had thirty sous to carry home to mother and tired though i was i walked merrily the two leagues to our village to see her again on the road there was a great wood to pass through and this frightened me for if a thief should come and rob me of my whole weeks earnings what could a poor lone girl do to help herself but i found a remedy for this too and no thieves ever came near me i used to begin saying my prayers as i entered the forest and never stopped until i was safe at home and safe i always arrived with my thirty sons in my pocket ah you may be sure sunday was a merry day for us all   this is the whole of beatrices history which is worthy of publication the rest of it only relates to her arrival in paris and the various masters and mistresses whom she there had the honor to serve as soon as she enters the capital the romance disappears and the poor girls sufferings and privations luckily vanish with it beatrice has got now warm gowns and stout shoes and plenty of good food she has had her little brother from picardy clothed fed and educated him that young gentleman is now a carpenter and an honor to his profession madame merger is in easy circumstances and receives yearly fifty francs from her daughter to crown all mademoiselle beatrice herself is a funded proprietor and consulted the writer of this biography as to the best method of laying out a capital of two hundred francs which is the present amount of her fortune  god bless her she is richer than his grace the duke of devonshire and i dare say has in her humble walk been more virtuous and more happy than all the dukes in the realm  it is indeed for the benefit of dukes and such great people who i make no doubt have long since ordered copies of these sketches that poor little beatrices story has been indited certain it is that the young woman would never have been immortalized in this way but for the good which her betters may derive from her example if your ladyship will but reflect a little after boasting of the sums which you spend in charity the beef and blankets which you dole out at christmas the poonahpainting which you execute for fancy fairs the long long sermons which you listen to at st georges the whole year throughyour ladyship i say will allow that although perfectly meritorious in your line as a patroness of the church of england of almacks and of the lyingin asylum yours is but a paltry sphere of virtue a pitiful attempt at benevolence and that this honest servantgirl puts you to shame and you my lord bishop do you out of your six sous a day give away five to support your flock and family would you drop a single coachhorse i do not say a dinner for such a notion is monstrous in one of your lordships degree to feed any one of the starving children of your lordships motherthe church  i pause for a reply his lordship took too much turtle and cold punch for dinner yesterday and cannot speak just now but we have by this ingenious question silenced him altogether let the world wag as it will and poor christians and curates starve as they may my lords footmen must have their new liveries and his horses their four feeds a day   when we recollect his speech about the catholicswhen we remember his last charity sermonbut i say nothing here is a poor benighted superstitious creature worshipping images without a rag to her tail who has as much faith and humility and charity as all the reverend bench   this angel is without a place and for this reason besides the pleasure of composing the above slap at episcopacyi have indited her history if the bishop is going to paris and wants a good honest maidofallwork he can have her i have no doubt or if he chooses to give a few pounds to her mother they can be sent to mr titmarsh at the publishers  here is miss mergers last letter and autograph the note was evidently composed by an ecrivain public   madameayant

caricatures and lithography in paris   fifty years ago there lived at munich a poor fellow by name aloys senefelder who was in so little repute as an author and artist that printers and engravers refused to publish his works at their own charges and so set him upon some plan for doing without their aid in the first place aloys invented a certain kind of ink which would resist the action of the acid that is usually employed by engravers and with this he made his experiments upon copperplates as long as he could afford to purchase them he found that to write upon the plates backwards after the manner of engravers required much skill and many trials and he thought that were he to practise upon any other polished surfacea smooth stone for instance the least costly article imaginablehe might spare the expense of the copper until he had sufficient skill to use it  one day it is said that aloys was called upon to writerather a humble composition for an author and artista washingbill he had no paper at hand and so he wrote out the bill with some of his newlyinvented ink upon one of his kelheim stones some time afterwards he thought he would try and take an impression of his washingbill he did and succeeded such is the story which the reader most likely knows very well and having alluded to the origin of the art we shall not follow the stream through its windings and enlargement after it issued from the little parent rock or fill our pages with the rest of the pedigree senefelder invented lithography his invention has not made so much noise and larum in the world as some others which have an origin quite as humble and unromantic but it is one to which we owe no small profit and a great deal of pleasure and as such we are bound to speak of it with all gratitude and respect the schoolmaster who is now abroad has taught us in our youth how the cultivation of art emollit mores nec sinit esseit is needless to finish the quotation and lithography has been to our thinking the very best ally that art ever had the best friend of the artist allowing him to produce rapidly multiplied and authentic copies of his own works without trusting to the tedious and expensive assistance of the engraver and the best friend to the people likewise who have means of purchasing these cheap and beautiful productions and thus having their ideas mollified and their manners feros no more  with ourselves among whom money is plenty enterprise so great and everything matter of commercial speculation lithography has not been so much practised as wood or steel engraving which by the aid of great original capital and spread of sale are able more than to compete with the art of drawing on stone the two former may be called art done by machinery we confess to a prejudice in favor of the honest work of hand in matters of art and prefer the rough workmanship of the painter to the smooth copies of his performances which are produced for the most part on the woodblock or the steelplate  the theory will possibly be objected to by many of our readers the best proof in its favor we think is that the state of art amongst the people in france and germany where publishers are not so wealthy or enterprising as with us and where lithography is more practised is infinitely higher than in england and the appreciation more correct as draughtsmen the french and german painters are incomparably superior to our own and with art as with any other commodity the demand will be found pretty equal to the supply with us the general demand is for neatness prettiness and what is called effect in pictures and these can be rendered completely nay improved by the engravers conventional manner of copying the artists performances but to copy fine expression and fine drawing the engraver himself must be a fine artist and let anybody examine the host of picturebooks which appear every christmas and say whether for the most part painters or engravers possess any artistic merit we boast nevertheless of some of the best engravers and painters in europe here again the supply is accounted for by the demand our highest class is richer than any other aristocracy quite as well instructed and can judge and pay for fine pictures and engravings but these costly productions are for the few and not for the many who have not yet certainly arrived at properly appreciating fine art        these countries are to be sure inundated with the      productions of our market in the shape of byron beauties      reprints from the keepsakes books of beauty and such      trash but these are only of late years and their original      schools of art are still flourishing  take the standard album for instancethat unfortunate collection of deformed zuleikas and medoras from the byron beauties the flowers gems souvenirs caskets of loveliness beauty as they way be called glaring caricatures of flowers singly in groups in flowerpots or with hideous deformed little cupids sporting among them of what are called mezzotinto pencildrawings poonahpaintings and what not the album is to be found invariably upon the round rosewood brassinlaid drawingroom table of the middle classes and with a couple of annuals besides which flank it on the same table represents the art of the house perhaps there is a portrait of the master of the house in the diningroom grimglancing from above the mantelpiece and of the mistress over the piano up stairs add to these some odious miniatures of the sons and daughters on each side of the chimneyglass and here commonly we appeal to the reader if this is an overcharged picture the collection ends the family goes to the exhibition once a year to the national gallery once in ten years to the former place they have an inducement to go there are their own portraits or the portraits of their friends or the portraits of public characters and you will see them infallibly wondering over no 2645 in the catalogue representing the portrait of a lady or of the first mayor of little pedlington since the passing of the reform bill or else bustling and squeezing among the miniatures where lies the chief attraction of the gallery england has produced owing to the effects of this class of admirers of art two admirable and five hundred very clever portrait painters how many artists let the reader count upon his five fingers and see if living at the present moment he can name one for each  if from this examination of our own worthy middle classes we look to the same class in france what a difference do we find humble cafés in country towns have their walls covered with pleasing picture papers representing les gloires de larmée française the seasons the four quarters of the world cupid and psyche or some other allegory landscape or history rudely painted as papers for walls usually are but the figures are all tolerably well drawn and the common taste which has caused a demand for such things is undeniable in paris the manner in which the cafés and houses of the restaurateurs are ornamented is of course a thousand times richer and nothing can be more beautiful or more exquisitely finished and correct than the designs which adorn many of them we are not prepared to say what sums were expended upon the painting of vérys or véfours of the salle musard or of numberless other places of public resort in the capital there is many a shopkeeper whose sign is a very tolerable picture and often have we stopped to admire the reader will give us credit for having remained outside the excellent workmanship of the grapes and vineleaves over the door of some very humble dirty inodorous shop of a marchand de vin  these however serve only to educate the public taste and are ornaments for the most part much too costly for the people but the same love of ornament which is shown in their public places of resort appears in their houses likewise and every one of our readers who has lived in paris in any lodging magnificent or humble with any family however poor may bear witness how profusely the walls of his smart salon in the english quarter or of his little room au sixième in the pays latin has been decorated with prints of all kinds in the first probably with bad engravings on copper from the bad and tawdry pictures of the artists of the time of the empire in the latter with gay caricatures of granville or monnier military pieces such as are dashed off by raffet charlet vernet one can hardly say which of the three designers has the greatest merit or the most vigorous hand or clever pictures from the crayon of the deverias the admirable roqueplan or decamp we have named here we believe the principal lithographic artists in paris and thoseas doubtless there are manyof our readers who have looked over monsieur auberts portfolios or gazed at that famous caricatureshop window in the rue de coq or are even acquainted with the exterior of monsieur delaportes little emporium in the burlington arcade need not be told how excellent the productions of all these artists are in their genre we get in these engravings the loisirs of men of genius not the finikin performances of labored mediocrity as with us all these artists are good painters as well as good designers a design from them is worth a whole gross of books of beauty and if we might raise a humble supplication to the artists in our own country of similar meritto such men as leslie maclise herbert cattermole and othersit would be that they should after the example of their french brethren and of the english landscape painters take chalk in hand produce their own copies of their own sketches and never more draw a single forsaken one rejected one dejected one at the entreaty of any publisher or for the pages of any book of beauty royalty or loveliness whatever  can there be a more pleasing walk in the whole world than a stroll through the gallery of the louvre on a fêteday not to look so much at the pictures as at the lookerson thousands of the poorer classes are there mechanics in their sunday clothes smiling grisettes smart dapper soldiers of the line with bronzed wondering faces marching together in little companies of six or seven and stopping every now and then at napoleon or leonidas as they appear in proper vulgar heroics in the pictures of david or gros the taste of these people will hardly be approved by the connoisseur but they have a taste for art can the same be said of our lower classes who if they are inclined to be sociable and amused in their holidays have no place of resort but the taproom or teagarden and no food for conversation except such as can be built upon the politics or the police reports of the last sunday paper so much has church and state puritanism done for usso well has it succeeded in materializing and binding down to the earth the imagination of men for which god has made another world which certain statesmen take but too little into accountthat fair and beautiful world of heart in which there can be nothing selfish or sordid of which dulness has forgotten the existence and which bigotry has endeavored to shut out from sight        on a banni les démons et les fées       le raisonner tristement saccrédite       on court helas après la vérité       ah croyez moi lerreur a son mérite   we are not putting in a plea here for demons and fairies as voltaire does in the above exquisite lines nor about to expatiate on the beauties of error for it has none but the clank of steamengines and the shouts of politicians and the struggle for gain or bread and the loud denunciations of stupid bigots have wellnigh smothered poor fancy among us we boast of our science and vaunt our superior morality does the latter exist in spite of all the forms which our policy has invented to secure itin spite of all the preachers all the meetinghouses and all the legislative enactmentsif any person will take upon himself the painful labor of purchasing and perusing some of the cheap periodical prints which form the peoples library of amusement and contain what may be presumed to be their standard in matters of imagination and fancy he will see how false the claim is that we bring forward of superior morality the aristocracy who are so eager to maintain were of course not the last to feel annoyance of the legislative restrictions on the sabbath and eagerly seized upon that happy invention for dissipating the gloom and ennui ordered by act of parliament to prevail on that daythe sunday paper it might be read in a clubroom where the poor could not see how their betters ordained one thing for the vulgar and another for themselves or in an easychair in the study whither my lord retires every sunday for his devotions it dealt in private scandal and ribaldry only the more piquant for its pretty flimsy veil of doubleentendre it was a fortune to the publisher and it became a necessary to the reader which he could not do without any more than without his snuffbox his operabox or his chasse after coffee the delightful novelty could not for any time be kept exclusively for the haut ton and from my lord it descended to his valet or tradesmen and from grosvenor square it spread all the town through so that now the lower classes have their scandal and ribaldry organs as well as their betters the rogues they will imitate them and as their tastes are somewhat coarser than my lords and their numbers a thousand to one why of course the prints have increased and the profligacy has been diffused in a ratio exactly proportionable to the demand until the town is infested with such a number of monstrous publications of the kind as would have put abbé dubois to the blush or made louis xv cry shame talk of english moralitythe worst licentiousness in the worst period of the french monarchy scarcely equalled the wickedness of this sabbathkeeping country of ours  the reader will be glad at last to come to the conclusion that we would fain draw from all these descriptionswhy does this immorality exist because the people must be amused and have not been taught how because the upper classes frightened by stupid cant or absorbed in material wants have not as yet learned the refinement which only the cultivation of art can give and when their intellects are uneducated and their tastes are coarse the tastes and amusements of classes still more ignorant must be coarse and vicious likewise in an increased proportion  such discussions and violent attacks upon high and low sabbath bills politicians and what not may appear perhaps out of place in a few pages which purport only to give an account of some french drawings all we would urge is that in france these prints are made because they are liked and appreciated with us they are not made because they are not liked and appreciated and the more is the pity nothing merely intellectual will be popular among us we do not love beauty for beautys sake as germans or wit for wits sake as the french for abstract art we have no appreciation we admire h bs caricatures because they are the caricatures of wellknown political characters not because they are witty and boz because he writes us good palpable stories if we may use such a word to a story and madame vestris because she has the most beautifully shaped legsthe art of the designer the writer the actress each admirable in its way is a very minor consideration each might have ten times the wit and would be quite unsuccessful without their substantial points of popularity  in france such matters are far better managed and the love of art is a thousand times more keen and from this feeling surely how much superiority is there in french society over our own how much better is social happiness understood how much more manly equality is there between frenchman and frenchman than between rich and poor in our own country with all our superior wealth instruction and political freedom there is amongst the humblest a gayety cheerfulness politeness and sobriety to which in england no class can show a parallel and these be it remembered are not only qualities for holidays but for workingdays too and add to the enjoyment of human life as much as good clothes good beef or good wages if to our freedom we could but add a little of their happinessit is one after all of the cheapest commodities in the world and in the power of every man with means of gaining decent bread who has the will or the skill to use it  we are not going to trace the history of the rise and progress of art in france our business at present is only to speak of one branch of art in that countrylithographic designs and those chiefly of a humorous character a history of french caricature was published in paris two or three years back illustrated by numerous copies of designs from the time of henry iii to our own day we can only speak of this work from memory having been unable in london to procure the sight of a copy but our impression at the time we saw the collection was as unfavorable as could possibly be nothing could be more meagre than the wit or poorer than the execution of the whole set of drawings under the empire art as may be imagined was at a very low ebb and aping the government of the day and catering to the national taste and vanity it was a kind of tawdry caricature of the sublime of which the pictures of david and girodet and almost the entire collection now at the luxembourg palace will give pretty fair examples swollen distorted unnatural the painting was something like the politics of those days with force in it nevertheless and something of grandeur that will exist in spite of taste and is born of energetic will a man disposed to write comparisons of characters might for instance find some striking analogies between mountebank murat with his irresistible bravery and horsemanship who was a kind of mixture of dugueselin and ducrow and mountebank david a fierce powerful painter and genius whose idea of beauty and sublimity seemed to have been gained from the bloody melodramas on the boulevard both however were great in their way and were worshipped as gods in those heathen times of false belief and heroworship  as for poor caricature and freedom of the press they like the rightful princess in a fairy tale with the merry fantastic dwarf her attendant were entirely in the power of the giant who ruled the land the princess press was so closely watched and guarded with some little show nevertheless of respect for her rank that she dared not utter a word of her own thoughts and for poor caricature he was gagged and put out of the way altogether imprisoned as completely as ever asmodeus was in his phial  how the press and her attendant fared in succeeding reigns is well known their condition was little bettered by the downfall of napoleon with the accession of charles x they were more oppressed even than beforemore than they could bear for so hard were they pressed that as one has seen when sailors are working a capstan back of a sudden the bars flew knocking to the earth the men who were endeavoring to work them the revolution came and up sprung caricature in france all sorts of fierce epigrams were discharged at the flying monarch and speedily were prepared too for the new one  about this time there lived at paris if our information be correct a certain m philipon an indifferent artist painting was his profession a tolerable designer and an admirable wit m philipon designed many caricatures himself married the sister of an eminent publisher of prints m aubert and the two gathering about them a body of wits and artists like themselves set up journals of their ownla caricature first published once a week and the charivari afterwards a daily paper in which a design also appears daily  at first the caricatures inserted in the charivari were chiefly political and a most curious contest speedily commenced between the state and m philipons little army in the galérie vérododat half a dozen poor artists on the one side and his majesty louis philippe his august family and the numberless placemen and supporters of the monarchy on the other it was something like thersites girding at ajax and piercing through the folds of the clypei septemplicis with the poisonous shafts of his scorn our french thersites was not always an honest opponent it must be confessed and many an attack was made upon the gigantic enemy which was cowardly false and malignant but to see the monster writhing under the effects of the arrowto see his uncouth fury in return and the blind blows that he dealt at his diminutive opponentnot one of these told in a hundred when they did tell it may be imagined that they were fierce enough in all conscience and served almost to annihilate the adversary  to speak more plainly and to drop the metaphor of giant and dwarf the king of the french suffered so much his ministers were so mercilessly ridiculed his family and his own remarkable figure drawn with such odious and grotesque resemblance in fanciful attitudes circumstances and disguises so ludicrously mean and often so appropriate that the king was obliged to descend into the lists and battle his ridiculous enemy in form prosecutions seizures fines regiments of furious legal officials were first brought into play against poor m philipon and his little dauntless troop of malicious artists some few were bribed out of his ranks and if they did not like gilray in england turn their weapons upon their old friends at least laid down their arms and would fight no more the bribes fines indictments and loudtongued avocats du roi made no impression philipon repaired the defeat of a fine by some fresh and furious attack upon his great enemy if his epigrams were more covert they were no less bitter if he was beaten a dozen times before a jury he had eighty or ninety victories to show in the same field of battle and every victory and every defeat brought him new sympathy every one who was at paris a few years since must recollect the famous poire which was chalked upon all the walls of the city and which bore so ludicrous a resemblance to louis philippe the poire became an object of prosecution and m philipon appeared before a jury to answer for the crime of inciting to contempt against the kings person by giving such a ludicrous version of his face philipon for defence produced a sheet of paper and drew a poire a real large burgundy pear in the lower parts round and capacious narrower near the stalk and crowned with two or three careless leaves there was no treason in that he said to the jury could any one object to such a harmless botanical representation then he drew a second pear exactly like the former except that one or two lines were scrawled in the midst of it which bore somehow a ludicrous resemblance to the eyes nose and mouth of a celebrated personage and lastly he drew the exact portrait of louis philippe the wellknown toupet the ample whiskers and jowl were there neither extenuated nor set down in malice can i help it gentlemen of the jury then said he if his majestys face is like a pear say yourselves respectable citizens is it or is it not like a pear such eloquence could not fail of its effect the artist was acquitted and la poire is immortal  at last came the famous september laws the freedom of the press which from august 1830 was to be désormais une vérité was calmly strangled by the monarch who had gained his crown for his supposed championship of it by his ministers some of whom had been stout republicans on paper but a few years before and by the chamber which such is the blessed constitution of french elections will generally vote unvote revote in any way the government wishes with a wondrous union and happy forgetfulness of principle monarch ministers and deputies issued the restriction laws the press was sent to prison as for the poor dear caricature it was fairly murdered no more political satires appear now and through the eye correct the heart no more poires ripen on the walls of the metropolis philipons political occupation is gone  but there is always food for satire and the french caricaturists being no longer allowed to hold up to ridicule and reprobation the king and the deputies have found no lack of subjects for the pencil in the ridicules and rascalities of common life we have said that public decency is greater amongst the french than amongst us which to some of our readers may appear paradoxical but we shall not attempt to argue that in private roguery our neighbors are not our equals the procès of gisquet which has appeared lately in the papers shows how deep the demoralization must be and how a government based itself on dishonesty a tyranny that is under the title and fiction of a democracy must practise and admit corruption in its own and in its agents dealings with the nation accordingly of cheating contracts of ministers dabbling with the funds or extracting underhand profits for the granting of unjust privileges and monopoliesof grasping envious police restrictions which destroy the freedom and with it the integrity of commercethose who like to examine such details may find plenty in french history the whole french finance system has been a swindle from the days of luvois or law down to the present time the government swindles the public and the small traders swindle their customers on the authority and example of the superior powers hence the art of roguery under such high patronage maintains in france a noble front of impudence and a fine audacious openness which it does not wear in our country  among the various characters of roguery which the french satirists have amused themselves by depicting there is one of which the greatness using the word in the sense which mr jonathan wild gave to it so far exceeds that of all others embracing as it does all in turn that it has come to be considered the type of roguery in general and now just as all the political squibs were made to come of old from the lips of pasquin all the reflections on the prevailing cant knavery quackery humbug are put into the mouth of monsieur robert macaire  a play was written some twenty years since called the auberge des adrets in which the characters of two robbers escaped from the galleys were introducedrobert macaire the clever rogue above mentioned and bertrand the stupid rogue his friend accomplice butt and scapegoat on all occasions of danger it is needless to describe the playa witless performance enough of which the joke was macaires exaggerated style of conversation a farrago of all sorts of highflown sentiments such as the french love to indulge incontrasted with his actions which were philosophically unscrupulous and his appearance which was most picturesquely sordid the play had been acted we believe and forgotten when a very clever actor m frederick lemaitre took upon himself the performance of the character of robert macaire and looked spoke and acted it to such admirable perfection that the whole town rung with applauses of the performance and the caricaturists delighted to copy his singular figure and costume m robert macaire appears in a most picturesque green coat with a variety of rents and patches a pair of crimson pantaloons ornamented in the same way enormous whiskers and ringlets an enormous stock and shirtfrill as dirty and ragged as stock and shirtfrill can be the relic of a hat very gayly cocked over one eye and a patch to take away somewhat from the brightness of the otherthese are the principal pièces of his costumea snuffbox like a creaking warmingpan a handkerchief hanging together by a miracle and a switch of about the thickness of a mans thigh formed the ornaments of this exquisite personage he is a compound of fieldings blueskin and goldsmiths beau tibbs he has the dirt and dandyism of the one with the ferocity of the other sometimes he is made to swindle but where he can get a shilling more m macaire will murder without scruple he performs one and the other act or any in the scale between them with a similar bland imperturbability and accompanies his actions with such philosophical remarks as may be expected from a person of his talents his energies his amiable life and character  bertrand is the simple recipient of macaires jokes and makes vicarious atonement for his crimes acting in fact the part which pantaloon performs in the pantomime who is entirely under the fatal influence of clown he is quite as much a rogue as that gentleman but he has not his genius and courage so in pantomimes it may doubtless have been remarked by the reader clown always leaps first pantaloon following after more clumsily and timidly than his bold and accomplished friend and guide whatever blows are destined for clown fall by some means of illluck upon the pate of pantaloon whenever the clown robs the stolen articles are sure to be found in his companions pocket and thus exactly robert macaire and his companion bertrand are made to go through the world both swindlers but the one more accomplished than the other both robbing all the world and robert robbing his friend and in the event of danger leaving him faithfully in the lurch there is in the two characters some grotesque good for the spectatora kind of beggars opera moral  ever since robert with his dandified rags and airs his cane and snuffbox and bertrand with torn surtout and allabsorbing pocket have appeared on the stage they have been popular with the parisians and with these two types of clever and stupid knavery m philipon and his companion daumier have created a world of pleasant satire upon all the prevailing abuses of the day  almost the first figure that these audacious caricaturists dared to depict was a political one in macaires red breeches and tattered coat appeared no less a personage than the king himselfthe old poirein a country of humbugs and swindlers the facile princeps fit to govern as he is deeper than all the rogues in his dominions bertrand was opposite to him and having listened with delight and reverence to some tale of knavery truly royal was exclaiming with a look and voice expressive of the most intense admiration ah vieux blageur vathe word blague is untranslatableit means french humbug as distinct from all other and only those who know the value of an epigram in france an epigram so wonderfully just a little word so curiously comprehensive can fancy the kind of rage and rapture with which it was received it was a blow that shook the whole dynasty thersites had there given such a wound to ajax as hector in arms could scarcely have inflicted a blow sufficient almost to create the madness to which the fabulous hero of homer and ovid fell a prey  not long however was french caricature allowed to attack personages so illustrious the september laws came and henceforth no more epigrams were launched against politics but the caricaturists were compelled to confine their satire to subjects and characters that had nothing to do with the state the duke of orleans was no longer to figure in lithography as the fantastic prince rosolin no longer were multitudes in chalk to shelter under the enormous shadow of m dargouts nose marshal lobans squirt was hung up in peace and m thierss pigmy figure and round spectacled face were no more to appear in print robert macaire was driven out of the chambers and the palacehis remarks were a great deal too appropriate and too severe for the ears of the great men who congregated in those places        almost all the principal public men had been most      ludicrously caricatured in the charivari those mentioned      above were usually depicted with the distinctive attributes      mentioned by us  the chambers and the palace were shut to him but the rogue driven out of his rogues paradise saw that the world was all before him where to choose and found no lack of opportunities for exercising his wit there was the bar with its roguish practitioners rascally attorneys stupid juries and forsworn judges there was the bourse with all its gambling swindling and hoaxing its cheats and its dupes the medical profession and the quacks who ruled it alternately the stage and the cant that was prevalent there the fashion and its thousand follies and extravagances robert macaire had all these to exploiter of all the empire through all the ranks professions the lies crimes and absurdities of men he may make sport at will of all except of a certain class like bluebeards wife he may see everything but is bidden to beware of the blue chamber robert is more wise than bluebeards wife and knows that it would cost him his head to enter it robert therefore keeps aloof for the moment would there be any use in his martyrdom bluebeard cannot live for ever perhaps even now those are on their way one sees a suspicious cloud of dust or two that are to destroy him  in the meantime robert and his friend have been furnishing the designs that we have before us and of which perhaps the reader will be edified by a brief description we are not to be sure to judge of the french nation by m macaire any more than we are to judge of our own national morals in the last century by such a book as the beggars opera but upon the morals and the national manners works of satire afford a world of light that one would in vain look for in regular books of history doctor smollett would have blushed to devote any considerable portion of his pages to a discussion of the acts and character of mr jonathan wild such a figure being hardly admissible among the dignified personages who usually push all others out from the possession of the historical page but a chapter of that gentlemans memoirs as they are recorded in that exemplary recueilthe newgate calendar nay a canto of the great comic epic involving many fables and containing much exaggeration but still having the seeds of truth which the satirical poet of those days wrote in celebration of himwe mean fieldings history of jonathan wild the greatdoes seem to us to give a more curious picture of the manners of those times than any recognized history of them at the close of his history of george ii smollett condescends to give a short chapter on literature and manners he speaks of glovers leonidas cibbers careless husband the poems of mason gray the two whiteheads the nervous style extensive erudition and superior sense of a corke the delicate taste the polished muse and tender feeling of a lyttelton king he says shone unrivalled in roman eloquence the female sex distinguished themselves by their taste and ingenuity miss carter rivalled the celebrated dacier in learning and critical knowledge mrs lennox signalized herself by many successful efforts of genius both in poetry and prose and miss reid excelled the celebrated rosalba in portraitpainting both in miniature and at large in oil as well as in crayons the genius of cervantes was transferred into the novels of fielding who painted the characters and ridiculed the follies of life with equal strength humor and propriety the field of history and biography was cultivated by many writers of ability among whom we distinguish the copious guthrie the circumstantial ralph the laborious carte the learned and elegant robertson and above all the ingenious penetrating and comprehensive hume c c we will quote no more of the passage could a man in the best humor sit down to write a graver satire who cares for the tender muse of lyttelton who knows the signal efforts of mrs lennoxs genius who has seen the admirable performances in miniature and at large in oil as well as in crayons of miss reid laborious carte and circumstantial ralph and copious guthrie where are they their works and their reputation mrs lennoxs name is just as clean wiped out of the list of worthies as if she had never been born and miss reid though she was once actual flesh and blood rival in miniature and at large of the celebrated rosalba she is as if she had never been at all her little farthing rushlight of a soul and reputation having burnt out and left neither wick nor tallow death too has overtaken copious guthrie and circumstantial ralph only a few know whereabouts is the grave where lies laborious carte and yet o wondrous power of genius fieldings men and women are alive though historys are not the progenitors of circumstantial ralph sent forth after much labor and pains of making educating feeding clothing a real man child a great palpable mass of flesh bones and blood we say nothing about the spirit which was to move through the world ponderous writing histories and to die having achieved the title of circumstantial ralph and lo without any of the trouble that the parents of ralph had undergone alone perhaps in a watch or spunginghouse fuddled most likely in the blandest easiest and most goodhumored way in the world henry fielding makes a number of men and women on so many sheets of paper not only more amusing than ralph or miss reid but more like flesh and blood and more alive now than they is not amelia preparing her husbands little supper is not miss snapp chastely preventing the crime of mr firebrand is not parson adams in the midst of his family and mr wild taking his last bowl of punch with the newgate ordinary is not every one of them a real substantial havebeen personage nowmore real than reid or ralph for our parts we will not take upon ourselves to say that they do not exist somewhere else that the actions attributed to them have not really taken place certain we are that they are more worthy of credence than ralph who may or may not have been circumstantial who may or may not even have existed a point unworthy of disputation as for miss reid we will take an affidavit that neither in miniature nor at large did she excel the celebrated rosalba and with regard to mrs lennox we consider her to be a mere figment like narcissa miss tabitha bramble or any hero or heroine depicted by the historian of peregrine pickle  in like manner after viewing nearly ninety portraits of robert macaire and his friend bertrand all strongly resembling each other we are inclined to believe in them as historical personages and to canvass gravely the circumstances of their lives why should we not have we not their portraits are not they sufficient proofs if not we must discredit napoleon as archbishop whately teaches for about his figure and himself we have no more authentic testimony  let the reality of m robert macaire and his friend m bertrand be granted if but to gratify our own fondness for those exquisite characters we find the worthy pair in the french capital mingling with all grades of its society pars magna in the intrigues pleasures perplexities rogueries speculations which are carried on in paris as in our own chief city for it need not be said that roguery is of no country nor clime but finds greek text omitted is a citizen of all countries where the quarters are good among our merry neighbors it finds itself very much at its ease  not being endowed then with patrimonial wealth but compelled to exercise their genius to obtain distinction or even subsistence we see messrs bertrand and macaire by turns adopting all trades and professions and exercising each with their own peculiar ingenuity as public men we have spoken already of their appearance in one or two important characters and stated that the government grew fairly jealous of them excluding them from office as the whigs did lord brougham as private individuals they are made to distinguish themselves as the founders of journals sociétés en commandite companies of which the members are irresponsible beyond the amount of their shares and all sorts of commercial speculations requiring intelligence and honesty on the part of the directors confidence and liberal disbursements from the shareholders  these are among the french so numerous and have been of late years in the shape of newspaper companies bitumen companies galvanizediron companies railroad companies c pursued with such a blind furor and lust of gain by that easily excited and imaginative people that as may be imagined the satirist has found plenty of occasion for remark and m macaire and his friend innumerable opportunities for exercising their talents  we know nothing of m emile de girardin except that in a duel he shot the best man in france armaud carrel and in girardins favor it must be said that he had no other alternative but was right in provoking the duel seeing that the whole republican party had vowed his destruction and that he fought and killed their champion as it were we know nothing of m girardins private character but as far as we can judge from the french public prints he seems to be the most speculative of speculators and of course a fair butt for the malice of the caricaturists his one great crime in the eyes of the french republicans and republican newspaper proprietors was that girardin set up a journal as he called it franchement monarchiquea journal in the pay of the monarchy that isand a journal that cost only forty francs by the year the national costs twice as much the charivari itself costs half as much again and though all newspapers of all parties concurred in snubbing poor m girardin and his journal the republican prints were by far the most bitter against him thundering daily accusations and personalities whether the abuse was well or ill founded we know not hence arose the duel with carrel after the termination of which girardin put by his pistol and vowed very properly to assist in the shedding of no more blood girardin had been the originator of numerous other speculations besides the journal the capital of these like that of the journal was raised by shares and the shareholders by some fatality have found themselves wofully in the lurch while girardin carries on the war gayly is or was a member of the chamber of deputies has money goes to court and possesses a certain kind of reputation he invented we believe the institution agronome de coetbo the physionotype the journal des connoissances utiles the pantheon littéraire and the system of primespremiums that isto be given by lottery to certain subscribers in these institutions could robert macaire see such things going on and have no hand in them         it is not necessary to enter into descriptions of these      various inventions   accordingly messrs macaire and bertrand are made the heroes of many speculations of the kind in almost the first print of our collection robert discourses to bertrand of his projects bertrand says the disinterested admirer of talent and enterprise jadore lindustrie si tu veux nous créons une banque mais là une vraie banque capital cent millions de millions cent milliards de milliards dactions nous enfonçons la banque de france les banquiers les banquistes nous enfonçons tout le monde oui says bertrand very calm and stupid mais les gendarmes que tu es bête bertrand estce quon arrête un millionaire such is the key to m macaires philosophy and a wise creed too as times go  acting on these principles robert appears soon after he has not created a bank but a journal he sits in a chair of state and discourses to a shareholder bertrand calm and stupid as before stands humbly behind sir says the editor of la blague journal quotidienne our profits arise from a new combination the journal costs twenty francs we sell it for twentythree and a half a million subscribers make three millions and a half of profits there are my figures contradict me by figures or i will bring an action for libel the reader may fancy the scene takes place in england where many such a swindling prospectus has obtained credit ere now at plate 33 robert is still a journalist he brings to the editor of a paper an article of his composition a violent attack on a law my dear m macaire says the editor this must be changed we must praise this law bon bon says our versatile macaire je vais retoucher ça et je vous fais en faveur de la loi un article mousseux  can such things be is it possible that french journalists can so forget themselves the rogues they should come to england and learn consistency the honesty of the press in england is like the air we breathe without it we die no no in france the satire may do very well but for england it is too monstrous call the press stupid call it vulgar call it violentbut honest it is who ever heard of a journal changing its politics o tempora o mores as robert macaire says this would be carrying the joke too far  when he has done with newspapers robert macaire begins to distinguish himself on change as a creator of companies a vender of shares or a dabbler in foreign stock buy my coalmine shares shouts robert gold mines silver mines diamond mines sont de la potbouille de la ratatouille en comparaison de ma houille look says he on another occasion to a very timid opencountenanced client you have a property to sell i have found the very man a rich capitalist a fellow whose bills are better than banknotes his client sells the bills are taken in payment and signed by that respectable capitalist monsieur de saint bertrand at plate 81 we find him inditing a circular letter to all the world running thus siri regret to say that your application for shares in the consolidated european incombustible blacking association cannot be complied with as all the shares of the c e i b a were disposed of on the day they were issued i have nevertheless registered your name and in case a second series should be put forth i shall have the honor of immediately giving you notice i am sir yours c the director robert macaireprint 300000 of these he says to bertrand and poison all france with them as usual the stupid bertrand remonstratesbut we have not sold a single share you have not a penny in your pocket andbertrand you are an ass do as i bid you        we have given a description of a genteel macaire in the      account of m de bernards novels  will this satire apply anywhere in england have we any consolidated european blacking associations amongst us have we penniless directors issuing el dorado prospectuses and jockeying their shares through the market for information on this head we must refer the reader to the newspapers or if he be connected with the city and acquainted with commercial men he will be able to say whether all the persons whose names figure at the head of announcements of projected companies are as rich as rothschild or quite as honest as heart could desire  when macaire has sufficiently exploité the bourse whether as a gambler in the public funds or other companies he sagely perceives that it is time to turn to some other profession and providing himself with a black gown proposes blandly to bertrand to set upa new religion mon ami says the repentant sinner le temps de la commandite va passer mais les badauds ne passeront pas o rare sentence it should be written in letters of gold occupons nous de ce qui est Éternel si nous fassions une réligion on which m bertrand remarks a religion what the devila religion is not an easy thing to make but macaires receipt is easy get a gown take a shop he says borrow some chairs preach about napoleon or the discovery of america or molièreand theres a religion for you  we have quoted this sentence more for the contrast it offers with our own manners than for its merits after the noble paragraph les badauds ne passeront pas occupons nous de ce qui est éternel one would have expected better satire upon cant than the words that follow we are not in a condition to say whether the subjects chosen are those that had been selected by père enfantin or chatel or lacordaire but the words are curious we think for the very reason that the satire is so poor the fact is there is no religion in paris even clever m philipon who satirizes everything and must know therefore some little about the subject which he ridicules has nothing to say but preach a sermon and that makes a religion anything will do if anything will do it is clear that the religious commodity is not in much demand tartuffe had better things to say about hypocrisy in his time but then faith was alive now there is no satirizing religious cant in france for its contrary true religion has disappeared altogether and having no substance can cast no shadow if a satirist would lash the religious hypocrites in england nowthe high church hypocrites the low church hypocrites the promiscuous dissenting hypocrites the no popery hypocriteshe would have ample subject enough in france the religious hypocrites went out with the bourbons those who remain pious in that country or rather we should say in the capital for of that we speak are unaffectedly so for they have no worldly benefit to hope for from their piety the great majority have no religion at all and do not scoff at the few for scoffing is the minoritys weapon and is passed always to the weaker side whatever that may be thus h b caricatures the ministers if by any accident that body of men should be dismissed from their situations and be succeeded by h bs friends the torieswhat must the poor artist do he must pine away and die if he be not converted he cannot always be paying compliments for caricature has a spice of goethes devil in it and is der geist der stets verneint the spirit that is always denying  with one or two of the french writers and painters of caricatures the king tried the experiment of bribery which succeeded occasionally in buying off the enemy and bringing him from the republican to the royal camp but when there the deserter was never of any use figaro when so treated grew fat and desponding and lost all his sprightly verve and nemesis became as gentle as a quakeress but these instances of ratting were not many some few poets were bought over but among men following the profession of the press a change of politics is an infringement of the point of honor and a man must fight as well as apostatize a very curious table might be made signalizing the difference of the moral standard between us and the french why is the grossness and indelicacy publicly permitted in england unknown in france where private morality is certainly at a lower ebb why is the point of private honor now more rigidly maintained among the french why is it as it should be a moral disgrace for a frenchman to go into debt and no disgrace for him to cheat his customer why is there more honesty and lessmore propriety and lessand how are we to account for the particular vices or virtues which belong to each nation in its turn  the above is the reverend m macaires solitary exploit as a spiritual swindler as maÎtre macaire in the courts of law as avocat avouéin a humbler capacity even as a prisoner at the bar he distinguishes himself greatly as may be imagined on one occasion we find the learned gentleman humanely visiting an unfortunate détenuno other person in fact than his friend m bertrand who has fallen into some trouble and is awaiting the sentence of the law he begins  mon cher bertrand donne moi cent écus je te fais acquitter demblée  jai pas dargent  hé bien donne moi cent francs  pas le sou  tu nas pas dix francs  pas un liard  alors donne moi tes bottes je plaiderai la circonstance atténuante  the manner in which maitre macaire soars from the cent écus a high point already to the sublime of the boots is in the best comic style in another instance he pleads before a judge and mistaking his client pleads for defendant instead of plaintiff the infamy of the plaintiffs character my luds renders his testimony on such a charge as this wholly unavailing m macaire m macaire cries the attorney in a fright you are for the plaintiff this my lords is what the defendant will say this is the line of defence which the opposite party intend to pursue as if slanders like these could weigh with an enlightened jury or injure the spotless reputation of my client in this story and expedient m macaire has been indebted to the english bar if there be an occupation for the english satirist in the exposing of the cant and knavery of the pretenders to religion what room is there for him to lash the infamies of the law on this point the french are babes in iniquity compared to usa counsel prostituting himself for money is a matter with us so stale that it is hardly food for satire which to be popular must find some much more complicated and interesting knavery whereon to exercise its skill  m macaire is more skilful in love than in law and appears once or twice in a very amiable light while under the influence of the tender passion we find him at the head of one of those useful establishments unknown in our countrya bureau de mariage half a dozen of such places are daily advertised in the journals and une veuve de trente ans ayant une fortune de deux cent mille francs or une demoiselle de quinze aus jolie dune famille très distinguée qui possède trente mille livres de rentescontinually in this kindhearted way are offering themselves to the public sometimes it is a gentleman with a physique agréabledes talens de sociétéand a place under government who makes a sacrifice of himself in a similar manner in our little historical gallery we find this philanthropic antimalthusian at the head of an establishment of this kind introducing a very meek simplelooking bachelor to some distinguished ladies of his connoissance let me present you sir to madame de st bertrand it is our old friend veuve de la grande armée et mdlle eloa de wormspire ces dames brûlent de lenvie de faire votre connoissance je les ai invitées à dîner chez vous ce soir vous

to more widows than it ever made mistresses of cafés old governesses keepers of boardinghouses genteel beggars and ladies of lower rank still have this favorite pedigree they have all had malheurs

daughter of a clergyman in the west of england has been plunged c c the difference is curious as indicating the standard of respectability  the male beggar of fashion is not so well known among us as in paris where streetdoors are open six or eight families live in a house and the gentleman who earns his livelihood by this profession can make half a dozen visits without the trouble of knocking from house to house and the pain of being observed by the whole street while the footman is examining him from the area some few may be seen in england about the inns of court where the locality is favorable where however the owners of the chambers are not proverbially soft of heart so that the harvest must be poor but paris is full of such adventurersfat smoothtongued and well dressed with gloves and giltheaded canes who would be insulted almost by the offer of silver and expect your gold as their right among these of course our friend robert plays his part and an excellent engraving represents him snuffbox in hand advancing to an old gentleman whom by his poodle his powdered head and his drivelling stupid look one knows to be a carlist of the old régime i beg pardon says robert is it really yourself to whom i have the honor of speakingit is do you take snuffi thank yousir i have had misfortunesi want assistance i am a vendéan of illustrious birth you know the family of macairbecwe are of brest my grandfather served the king in his galleys my father and i belong also to the marine unfortunate suits at law have plunged us into difficulties and i do not hesitate to ask you for the succor of ten francssir i never give to those i dont knowright sir perfectly right perhaps you will have the kindness to lend me ten francs  the adventures of doctor macaire need not be described because the different degrees in quackery which are taken by that learned physician are all well known in england where we have the advantage of many higher degrees in the science which our neighbors know nothing about we have not hahnemann but we have his disciples we have not broussais but we have the college of health and surely a dose of morrisons pills is a sublimer discovery than a draught of hot water we had st john long toowhere is his scienceand we are credibly informed that some important cures have been effected by the inspired dignitaries of the church in newman street which if it continue to practise will sadly interfere with the profits of the regular physicians and where the miracles of the abbé of paris are about to be acted over again  in speaking of m macaire and his adventures we have managed so entirely to convince ourselves of the reality of the personage that we have quite forgotten to speak of messrs philipon and daumier who are the one the inventor the other the designer of the macaire picture gallery as works of esprit these drawings are not more remarkable than they are as works of art and we never recollect to have seen a series of sketches possessing more extraordinary cleverness and variety the countenance and figure of macaire and the dear stupid bertrand are preserved of course with great fidelity throughout but the admirable way in which each fresh character is conceived the grotesque appropriateness of roberts every successive attitude and gesticulation and the variety of bertrands postures of invariable repose the exquisite fitness of all the other characters who act their little part and disappear from the scene cannot be described on paper or too highly lauded the figures are very carelessly drawn but if the reader can understand us all the attitudes and limbs are perfectly conceived and wonderfully natural and various after pondering over these drawings for some hours as we have been while compiling this notice of them we have grown to believe that the personages are real and the scenes remain imprinted on the brain as if we had absolutely been present at their acting perhaps the clever way in which the plates are colored and the excellent effect which is put into each may add to this illusion now in looking for instance at h bs slim vapory figures they have struck us as excellent likenesses of men and women but no more the bodies want spirit action and individuality george cruikshank as a humorist has quite as much genius but he does not know the art of effect so well as monsieur daumier and if we might venture to give a word of advice to another humorous designer whose works are extensively circulatedthe illustrator of pickwick and nicholas nicklebyit would be to study well these caricatures of monsieur daumier who though he executes very carelessly knows very well what he would express indicates perfectly the attitude and identity of his figure and is quite aware beforehand of the effect which he intends to produce the one we should fancy to be a practised artist taking his ease the other a young one somewhat bewildered a very clever one however who if he would think more and exaggerate less would add not a little to his reputation  having pursued all through these remarks the comparison between english art and french art english and french humor manners and morals perhaps we should endeavor also to write an analytical essay on english cant or humbug as distinguished from french it might be shown that the latter was more picturesque and startling the former more substantial and positive it has none of the poetic flights of the french genius but advances steadily and gains more ground in the end than its sprightlier compeer but such a discussion would carry us through the whole range of french and english history and the reader has probably read quite enough of the subject in this and the foregoing pages  we shall therefore say no more of french and english caricatures generally or of mr macaires particular accomplishments and adventures they are far better understood by examining the original pictures by which philipon and daumier have illustrated them than by translations first into print and afterwards into english they form a very curious and instructive commentary upon the present state of society in paris and a hundred years hence when the whole of this struggling noisy busy merry race shall have exchanged their pleasures or occupations for a quiet coffin and a tawdry lying epitaph at montmartre or père la chaise when the follies here recorded shall have been superseded by new ones and the fools now so active shall have given up the inheritance of the world to their children the latter will at least have the advantage of knowing intimately and exactly the manners of life and being of their grandsires and calling up when they so choose it our ghosts from the grave to live love quarrel swindle suffer and struggle on blindly as of yore and when the amused speculator shall have laughed sufficiently at the immensity of our follies and the paltriness of our aims smiled at our exploded superstitions wondered how this man should be considered great who is now clean forgotten as copious guthrie before mentioned how this should have been thought a patriot who is but a knave spouting commonplace or how that should have been dubbed a philosopher who is but a dull fool blinking solemn and pretending to see in the dark when he shall have examined all these at his leisure smiling in a pleasant contempt and goodhumored superiority and thanking heaven for his increased lights he will shut the book and be a fool as his fathers were before him  it runs in the blood well hast thou said o ragged macairele jour va passer mais les badauds ne passeront pas     little poinsinet   about the year 1760 there lived at paris a little fellow who was the darling of all the wags of his acquaintance nature seemed in the formation of this little man to have amused herself by giving loose to half a hundred of her most comical caprices he had some wit and drollery of his own which sometimes rendered his sallies very amusing but where his friends laughed with him once they laughed at him a thousand times for he had a fund of absurdity in himself that was more pleasant than all the wit in the world he was as proud as a peacock as wicked as an ape and as silly as a goose he did not possess one single grain of common sense but in revenge his pretensions were enormous his ignorance vast and his credulity more extensive still from his youth upwards he had read nothing but the new novels and the verses in the almanacs which helped him not a little in making what he called poetry of his own for of course our little hero was a poet all the common usages of life all the ways of the world and all the customs of society seemed to be quite unknown to him add to these good qualities a magnificent conceit a cowardice inconceivable and a face so irresistibly comic that every one who first beheld it was compelled to burst out alaughing and you will have some notion of this strange little gentleman he was very proud of his voice and uttered all his sentences in the richest tragic tone he was little better than a dwarf but he elevated his eyebrows held up his neck walked on the tips of his toes and gave himself the airs of a giant he had a little pair of bandy legs which seemed much too short to support anything like a human body but by the help of these crooked supporters he thought he could dance like a grace and indeed fancied all the graces possible were to be found in his person his goggle eyes were always rolling about wildly as if in correspondence with the disorder of his little brain and his countenance thus wore an expression of perpetual wonder with such happy natural gifts he not only fell into all traps that were laid for him but seemed almost to go out of his way to seek them although to be sure his friends did not give him much trouble in that search for they prepared hoaxes for him incessantly  one day the wags introduced him to a company of ladies who though not countesses and princesses exactly took nevertheless those titles upon themselves for the nonce and were all for the same reason violently smitten with master poinsinets person one of them the lady of the house was especially tender and seating him by her side at supper so plied him with smiles ogles and champagne that our little hero grew crazed with ecstasy and wild with love in the midst of his happiness a cruel knock was heard below accompanied by quick loud talking swearing and shuffling of feet you would have thought a regiment was at the door oh heavens cried the marchioness starting up and giving to the hand of poinsinet one parting squeeze flyfly my poinsinet tis the colonelmy husband at this each gentleman of the party rose and drawing his rapier vowed to cut his way through the colonel and all his mousquetaires or die if need be by the side of poinsinet  the little fellow was obliged to lug out his sword too and went shuddering down stairs heartily repenting of his passion for marchionesses when the party arrived in the street they found sure enough a dreadful company of mousquetaires as they seemed ready to oppose their passage swords crossedtorches blazed and with the most dreadful shouts and imprecations the contending parties rushed upon one another the friends of poinsinet surrounding and supporting that little warrior as the french knights did king francis at pavia otherwise the poor fellow certainly would have fallen down in the gutter from fright  but the combat was suddenly interrupted for the neighbors who knew nothing of the trick going on and thought the brawl was real had been screaming with all their might for the police who began about this time to arrive directly they appeared friends and enemies of poinsinet at once took to their heels and in this part of the transaction at least our hero himself showed that he was equal to the longestlegged grenadier that ever ran away  when at last those little bandy legs of his had borne him safely to his lodgings all poinsinets friends crowded round him to congratulate him on his escape and his valor  egad how he pinked that great redhaired fellow said one  no did i said poinsinet  did you psha dont try to play the modest and humbug us you know you did i suppose you will say next that you were not for three minutes point to point with cartentierce himself the most dreadful swordsman of the army  why you see says poinsinet quite delighted it was so dark that i did not know with whom i was engaged although corbleu i did for one or two of the fellows and after a little more of such conversation during which he was fully persuaded that he had done for a dozen of the enemy at least poinsinet went to bed his little person trembling with fright and pleasure and he fell asleep and dreamed of rescuing ladies and destroying monsters like a second amadis de gaul  when he awoke in the morning he found a party of his friends in his room one was examining his coat and waistcoat another was casting many curious glances at his inexpressibles look here said this gentleman holding up the garment to the light onetwothree gashes i am hanged if the cowards did not aim at poinsinets legs there are four holes in the sword arm of his coat and seven have gone right through coat and waistcoat good heaven poinsinet have you had a surgeon to your wounds  wounds said the little man springing up i dont knowthat is i hopethat iso lord o lord i hope im not wounded and after a proper examination he discovered he was not  thank heaven thank heaven said one of the wags who indeed during the slumbers of poinsinet had been occupied in making these very holes through the garments of that individual if you have escaped it is by a miracle alas alas all your enemies have not been so lucky  how is anybody wounded said poinsinet  my dearest friend prepare yourself that unhappy man who came to revenge his menaced honorthat gallant officerthat injured husband colonel count de cartentierce  well  is no more he died this morning pierced through with nineteen wounds from your hand and calling upon his country to revenge his murder  when this awful sentence was pronounced all the auditory gave a pathetic and simultaneous sob and as for poinsinet he sank back on his bed with a howl of terror which would have melted a visigoth to tears or to laughter as soon as his terror and remorse had in some degree subsided his comrades spoke to him of the necessity of making his escape and huddling on his clothes and bidding them all a tender adieu he set off incontinently without his breakfast for england america or russia not knowing exactly which  one of his companions agreed to accompany him on a part of this journeythat is as far as the barrier of st denis which is as everybody knows on the high road to dover and there being tolerably secure they entered a tavern for breakfast which meal the last that he ever was to take perhaps in his native city poinsinet was just about to discuss when behold a gentleman entered the apartment where poinsinet and his friend were seated and drawing from his pocket a paper with au nom du roy flourished on the top read from it or rather from poinsinets own figure his exact signalement laid his hand on his shoulder and arrested him in the name of the king and of the provostmarshal of paris i arrest you sir said he gravely with regret you have slain with seventeen wounds in single combat colonel count de cartentierce one of his majestys household and as his murderer you fall under the immediate authority of the provostmarshal and die without trial or benefit of clergy  you may fancy how the poor little mans appetite fell when he heard this speech in the provostmarshals hands said his friend then it is all over indeed when does my poor friend suffer sir  at halfpast six oclock the day after tomorrow said the officer sitting down and helping himself to wine but stop said he suddenly sure i cant mistake yesnoyes it is my dear friend my dear durand dont you recollect your old schoolfellow antoine and herewith the officer flung himself into the arms of durand poinsinets comrade and they performed a most affecting scene of friendship  this may be of some service to you whispered durand to poinsinet and after some further parley he asked the officer when he was bound to deliver up his prisoner and hearing that he was not called upon to appear at the marshalsea before six oclock at night monsieur durand prevailed upon monsieur antoine to wait until that hour and in the meantime to allow his prisoner to walk about the town in his company this request was with a little difficulty granted and poor poinsinet begged to be carried to the houses of his various friends and bid them farewell some were aware of the trick that had been played upon him others were not but the poor little mans credulity was so great that it was impossible to undeceive him and he went from house to house bewailing his fate and followed by the complaisant marshals officer  the news of his death he received with much more meekness than could have been expected but what he could not reconcile to himself was the idea of dissection afterwards what can they want with me cried the poor wretch in an unusual fit of candor i am very small and ugly it would be different if i were a tall finelooking fellow but he was given to understand that beauty made very little difference to the surgeons who on the contrary would on certain occasions prefer a deformed man to a handsome one for science was much advanced by the study of such monstrosities with this reason poinsinet was obliged to be content and so paid his rounds of visits and repeated his dismal adieux  the officer of the provostmarshal however amusing poinsinets woes might have been began by this time to grow very weary of them and gave him more than one opportunity to escape he would stop at shopwindows loiter round corners and look up in the sky but all in vain poinsinet would not escape do what the other would at length luckily about dinnertime the officer met one of poinsinets friends and his own and the three agreed to dine at a tavern as they had breakfasted and here the officer who vowed that he had been up for five weeks incessantly fell suddenly asleep in the profoundest fatigue and poinsinet was persuaded after much hesitation on his part to take leave of him  and now this danger overcome another was to be avoided beyond a doubt the police were after him and how was he to avoid them he must be disguised of course and one of his friends a tall gaunt lawyers clerk agreed to provide him with habits  so little poinsinet dressed himself out in the clerks dingy black suit of which the kneebreeches hung down to his heels and the waist of the coat reached to the calves of his legs and furthermore he blacked his eyebrows and wore a huge black periwig in which his friend vowed that no one could recognize him but the most painful incident with regard to the periwig was that poinsinet whose solitary beautyif beauty it might be calledwas a head of copious curling yellow hair was compelled to snip off every one of his golden locks and to rub the bristles with a black dye for if your wig were to come off said the lawyer and your fair hair to tumble over your shoulders every man would know or at least suspect you so off the locks were cut and in his black suit and periwig little poinsinet went abroad  his friends had their cue and when he appeared amongst them not one seemed to know him he was taken into companies where his character was discussed before him and his wonderful escape spoken of at last he was introduced to the very officer of the provostmarshal who had taken him into custody and who told him that he had been dismissed the provosts service in consequence of the escape of the prisoner now for the first time poor poinsinet thought himself tolerably safe and blessed his kind friends who had procured for him such a complete disguise how this affair ended i know notwhether some new lie was coined to account for his release or whether he was simply told that he had been hoaxed it mattered little for the little man was quite as ready to be hoaxed the next day  poinsinet was one day invited to dine with one of the servants of the tuileries and before his arrival a person in company had been decorated with a knot of lace and a gold key such as chamberlains wear he was introduced to poinsinet as the count de truchses chamberlain to the king of prussia after dinner the conversation fell upon the counts visit to paris when his excellency with a mysterious air vowed that he had only come for pleasure it is mighty well said a third person and of course we cant crossquestion your lordship too closely but at the same time it was hinted to poinsinet that a person of such consequence did not travel for nothing with which opinion poinsinet solemnly agreed and indeed it was borne out by a subsequent declaration of the count who condescended at last to tell the company in confidence that he had a mission and a most important oneto find namely among the literary men of france a governor for the prince royal of prussia the company seemed astonished that the king had not made choice of voltaire or dalembert and mentioned a dozen other distinguished men who might be competent to this important duty but the count as may be imagined found objections to every one of them and at last one of the guests said that if his prussian majesty was not particular as to age he knew a person more fitted for the place than any other who could be foundhis honorable friend m poinsinet was the individual to whom he alluded  good heavens cried the count is it possible that the celebrated poinsinet would take such a place i would give the world to see him and you may fancy how poinsinet simpered and blushed when the introduction immediately took place  the count protested to him that the king would be charmed to know him and added that one of his operas for it must be told that our little friend was a vaudevillemaker by trade had been acted sevenandtwenty times at the theatre at potsdam his excellency then detailed to him all the honors and privileges which the governor of the prince royal might expect and all the guests encouraged the little mans vanity by asking him for his protection and favor in a short time our hero grew so inflated with pride and vanity that he was for patronizing the chamberlain himself who proceeded to inform him that he was furnished with all the necessary powers by his sovereign who had specially enjoined him to confer upon the future governor of his son the royal order of the black eagle  poinsinet delighted was ordered to kneel down and the count produced a large yellow ribbon which he hung over his shoulder and which was he declared the grand cordon of the order you must fancy poinsinets face and excessive delight at this for as for describing them nobody can for fourandtwenty hours the happy chevalier paraded through paris with this flaring yellow ribbon and he was not undeceived until his friends had another trick in store for him  he dined one day in the company of a man who understood a little of the noble art of conjuring and performed some clever tricks on the cards poinsinets organ of wonder was enormous he looked on with the gravity and awe of a child and thought the mans tricks sheer miracles it wanted no more to set his companions to work  who is this wonderful man said he to his neighbor  why said the other mysteriously one hardly knows who he is or at least one does not like to say to such an indiscreet fellow as you are poinsinet at once swore to be secret well then said his friend you will hear that manthat wonderful mancalled by a name which is not his his real name is acosta he is a portuguese jew a rosicrucian and cabalist of the first order and compelled to leave lisbon for fear of the inquisition he performs here as you see some extraordinary things occasionally but the master of the house who loves him excessively would not for the world that his name should be made public  ah bah said poinsinet who affected the bel esprit you dont mean to say that you believe in magic and cabalas and such trash  do i not you shall judge for yourself and accordingly poinsinet was presented to the magician who pretended to take a vast liking for him and declared that he saw in him certain marks which would infallibly lead him to great eminence in the magic art if he chose to study it  dinner was served and poinsinet placed by the side of the miracleworker who became very confidential with him and promised himay before dinner was overa remarkable instance of his power nobody on this occasion ventured to cut a single joke against poor poinsinet nor could he fancy that any trick was intended against him for the demeanor of the society towards him was perfectly grave and respectful and the conversation serious on a sudden however somebody exclaimed where is poinsinet did any one see him leave the room  all the company exclaimed how singular the disappearance was and poinsinet himself growing alarmed turned round to his neighbor and was about to explain  hush said the magician in a whisper i told you that you should see what i could do i have made you invisible be quiet and you shall see some more tricks that i shall play with these fellows  poinsinet remained then silent and listened to his neighbors who agreed at last that he was a quiet orderly personage and had left the table early being unwilling to drink too much presently they ceased to talk about him and resumed their conversation upon other matters  at first it was very quiet and grave but the master of the house brought back the talk to the subject of poinsinet and uttered all sorts of abuse concerning him he begged the gentleman who had introduced such a little scamp into his house to bring him thither no more whereupon the other took up warmly poinsinets defence declared that he was a man of the greatest merit frequenting the best society and remarkable for his talents as well as his virtues  ah said poinsinet to the magician quite charmed at what he heard how ever shall i thank you my dear sir for thus showing me who my true friends are  the magician promised him still further favors in prospect and told him to look out now for he was about to throw all the company into a temporary fit of madness which no doubt would be very amusing  in consequence all the company who had heard every syllable of the conversation began to perform the most extraordinary antics much to the delight of poinsinet one asked a nonsensical question and the other delivered an answer not at all to the purpose if a man asked for a drink they poured him out a pepperbox or a napkin they took a pinch of snuff and swore it was excellent wine and vowed that the bread was the most delicious mutton ever tasted the little man was delighted  ah said he these fellows are prettily punished for their rascally backbiting of me  gentlemen said the host i shall now give you some celebrated champagne and he poured out to each a glass of water  good heavens said one spitting it out with the most horrible grimace where did you get this detestable claret  ah faugh said a second i never tasted such vile corked burgundy in all my days and he threw the glass of water into poinsinets face as did half a dozen of the other guests drenching the poor wretch to the skin to complete this pleasant illusion two of the guests fell to boxing across poinsinet who received a number of the blows and received them with the patience of a fakir feeling himself more flattered by the precious privilege of beholding this scene invisible than hurt by the blows and buffets which the mad company bestowed upon him  the fame of this adventure spread quickly over paris and all the world longed to have at their houses the representation of poinsinet the invisible the servants and the whole company used to be put up to the trick and poinsinet who believed in his invisibility as much as he did in his existence went about with his friend and protector the magician people of course never pretended to see him and would very often not talk of him at all for some time but hold sober conversation about anything else in the world when dinner was served of course there was no cover laid for poinsinet who carried about a little stool on which he sat by the side of the magician and always ate off his plate everybody was astonished at the magicians appetite and at the quantity of wine he drank as for little poinsinet he never once suspected any trick and had such a confidence in his magician that i do believe if the latter had told him to fling himself out of window he would have done so without the slightest trepidation  among other mystifications in which the portuguese enchanter plunged him was one which used to afford always a good deal of amusement he informed poinsinet with great mystery that he was not himself he was not that is to say that ugly deformed little monster called poinsinet but that his birth was most illustrious and his real name polycarte he was in fact the son of a celebrated magician but other magicians enemies of his father had changed him in his cradle altering his features into their present hideous shape in order that a silly old fellow called poinsinet might take him to be his own son which little monster the magician had likewise spirited away  the poor wretch was sadly cast down at this for he tried to fancy that his person was agreeable to the ladies of whom he was one of the warmest little admirers possible and to console him somewhat the magician told him that his real shape was exquisitely beautiful and as soon as he should appear in it all the beauties in paris would be at his feet but how to regain it oh for one minute of that beauty cried the little man what would he not give to appear under that enchanting form the magician hereupon waved his stick over his head pronounced some awful magical words and twisted him round three times at the third twist the men in company seemed struck with astonishment and envy the ladies clasped their hands and some of them kissed his everybody declared his beauty to be supernatural  poinsinet enchanted rushed to a glass fool said the magician do you suppose that you can see the change my power to render you invisible beautiful or ten times more hideous even than you are extends only to others not to you you may look a thousand times in the glass and you will only see those deformed limbs and disgusting features with which devilish malice has disguised you poor little poinsinet looked and came back in tears but resumed the magicianha ha hai know a way in which to disappoint the machinations of these fiendish magi  oh my benefactormy great masterfor heavens sake tell it gasped poinsinet  look youit is this a prey to enchantment and demoniac art all your life long you have lived until your present age perfectly satisfied nay absolutely vain of a person the most singularly hideous that ever walked the earth  is it whispered poinsinet indeed and indeed i didnt think it so bad  he acknowledges it he acknowledges it roared the magician wretch dotard owl mole miserable buzzard i have no reason to tell thee now that thy form is monstrous that children cry that cowards turn pale that teeming matrons shudder to behold it it is not thy fault that thou art thus ungainly but wherefore so blind wherefore so conceited of thyself i tell thee poinsinet that over every fresh instance of thy vanity the hostile enchanters rejoice and triumph as long as thou art blindly satisfied with thyself as long as thou pretendest in thy present odious shape to win the love of aught above a negress nay further still until thou hast learned to regard that face as others do with the most intolerable horror and disgust to abuse it when thou seest it to despise it in short and treat that miserable disguise in which the enchanters have wrapped thee with the strongest hatred and scorn so long art thou destined to wear it  such speeches as these continually repeated caused poinsinet to be fully convinced of his ugliness he used to go about in companies and take every opportunity of inveighing against himself he made verses and epigrams against himself he talked about that dwarf poinsinet that buffoon poinsinet that conceited humpbacked poinsinet and he would spend hours before the glass abusing his own face as he saw it reflected there and vowing that he grew handsomer at every fresh epithet that he uttered  of course the wags from time to time used to give him every possible encouragement and declared that since this exercise his person was amazingly improved the ladies too began to be so excessively fond of him that the little fellow was obliged to caution them at lastfor the good as he said of society he recommended them to draw lots for he could not gratify them all but promised when his metamorphosis was complete that the one chosen should become the happy mrs poinsinet or to speak more correctly mrs polycarte  i am sorry to say however that on the score of gallantry poinsinet was never quite convinced of the hideousness of his appearance he had a number of adventures accordingly with the ladies but strange to say the husbands or fathers were always interrupting him on one occasion he was made to pass the night in a slipperbath full of water where although he had all his clothes on he declared that he nearly caught his death of cold another night in revenge the poor fellow                 dans le simple appareil      dune beauté quon vient darracher au sommeil   spent a number of hours contemplating the beauty of the moon on the tiles these adventures are pretty numerous in the memoirs of m poinsinet but the fact is that people in france were a great deal more philosophical in those days than the english are now so that poinsinets loves must be passed over as not being to our taste his magician was a great diver and told poinsinet the most wonderful tales of his two minutes absence under water these two minutes he said lasted through a year at least which he spent in the company of a naiad more beautiful than venus in a palace more splendid than even versailles fired by the description poinsinet used to dip and dip but he never was known to make any mermaid acquaintances although he fully believed that one day he should find such  the invisible joke was brought to an end by poinsinets too great reliance on it for being as we have said of a very tender and sanguine disposition he one day fell in love with a lady in whose company he dined and whom he actually proposed to embrace but the fair lady in the hurry of the moment forgot to act up to the joke and instead of receiving poinsinets salute with calmness grew indignant called him an impudent little scoundrel and lent him a sound box on the ear with this slap the invisibility of poinsinet disappeared the gnomes and genii left him and he settled down into common life again and was hoaxed only by vulgar means  a vast number of pages might be filled with narratives of the tricks that were played upon him but they resemble each other a good deal as may be imagined and the chief point remarkable about them is the wondrous faith of poinsinet after being introduced to the prussian ambassador at the tuileries he was presented to the turkish envoy at the place vendôme who received him in state surrounded by the officers of his establishment all dressed in the smartest dresses that the wardrobe of the opéra comique could furnish  as the greatest honor that could be done to him poinsinet was invited to eat and a tray was produced on which was a delicate dish prepared in the turkish manner this consisted of a reasonable quantity of mustard salt cinnamon and ginger nutmegs and cloves with a couple of tablespoonfuls of cayenne pepper to give the whole a flavor and poinsinets countenance may be imagined when he introduced into his mouth a quantity of this exquisite compound  the best of the joke was says the author who records so many of the pitiless tricks practised upon poor poinsinet that the little man used to laugh at them afterwards himself with perfect good humor and lived in the daily hope that from being the sufferer he should become the agent in these hoaxes and do to others as he had been done by passing therefore one day on the pont neuf with a friend who had been one of the greatest performers the latter said to him poinsinet my good fellow thou hast suffered enough and thy sufferings have made thee so wise and cunning that thou art worthy of entering among the initiated and hoaxing in thy turn poinsinet was charmed he asked when he should be initiated and how it was told him that a moment would suffice and that the ceremony might be performed on the spot at this news and according to order poinsinet flung himself straightway on his knees in the kennel and the other drawing his sword solemnly initiated him into the sacred order of jokers from that day the little man believed himself received into the society and to this having brought him let us bid him a respectful adieu     the devils wager   it was the hour of the night when there be none stirring save churchyard ghostswhen all doors are closed except the gates of graves and all eyes shut but the eyes of wicked men  when there is no sound on the earth except the ticking of the grasshopper or the croaking of obscene frogs in the poole  and no light except that of the blinking starres and the wicked and devilish willsothewisp as they gambol among the marshes and lead good men astraye  when there is nothing moving in heaven except the owle as he flappeth along lazily or the magician as he rides on his infernal broomsticke whistling through the aire like the arrowes of a yorkshire archere  it was at this hour namely at twelve oclock of the night that two beings went winging through the black clouds and holding converse with each other  now the first was mercurius the messenger not of gods as the heathens feigned but of daemons and the second with whom he held company was the soul of sir roger de rollo the brave knight sir roger was count of chauchigny in champagne seigneur of santerre villacerf and aultre lieux but the great die as well as the humble and nothing remained of brave rodger now but his coffin and his deathless soul  and mercurius in order to keep fast the soul his companion had bound him round the neck with his tail which when the soul was stubborn he would draw so tight as to strangle him wellnigh sticking into him the barbed point thereof whereat the poor soul sir rollo would groan and roar lustily  now they two had come together from the gates of purgatorie being bound to those regions of fire and flame where poor sinners fry and roast in saecula saeculorum  it is hard said the poor sir rollo as they went gliding through the clouds that i should thus be condemned for ever and all for want of a single ave  how sir soul said the daemon you were on earth so wicked that not one or a million of aves could suffice to keep from hellflame a creature like thee but cheer up and be merry thou wilt be but a subject of our lord the devil as am i and perhaps thou wilt be advanced to posts of honor as am i also and to show his authoritie he lashed with his tail the ribbes of the wretched rollo  nevertheless sinner as i am one more ave would have saved me for my sister who was abbess of st mary of chauchigny did so prevail by her prayer and good works for my lost and wretched soul that every day i felt the pains of purgatory decrease the pitchforks which on my first entry had never ceased to vex and torment my poor carcass were now not applied above once a week the roasting had ceased the boiling had discontinued only a certain warmth was kept up to remind me of my situation  a gentle stewe said the daemon  yea truly i was but in a stew and all from the effects of the prayers of my blessed sister but yesterday he who watched me in purgatory told me that yet another prayer from my sister and my bonds should be unloosed and i who am now a devil should have been a blessed angel  and the other ave said the daemon  she died sirmy sister dieddeath choked her in the middle of the prayer and hereat the wretched spirit began to weepe and whine piteously his salt tears falling over his beard and scalding the tail of mercurius the devil  it is in truth a hard case said the daemon but i know of no remedy save patience and for that you will have an excellent opportunity in your lodgings below  but i have relations said the earl my kinsman randal who has inherited my lands will he not say a prayer for his uncle  thou didst hate and oppress him when living  it is true but an ave is not much his sister my niece matilda  you shut her in a convent and hanged her lover  had i not reason besides has she not others  a dozen without doubt  and my brother the prior  a liege subject of my lord the devil he never opens his mouth except to utter an oath or to swallow a cup of wine  and yet if but one of these would but say an ave for me i should be saved  aves with them are rarae aves replied mercurius wagging his tail right waggishly and what is more i will lay thee any wager that not one of these will say a prayer to save thee  i would wager willingly responded he of chauchigny but what has a poor soul like me to stake  every evening after the days roasting my lord satan giveth a cup of cold water to his servants i will bet thee thy water for a year that none of the three will pray for thee  done said rollo  done said the daemon and here if i mistake not is thy castle of chauchigny  indeed it was true the soul on looking down perceived the tall towers the courts the stables and the fair gardens of the castle although it was past midnight there was a blaze of light in the banquetinghall and a lamp burning in the open window of the lady matilda  with whom shall we begin said the daemon with the baron or the lady  with the lady if you will  be it so her window is open let us enter  so they descended and entered silently into matildas chamber   the young ladys eyes were fixed so intently on a little clock that it was no wonder that she did not perceive the entrance of her two visitors her fair cheek rested on her white arm and her white arm on the cushion of a great chair in which she sat pleasantly supported by sweet thoughts and swans down a lute was at her side and a book of prayers lay under the table for piety is always modest like the amorous alexander she sighed and looked at the clockand sighed for ten minutes or more when she softly breathed the word edward  at this the soul of the baron was wroth the jade is at her old pranks said he to the devil and then addressing matilda i pray thee sweet niece turn thy thoughts for a moment from that villanous page edward and give them to thine affectionate uncle  when she heard the voice and saw the awful apparition of her uncle for a years sojourn in purgatory had not increased the comeliness of his appearance she started screamed and of course fainted  but the devil mercurius soon restored her to herself whats oclock said she as soon as she had recovered from her fit is he come  not thy lover maude but thine unclethat is his soul for the love of heaven listen to me i have been frying in purgatory for a year past and should have been in heaven but for the want of a single ave  i will say it for thee tomorrow uncle  tonight or never  well tonight be it and she requested the devil mercurius to give her the prayerbook from under the table but he had no sooner touched the holy book than he dropped it with a shriek and a yell it was hotter he said than his master sir lucifers own particular pitchfork and the lady was forced to begin her ave without the aid of her missal  at the commencement of her devotions the daemon retired and carried with him the anxious soul of poor sir roger de rollo  the lady knelt downshe sighed deeply she looked again at the clock and began  ave maria  when a lute was heard under the window and a sweet voice singing  hark said matilda        now the toils of day are over         and the sun hath sunk to rest       seeking like a fiery lover         the bosom of the blushing west       the faithful night keeps watch and ward         raising the moon her silver shield       and summoning the stars to guard         the slumbers of my fair mathilde   for mercys sake said sir rollo the ave first and next the song  so matilda again dutifully betook her to her devotions and began  ave maria gratiâ plena but the music began again and the prayer ceased of course        the faithful night  now all things lie         hid by her mantle dark and dim       in pious hope i hither hie         and humbly chant mine evning hymn       thou art my prayer my saint my shrine         for never holy pilgrim kneeld       or wept at feet more pure than thine         my virgin love my sweet mathilde   virgin love said the baron upon my soul this is too bad and he thought of the ladys lover whom he had caused to be hanged  but she only thought of him who stood singing at her window  niece matilda cried sir roger agonizedly wilt thou listen to the lies of an impudent page whilst thine uncle is waiting but a dozen words to make him happy  at this matilda grew angry edward is neither impudent nor a liar sir uncle and i will listen to the end of the song  come away said mercurius he hath yet got wield field sealed congealed and a dozen other rhymes beside and after the song will come the supper  so the poor soul was obliged to go while the lady listened and the page sung away till morning   my virtues have been my ruin said poor sir rollo as he and mercurius slunk silently out of the window had i hanged that knave edward as i did the page his predecessor my niece would have sung mine ave and i should have been by this time an angel in heaven  he is reserved for wiser purposes responded the devil he will assassinate your successor the lady mathildes brother and in consequence will be hanged in the love of the lady he will be succeeded by a gardener who will be replaced by a monk who will give way to an ostler who will be deposed by a jew pedler who shall finally yield to a noble earl the future husband of the fair mathilde so that you see instead of having one poor soul afrying we may now look forward to a goodly harvest for our lord the devil  the soul of the baron began to think that his companion knew too much for one who would make fair bets but there was no help for it he would not and he could not cry off and he prayed inwardly that the brother might be found more pious than the sister  but there seemed little chance of this as they crossed the court lackeys with smoking dishes and full jugs passed and repassed continually although it was long past midnight on entering the hall they found sir randal at the head of a vast table surrounded by a fiercer and more motley collection of individuals than had congregated there even in the time of sir rollo the lord of the castle had signified that it was his royal pleasure to be drunk and the gentlemen of his train had obsequiously followed their master mercurius was delighted with the scene and relaxed his usually rigid countenance into a bland and benevolent smile which became him wonderfully  the entrance of sir roger who had been dead about a year and a person with hoofs horns and a tail rather disturbed the hilarity of the company sir randal dropped his cup of wine and father peter the confessor incontinently paused in the midst of a profane song with which he was amusing the society  holy mother cried he it is sir roger  alive screamed sir randal  no my lord mercurius said sir roger is dead but cometh on a matter of business and i have the honor to act as his counsellor and attendant  nephew said sir roger the daemon saith justly i am come on a trifling affair in which thy service is essential  i will do anything uncle in my power  thou canst give me life if thou wilt but sir randal looked very blank at this proposition i mean life spiritual randal said sir roger and thereupon he explained to him the nature of the wager  whilst he was telling his story his companion mercurius was playing all sorts of antics in the hall and by his wit and fun became so popular with this godless crew that they lost all the fear which his first appearance had given them the friar was wonderfully taken with him and used his utmost eloquence and endeavors to convert the devil the knights stopped drinking to listen to the argument the menatarms forbore brawling and the wicked little pages crowded round the two strange disputants to hear their edifying discourse the ghostly man however had little chance in the controversy and certainly little learning to carry it on sir randal interrupted him father peter said he our kinsman is condemned for ever for want of a single ave wilt thou say it for him willingly my lord said the monk with my book and accordingly he produced his missal to read without which aid it appeared that the holy father could not manage the desired prayer but the crafty mercurius had by his devilish art inserted a song in the place of the ave so that father peter instead of chanting an hymn sang the following irreverent ditty        some love the matinchimes which toll         the hour of prayer to sinner       but better fars the midday bell         which speaks the hour of dinner       for when i see a smoking fish         or capon drownd in gravy       or noble haunch on silver dish         full glad i sing mine ave       my pulpit is an alehouse bench         whereon i sit so jolly       a smiling rosy country wench         my saint and patron holy       i kiss her cheek so red and sleek         i press her ringlets wavy       and in her willing ear i speak         a most religious ave       and if im blind yet heaven is kind         and holy saints forgiving       for sure he leads a right good life         who thus admires good living       above they say our flesh is air         our blood celestial ichor       oh grant mid all the changes there         they may not change our liquor   and with this pious wish the holy confessor tumbled under the table in an agony of devout drunkenness whilst the knights the menatarms and the wicked little pages rang out the last verse with a most melodious and emphatic glee i am sorry fair uncle hiccupped sir randal that in the matter of the ave we could not oblige thee in a more orthodox manner but the holy father has failed and there is not another man in the hall who hath an idea of a prayer  it is my own fault said sir rollo for i hanged the last confessor and he wished his nephew a surly goodnight as he prepared to quit the room  au revoir gentlemen said the devil mercurius and once more fixed his tail round the neck of his disappointed companion  the spirit of poor rollo was sadly cast down the devil on the contrary was in high good humor he wagged his tail with the most satisfied air in the world and cut a hundred jokes at the expense of his poor associate on they sped cleaving swiftly through the cold night winds frightening the birds that were roosting in the woods and the owls that were watching in the towers  in the twinkling of an eye as it is known devils can fly hundreds of miles so that almost the same beat of the clock which left these two in champagne found them hovering over paris they dropped into the court of the lazarist convent and winded their way through passage and cloister until they reached the door of the priors cell  now the prior rollos brother was a wicked and malignant sorcerer his time was spent in conjuring devils and doing wicked deeds instead of fasting scourging and singing holy psalms this mercurius knew and he therefore was fully at ease as to the final result of his wager with poor sir roger  you seem to be well acquainted with the road said the knight  i have reason answered mercurius having for a long period had the acquaintance of his reverence your brother but you have little chance with him  and why said sir rollo  he is under a bond to my master never to say a prayer or else his soul and his body are forfeited at once  why thou false and traitorous devil said the enraged knight and thou knewest this when we made our wager  undoubtedly do you suppose i would have done so had there been any chance of losing  and with this they arrived at father ignatiuss door  thy cursed presence threw a spell on my niece and stopped the tongue of my nephews chaplain i do believe that had i seen either of them alone my wager had been won  certainly therefore i took good care to go with thee however thou mayest see the prior alone if thou wilt and lo his door is open i will stand without for five minutes when it will be time to commence our journey  it was the poor barons last chance and he entered his brothers room more for the five minutes respite than from any hope of success  father ignatius the prior was absorbed in magic calculations he stood in the middle of a circle of skulls with no garment except his long white beard which reached to his knees he was waving a silver rod and muttering imprecations in some horrible tongue  but sir rollo came forward and interrupted his incantation i am said he the shade of thy brother roger de rollo and have come from pure brotherly love to warn thee of thy fate  whence camest thou  from the abode of the blessed in paradise replied sir roger who was inspired with a sudden thought it was but five minutes ago that the patron saint of thy church told me of thy danger and of thy wicked compact with the fiend go said he to thy miserable brother and tell him there is but one way by which he may escape from paying the awful forfeit of his bond  and how may that be said the prior the false fiend hath deceived me i have given him my soul but have received no worldly benefit in return brother dear brother how may i escape  i will tell thee as soon as i heard the voice of blessed st mary lazarus the worthy earl had at a pinch coined the name of a saint i left the clouds where with other angels i was seated and sped hither to save thee thy brother said the saint hath but one day more to live when he will become for all eternity the subject of satan if he would escape he must boldly break his bond by saying an ave  it is the express condition of the agreement said the unhappy monk i must say no prayer or that instant i become satans body and soul  it is the express condition of the saint answered roger fiercely pray brother pray or thou art lost for ever  so the foolish monk knelt down and devoutly sung out an ave amen said sir roger devoutly  amen said mercurius as suddenly coming behind he seized ignatius by his long beard and flew up with him to the top of the churchsteeple  the monk roared and screamed and swore against his brother but it was of no avail sir roger smiled kindly on him and said do not fret brother it must have come to this in a year or two  and he flew alongside of mercurius to the steepletop but this time the devil had not his tail round his neck i will let thee off thy bet said he to the daemon for he could afford now to be generous  i believe my lord said the daemon politely that our ways separate here sir roger sailed gayly upwards while mercurius having bound the miserable monk faster than ever he sunk downwards to earth and perhaps lower ignatius was heard roaring and screaming as the devil dashed him against the iron spikes and buttresses of the church   the moral of this story will be given in the second edition     madame sand and the new apocalypse   i dont know an impression more curious than that which is formed in a foreigners mind who has been absent from this place for two or three years returns to it and beholds the change which has taken place in the meantime in french fashions and ways of thinking two years ago for instance when i left the capital i left the young gentlemen of france with their hair brushed en toupet in front and the toes of their boots round now the boottoes are pointed and the hair combed flat and parted in the middle falls in ringlets on the fashionable shoulders and in like manner with books as with boots the fashion has changed considerably and it is not a little curious to contrast the old modes with the new absurd as was the literary dandyism of those days it is not a whit less absurd now only the manner is changed and our versatile frenchmen have passed from one caricature to another  the revolution may be called a caricature of freedom as the empire was of glory and what they borrow from foreigners undergoes the same process they take topboots and mackintoshes from across the water and caricature our fashions they read a little very little shakespeare and caricature our poetry and while in davids time art and religion were only a caricature of heathenism now on the contrary these two commodities are imported from germany and distorted caricatures originally are still farther distorted on passing the frontier  i trust in heaven that german art and religion will take no hold in our country where there is a fund of roastbeef that will expel any such humbug in the end but these sprightly frenchmen have relished the mystical doctrines mightily and having watched the germans with their sanctified looks and quaint imitations of the old times and mysterious transcendental talk are aping many of their fashions as well and solemnly as they can not very solemnly god wot for i think one should always prepare to grin when a frenchman looks particularly grave being sure that there is something false and ridiculous lurking under the owllike solemnity  when last in paris we were in the midst of what was called a catholic reaction artists talked of faith in poems and pictures churches were built here and there old missals were copied and purchased and numberless portraits of saints with as much gilding about them as ever was used in the fifteenth century appeared in churches ladies boudoirs and pictureshops one or two fashionable preachers rose and were eagerly followed the very youth of the schools gave up their pipes and billiards for some time and flocked in crowds to notre dame to sit under the feet of lacordaire i went to visit the church of notre dame de lorette yesterday which was finished in the heat of this catholic rage and was not a little struck by the similarity of the place to the worship celebrated in it and the admirable manner in which the architect has caused his work to express the public feeling of the moment it is a pretty little bijou of a church it is supported by sham marble pillars it has a gaudy ceiling of blue and gold which will look very well for some time and is filled with gaudy pictures and carvings in the very pink of the mode the congregation did not offer a bad illustration of the present state of catholic reaction two or three stray people were at prayers there was no service a few countrymen and idlers were staring about at the pictures and the swiss the paid guardian of the place was comfortably and appropriately asleep on his bench at the door i am inclined to think the famous reaction is over the students have taken to their sunday pipes and billiards again and one or two cafés have been established within the last year that are ten times handsomer than notre dame de lorette  however if the immortal görres and the german mystics have had their day there is the immortal göthe and the pantheists and i incline to think that the fashion has set very strongly in their favor voltaire and the encyclopaedians are voted now barbares and there is no term of reprobation strong enough for heartless humes and helvetiuses who lived but to destroy and who only thought to doubt wretched as voltaires sneers and puns are i think there is something more manly and earnest even in them than in the present muddy french transcendentalism pantheism is the word now one and all have begun to éprouver the besoin of a religious sentiment and we are deluged with a host of gods accordingly monsieur de balzac feels himself to be inspired victor hugo is a god madame sand is a god that tawdry man of genius jules janin who writes theatrical reviews for the débats has divine intimations and there is scarce a beggarly beardless scribbler of poems and prose but tells you in his preface of the sainteté of the sacerdoce littéraire or a dirty student sucking tobacco and beer and reeling home with a grisette from the chaumière who is not convinced of the necessity of a new messianism and will hiccup to such as will listen chapters of his own drunken apocalypse surely the negatives of the old days were far less dangerous than the assertions of the present and you may fancy what a religion that must be which has such high priests  there is no reason to trouble the reader with details of the lives of many of these prophets and expounders of new revelations madame sand for instance i do not know personally and can only speak of her from report true or false the history at any rate is not very edifying and so may be passed over but as a certain great philosopher told us in very humble and simple words that we are not to expect to gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles we may at least demand in all persons assuming the character of moralist or philosopherorder soberness and regularity of life for we are apt to distrust the intellect that we fancy can be swayed by circumstance or passion and we know how circumstance and passion will sway the intellect how mortified vanity will form excuses for itself and how temper turns angrily upon conscience that reproves it how often have we called our judge our enemy because he has given sentence against ushow often have we called the right wrong because the right condemns us and in the lives of many of the bitter foes of the christian doctrine can we find no personal reason for their hostility the men in athens said it was out of regard for religion that they murdered socrates but we have had time since then to reconsider the verdict and socrates character is pretty pure now in spite of the sentence and the jury of those days  the parisian philosophers will attempt to explain to you the changes through which madame sands mind has passedthe initiatory trials labors and sufferings which she has had to go throughbefore she reached her present happy state of mental illumination she teaches her wisdom in parables that are mostly a couple of volumes long and began first by an eloquent attack on marriage in the charming novel of indiana pity cried she for the poor woman who united to a being whose brute force makes him her superior should venture to break the bondage which is imposed on her and allow her heart to be free  in support of this claim of pity she writes two volumes of the most exquisite prose what a tender suffering creature is indiana how little her husband appreciates that gentleness which he is crushing by his tyranny and brutal scorn how natural it is that in the absence of his sympathy she poor clinging confiding creature should seek elsewhere for shelter how cautious should we be to call criminalto visit with too heavy a censurean act which is one of the natural impulses of a tender heart that seeks but for a worthy object of love but why attempt to tell the tale of beautiful indiana madame sand has written it so well that not the hardesthearted husband in christendom can fail to be touched by her sorrows though he may refuse to listen to her argument let us grant for arguments sake that the laws of marriage especially the french laws of marriage press very cruelly upon unfortunate women  but if one wants to have a question of this or any nature honestly argued it is better surely to apply to an indifferent person for an umpire for instance the stealing of pockethandkerchiefs or snuffboxes may or may not be vicious but if we who have not the wit or will not take the trouble to decide the question ourselves want to hear the real rights of the matter we should not surely apply to a pickpocket to know what he thought on the point it might naturally be presumed that he would be rather a prejudiced personparticularly as his reasoning if successful might get him out of gaol this is a homely illustration no doubt all we would urge by it is that madame sand having according to the french newspapers had a stern husband and also having according to the newspapers sought sympathy elsewhere her arguments may be considered to be somewhat partial and received with some little caution  and tell us who have been the social reformersthe haters that is of the present system according to which we live love marry have children educate them and endow themare they pure themselves i do believe not one and directly a man begins to quarrel with the world and its ways and to lift up as he calls it the voice of his despair and preach passionately to mankind about this tyranny of faith customs laws if we examine what the personal character of the preacher is we begin pretty clearly to understand the value of the doctrine any one can see why rousseau should be such a whimpering reformer and byron such a free and easy misanthropist and why our accomplished madame sand who has a genius and eloquence inferior to neither should take the present condition of mankind frenchkind so much to heart and labor so hotly to set it right  after indiana which we presume contains the ladys notions upon wives and husbands came valentine which may be said to exhibit her doctrine in regard of young men and maidens to whom the author would accord as we fancy the same tender license valentine was followed by lelia a wonderful book indeed gorgeous in eloquence and rich in magnificent poetry a regular topsyturvyfication of morality a thieves and prostitutes apotheosis this book has received some late enlargements and emendations by the writer it contains her notions on morals which as we have said are so peculiar that alas they only can be mentioned here not particularized but of spiridion we may write a few pages as it is her religious manifesto  in this work the lady asserts her pantheistical doctrine and openly attacks the received christian creed she declares it to be useless now and unfitted to the exigencies and the degree of culture of the actual world and though it would be hardly worth while to combat her opinions in due form it is at least worth while to notice them not merely from the extraordinary eloquence and genius of the woman herself but because they express the opinions of a great number of people besides for she not only produces her own thoughts but imitates those of others very eagerly and one finds in her writings so much similarity with others or in others so much resemblance to her that the book before us may pass for the expression of the sentiments of a certain french party  dieu est mort says another writer of the same class and of great genius toodieu est mort writes mr henry heine speaking of the christian god and he adds in a daring figure of speechnentendezvous pas sonner la clochetteon porte les sacremens à un dieu qui se meurt another of the pantheist poetical philosophers mr edgar quinet has a poem in which christ and the virgin mary are made to die similarly and the former is classed with prometheus this book of spiridion is a continuation of the theme and perhaps you will listen to some of the authors expositions of it  it must be confessed that the controversialists of the present day have an eminent advantage over their predecessors in the days of folios it required some learning then to write a book and some time at leastfor the very labor of writing out a thousand such vast pages would demand a considerable period but now in the age of duodecimos the system is reformed altogether a male or female controversialist draws upon his imagination and not his learning makes a story instead of an argument and in the course of 150 pages where the preacher has it all his own way will prove or disprove you anything and to our shame be it said we protestants have set the example of this kind of proselytismthose detestable mixtures of truth lies false sentiment false reasoning bad grammar correct and genuine philanthropy and pietyi mean our religious tracts which any woman or man be he ever so silly can take upon himself to write and sell for a penny as if religious instruction were the easiest thing in the world we i say have set the example in this kind of composition and all the sects of the earth will doubtless speedily follow it i can point you out blasphemies in famous pious tracts that are as dreadful as those above mentioned but this is no place for such discussions and we had better return to madame sand as mrs sherwood expounds by means of many touching histories and anecdotes of little boys and girls her notions of church history church catechism church doctrineas the author of father clement a roman catholic story demolishes the stately structure of eighteen centuries the mighty and beautiful roman catholic faith in whose bosom repose so many saints and sagesby the means of a threeandsixpenny duodecimo volume which tumbles over the vast fabric as davids pebblestone did goliathas again the roman catholic author of geraldine falls foul of luther and calvin and drowns the awful echoes of their tremendous protest by the sounds of her little halfcrown trumpet in like manner by means of pretty sentimental tales and cheap apologues mrs sand proclaims her truththat we need a new messiah and that the christian religion is no more o awful awful name of god light unbearable mystery unfathomable vastness immeasurablewho are these who come forward to explain the mystery and gaze unblinking into the depths of the light and measure the immeasurable vastness to a hair o name that gods people of old did fear to utter o light that gods prophet would have perished had he seen who are these that are now so familiar with itwomen truly for the most part weak womenweak in intellect weak mayhap in spelling and grammar but marvellously strong in faithwomen who step down to the people with stately step and voice of authority and deliver their twopenny tablets as if there were some divine authority for the wretched nonsense recorded there  with regard to the spelling and grammar our parisian pythoness stands in the goodly fellowship remarkable her style is a noble and as far as a foreigner can judge a strange tongue beautifully rich and pure she has a very exuberant imagination and with it a very chaste style of expression she never scarcely indulges in declamation as other modern prophets do and yet her sentences are exquisitely melodious and full she seldom runs a thought to death after the manner of some prophets who when they catch a little one toy with it until they kill it but she leaves you at the end of one of her brief rich melancholy sentences with plenty of food for future cogitation i cant express to you the charm of them they seem to me like the sound of country bellsprovoking i dont know what vein of musing and meditation and falling sweetly and sadly on the ear  this wonderful power of language must have been felt by most people who read madame sands first books valentine and indiana in spiridion it is greater i think than ever and for those who are not afraid of the matter of the novel the manner will be found most delightful the authors intention i presume is to describe in a parable her notions of the downfall of the catholic church and indeed of the whole christian scheme she places her hero in a monastery in italy where among the characters about him and the events which occur the particular tenets of madame dudevants doctrine are not inaptly laid down innocent faithful tenderhearted a young monk by name angel finds himself when he has pronounced his vows an object of aversion and hatred to the godly men whose lives he so much respects and whose love he would make any sacrifice to win after enduring much he flings himself at the feet of his confessor and begs for his sympathy and counsel but the confessor spurns him away and accuses him fiercely of some unknown and terrible crimebids him never return to the confessional until contrition has touched his heart and the stains which sully his spirit are by sincere repentance washed away  thus speaking says angel father hegesippus tore away his robe which i was holding in my supplicating hands in a sort of wildness i still grasped it tighter he pushed me fiercely from him and i fell with my face towards the ground he quitted me closing violently after him the door of the sacristy in which this scene had passed i was left alone in the darkness either from the violence of my fall or the excess of my grief a vein had burst in my throat and a haemorrhage ensued i had not the force to rise i felt my senses rapidly sinking and presently i lay stretched on the pavement unconscious and bathed in my blood  now the wonderful part of the story begins  i know not how much time i passed in this way as i came to myself i felt an agreeable coolness it seemed as if some harmonious air was playing round about me stirring gently in my hair and drying the drops of perspiration on my brow it seemed to approach and then again to withdraw breathing now softly and sweetly in the distance and now returning as if to give me strength and courage to rise  i would not however do so as yet for i felt myself as i lay under the influence of a pleasure quite new to me and listened in a kind of peaceful aberration to the gentle murmurs of the summer wind as it breathed on me through the closed windowblinds above me then i fancied i heard a voice that spoke to me from the end of the sacristy it whispered so low that i could not catch the words i remained motionless and gave it my whole attention at last i heard distinctly the following sentencespirit of truth raise up these victims of ignorance and imposture father hegesippus said i in a weak voice is that you who are returning to me but no one answered i lifted myself on my hands and knees i listened again but i heard nothing i got up completely and looked about me i had fallen so near to the only door in this little room that none after the departure of the confessor could have entered it without passing over me besides the door was shut and only opened from the inside by a strong lock of the ancient shape i touched it and assured myself that it was closed i was seized with terror and for some moments did not dare to move leaning against the door i looked round and endeavored to see into the gloom in which the angles of the room were enveloped a pale light which came from an upper window half closed was seen to be trembling in the midst of the apartment the wind beat the shutter to and fro and enlarged or diminished the space through which the light issued the objects which were in this half lightthe prayingdesk surmounted by its skulla few books lying on the benchesa surplice hanging against the wallseemed to move with the shadow of the foliage that the air agitated behind the window when i thought i was alone i felt ashamed of my former timidity i made the sign of the cross and was about to move forward in order to open the shutter altogether but a deep sigh came from the prayingdesk and kept me nailed to my place and yet i saw the desk distinctly enough to be sure that no person was near it then i had an idea which gave me courage some person i thought is behind the shutter and has been saying his prayers outside without thinking of me but who would be so bold as to express such wishes and utter such a prayer as i had just heard  curiosity the only passion and amusement permitted in a cloister now entirely possessed me and i advanced towards the window but i had not made a step when a black shadow as it seemed to me detaching itself from the prayingdesk traversed the room directing itself towards the window and passed swiftly by me the movement was so rapid that i had not time to avoid what seemed a body advancing towards me and my fright was so great that i thought i should faint a second time but i felt nothing and as if the shadow had passed through me i saw it suddenly disappear to my left  i rushed to the window i pushed back the blind with precipitation and looked round the sacristy i was there entirely alone i looked into the gardenit was deserted and the midday wind was wandering among the flowers i took courage i examined all the corners of the room i looked behind the prayingdesk which was very large and i shook all the sacerdotal vestments which were hanging on the walls everything was in its natural condition and could give me no explanation of what had just occurred the sight of all the blood i had lost led me to fancy that my brain had probably been weakened by the haemorrhage and that i had been a prey to some delusion i retired to my cell and remained shut up there until the next day  i dont know whether the reader has been as much struck with the above mysterious scene as the writer has but the fancy of it strikes me as very fine and the natural supernaturalness is kept up in the best style the shutter swaying to and fro the fitful light appearing over the furniture of the room and giving it an air of strange motionthe awful shadow which passed through the body of the timid young noviceare surely very finely painted i rushed to the shutter and flung it back there was no one in the sacristy i looked into the garden it was deserted and the midday wind was roaming among the flowers the dreariness is wonderfully described only the poor pale boy looking eagerly out from the window of the sacristy and the hot midday wind walking in the solitary garden how skilfully is each of these little strokes dashed in and how well do all together combine to make a picture but we must have a little more about spiridions wonderful visitant   as i entered into the garden i stepped a little on one side to make way for a person whom i saw before me he was a young man of surprising beauty and attired in a foreign costume although dressed in the large black robe which the superiors of our order wear he had underneath a short jacket of fine cloth fastened round the waist by a leathern belt and a buckle of silver after the manner of the old german students like them he wore instead of the sandals of our monks short tight boots and over the collar of his shirt which fell on his shoulders and was as white as snow hung in rich golden curls the most beautiful hair i ever saw he was tall and his elegant posture seemed to reveal to me that he was in the habit of commanding with much respect and yet uncertain i half saluted him he did not return my salute but he smiled on me with so benevolent an air and at the same time his eyes severe and blue looked towards me with an expression of such compassionate tenderness that his features have never since then passed away from my recollection i stopped hoping he would speak to me and persuading myself from the majesty of his aspect that he had the power to protect me but the monk who was walking behind me and who did not seem to remark him in the least forced him brutally to step aside from the walk and pushed me so rudely as almost to cause me to fall not wishing to engage in a quarrel with this coarse monk i moved away but after having taken a few steps in the garden i looked back and saw the unknown still gazing on me with looks of the tenderest solicitude the sun shone full upon him and made his hair look radiant he sighed and lifted his fine eyes to heaven as if to invoke its justice in my favor and to call it to bear witness to my misery he turned slowly towards the sanctuary entered into the quire and was lost presently in the shade i longed to return spite of the monk to follow this noble stranger and to tell him my afflictions but who was he that i imagined he would listen to them and cause them to cease i felt even while his softness drew me towards him that he still inspired me with a kind of fear for i saw in his physiognomy as much austerity as sweetness   who was hewe shall see that he was somebody very mysterious indeed but our author has taken care after the manner of her sex to make a very pretty fellow of him and to dress him in the most becoming costumes possible   the individual in tight boots and a rolling collar with the copious golden locks and the solemn blue eyes who had just gazed on spiridion and inspired him with such a feeling of tender awe is a much more important personage than the reader might suppose at first sight this beautiful mysterious dandy ghost whose costume with a true womans coquetry madame dudevant has so rejoiced to describeis her religious type a mystical representation of faith struggling up towards truth through superstition doubt fear reasonin tight inexpressibles with a belt such as is worn by the old german students you will pardon me for treating such an awful person as this somewhat lightly but there is always i think such a dash of the ridiculous in the french sublime that the critic should try and do justice to both or he may fail in giving a fair account of either this character of hebronius the type of mrs sands convictionsif convictions they may be calledor at least the allegory under which her doubts are represented is in parts very finely drawn contains many passages of truth very deep and touching by the side of others so entirely absurd and unreasonable that the readers feelings are continually swaying between admiration and something very like contemptalways in a kind of wonder at the strange mixture before him but let us hear madame sand  peter hebronius says our author was not originally so named his real name was samuel he was a jew and born in a little village in the neighborhood of innsprück his family which possessed a considerable fortune left him in his early youth completely free to his own pursuits from infancy he had shown that these were serious he loved to be alone and passed his days and sometimes his nights wandering among the mountains and valleys in the neighborhood of his birthplace he would often sit by the brink of torrents listening to the voice of their waters and endeavoring to penetrate the meaning which nature had hidden in those sounds as he advanced in years his inquiries became more curious and more grave it was necessary that he should receive a solid education and his parents sent him to study in the german universities luther had been dead only a century and his words and his memory still lived in the enthusiasm of his disciples the new faith was strengthening the conquests it had made the reformers were as ardent as in the first days but their ardor was more enlightened and more measured proselytism was still carried on with zeal and new converts were made every day in listening to the morality and to the dogmas which lutheranism had taken from catholicism samuel was filled with admiration his bold and sincere spirit instantly compared the doctrines which were now submitted to him with those in the belief of which he had been bred and enlightened by the comparison was not slow to acknowledge the inferiority of judaism he said to himself that a religion made for a single people to the exclusion of all otherswhich only offered a barbarous justice for rule of conductwhich neither rendered the present intelligible nor satisfactory and left the future uncertaincould not be that of noble souls and lofty intellects and that he could not be the god of truth who had dictated in the midst of thunder his vacillating will and had called to the performance of his narrow wishes the slaves of a vulgar terror always conversant with himself samuel who had spoken what he thought now performed what he had spoken and a year after his arrival in germany solemnly abjured judaism and entered into the bosom of the reformed church as he did not wish to do things by halves and desired as much as was in him to put off the old man and lead a new life he changed his name of samuel to that of peter some time passed during which he strengthened and instructed himself in his new religion very soon he arrived at the point of searching for objections to refute and adversaries to overthrow bold and enterprising he went at once to the strongest and bossuet was the first catholic author that he set himself to read he commenced with a kind of disdain believing that the faith which he had just embraced contained the pure truth he despised all the attacks which could be made against it and laughed already at the irresistible arguments which he was to find in the works of the eagle of meaux but his mistrust and irony soon gave place to wonder first and then to admiration he thought that the cause pleaded by such an advocate must at least be respectable and by a natural transition came to think that great geniuses would only devote themselves to that which was great he then studied catholicism with the same ardor and impartiality which he had bestowed on lutheranism he went into france to gain instruction from the professors of the mother church as he had from the doctors of the reformed creed in germany he saw arnauld fénélon that second gregory of nazianzen and bossuet himself guided by these masters whose virtues made him appreciate their talents the more he rapidly penetrated to the depth of the mysteries of the catholic doctrine and morality he found in this religion all that had for him constituted the grandeur and beauty of protestantismthe dogmas of the unity and eternity of god which the two religions had borrowed from judaism and what seemed the natural consequence of the last doctrinea doctrine however to which the jews had not arrivedthe doctrine of the immortality of the soul free will in this life in the next recompense for the good and punishment for the evil he found more pure perhaps and more elevated in catholicism than in protestantism that sublime morality which preaches equality to man fraternity love charity renouncement of self devotion to your neighbor catholicism in a word seemed to possess that vast formula and that vigorous unity which lutheranism wanted the latter had indeed in its favor the liberty of inquiry which is also a want of the human mind and had proclaimed the authority of individual reason but it had so lost that which is the necessary basis and vital condition of all revealed religionthe principle of infallibility because nothing can live except in virtue of the laws that presided at its birth and in consequence one revelation cannot be continued and confirmed without another now infallibility is nothing but revelation continued by god or the word in the person of his vicars  at last after much reflection hebronius acknowledged himself entirely and sincerely convinced and received baptism from the hands of bossuet he added the name of spiridion to that of peter to signify that he had been twice enlightened by the spirit resolved thenceforward to consecrate his life to the worship of the new god who had called him to him and to the study of his doctrines he passed into italy and with the aid of a large fortune which one of his uncles a catholic like himself had left to him he built this convent where we now are   a friend of mine who has just come from italy says that he has there left messrs spr pl and w drd who were the lights of the great church in newman street who were themselves apostles and declared and believed that every word of nonsense which fell from their lips was a direct spiritual intervention these gentlemen have become puseyites already and are my friend states in the high way to catholicism madame sand herself was a catholic some time since having been converted to that faith along with m n of the academy of music mr l the pianoforte player and one or two other chosen individuals by the famous abbé de la m abbé de la m so told me in the diligence a priest who read his breviary and gossiped alternately very curiously and pleasantly is himself an âme perdue the man spoke of his brother clergyman with actual horror and it certainly appears that the abbés works of conversion have not prospered for madame sand having brought her hero and herself as we may presume to the point of catholicism proceeds directly to dispose of that as she has done of judaism and protestantism and will not leave of the whole fabric of christianity a single stone standing  i think the fate of our english newman street apostles and of m de la m the mad priest and his congregation of mad converts should be a warning to such of us as are inclined to dabble in religious speculations for in them as in all others our flighty brains soon lose themselves and we find our reason speedily lying prostrated at the mercy of our passions and i think that madame sands novel of spiridion may do a vast deal of good and bears a good moral with it though not such an one perhaps as our fair philosopher intended for anything he learned samuelpeterspiridionhebronius might have remained a jew from the beginning to the end wherefore be in such a hurry to set up new faiths wherefore madame sand try and be so preternaturally wise wherefore be so eager to jump out of one religion for the purpose of jumping into another see what good this philosophical friskiness has done you and on what sort of ground you are come at last you are so wonderfully sagacious that you flounder in mud at every step so amazingly clearsighted that your eyes cannot see an inch before you having put out with that extinguishing genius of yours every one of the lights that are sufficient for the conduct of common men and for what let our friend spiridion speak for himself after setting up his convent and filling it with monks who entertain an immense respect for his wealth and genius father hebronius unanimously elected prior gives himself up to further studies and leaves his monks to themselves industrious and sober as they were originally they grow quickly intemperate and idle and hebronius who does not appear among his flock until he has freed himself of the catholic religion as he has of the jewish and the protestant sees with dismay the evil condition of his disciples and regrets too late the precipitancy by which he renounced then and for ever christianity but as he had no new religion to adopt in its place and as grown more prudent and calm he did not wish to accuse himself unnecessarily once more of inconstancy and apostasy he still maintained all the exterior forms of the worship which inwardly he had abjured but it was not enough for him to have quitted error it was necessary to discover truth but hebronius had well looked round to discover it he could not find anything that resembled it then commenced for him a series of sufferings unknown and terrible placed face to face with doubt this sincere and religious spirit was frightened at its own solitude and as it had no other desire nor aim on earth than truth and nothing else here below interested it he lived absorbed in his own sad contemplations looked ceaselessly into the vague that surrounded him like an ocean without bounds and seeing the horizon retreat and retreat as ever he wished to near it lost in this immense uncertainty he felt as if attacked by vertigo and his thoughts whirled within his brain then fatigued with his vain toils and hopeless endeavors he would sink down depressed unmanned lifewearied only living in the sensation of that silent grief which he felt and could not comprehend  it is a pity that this hapless spiridion so eager in his passage from one creed to another and so loud in his profession of the truth wherever he fancied that he had found it had not waited a little before he avowed himself either catholic or protestant and implicated others in errors and follies which might at least have been confined to his own bosom and there have lain comparatively harmless in what a pretty state for instance will messrs drd and pl have left their newman street congregation who are still plunged in their old superstitions from which their spiritual pastors and masters have been set free in what a state too do mrs sand and her brother and sister philosophers templars saint simonians fourierites lerouxites or whatever the sect may be leave the unfortunate people who have listened to their doctrines and who have not the opportunity or the fiery versatility of belief which carries their teachers from one creed to another leaving only exploded lies and useless recantations behind them i wish the state would make a law that one individual should not be allowed to preach more than one doctrine in his life or at any rate should be soundly corrected for every change of creed how many charlatans would have been silencedhow much conceit would have been kept within boundshow many fools who are dazzled by fine sentences and made drunk by declamation would have remained quiet and sober in that quiet and sober way of faith which their fathers held before them however the reader will be glad to learn that after all his doubts and sorrows spiridion does discover the truth the truth what a wise spiridion and some discretion with it for having found among his monks who are dissolute superstitiousand all hate himone only being fulgentius who is loving candid and pious he says to him if you were like myself if the first want of your nature were like mine to know i would without hesitation lay bare to you my entire thoughts i would make you drink the cup of truth which i myself have filled with so many tears at the risk of intoxicating you with the draught but it is not so alas you are made to love rather than to know and your heart is stronger than your intellect you are attached to catholicismi believe so at leastby bonds of sentiment which you could not break without pain and which if you were to break the truth which i could lay bare to you in return would not repay you for what you had sacrificed instead of exalting it would crush you very likely it is a food too strong for ordinary men and which when it does not revivify smothers i will not then reveal to you this doctrine which is the triumph of my life and the consolation of my last days because it might perhaps be for you only a cause of mourning and despair of all the works which my long studies have produced there is one alone which i have not given to the flames for it alone is complete in that you will find me entire and there lies the truth and as the sage has said you must not bury your treasures in a well i will not confide mine to the brutal stupidity of these monks but as this volume should only pass into hands worthy to touch it and be laid open for eyes that are capable of comprehending its mysteries i shall exact from the reader one condition which at the same time shall be a proof i shall carry it with me to the tomb in order that he who one day shall read it may have courage enough to brave the vain terrors of the grave in searching for it amid the dust of my sepulchre as soon as i am dead therefore place this writing on my breast ah when the time comes for reading it i think my withered heart will spring up again as the frozen grass at the return of the sun and that from the midst of its infinite transformations my spirit will enter into immediate communication with thine   does not the reader long to be at this precious manuscript which contains the truth and ought he not to be very much obliged to mrs sand for being so good as to print it for him we leave all the story aside how fulgentius had not the spirit to read the manuscript but left the secret to alexis how alexis a stern old philosophical unbelieving monk as ever was tried in vain to lift up the gravestone but was taken with fever and obliged to forego the discovery and how finally angel his disciple a youth amiable and innocent as his name was the destined person who brought the longburied treasure to light trembling and delighted the pair read this tremendous manuscript of spiridion  will it be believed that of all the dull vague windy documents that mortal ever set eyes on this is the dullest if this be absolute truth à quoi bon search for it since we have long long had the jewel in our possession or since at least it has been held up as such by every sham philosopher who has had a mind to pass off his wares on the public hear spiridion  how much have i wept how much have i suffered how much have i prayed how much have i labored before i understood the cause and the aim of my passage on this earth after many incertitudes after much remorse after many scruples i have comprehended that i was a martyrbut why my martyrdom said i what crimne did i commit before i was born thus to be condemned to labor and groaning from the hour when i first saw the day up to that when i am about to enter into the night of the tomb  at last by dint of imploring godby dint of inquiry into the history of man a ray of the truth has descended on my brow and the shadows of the past have melted from before my eyes i have lifted a corner of the curtain i have seen enough to know that my life like that of the rest of the human race has been a series of necessary errors yet to speak more correctly of incomplete truths conducting more or less slowly and directly to absolute truth and ideal perfection but when will they rise on the face of the earthwhen will they issue from the bosom of the divinitythose generations who shall salute the august countenance of truth and proclaim the reign of the ideal on earth i see well how humanity marches but i neither can see its cradle nor its apotheosis man seems to me a transitory race between the beast and the angel but i know not how many centuries have been required that he might pass from the state of brute to the state of man and i cannot tell how many ages are necessary that he may pass from the state of man to the state of angel  yet i hope and i feel within me at the approach of death that which warns me that great destinies await humanity in this life all is over for me much have i striven to advance but little i have labored without ceasing and have done almost nothing yet after pains immeasurable i die content for i know that i have done all i could and am sure that the little i have done will not be lost  what then have i done this wilt thou demand of me man of a future age who will seek for truth in the testaments of the past thou who wilt be no more catholicno more christian thou wilt ask of the poor monk lying in the dust an account of his life and death thou wouldst know wherefore were his vows why his austerities his labors his retreat his prayers  you who turn back to me in order that i may guide you on your road and that you may arrive more quickly at the goal which it has not been my lot to attain pause yet for a moment and look upon the past history of humanity you will see that its fate has been ever to choose between the least of two evils and ever to commit great faults in order to avoid others still greater you will see on one side the heathen mythology that debased the spirit in its efforts to deify the flesh on the other the austere christian principle that debased the flesh too much in order to raise the worship of the spirit you will see afterwards how the religion of christ embodies itself in a church and raises itself a generous democratic power against the tyranny of princes later still you will see how that power has attained its end and passed beyond it you will see it having chained and conquered princes league itself with them in order to oppress the people and seize on temporal power schism then raises up against it the standard of revolt and preaches the bold and legitimate principle of liberty of conscience but also you will see how this liberty of conscience brings religious anarchy in its train or worse still religious indifference and disgust and if your soul shattered in the tempestuous changes which you behold humanity undergoing would strike out for itself a passage through the rocks amidst which like a frail bark lies tossing trembling truth you will be embarrassed to choose between the new philosopherswho in preaching tolerance destroy religious and social unityand the last christians who to preserve society that is religion and philosophy are obliged to brave the principle of toleration man of truth to whom i address at once my instruction and my justification at the time when you shall live the science of truth no doubt will have advanced a step think then of all your fathers have suffered as bending beneath the weight of their ignorance and uncertainty they have traversed the desert across which with so much pain they have conducted thee and if the pride of thy young learning shall make thee contemplate the petty strifes in which our life has been consumed pause and tremble as you think of that which is still unknown to yourself and of the judgment that your descendants will pass on you think of this and learn to respect all those who seeking their way in all sincerity have wandered from the path frightened by the storm and sorely tried by the severe hand of the allpowerful think of this and prostrate yourself for all these even the most mistaken among them are saints and martyrs  without their conquests and their defeats thou wert in darkness still yes their failures their errors even have a right to your respect for man is weak weep then for us obscure travellersunknown victims who by our mortal sufferings and unheardof labors have prepared the way before you pity me who have passionately loved justice and perseveringly sought for truth only opened my eyes to shut them again for ever and saw that i had been in vain endeavoring to support a ruin to take refuge in a vault of which the foundations were worn away  the rest of the book of spiridion is made up of a history of the rise progress and what our philosopher is pleased to call decay of christianityof an assertion that the doctrine of christ is incomplete that christ may nevertheless take his place in the pantheon of divine men and of a long disgusting absurd and impious vision in which the saviour moses david and elijah are represented and in which christ is made to saywe are all messiahs when we wish to bring the reign of truth upon earth we are all christs when we suffer for it  and this is the ultimatum the supreme secret the absolute truth and it has been published by mrs sand for so many napoleons per sheet in the revue des deux mondes and the deux mondes are to abide by it for the future after having attained it are we a whit wiser man is between an angel and a beast i dont know how long it is since he was a brutei cant say how long it will be before he is an angel think of people living by their wits and living by such a wit as this think of the state of mental debauch and disease which must have been passed through ere such words could be written and could be popular  when a man leaves our dismal smoky london atmosphere and breathes instead of coalsmoke and yellow fog this bright clear french air he is quite intoxicated by it at first and feels a glow in his blood and a joy in his spirits which scarcely thrice a year and then only at a distance from london he can attain in england is the intoxication i wonder permanent among the natives and may we not account for the ten thousand frantic freaks of these people by the peculiar influence of french air and sun the philosophers are from night to morning drunk the politicians are drunk the literary men reel and stagger from one absurdity to another and how shall we understand their vagaries let us suppose charitably that madame sand had inhaled a more than ordinary quantity of this laughing gas when she wrote for us this precious manuscript of spiridion that great destinies are in prospect for the human race we may fancy without her ladyships word for it but more liberal than she and having a little retrospective charity as well as that easy prospective benevolence which mrs sand adopts let us try and think there is some hope for our fathers who were nearer brutality than ourselves according to the sandean creed or else there is a very poor chance for us who great philosophers as we are are yet alas far removed from that angelic consummation which all must wish for so devoutly she cannot sayis it not extraordinaryhow many centuries have been necessary before man could pass from the brutal state to his present condition or how many ages will be required ere we may pass from the state of man to the state of angels what the deuce is the use of chronology or philosophy we were beasts and we cant tell when our tails dropped off we shall be angels but when our wings are to begin to sprout who knows in the meantime o man of genius follow our counsel lead an easy life dont stick at trifles never mind about duty it is only made for slaves if the world reproach you reproach the world in return you have a good loud tongue in your head if your straightlaced morals injure your mental respiration fling off the oldfashioned stays and leave your free limbs to rise and fall as nature pleases and when you have grown pretty sick of your liberty and yet unfit to return to restraint curse the world and scorn it and be miserable like my lord byron and other philosophers of his kidney or else mount a step higher and with conceit still more monstrous and mental vision still more wretchedly debauched and weak begin suddenly to find yourself afflicted with a maudlin compassion for the human race and a desire to set them right after your own fashion there is the quarrelsome stage of drunkenness when a man can as yet walk and speak when he can call names and fling plates and wineglasses at his neighbors head with a pretty good aim after this comes the pathetic stage when the patient becomes wondrous philanthropic and weeps wildly as he lies in the gutter and fancies he is at home in bedwhere he ought to be but this is an allegory  i dont wish to carry this any farther or to say a word in defence of the doctrine which mrs dudevant has found incompletehere at least is not the place for discussing its merits any more than mrs sands book was the place for exposing forsooth its errors our business is only with the day and the new novels and the clever or silly people who write them oh if they but knew their places and would keep to them and drop their absurd philosophical jargon not all the big words in the world can make mrs sand talk like a philosopher when will she go back to her old trade of which she was the very ablest practitioner in france  i should have been glad to give some extracts from the dramatic and descriptive parts of the novel that cannot in point of style and beauty be praised too highly one must sufficeit is the descent of alexis to seek that unlucky manuscript spiridion  it seemed to me he begins that the descent was eternal and that i was burying myself in the depths of erebus at last i reached a level placeand i heard a mournful voice deliver these words as it were to the secret centre of the earthhe will mount that ascent no moreimmediately i heard arise towards me from the depth of invisible abysses a myriad of formidable voices united in a strange chantlet us destroy him let him be destroyed what does he here among the dead let him be delivered back to torture let him be given again to life  then a feeble light began to pierce the darkness and i perceived that i stood on the lowest step of a staircase vast as the foot of a mountain behind me were thousands of steps of lurid iron before me nothing but a voidan abyss and ether the blue gloom of midnight beneath my feet as above my head i became delirious and quitting that staircase which methought it was impossible for me to reascend i sprung forth into the void with an execration but immediately when i had uttered the curse the void began to be filled with forms and colors and i presently perceived that i was in a vast gallery along which i advanced trembling there was still darkness round me but the hollows of the vaults gleamed with a red light and showed me the strange and hideous forms of their building i did not distinguish the nearest objects but those towards which i advanced assumed an appearance more and more ominous and my terror increased with every step i took the enormous pillars which supported the vault and the tracery thereof itself were figures of men of supernatural stature delivered to tortures without a name some hung by their feet and locked in the coils of monstrous serpents clenched their teeth in the marble of the pavement others fastened by their waists were dragged upwards these by their feet those by their heads towards capitals where other figures stooped towards them eager to torment them other pillars again represented a struggling mass of figures devouring one another each of which only offered a trunk severed to the knees or to the shoulders the fierce heads whereof retained life enough to seize and devour that which was near them there were some who half hanging down agonized themselves by attempting with their upper limbs to flay the lower moiety of their bodies which drooped from the columns or were attached to the pedestals and others who in their fight with each other were dragged along by morsels of fleshgrasping which they clung to each other with a countenance of unspeakable hate and agony along or rather in place of the frieze there were on either side a range of unclean beings wearing the human form but of a loathsome ugliness busied in tearing human corpses to piecesin feasting upon their limbs and entrails from the vault instead of bosses and pendants hung the crushed and wounded forms of children as if to escape these eaters of mans flesh they would throw themselves downwards and be dashed to pieces on the pavement the silence and motionlessness of the whole added to its awfulness i became so faint with terror that i stopped and would fain have returned but at that moment i heard from the depths of the gloom through which i had passed confused noises like those of a multitude on its march and the sounds soon became more distinct and the clamor fiercer and the steps came hurrying on tumultuouslyat every new burst nearer more violent more threatening i thought that i was pursued by this disorderly crowd and i strove to advance hurrying into the midst of those dismal sculptures then it seemed as if those figures began to heaveand to sweat bloodand their beady eyes to move in their sockets at once i beheld that they were all looking upon me that they were all leaning towards mesome with frightful derision others with furious aversion every arm was raised against me and they made as though they would crush me with the quivering limbs they had torn one from the other  it is indeed a pity that the poor fellow gave himself the trouble to go down into damp unwholesome graves for the purpose of fetching up a few trumpery sheets of manuscript and if the public has been rather tired with their contents and is disposed to ask why mrs sands religious or irreligious notions are to be brought forward to people who are quite satisfied with their own we can only say that this lady is the representative of a vast class of her countrymen whom the wits and philosophers of the eighteenth century have brought to this condition the leaves of the diderot and rousseau tree have produced this goodly fruit here it is ripe bursting and ready to falland how to fall heaven send that it may drop easily for all can see that the time is come     the case of peytel  in a letter to edward briefless esquire of pump court temple   paris november 1839  my dear brieflesstwo months since when the act of accusation first appeared containing the sum of the charges against sebastian peytel all paris was in a fervor on the subject the mans trial speedily followed and kept for three days the public interest wound up to a painful point he was found guilty of double murder at the beginning of september and since that time what with marotos disaffection and turkish news we have had leisure to forget monsieur peytel and to occupy ourselves with greek text omitted perhaps monsieur de balzac helped to smother what little sparks of interest might still have remained for the murderous notary balzac put forward a letter in his favor so very long so very dull so very pompous promising so much and performing so little that the parisian public gave up peytel and his case altogether nor was it until today that some small feeling was raised concerning him when the newspapers brought the account how peytels head had been cut off at bourg  he had gone through the usual miserable ceremonies and delays which attend what is called in this country the march of justice he had made his appeal to the court of cassation which had taken time to consider the verdict of the provincial court and had confirmed it he had made his appeal for mercy his poor sister coming up all the way from bourg a sad journey poor thing to have an interview with the king who had refused to see her last monday morning at nine oclock an hour before peytels breakfast the greffier of assize court in company with the curé of bourg waited on him and informed him that he had only three hours to live at twelve oclock peytels head was off his body an executioner from lyons had come over the night before to assist the professional throatcutter of bourg  i am not going to entertain you with any sentimental lamentations for this scoundrels fate or to declare my belief in his innocence as monsieur de balzac has done as far as moral conviction can go the mans guilt is pretty clearly brought home to him but any man who has read the causes célèbres knows that men have been convicted and executed upon evidence ten times more powerful than that which was brought against peytel his own account of his horrible case may be true there is nothing adduced in the evidence which is strong enough to overthrow it it is a serious privilege god knows that society takes upon itself at any time to deprive one of gods creatures of existence but when the slightest doubt remains what a tremendous risk does it incur in england thank heaven the law is more wise and more merciful an english jury would never have taken a mans blood upon such testimony an english judge and crown advocate would never have acted as these frenchmen have done the latter inflaming the public mind by exaggerated appeals to their passions the former seeking in every way to draw confessions from the prisoner to perplex and confound him to do away by fierce crossquestioning and bitter remarks from the bench with any effect that his testimony might have on the jury i dont mean to say that judges and lawyers have been more violent and inquisitorial against the unhappy peytel than against any one else it is the fashion of the country a man is guilty until he proves himself to be innocent and to batter down his defence if he have any there are the lawyers with all their horrible ingenuity and their captivating passionate eloquence it is hard thus to set the skilful and tried champions of the law against men unused to this kind of combat nay give a man all the legal aid that he can purchase or procure still by this plan you take him at a cruel unmanly disadvantage he has to fight against the law clogged with the dreadful weight of his presupposed guilt thank god that in england things are not managed so  however i am not about to entertain you with ignorant disquisitions about the law peytels case may nevertheless interest you for the tale is a very stirring and mysterious one and you may see how easy a thing it is for a mans life to be talked away in france if ever he should happen to fall under the suspicion of a crime the french acte daccusation begins in the following manner  of all the events which in these latter times have afflicted the department of the ain there is none which has caused a more profound and lively sensation than the tragical death of the lady félicité alcazar wife of sebastian benedict peytel notary at belley at the end of october 1838 madame peytel quitted that town with her husband and their servant louis rey in order to pass a few days at macon at midnight the inhabitants of belley were suddenly awakened by the arrival of monsieur peytel by his cries and by the signs which he exhibited of the most lively agitation he implored the succors of all the physicians in the town knocked violently at their doors rung at the bells of their houses with a sort of frenzy and announced that his wife stretched out and dying in his carriage had just been shot on the lyons road by his domestic whose life peytel himself had taken  at this recital a number of persons assembled and what a spectacle was presented to their eyes  a young woman lay at the bottom of a carriage deprived of life her whole body was wet and seemed as if it had just been plunged into the water she appeared to be severely wounded in the face and her garments which were raised up in spite of the cold and rainy weather left the upper part of her knees almost entirely exposed at the sight of this halfnaked and inanimate body all the spectators were affected people said that the first duty to pay to a dying woman was to preserve her from the cold to cover her a physician examined the body he declared that all remedies were useless that madame peytel was dead and cold  the entreaties of peytel were redoubled he demanded fresh succors and giving no heed to the fatal assurance which had just been given him required that all the physicians in the place should be sent for a scene so strange and so melancholy the incoherent account given by peytel of the murder of his wife his extraordinary movements and the avowal which he continued to make that he had despatched the murderer rey with strokes of his hammer excited the attention of lieutenant wolf commandant of gendarmes that officer gave orders for the immediate arrest of peytel but the latter threw himself into the arms of a friend who interceded for him and begged the police not immediately to seize upon his person  the corpse of madame peytel was transported to her apartment the bleeding body of the domestic was likewise brought from the road where it lay and peytel asked to explain the circumstance did so  now as there is little reason to tell the reader when an english counsel has to prosecute a prisoner on the part of the crown for a capital offence he produces the articles of his accusation in the most moderate terms and especially warns the jury to give the accused person the benefit of every possible doubt that the evidence may give or may leave see how these things are managed in france and how differently the french counsel for the crown sets about his work  he first prepares his act of accusation the opening of which we have just read it is published six days before the trial so that an unimpassioned unprejudiced jury has ample time to study it and to form its opinions accordingly and to go into court with a happy just prepossession against the prisoner  read the first part of the peytel act of accusation it is as turgid and declamatory as a bad romance and as inflated as a newspaper document by an unlimited pennyalinerthe department of the ain is in a dreadful state of excitement the inhabitants of belley come trooping from their bedsand what a sight do they beholda young woman at the bottom of a carriage toute ruisselante just out of a river her garments in spite of the cold and rain raised so as to leave the upper part of her knees entirely exposed at which all the beholders were affected and cried that the first duty was to cover her from the cold this settles the case at once the first duty of a man is to cover the legs of the sufferer the second to call for help the eloquent substitut du procureur du roi has prejudged the case in the course of a few sentences he is putting his readers among whom his future jury is to be found into a proper state of mind he works on them with pathetic description just as a romancewriter would the rain pours in torrents it is a dreary evening in november the young creatures situation is neatly described the distrust which entered into the breast of the keen old officer of gendarmes strongly painted the suspicions which might or might not have been entertained by the inhabitants eloquently argued how did the advocate know that the people had such did all the bystanders say aloud i suspect that this is a case of murder by monsieur peytel and that his story about the domestic is all deception or did they go off to the mayor and register their suspicion or was the advocate there to hear them not he but he paints you the whole scene as though it had existed and gives full accounts of suspicions as if they had been facts positive patent staring that everybody could see and swear to  having thus primed his audience and prepared them for the testimony of the accused party now says he with a fine show of justice let us hear monsieur peytel and that worthys narrative is given as follows  he said that he had left macon on the 31st october at eleven oclock in the morning in order to return to belley with his wife and servant the latter drove or led an open car he himself was driving his wife in a fourwheeled carriage drawn by one horse they reached bourg at five oclock in the evening left it at seven to sleep at pont dain where they did not arrive before midnight during the journey peytel thought he remarked that rey had slackened his horses pace when they alighted at the inn peytel bade him deposit in his chamber 7500 francs which he carried with him but the domestic refused to do so saying that the inn gates were secure and there was no danger peytel was therefore obliged to carry his money up stairs himself the next day the 1st november they set out on their journey again at nine oclock in the morning louis did not come according to custom to take his masters orders they arrived at tenay about three stopped there a couple of hours to dine and it was eight oclock when they reached the bourg of rossillon where they waited half an hour to bait the horses  as they left rossillon the weather became bad and the rain began to fall peytel told his domestic to get a covering for the articles in the open chariot but rey refused to do so adding in an ironical tone that the weather was fine for some days past peytel had remarked that his servant was gloomy and scarcely spoke at all  after they had gone about 500 paces beyond the bridge of andert that crosses the river furans and ascended to the least steep part of the hill of darde peytel cried out to his servant who was seated in the car to come down from it and finish the ascent on foot  at this moment a violent wind was blowing from the south and the rain was falling heavily peytel was seated back in the right corner of the carriage and his wife who was close to him was asleep with her head on his left shoulder all of a sudden he heard the report of a firearm he had seen the light of it at some paces distance and madame peytel cried out my poor husband take your pistols the horse was frightened and began to trot peytel immediately drew the pistol and fired from the interior of the carriage upon an individual whom he saw running by the side of the road  not knowing as yet that his wife had been hit he jumped out on one side of the carriage while madame peytel descended from the other and he fired a second pistol at his domestic louis rey whom he had just recognized redoubling his pace he came up with rey and struck him from behind a blow with the hammer rey turned at this and raised up his arm to strike his master with the pistol which he had just discharged at him but peytel more quick than he gave the domestic a blow with the hammer which felled him to the ground he fell his face forwards and then peytel bestriding the body despatched him although the brigand asked for mercy  he now began to think of his wife and ran back calling out her name repeatedly and seeking for her in vain on both sides of the road arrived at the bridge of andert he recognized his wife stretched in a field covered with water which bordered the furans this horrible discovery had so much the more astonished him because he had no idea until now that his wife had been wounded he endeavored to draw her from the water and it was only after considerable exertions that he was enabled to do so and to place her with her face towards the ground on the side of the road supposing that here she would be sheltered from any farther danger and believing as yet that she was only wounded he determined to ask for help at a lone house situated on the road towards rossillon and at this instant he perceived without at all being able to explain how that his horse had followed him back to the spot having turned back of its own accord from the road to belley  the house at which he knocked was inhabited by two men of the name of thannet father and son who opened the door to him and whom he entreated to come to his aid saying that his wife had just been assassinated by his servant the elder thannet approached to and examined the body and told peytel that it was quite dead he and his son took up the corpse and placed it in the bottom of the carriage which they all mounted themselves and pursued their route to belley in order to do so they had to pass by reys body on the road which peytel wished to crush under the wheels of his carriage it was to rob him of 7500 francs said peytel that the attack had been made  our friend the procureurs substitut has dropped here the eloquent and pathetic style altogether and only gives the unlucky prisoners narrative in the baldest and most unimaginative style how is a jury to listen to such a fellow they ought to condemn him if but for making such an uninteresting statement why not have helped poor peytel with some of those rhetorical graces which have been so plentifully bestowed in the opening part of the act of accusation he might have said  monsieur peytel is an eminent notary at belley he is a man distinguished for his literary and scientific acquirements he has lived long in the best society of the capital he had been but a few months married to that young and unfortunate lady whose loss has plunged her bereaved husband into despairalmost into madness some early differences had marked it is true the commencement of their union but these which as can be proved by evidence were almost all the unhappy ladys faulthad happily ceased to give place to sentiments far more delightful and tender gentlemen madame peytel bore in her bosom a sweet pledge of future concord between herself and her husband in three brief months she was to become a mother  in the exercise of his honorable professionin which to succeed a man must not only have high talents but undoubted probityand gentlemen monsieur peytel did succeeddid inspire respect and confidence as you his neighbors well knowin the exercise i say of his high calling monsieur peytel towards the end of october last had occasion to make a journey in the neighborhood and visit some of his many clients  he travelled in his own carriage his young wife beside him does this look like want of affection gentlemen or is it not a mark of loveof love and paternal care on his part towards the being with whom his lot in life was linkedthe mother of his coming childthe young girl who had everything to gain from the union with a man of his attainments of intellect his kind temper his great experience and his high position in this manner they travelled side by side lovingly together monsieur peytel was not a lawyer merely but a man of letters and varied learning of the noble and sublime science of geology he was especially an ardent devotee  suppose here a short panegyric upon geology allude to the creation of this mighty world and then naturally to the creator fancy the conversations which peytel a religious man might have with his young wife upon the subject        he always went to mass it is in the evidence  monsieur peytel had lately taken into his service a man named louis rey rey was a foundling and had passed many years in a regimenta school gentlemen where much besides bravery alas is taught nay where the spirit which familiarizes one with notions of battle and death i fear may familiarize one with ideas too of murder rey a dashing reckless fellow from the army had lately entered peytels service was treated by him with the most singular kindness accompanied him having charge of another vehicle upon the journey before alluded to and knew that his master carried with him a considerable sum of money for a man like rey an enormous sum 7500 francs at midnight on the 1st of november as madame peytel and her husband were returning home an attack was made upon their carriage remember gentlemen the hour at which the attack was made remember the sum of money that was in the carriage and remember that the savoy frontier is within a league of the spot where the desperate deed was done  now my dear briefless ought not monsieur procureur in common justice to peytel after he had so eloquently proclaimed not the facts but the suspicions which weighed against that worthy to have given a similar florid account of the prisoners case instead of this you will remark that it is the advocates endeavor to make peytels statements as uninteresting in style as possible and then he demolishes them in the following way  scarcely was peytels statement known when the common sense of the public rose against it peytel had commenced his story upon the bridge of andert over the cold body of his wife on the 2nd november he had developed it in detail in the presence of the physicians in the presence of the assembled neighborsof the persons who on the day previous only were his friends finally he had completed it in his interrogatories his conversations his writings and letters to the magistrates and everywhere these words repeated so often were only received with a painful incredulity the fact was that besides the singular character which peytels appearance attitude and talk had worn ever since the event there was in his narrative an inexplicable enigma its contradictions and impossibilities were such that calm persons were revolted at it and that even friendship itself refused to believe it  thus mr attorney speaks not for himself alone but for the whole french public whose opinions of course he knows peytels statement is discredited everywhere the statement which he had made over the cold body of his wifethe monster it is not enough simply to prove that the man committed the murder but to make the jury violently angry against him and cause them to shudder in the jurybox as he exposes the horrid details of the crime  justice goes on mr substitute who answers for the feelings of everybody disturbed by the preoccupations of public opinion commenced without delay the most active researches the bodies of the victims were submitted to the investigations of men of art the wounds and projectiles were examined the place where the event took place explored with care the morality of the author of this frightful scene became the object of rigorous examination the exigeances of the prisoner the forms affected by him his calculating silence and his answers coldly insulting were feeble obstacles and justice at length arrived by its prudence and by the discoveries it made to the most cruel point of certainty  you see that a mans demeanor is here made a crime against him and that mr substitute wishes to consider him guilty because he has actually the audacity to hold his tongue now follows a touching description of the domestic louis rey   louis rey a child of the hospital at lyons was confided at a very early age to some honest country people with whom he stayed until he entered the army at their house and during this long period of time his conduct his intelligence and the sweetness of his manners were such that the family of his guardians became to him as an adopted family and his departure caused them the most sincere affliction when louis quitted the army he returned to his benefactors and was received as a son they found him just as they had ever known him i acknowledge that this pathos beats my humble defence of peytel entirely except that he had learned to read and write and the certificates of his commanders proved him to be a good and gallant soldier  the necessity of creating some resources for himself obliged him to quit his friends and to enter the service of monsieur de montrichard a lieutenant of gendarmerie from whom he received fresh testimonials of regard louis it is true might have a fondness for wine and a passion for women but he had been a soldier and these faults were according to the witnesses amply compensated for by his activity his intelligence and the agreeable manner in which he performed his service in the month of july 1839 rey quitted voluntarily the service of m de montrichard and peytel about this period meeting him at lyons did not hesitate to attach him to his service whatever may be the prisoners present language it is certain that up to the day of louiss death he served peytel with diligence and fidelity  more than once his master and mistress spoke well of him everybody who has worked or been at the house of madame peytel has spoken in praise of his character and indeed it may be said that these testimonials were general  on the very night of the 1st of november and immediately after the catastrophe we remark how peytel begins to make insinuations against his servant and how artfully in order to render them more sure he disseminates them through the different parts of his narrative but in the course of the proceeding these charges have met with a most complete denial thus we find the disobedient servant who at pont dain refused to carry the moneychest to his masters room under the pretext that the gates of the inn were closed securely occupied with tending the horses after their long journey meanwhile peytel was standing by and neither master nor servant exchanged a word and the witnesses who beheld them both have borne testimony to the zeal and care of the domestic  in like manner we find that the servant who was so remiss in the morning as to neglect to go to his master for orders was ready for departure before seven oclock and had eagerly informed himself whether monsieur and madame peytel were awake learning from the maid of the inn that they had ordered nothing for their breakfast this man who refused to carry with him a covering for the car was on the contrary ready to take off his own cloak and with it shelter articles of small value this man who had been for many days so silent and gloomy gave on the contrary many proofs of his gayetyalmost of his indiscretion speaking at all the inns in terms of praise of his master and mistress the waiter at the inn at dauphin says he was a tall young fellow mild and goodnatured we talked for some time about horses and such things he seemed to be perfectly natural and not preoccupied at all at pont dain he talked of his being a foundling of the place where he had been brought up and where he had served and finally at rossillon an hour before his death he conversed familiarly with the master of the port and spoke on indifferent subjects  all peytels insinuations against his servant had no other end than to show in every point of reys conduct the behavior of a man who was premeditating attack of what in fact does he accuse him of wishing to rob him of 7500 francs and of having had recourse to assassination in order to effect the robbery but for a premeditated crime consider what singular improvidence the person showed who had determined on committing it what folly and what weakness there is in the execution of it  how many insurmountable obstacles are there in the way of committing and profiting by crime on leaving belley louis rey according to peytels statement knowing that his master would return with money provided himself with a holster pistol which madame peytel had once before perceived among his effects in peytels cabinet there were some balls four of these were found in reys trunk on the 6th of november and in order to commit the crime this domestic had brought away with him a pistol and no ammunition for peytel has informed us that rey an hour before his departure from macon purchased six balls at a gunsmiths to gain his point the assassin must immolate his victims for this he has only one pistol knowing perfectly well that peytel in all his travels had two on his person knowing that at a late hour of the night his shot might fail of effect and that in this case he would be left to the mercy of his opponent  the execution of the crime is according to peytels account still more singular louis does not get off the carriage until peytel tells him to descend he does not think of taking his masters life until he is sure that the latter has his eyes open it is dark and the pair are covered in one cloak and rey only fires at them at six paces distance he fires at hazard without disquieting himself as to the choice of his victim and the soldier who was bold enough to undertake this double murder has not force nor courage to consummate it he flies carrying in his hand a useless whip with a heavy mantle on his shoulders in spite of the detonation of two pistols at his ears and the rapid steps of an angry master in pursuit which ought to have set him upon some better means of escape and we find this man full of youth and vigor lying with his face to the ground in the midst of a public road falling without a struggle or resistance under the blows of a hammer  and suppose the murderer had succeeded in his criminal projects what fruit could he have drawn from themleaving on the road the two bleeding bodies obliged to lead two carriages at a time for fear of discovery not able to return himself after all the pains he had taken to speak at every place at which they had stopped of the money which his master was carrying with him too prudent to appear alone at belley arrested at the frontier by the excise officers who would present an impassable barrier to him till morning what could he do or hope to do the examination of the car has shown that rey at the moment of the crime had neither linen nor clothes nor effects of any kind there was found in his pockets when the body was examined no passport nor certificate one of his pockets contained a ball of large calibre which he had shown in play to a girl at the inn at macon a little hornhandled knife a snuffbox a little packet of gunpowder and a purse containing only a halfpenny and some string here is all the baggage with which after the execution of his homicidal plan louis rey intended to take refuge in a foreign country beside these absurd contradictions there is another remarkable fact which must not be passed over it is thisthe pistol found by rey is of antique form and the original owner of it has been found he is a curiositymerchant at lyons and though he cannot affirm that peytel was the person who bought this pistol of him he perfectly recognizes peytel as having been a frequent customer at his shop        this sentence is taken from another part of the acte      daccusation  no we may fearlessly affirm that louis rey was not guilty of the crime which peytel lays to his charge if to those who knew him his mild and open disposition his military career modest and without a stain the touching regrets of his employers are sufficient proofs of his innocencethe calm and candid observer who considers how the crime was conceived was executed and what consequences would have resulted from it will likewise acquit him and free him of the odious imputation which peytel endeavors to cast upon his memory  but justice has removed the veil with which an impious hand endeavored to cover itself already on the night of the 1st of november suspicion was awakened by the extraordinary agitation of peytel by those excessive attentions towards his wife which came so late by that excessive and noisy grief and by those calculated bursts of sorrow which are such as nature does not exhibit the criminal whom the public conscience had fixed upon the man whose frightful combinations have been laid bare and whose falsehoods step by step have been exposed during the proceedings previous to the trial the murderer at whose hands a heartstricken family and society at large demands an account of the blood of a wifethat murderer is peytel  when my dear briefless you are a judge as i make no doubt you will be when you have left off the club all night cigarsmoking of mornings and reading novels in bed will you ever find it in your heart to order a fellowsinners head off upon such evidence as this because a romantic substitut du procureur de roi chooses to compose and recite a little drama and draw tears from juries let us hope that severe rhadamanthine judges are not to be melted by such trumpery one wants but the description of the characters to render the piece complete as thus           personages                             costumes     sebastian peytal  meurtrier        habillement complet de notaire

minuit  la pluie tombe les tonnerres grondent  le ciel est    convert de nuages et sillonné déclairs   all these personages are brought into play in the procureurs drama the villagers come in with their chorus the old lieutenant of gendarmes with his suspicions reys frankness and gayety the romantic circumstances of his birth his gallantry and fidelity are all introduced in order to form a contrast with peytel and to call down the jurys indignation against the latter but are these proofs or anything like proofs and the suspicions that are to serve instead of proofs what are they  my servant louis rey was very sombre and reserved says peytel he refused to call me in the morning to carry my moneychest to my room to cover the open car when it rained the prosecutor disproves this by stating that rey talked with the inn maids and servants asked if his master was up and stood in the innyard grooming the horses with his master by his side neither speaking to the other might he not have talked to the maids and yet been sombre when speaking to his master might he not have neglected to call his master and yet have asked whether he was awake might he not have said that the inngates were safe out of hearing of the ostler witness mr substitutes answers to peytels statements are no answer at all every word peytel said might be true and yet louis rey might not have committed the murder or every word might have been false and yet louis rey might have committed the murder  then says mr substitute how many obstacles are there to the commission of the crime and these are  1 rey provided himself with one holster pistol to kill two people knowing well that one of them had always a brace of pistols about him  2 he does not think of firing until his masters eyes are open fires at six paces not caring at whom he fires and then runs away  3 he could not have intended to kill his master because he had no passport in his pocket and no clothes and because he must have been detained at the frontier until morning and because he would have had to drive two carriages in order to avoid suspicion  4 and a most singular circumstance the very pistol which was found by his side had been bought at the shop of a man at lyons who perfectly recognized peytel as one of his customers though he could not say he had sold that particular weapon to peytel  does it follow from this that louis rey is not the murderer much more that peytel is look at argument no 1 rey had no need to kill two people he wanted the money and not the blood suppose he had killed peytel would he not have mastered madame peytel easilya weak woman in an excessively delicate situation incapable of much energy at the best of times  2 he does not fire till he knows his masters eyes are open why on a stormy night does a man driving a carriage go to sleep was rey to wait until his master snored he fires at six paces not caring whom he hitsand might not this happen too the night is not so dark but that he can see his master in his usual place driving he fires and hitswhom madame peytel who had left her place and was wrapped up with peytel in his cloak she screams out husband take your pistols rey knows that his master has a brace thinks that he has hit the wrong person and as peytel fires on him runs away peytel follows hammer in hand as he comes up with the fugitive he deals him a blow on the back of the head and rey fallshis face to the ground is there anything unnatural in this storyanything so monstrously unnatural that is that it might not be true  3 these objections are absurd why need a man have change of linen if he had taken none for the journey why should he want any for the escape why need he drive two carriageshe might have driven both into the river and mrs peytel in one why is he to go to the douane and thrust himself into the very jaws of danger are there not a thousand ways for a man to pass a frontier do smugglers when they have to pass from one country to another choose exactly those spots where a police is placed  and finally the gunsmith of lyons who knows peytel quite well cannot say that he sold the pistol to him that is he did not sell the pistol to him for you have only one mans word in this case peytels to the contrary and the testimony as far as it goes is in his favor i say my lud and gentlemen of the jury that these objections of my learned friend who is engaged for the crown are absurd frivolous monstrous that to suspect away the life of a man upon such suppositions as these is wicked illegal and inhuman and what is more that louis rey if he wanted to commit the crimeif he wanted to possess himself of a large sum of money chose the best time and spot for so doing and no doubt would have succeeded if fate had not in a wonderful manner caused madame peytel to take her husbands place and receive the ball intended for him in her own head  but whether these suspicions are absurd or not hit or miss it is the advocates duty as it appears to urge them he wants to make as unfavorable an impression as possible with regard to peytels character he therefore must for contrasts sake give all sorts of praise to his victim and awaken every sympathy in the poor fellows favor having done this as far as lies in his power having exaggerated every circumstance that can be unfavorable to peytel and given his own tale in the baldest manner possiblehaving declared that peytel is the murderer of his wife and servant the crown now proceeds to back this assertion by showing what interested motives he had and by relating after its own fashion the circumstances of his marriage  they may be told briefly here peytel was of a good family of macon and entitled at his mothers death to a considerable property he had been educated as a notary and had lately purchased a business in that line in belley for which he had paid a large sum of money part of the sum 15000 francs for which he had given bills was still due  near belley peytel first met félicité alcazar who was residing with her brotherinlaw monsieur de montrichard and knowing that the young ladys fortune was considerable he made an offer of marriage to the brotherinlaw who thought the match advantageous and communicated on the subject with félicités mother madame alcazar at paris after a time peytel went to paris to press his suit and was accepted there seems to have been no affectation of love on his side and some little repugnance on the part of the lady who yielded however to the wishes of her parents and was married the parties began to quarrel on the very day of the marriage and continued their disputes almost to the close of the unhappy connection félicité was half blind passionate sarcastic clumsy in her person and manners and ill educated peytel a man of considerable intellect and pretensions who had lived for some time at paris where he had mingled with good literary society the lady was in fact as disagreeable a person as could well be and the evidence describes some scenes which took place between her and her husband showing how deeply she must have mortified and enraged him  a charge very clearly made out against peytel is that of dishonesty he procured from the notary of whom he bought his place an acquittance in full whereas there were 15000 francs owing as we have seen he also in the contract of marriage which was to have resembled in all respects that between monsieur broussais and another demoiselle alcazar caused an alteration to be made in his favor which gave him command over his wifes funded property without furnishing the guarantees by which the other soninlaw was bound and almost immediately after his marriage peytel sold out of the funds a sum of 50000 francs that belonged to his wife and used it for his own purposes  about two months after his marriage peytel pressed his wife to make her will he had made his he said leaving everything to her in case of his death after some parley the poor thing consented this is a cruel suspicion against him and mr substitute has no need to enlarge upon it as for the previous fact the dishonest statement about the 15000 francs there is nothing murderous in thatnothing which a man very eager to make a good marriage might not do the same may be said of the suppression in peytels marriage contract of the clause to be found in broussaiss placing restrictions upon the use of the wifes money mademoiselle dalcazars friends read the contract before they signed it and might have refused it had they so pleased        peytel says the act of accusation did not fail to see      the danger which would menace him if this will which had      escaped the magistrates in their search of peytels papers      was discovered he therefore instructed his agent to take      possession of it which he did and the fact was not      mentioned for several months afterwards peytel and his      agent were called upon to explain the circumstance but      refused and their silence for a long time interrupted the      instruction getting up of the evidence all that could      be obtained from them was an avowal that such a will      existed constituting peytel his wifes sole legatee and a      promise on their parts to produce it before the court gave      its sentence but why keep the will secret the anxiety      about it was surely absurd and unnecessary the whole of      madame peytels family knew that such a will was made she      had consulted her sister concerning it who saidif there      is no other way of satisfying him make the will and the      mother when she heard of it cried outdoes he intend to      poison her  after some disputes which took place between peytel and his wife there were continual quarrels and continual letters passing between them from room to room the latter was induced to write him a couple of exaggerated letters swearing by the ashes of her father that she would be an obedient wife to him and entreating him to counsel and direct her these letters were seen by members of the ladys family who in the quarrels between the couple always took the husbands part they were found in peytels cabinet after he had been arrested for the murder and after he had had full access to all his papers of which he destroyed or left as many as he pleased the accusation makes it a matter of suspicion against peytel that he should have left these letters of his wifes in a conspicuous situation  all these circumstances says the accusation throw a frightful light upon peytels plans the letters and will of madame peytel are in the hands of her husband three months pass away and this poor woman is brought to her home in the middle of the night with two balls in her head stretched at the bottom of her carriage by the side of a peasant  what other than sebastian peytel could have committed this murderwhom could it profitwho but himself had an odious chain to break and an inheritance to receive why speak of the servants projected robbery the pistols found by the side of louiss body the balls bought by him at macon and those discovered at belley among his effects were only the result of a perfidious combination the pistol indeed which was found on the hill of darde on the night of the 1st of november could only have belonged to peytel and must have been thrown by him near the body of his domestic with the paper which had before enveloped it who had seen this pistol in the hands of louis among all the gendarmes workwomen domestics employed by peytel and his brotherinlaw is there one single witness who had seen this weapon in louiss possession it is true that madame peytel did on one occasion speak to m de montrichard of a pistol which had nothing to do however with that found near louis rey  is this justice or good reason just reverse the argument and apply it to rey who but rey could have committed this murderwho but rey had a large sum of money to seize upona pistol is found by his side balls and powder in his pocket other balls in his trunks at home the pistol found near his body could not indeed have belonged to peytel did any man ever see it in his possession the very gunsmith who sold it and who knew peytel would he not have known that he had sold him this pistol at his own house peytel has a collection of weapons of all kinds everybody has seen thema man who makes such collections is anxious to display them did any one ever see this weaponnot one and madame peytel did in her lifetime remark a pistol in the valets possession she was shortsighted and could not particularize what kind of pistol it was but she spoke of it to her husband and her brotherinlaw this is not satisfactory if you please but at least it is as satisfactory as the other set of suppositions it is the very chain of argument which would have been brought against louis rey by this very same compiler of the act of accusation had rey survived instead of peytel and had he as most undoubtedly would have been the case been tried for the murder  this argument was shortly put by peytels counselif peytel had been killed by rey in the struggle would you not have found rey guilty of the murder of his master and mistress it is such a dreadful dilemma that i wonder how judges and lawyers could have dared to persecute peytel in the manner which they did  after the act of accusation which lays down all the suppositions against peytel as facts which will not admit the truth of one of the prisoners allegations in his own defence comes the trial the judge is quite as impartial as the preparer of the indictment as will be seen by the following specimens of his interrogatories  judge the act of accusation finds in your statement contradictions improbabilities impossibilities thus your domestic who had determined to assassinate you in order to rob you and who must have calculated upon the consequence of a failure had neither passport nor money upon him this is very unlikely because he could not have gone far with only a single halfpenny which was all he had  prisoner my servant was known and often passed the frontier without a passport  judge your domestic had to assassinate two persons and had no weapon but a single pistol he had no dagger and the only thing found on him was a knife  prisoner in the car there were several turners implements which he might have used  judge but he had not those arms upon him because you pursued him immediately he had according to you only this old pistol  prisoner i have nothing to say  judge your domestic instead of flying into woods which skirt the road ran straight forward on the road itself this again is very unlikely  prisoner this is a conjecture i could answer by another conjecture i can only reason on the facts  judge how far did you pursue him  prisoner i dont know exactly  judge you said two hundred paces  no answer from the prisoner  judge your domestic was young active robust and tall he was ahead of you you were in a carriage from which you had to descend you had to take your pistols from a cushion and then your hammerhow are we to believe that you could have caught him if he ran it is impossible  prisoner i cant explain it i think that rey had some defect in one leg i for my part run tolerably fast  judge at what distance from him did you fire your first shot  prisoner i cant tell  judge perhaps he was not running when you fired  prisoner i saw him running  judge in what position was your wife  prisoner she was leaning on my left arm and the man was on the right side of the carriage  judge the shot must have been fired à bout portant because it burned the eyebrows and lashes entirely the assassin must have passed his pistol across your breast  prisoner the shot was not fired so close i am convinced of it professional gentlemen will prove it  judge that is what you pretend because you understand perfectly the consequences of admitting the fact your wife was hit with two ballsone striking downwards to the right by the nose the other going horizontally through the cheek to the left  prisoner the contrary will be shown by the witnesses called for the purpose  judge it is a very unlucky combination for you that these balls which went you say from the same pistol should have taken two different directions  prisoner i cant dispute about the various combinations of firearmsprofessional persons will be heard  judge according to your statement your wife said to you my poor husband take your pistols  prisoner she did  judge in a manner quite distinct  prisoner yes  judge so distinct that you did not fancy she was hit  prisoner yes that is the fact  judge here again is an impossibility and nothing is more precise than the declaration of the medical men they affirm that your wife could not have spokentheir report is unanimous  prisoner i can only oppose to it quite contrary opinions from professional men also you must hear them  judge what did your wife do next                                        judge you deny the statements of the witnesses they related to peytels demeanor and behavior which the judge wishes to show were very unusualand what if they were here however are some mute witnesses whose testimony you will not perhaps refuse near louis reys body was found a horsecloth a pistol and a whip your domestic must have had this cloth upon him when he went to assassinate you it was wet and heavy an assassin disencumbers himself of anything that is likely to impede him especially when he is going to struggle with a man as young as himself  prisoner my servant had i believe this covering on his body it might be useful to him to keep the priming of his pistol dry  the president caused the cloth to be opened and showed that there was no hook or tie by which it could be held together and that rey must have held it with one hand and in the other his whip and the pistol with which he intended to commit the crime which was impossible  prisoner these are only conjectures  and what conjectures my god upon which to take away the life of a man jeffreys or fouquier tinville could scarcely have dared to make such such prejudice such bitter persecution such priming of the jury such monstrous assumptions and unreasonfancy them coming from an impartial judge the man is worse than the public accuser  rey says the judge could not have committed the murder because he had no money in his pocket to fly in case of failure and what is the precise sum that his lordship thinks necessary for a gentleman to have before he makes such an attempt are the men who murder for money usually in possession of a certain independence before they begin how much money was rey a servant who loved wine and women had been stopping at a score of inns on the road and had probably an annual income of 400 francshow much money was rey likely to have  your servant had to assassinate two persons this i have mentioned before why had he to assassinate two persons when one was enough if he had killed peytel could he not have seized and gagged his wife immediately        m balzacs theory of the case is that rey had intrigued      with madame peytel having known her previous to her      marriage when she was staying in the house of her brother      inlaw monsieur de montrichard where rey had been a      servant  your domestic ran straight forward instead of taking to the woods by the side of the rood this is very unlikely how does his worship know can any judge however enlightened tell the exact road that a man will take who has just missed a coup of murder and is pursued by a man who is firing pistols at him and has a judge a right to instruct a jury in this way as to what they shall or shall not believe  you have to run after an active man who has the start of you to jump out of a carriage to take your pistols and then your hammer this is impossible by heavens does it not make a mans blood boil to read such blundering bloodseeking sophistry this man when it suits him shows that rey would be slow in his motions and when it suits him declares that rey ought to be quick declares ex cathedrâ what pace rey should go and what direction he should take shows in a breath that he must have run faster than peytel and then that he could not run fast because the cloak clogged him settles how he is to be dressed when he commits a murder and what money he is to have in his pocket gives these impossible suppositions to the jury and tells them that the previous statements are impossible and finally informs them of the precise manner in which rey must have stood holding his horsecloth in one hand his whip and pistol in the other when he made the supposed attempt at murder now what is the size of a horsecloth is it as big as a pockethandkerchief is there no possibility that it might hang over one shoulder that the whip should be held under that very arm did you never see a carter so carry it his hands in his pockets all the while is it monstrous abhorrent to nature that a man should fire a pistol from under a cloak on a rainy daythat he should after firing the shot be frightened and run run straight before him with the cloak on his shoulders and the weapon in his hand peytels story is possible and very possible it is almost probable allow that rey had the cloth on and you allow that he must have been clogged in his motions that peytel may have come up with himfelled him with a blow of the hammer the doctors say that he would have so fallen by one blowhe would have fallen on his face as he was found the paper might have been thrust into his breast and tumbled out as he fell circumstances far more impossible have occurred ere this and men have been hanged for them who were as innocent of the crime laid to their charge as the judge on the bench who convicted them  in like manner peytel may not have committed the crime charged to him and mr judge with his arguments as to possibilities and impossibilitiesmr public prosecutor with his romantic narrative and inflammatory harangues to the jurymay have used all these powers to bring to death an innocent man from the animus with which the case had been conducted from beginning to end it was easy to see the result here it is in the words of the provincial paper   bourg 28 october 1839  the condemned peytel has just undergone his punishment which took place four days before the anniversary of his crime the terrible drama of the bridge of andert which cost the life of two persons has just terminated on the scaffold midday had just sounded on the clock of the palais the same clock tolled midnight when on the 30th of august his sentence was pronounced  since the rejection of his appeal in cassation on which his principal hopes were founded peytel spoke little of his petition to the king the notion of transportation was that which he seemed to cherish most however he made several inquiries from the gaoler of the prison when he saw him at mealtime with regard to the place of execution the usual hour and other details on the subject from that period the words champ de foire the fairfield where the execution was to be held were frequently used by him in conversation  yesterday the idea that the time had arrived seemed to be more strongly than ever impressed upon him especially after the departure of the curé who latterly has been with him every day the documents connected with the trial had arrived in the morning he was ignorant of this circumstance but sought to discover from his guardians what they tried to hide from him and to find out whether his petition was rejected and when he was to die  yesterday also he had written to demand the presence of his counsel m margerand in order that he might have some conversation with him and regulate his affairs before he  he did not write down the word but left in its place a few points of the pen  in the evening whilst he was at supper he begged earnestly to be allowed a little waxcandle to finish what he was writing otherwise he said time might fail this was a new indirect manner of repeating his ordinary question as light up to that evening had been refused him it was thought best to deny him in this as in former instances otherwise his suspicions might have been confirmed the keeper refused his demand  this morning monday at nine oclock the greffier of the assize court in fulfilment of the painful duty which the law imposes upon him came to the prison in company with the curé of bourg and announced to the convict that his petition was rejected and that he had only three hours to live he received this fatal news with a great deal of calmness and showed himself to be no more affected than he had been on the trial i am ready but i wish they had given me fourandtwenty hours noticewere all the words he used  the greffier now retired leaving peytel alone with the curé who did not thenceforth quit him peytel breakfasted at ten oclock  at eleven a piquet of mounted gendarmerie and infantry took their station upon the place before the prison where a great concourse of people had already assembled an open car was at the door before he went out peytel asked the gaoler for a lookingglass and having examined his face for a moment said at least the inhabitants of bourg will see that i have not grown thin  as twelve oclock sounded the prison gates opened an aide appeared followed by peytel leaning on the arm of the curé peytels face was pale he had a long black beard a blue cap on his head and his greatcoat flung over his shoulders and buttoned at the neck  he looked about at the place and the crowd he asked if the carriage would go at a trot and on being told that that would be difficult he said he would prefer walking and asked what the road was he immediately set out walking at a firm and rapid pace he was not bound at all  an immense crowd of people encumbered the two streets through which he had to pass to the place of execution he cast his eyes alternately upon them and upon the guillotine which was before him  arrived at the foot of the scaffold peytel embraced the curé and bade him adieu he then embraced him again perhaps for his mother and sister he then mounted the steps rapidly and gave himself into the hands of the executioner who removed his coat and cap he asked how he was to place himself and on a sign being made he flung himself briskly on the plank and stretched his neck in another moment he was no more  the crowd which had been quite silent retired profoundly moved by the sight it had witnessed as at all executions there was a very great number of women present  under the scaffold there had been ever since the morning a coffin the family had asked for his remains and had them immediately buried privately and thus the unfortunate mans head escaped the modellers in wax several of whom had arrived to take an impression of it  down goes the axe the poor wretchs head rolls gasping into the basket the spectators go home pondering and mr executioner and his aides have in half an hour removed all traces of the august sacrifice and of the altar on which it had been performed say mr briefless do you think that any single person meditating murder would be deterred therefrom by beholding thisnay a thousand more executions it is not for moral improvement as i take it nor for opportunity to make appropriate remarks upon the punishment of crime that people make a holiday of a killingday and leave their homes and occupations to flock and witness the cutting off of a head do we crowd to see mr macready in the new tragedy or mademoiselle ellssler in her last new ballet and fleshcolored stockinnet pantaloons out of a pure love of abstract poetry and beauty or from a strong notion that we shall be excited in different ways by the actor and the dancer and so as we go to have a meal of fictitious terror at the tragedy of something more questionable in the ballet we go for a glut of blood to the execution the lust is in every mans nature more or less did you ever witness a wrestling or boxing match the first clatter of the kick on the shins or the first drawing of blood makes the stranger shudder a little but soon the blood is his chief enjoyment and he thirsts for it with a fierce delight it is a fine grim pleasure that we have in seeing a man killed and i make no doubt that the organs of destructiveness must begin to throb and swell as we witness the delightful savage spectacle  three or four years back when fieschi and lacenaire were executed i made attempts to see the execution of both but was disappointed in both cases in the first instance the day for fieschis death was purposely kept secret and he was if i remember rightly executed at some remote quarter of the town but it would have done a philanthropist good to witness the scene which we saw on the morning when his execution did not take place  it was carnival time and the rumor had pretty generally been carried abroad that he was to die on that morning a friend who accompanied me came many miles through the mud and dark in order to be in at the death we set out before light floundering through the muddy champs elysées where besides were many other persons floundering and all bent upon the same errand we passed by the concert of musard then held in the rue st honoré and round this in the wet a number of coaches were collected the ball was just up and a crowd of people in hideous masquerade drunk tired dirty dressed in horrible old frippery and daubed with filthy rouge were trooping out of the place tipsy women and men shrieking jabbering gesticulating as french will do parties swaggering staggering forwards arm in arm reeling to and fro across the street and yelling songs in chorus hundreds of these were bound for the show and we thought ourselves lucky in finding a vehicle to the execution place at the barrière denfer as we crossed the river and entered the enfer street crowds of students black workmen and more drunken devils from more carnival balls were filling it and on the grand place there were thousands of these assembled looking out for fiaschi and his cortège we waited and waited but alas no fun for us that morning no throatcutting no august spectacle of satisfied justice and the eager spectators were obliged to return disappointed of their expected breakfast of blood it would have been a fine scene that execution could it but have taken place in the midst of the mad mountebanks and tipsy strumpets who had flocked so far to witness it wishing to wind up the delights of their carnival by a bonnebouche of a murder  the other attempt was equally unfortunate we arrived too late on the ground to be present at the execution of lacenaire and his comate in murder avril but as we came to the ground a gloomy round space within the barrierthree roads lead to it and outside you see the wineshops and restaurateurs of the barrier looking gay and invitingas we came to the ground we only found in the midst of it a little pool of ice just partially tinged with red two or three idle streetboys were dancing and stamping about this pool and when i asked one of them whether the execution had taken place he began dancing more madly than ever and shrieked out with a loud fantastical theatrical voice venez tous messieurs et dames voyez ici le sang du monstre lacenaire et de son compagnon he traître avril or words to that effect and straightway all the other gamins screamed out the words in chorus and took hands and danced round the little puddle  o august justice your meal was followed by a pretty appropriate grace was any man who saw the show deterred or frightened or moralized in any way he had gratified his appetite for blood and this was all there is something singularly pleasing both in the amusement of executionseeing and in the results you are not only delightfully excited at the time but most pleasingly relaxed afterwards the mind which has been wound up painfully until now becomes quite complacent and easy there is something agreeable in the misfortunes of others as the philosopher has told us remark what a good breakfast you eat after an execution how pleasant it is to cut jokes after it and upon it this merry pleasant mood is brought on by the blood tonic  but for gods sake if we are to enjoy this let us do so in moderation and let us at least be sure of a mans guilt before we murder him to kill him even with the full assurance that he is guilty is hazardous enough who gave you the right to do soyou who cry out against suicides as impious and contrary to christian law what use is there in killing him you deter no one else from committing the crime by so doing you give us to be sure half an hours pleasant entertainment but it is a great question whether we derive much moral profit from the sight if you want to keep a murderer from farther inroads upon society are there not plenty of hulks and prisons god wot treadmills galleys and houses of correction above all as in the case of sebastian peytel and his family there have been two deaths already was a third death absolutely necessary and taking the fallibility of judges and lawyers into his heart and remembering the thousand instances of unmerited punishment that have been suffered upon similar and stronger evidence before can any man declare positively and upon his oath that peytel was guilty and that this was not the third murder in the family     four imitations of bÉranger     le roi dyvetot

subdivide as much as you please  there is the old classical drama wellnigh dead and full time too old tragedies in which half a dozen characters appear and spout sonorous alexandrines for half a dozen hours the fair rachel has been trying to revive this genre and to untomb racine but be not alarmed racine will never come to life again and cause audiences to weep as of yore madame rachel can only galvanize the corpse not revivify it ancient french tragedy redheeled patched and beperiwigged lies in the grave and it is only the ghost of it that we see which the fair jewess has raised there are classical comedies in verse too wherein the knavish valets rakish heroes stolid old guardians and smart freespoken servingwomen discourse in alexandrines as loud as the horaces or the cid an englishman will seldom reconcile himself to the roulement of the verses and the painful recurrence of the rhymes for my part i had rather go to madame saquis or see deburau dancing on a rope his lines are quite as natural and poetical  then there is the comedy of the day of which monsieur scribe is the father good heavens with what a number of gay colonels smart widows and silly husbands has that gentleman peopled the playbooks how that unfortunate seventh commandment has been maltreated by him and his disciples you will see four pieces at the gymnase of a night and so sure as you see them four husbands shall be wickedly used when is this joke to cease mon dieu playwriters have handled it for about two thousand years and the public like a great baby must have the tale repeated to it over and over again  finally there is the drama that great monster which has sprung into life of late years and which is said but i dont believe a word of it to have shakspeare for a father if monsieur scribes plays may be said to be so many ingenious examples how to break one commandment the drame is a grand and general chaos of them all nay several crimes are added not prohibited in the decalogue which was written before dramas were of the drama victor hugo and dumas are the wellknown and respectable guardians every piece victor hugo has written since hernani has contained a monstera delightful monster saved by one virtue there is triboulet a foolish monster lucrèce borgia a maternal monster mary tudor a religious monster monsieur quasimodo a humpback monster and others that might be named whose monstrosities we are induced to pardonnay admiringly to witnessbecause they are agreeably mingled with some exquisite display of affection and as the great hugo has one monster to each play the great dumas has ordinarily half a dozen to whom murder is nothing common intrigue and simple breakage of the beforementioned commandment nothing but who live and move in a vast delightful complication of crime that cannot be easily conceived in england much less described  when i think over the number of crimes that i have seen mademoiselle georges for instance commit i am filled with wonder at her greatness and the greatness of the poets who have conceived these charming horrors for her i have seen her make love to and murder her sons in the tour de nesle i have seen her poison a company of no less than nine gentlemen at ferrara with an affectionate son in the number i have seen her as madame de brinvilliers kill off numbers of respectable relations in the first four acts and at the last be actually burned at the stake to which she comes shuddering ghastly barefooted and in a white sheet sweet excitement of tender sympathies such tragedies are not so good as a real downright execution but in point of interest the next thing to it with what a number of moral emotions do they fill the breast with what a hatred for vice and yet a true pity and respect for that grain of virtue that is to be found in us all our bloody daughterloving brinvilliers our warmhearted poisonous lucretia borgia above all what a smart appetite for a cool supper afterwards at the café anglais when the horrors of the play act as a piquant sauce to the supper  or to speak more seriously and to come at last to the point after having seen most of the grand dramas which have been produced at paris for the last halfdozen years and thinking over all that one has seenthe fictitious murders rapes adulteries and other crimes by which one has been interested and exciteda man may take leave to be heartily ashamed of the manner in which he has spent his time and of the hideous kind of mental intoxication in which he has permitted himself to indulge  nor are simple society outrages the only sort of crime in which the spectator of paris plays has permitted himself to indulge he has recreated himself with a deal of blasphemy besides and has passed many pleasant evenings in beholding religion defiled and ridiculed  allusion has been made in a former paper to a fashion that lately obtained in france and which went by the name of catholic reaction and as in this happy country fashion is everything we have had not merely catholic pictures and quasi religious books but a number of catholic plays have been produced very edifying to the frequenters of the theatres or the boulevards who have learned more about religion from these performances than they have acquired no doubt in the whole of their lives before in the course of a very few years we have seenthe wandering jew belshazzars feast nebuchadnezzar and the massacre of the innocents joseph and his brethren the passage of the red sea and the deluge  the great dumas like madame sand before mentioned has brought a vast quantity of religion before the footlights there was his famous tragedy of caligula which be it spoken to the shame of the paris critics was coldly received nay actually hissed by them and why because says dumas it contained a great deal too much piety for the rogues the public he says was much more religious and understood him at once  as for the critics says he nobly let those who cried out against the immorality of antony and marguérite de bourgogne reproach me for the chastity of messalina this dear creature is the heroine of the play of caligula it matters little to me these people have but seen the form of my work they have walked round the tent but have not seen the arch which it covered they have examined the vases and candles of the altar but have not opened the tabernacle  the public alone has instinctively comprehended that there was beneath this outward sign an inward and mysterious grace it followed the action of the piece in all its serpentine windings it listened for four hours with pious attention avec recueillement et religion to the sound of this rolling river of thoughts which may have appeared to it new and bold perhaps but chaste and grave and it retired with its head on its breast like a man who had just perceived in a dream the solution of a problem which he has long and vainly sought in his waking hours  you see that not only saint sand is an apostle in her way but saint dumas is another we have people in england who write for bread like dumas and sand and are paid so much for their line but they dont set up for prophets mrs trollope has never declared that her novels are inspired by heaven mr buckstone has written a great number of farces and never talked about the altar and the tabernacle even sir edward bulwer who on a similar occasion when the critics found fault with a play of his answered them by a pretty decent declaration of his own merits never ventured to say that he had received a divine mission and was uttering fiveact revelations  all things considered the tragedy of caligula is a decent tragedy as decent as the decent characters of the hero and heroine can allow it to be it may be almost said provokingly decent but this it must be remembered is the characteristic of the modern french school nay of the english school too and if the writer take the character of a remarkable scoundrel it is ten to one but he turns out an amiable fellow in whom we have all the warmest sympathy caligula is killed at the end of the performance messalina is comparatively wellbehaved and the sacred part of the performance the tabernaclecharacters apart from the mere vase and candlestick personages may be said to be depicted in the person of a christian convert stella who has had the good fortune to be converted by no less a person than mary magdalene when she stella was staying on a visit to her aunt near narbonne   stella continuant voilà que je vois savancer sans pilote et sans rames une barque

no inclination to enter the tabernacle in company with such a spotless highpriest as monsieur dumas  something tabernacular may be found in dumass famous piece of don juan de marana the poet has laid the scene of his play in a vast number of places in heaven where we have the virgin mary and little angels in blue swinging censers before heron earth under the earth and in a place still lower but not mentionable to ears polite and the plot as it appears from a dialogue between a good and a bad angel with which the play commences turns upon a contest between these two worthies for the possession of the soul of a member of the family of marana  don juan de marana not only resembles his namesake celebrated by mozart and molière in his peculiar successes among the ladies but possesses further qualities which render his character eminently fitting for stage representation he unites the virtues of lovelace and lacenaire he blasphemes upon all occasions he murders at the slightest provocation and without the most trifling remorse he overcomes ladies of rigid virtue ladies of easy virtue and ladies of no virtue at all and the poet inspired by the contemplation of such a character has depicted his heros adventures and conversation with wonderful feeling and truth  the first act of the play contains a halfdozen of murders and intrigues which would have sufficed humbler genius than m dumass for the completion of at least half a dozen tragedies in the second act our hero flogs his elder brother and runs away with his sisterinlaw in the third he fights a duel with a rival and kills him whereupon the mistress of his victim takes poison and dies in great agonies on the stage in the fourth act don juan having entered a church for the purpose of carrying off a nun with whom he is in love is seized by the statue of one of the ladies whom he has previously victimized and made to behold the ghosts of all those unfortunate persons whose deaths he has caused  this is a most edifying spectacle the ghosts rise solemnly each in a white sheet preceded by a waxcandle and having declared their names and qualities call in chorus for vengeance upon don juan as thus   don sandoval loquitur  i am don sandoval dojedo i played against don juan my fortune the tomb of my fathers and the heart of my mistressi lost all i played against him my life and i lost it vengeance against the murderer vengeancethe candle goes out   the candle goes out and an angel descendsa flaming sword in his handand asks is there no voice in favor of don juan when lo don juans father like one of those ingenious toys called jackinthebox jumps up from his coffin and demands grace for his son  when martha the nun returns having prepared all things for her elopement she finds don juan fainting upon the groundi am no longer your husband says he upon coming to himself i am no longer don juan i am brother juan the trappist sister martha recollect that you must die  this was a most cruel blow upon sister martha who is no less a person than an angel an angel in disguisethe good spirit of the house of marana who has gone to the length of losing her wings and forfeiting her place in heaven in order to keep company with don juan on earth and if possible to convert him already in her angelic character she had exhorted him to repentance but in vain for while she stood at one elbow pouring not merely hints but long sermons into his ear at the other elbow stood a bad spirit grinning and sneering at all her pious counsels and obtaining by far the greater share of the dons attention  in spite however of the utter contempt with which don juan treats herin spite of his dissolute courses which must shock her virtueand his impolite neglect which must wound her vanity the poor creature who from having been accustomed to better company might have been presumed to have had better taste the unfortunate angel feels a certain inclination for the don and actually flies up to heaven to ask permission to remain with him on earth  and when the curtain draws up to the sound of harps and discovers whiterobed angels walking in the clouds we find the angel of marana upon her knees uttering the following address   le bon ange       vierge à qui le calice à la liqueur amère            fut si souvent offert      mère que lon nomma la douloureuse mère            tant vous avez souffert       vous dont les yeux divins sur la terre des hommes            ont versé plus de pleurs      que vos pieds nont depuis dans le ciel où nous sommes            fait éclore de fleurs       vase délection étoile matinale           miroir de pureté      vous qui priez pour nous dune voix virginale           la suprême bonté       a mon tour aujourdhui bienheureuse marie           je tombe à vos genoux      daignez donc mécouter car cest vous que je prie           vous qui priez pour nous        which may be thus interpreted        o virgin blest by whom the bitter draught           so often has been quaffed      that for thy sorrow thou art named by us           the mother dolorous       thou from whose eyes have fallen more tears of woe           upon the earth below      than neath thy footsteps in this heaven of ours           have risen flowers       o beaming morning star o chosen vase           o mirror of all grace      who with thy virgin voice dost ever pray           mans sins away       bend down thine ear and list o blessed saint           unto my sad complaint      mother to thee i kneel on thee i call           who hearest all   she proceeds to request that she may be allowed to return to earth and follow the fortunes of don juan and as there is one difficulty or to use her own words       mais comme vous savez quaux voûtes éternelles          malgré moi tend mon vol     soufflez sur mon étoile et détachez mes ailes          pour menchainer au sol   her request is granted her star is blown out o poetic allusion and she descends to earth to love and to go mad and to die for don juan  the reader will require no further explanation in order to be satisfied as to the moral of this play but is it not a very bitter satire upon the country which calls itself the politest nation in the world that the incidents the indecency the coarse blasphemy and the vulgar wit of this piece should find admirers among the public and procure reputation for the author could not the government which has reestablished in a manner the theatrical censorship and forbids or alters plays which touch on politics exert the same guardianship over public morals the honest english reader who has a faith in his clergyman and is a regular attendant at sunday worship will not be a little surprised at the march of intellect among our neighbors across the channel and at the kind of consideration in which they hold their religion here is a man who seizes upon saints and angels merely to put sentiments in their mouths which might suit a nymph of drury lane he shows heaven in order that he may carry debauch into it and avails himself of the most sacred and sublime parts of our creed as a vehicle for a scenepainters skill or an occasion for a handsome actress to wear a new dress  m dumass piece of kean is not quite so sublime it was brought out by the author as a satire upon the french critics who to their credit be it spoken had generally attacked him and was intended by him and received by the public as a faithful portraiture of english manners as such it merits special observation and praise in the first act you find a countess and an ambassadress whose conversation relates purely to the great actor all the ladies in london are in love with him especially the two present as for the ambassadress she prefers him to her husband a matter of course in all french plays and to a more seducing person stillno less a person than the prince of wales who presently waits on the ladies and joins in their conversation concerning kean this man says his royal highness is the very pink of fashion brummell is nobody when compared to him and i myself only an insignificant private gentleman he has a reputation among ladies for which i sigh in vain and spends an income twice as great as mine this admirable historic touch at once paints the actor and the prince the estimation in which the one was held and the modest economy for which the other was so notorious  then we have kean at a place called the trou de charbon the coal hole where to the edification of the public he engages in a fisty combat with a notorious boxer this scene was received by the audience with loud exclamations of delight and commented on by the journals as a faultless picture of english manners the coal hole being on the banks of the thames a noblemanlord melbournhas chosen the tavern as a rendezvous for a gang of pirates who are to have their ship in waiting in order to carry off a young lady with whom his lordship is enamored it need not be said that kean arrives at the nick of time saves the innocent meess anna and exposes the infamy of the peer a violent tirade against noblemen ensues and lord melbourn slinks away disappointed to meditate revenge keans triumphs continue through all the acts the ambassadress falls madly in love with him the prince becomes furious at his ill success and the ambassador dreadfully jealous they pursue kean to his dressingroom at the theatre where unluckily the ambassadress herself has taken refuge dreadful quarrels ensue the tragedian grows suddenly mad upon the stage and so cruelly insults the prince of wales that his royal highness determines to send him to botany bay his sentence however is commuted to banishment to new york whither of course miss anna accompanies him rewarding him previously with her hand and twenty thousand a year  this wonderful performance was gravely received and admired by the people of paris the piece was considered to be decidedly moral because the popular candidate was made to triumph throughout and to triumph in the most virtuous manner for according to the french code of morals success among women is at once the proof and the reward of virtue  the sacred personage introduced in dumass play behind a cloud figures bodily in the piece of the massacre of the innocents represented at paris last year she appears under a different name but the costume is exactly that of carlo dolces madonna and an ingenious fable is arranged the interest of which hangs upon the grand massacre of the innocents perpetrated in the fifth act one of the chief characters is jean le précurseur who threatens woe to herod and his race and is beheaded by orders of that sovereign  in the festin de balthazar we are similarly introduced to daniel and the first scene is laid by the waters of babylon where a certain number of captive jews are seated in melancholy postures a babylonian officer enters exclaiming chantez nous quelques chansons de jerusalem and the request is refused in the language of the psalm belshazzars feast is given in a grand tableau after martins picture that painter in like manner furnished scenes for the deluge vast numbers of schoolboys and children are brought to see these pieces the lower classes delight in them the famous juif errant at the theatre of the porte st martin was the first of the kind and its prodigious success no doubt occasioned the number of imitations which the other theatres have produced  the taste of such exhibitions of course every english person will question but we must remember the manners of the people among whom they are popular and if i may be allowed to hazard such an opinion there is in every one of these boulevard mysteries a kind of rude moral the boulevard writers dont pretend to tabernacles and divine gifts like madame sand and dumas before mentioned if they take a story from the sacred books they garble it without mercy and take sad liberties with the text but they do not deal in descriptions of the agreeably wicked or ask pity and admiration for tenderhearted criminals and philanthropic murderers as their betters do vice is vice on the boulevard and it is fine to hear the audience as a tyrant king roars out cruel sentences of death or a bereaved mother pleads for the life of her child making their remarks on the circumstances of the scene ah le gredin growls an indignant countryman quel monstre says a grisette in a fury you see very fat old men crying like babies and like babies sucking enormous sticks of barleysugar actors and audience enter warmly into the illusion of the piece and so especially are the former affected that at franconis where the battles of the empire are represented there is as regular gradation in the ranks of the mimic army as in the real imperial legions after a man has served with credit for a certain number of years in the line he is promoted to be an officeran acting officer if he conducts himself well he may rise to be a colonel or a general of division if ill he is degraded to the ranks again or worst degradation of all drafted into a regiment of cossacks or austrians cossacks is the lowest depth however nay it is said that the men who perform these cossack parts receive higher wages than the mimic grenadiers and old guard they will not consent to be beaten every night even in play to be pursued in hundreds by a handful of french to fight against their beloved emperor surely there is fine hearty virtue in this and pleasant childlike simplicity  so that while the drama of victor hugo dumas and the enlightened classes is profoundly immoral and absurd the drama of the common people is absurd if you will but good and righthearted i have made notes of one or two of these pieces which all have good feeling and kindness in them and which turn as the reader will see upon one or two favorite points of popular morality a drama that obtained a vast success at the porte saint martin was la duchesse de la vauballière the duchess is the daughter of a poor farmer who was carried off in the first place and then married by m le duc de la vauballière a terrible roué the farmers landlord and the intimate friend of philippe dorléans the regent of france  now the duke in running away with the lady intended to dispense altogether with ceremony and make of julie anything but his wife but georges her father and one morisseau a notary discovered him in his dastardly act and pursued him to the very feet of the regent who compelled the pair to marry and make it up  julie complies but though she becomes a duchess her heart remains faithful to her old flame adrian the doctor and she declares that beyond the ceremony no sort of intimacy shall take place between her husband and herself  then the duke begins to treat her in the most ungentlemanlike manner he abuses her in every possible way he introduces improper characters into her house and finally becomes so disgusted with her that he determines to make away with her altogether  for this purpose he sends forth into the highways and seizes a doctor bidding him on pain of death to write a poisonous prescription for madame la duchesse she swallows the potion and o horror the doctor turns out to be dr adrian whose woe may be imagined upon finding that he has been thus committing murder on his true love  let not the reader however be alarmed as to the fate of the heroine no heroine of a tragedy ever yet died in the third act and accordingly the duchess gets up perfectly well again in the fourth through the instrumentality of morisseau the good lawyer  and now it is that vice begins to be really punished the duke who after killing his wife thinks it necessary to retreat and take refuge in spain is tracked to the borders of that country by the virtuous notary and there receives such a lesson as he will never forget to his dying day  morisseau in the first instance produces a deed signed by his holiness the pope which annuls the marriage of the duke de la vauballière then another deed by which it is proved that he was not the eldest son of old la vauballière the former duke then another deed by which he shows that old la vauballière who seems to have been a disreputable old fellow was a bigamist and that in consequence the present man styling himself duke is illegitimate and finally morisseau brings forward another document which proves that the reglar duke is no other than adrian the doctor  thus it is that love law and physic combined triumph over the horrid machinations of this starandgartered libertine  hermann livrogne is another piece of the same order and though not very refined yet possesses considerable merit as in the case of the celebrated captain smith of halifax who took to drinking ratafia and thought of poor miss baileya woman and the bottle have been the cause of hermanns ruin deserted by his mistress who has been seduced from him by a base italian count hermann a german artist gives himself entirely up to liquor and revenge but when he finds that force and not infidelity have been the cause of his mistresss ruin the reader can fancy the indignant ferocity with which he pursues the infame ravisseur a scene which is really full of spirit and excellently well acted here ensues hermann proposes to the count on the eve of their duel that the survivor should bind himself to espouse the unhappy marie but the count declares himself to be already married and the student finding a duel impossible for his object was to restore at all events the honor of marie now only thinks of his revenge and murders the count presently two parties of men enter hermanns apartment one is a company of students who bring him the news that he has obtained the prize of painting the other the policemen who carry him to prison to suffer the penalty of murder  i could mention many more plays in which the popular morality is similiarly expressed the seducer or rascal of the piece is always an aristocrata wicked count or licentious marquis who is brought to condign punishment just before the fall of the curtain and too good reason have the french people had to lay such crimes to the charge of the aristocracy who are expiating now on the stage the wrongs which they did a hundred years since the aristocracy is dead now but the theatre lives upon traditions and dont let us be too scornful at such simple legends as are handed down by the people from race to race vulgar prejudice against the great it may be but prejudice against the great is only a rude expression of sympathy with the poor long therefore may fat épiciers blubber over mimic woes and honest prolétaires shake their fists shoutinggredin scélérat monstre de marquis and such republican cries  remark too another development of this same popular feeling of dislike against men in power what a number of plays and legends have we the writer has submitted to the public in the preeeding pages a couple of specimens one of french and the other of polish origin in which that great and powerful aristocrat the devil is made to be miserably tricked humiliated and disappointed a play of this class which in the midst of all its absurdities and claptraps had much of good in it was called le maudit des mers le maudit is a dutch captain who in the midst of a storm while his crew were on their knees at prayers blasphemed and drank punch but what was his astonishment at beholding an archangel with a sword all covered with flaming resin who told him that as he in this hour of danger was too daring or too wicked to utter a prayer he never should cease roaming the seas until he could find some being who would pray to heaven for him  once only in a hundred years was the skipper allowed to land for this purpose and this piece runs through four centuries in as many acts describing the agonies and unavailing attempts of the miserable dutchman willing to go any lengths in order to obtain his prayer he in the second act betrays a virgin of the sun to a follower of pizarro and in the third assassinates the heroic william of nassau but ever before the dropping of the curtain the angel and sword make their appearancetreachery says the spirit cannot lessen thy punishmentcrime will not obtain thy releasea la mer à la mer and the poor devil returns to the ocean to be lonely and tempesttossed and seasick for a hundred years more  but his woes are destined to end with the fourth act having landed in america where the peasants on the seashore all dressed in italian costumes are celebrating in a quadrille the victories of washington he is there lucky enough to find a young girl to pray for him then the curse is removed the punishment is over and a celestial vessel with angels on the decks and sweet little cherubs fluttering about the shrouds and the poop appear to receive him  this piece was acted at franconis where for once an angelship was introduced in place of the usual horsemanship  one must not forget to mention here how the english nation is satirized by our neighbors who have some droll traditions regarding us in one of the little christmas pieces produced at the palais royal satires upon the follies of the past twelve months on which all the small theatres exhaust their wit the celebrated flight of messrs green and monck mason was parodied and created a good deal of laughter at the expense of john bull two english noblemen milor cricri and milor hanneton appear as descending from a balloon and one of them communicates to the public the philosophic observations which were made in the course of his aërial tour  on leaving vauxhall says his lordship we drank a bottle of madeira as a health to the friends from whom we parted and crunched a few biscuits to support nature during the hours before lunch in two hours we arrived at canterbury enveloped in clouds lunch bottled porter at dover carried several miles in a tide of air bitter cold cherrybrandy crossed over the channel safely and thought with pity of the poor people who were sickening in the steamboats below more bottled porter over calais dinner roastbeef of old england near dunkirknight falling lunar rainbow brandyandwater night confoundedly thick supper nightcap of rumpunch and so to bed the sun broke beautifully through the morning mist as we boiled the kettle and took our breakfast over cologne in a few more hours we concluded this memorable voyage and landed safely at weilburg in good time for dinner  the joke here is smart enough but our honest neighbors make many better when they are quite unconscious of the fun let us leave plays for a moment for poetry and take an instance of french criticism concerning england from the works of a famous french exquisite and man of letters the hero of the poem addresses his mistress        londres tu le sais trop en fait de capitale      estce que fit le ciel de plus froid et plus pâle      cest la ville du gaz des marins du brouillard      on sy couche à minuit et lon sy lève tard      ses raouts tant vantés ne sont quune boxade      sur ses grands quais jamais échelle ou sérénade      mais de volumineux bourgeois pris de porter      qui passent sans lever le front à westminster      et nétait sa forêt de mâts perçant la brume      sa tour dont à minuit le vieil oeil sallume      et tes deux yeux zerline illuminés bien plus      je dirais que ma foi des romans que jai lus      il nen est pas un seul plus lourd plus léthargique      que cette nation quon nomme britannique   the writer of the above lines which let any man who can translate is monsieur roger de beauvoir a gentleman who actually lived many months in england as an attaché to the embassy of m de polignac he places the heroine of his tale in a petit réduit près le strand with a green and fresh jalousie and a large blind let down all day you fancied you were entering a bath of asia as soon as you had passed the perfumed threshold of this charming retreat he next places her        dans un square écarté morne et couverte de givre      où se cache un hôtel aux vieux lions de cuivre   and the hero of the tale a young french poet who is in london is truly unhappy in that village        arthur dessèche et meurt  dans la ville de sterne      rien quen voyant le peuple il a le mal de mer      il naime ni le parc gai comme une citerne      ni le tir au pigeon ni le sodawater       liston ne le fait plus sourciller  il rumine      sur les trottoirs du strand droit comme un échiquier      contre le peuple anglais les nègres la vermine      et les mille cokneys du peuple boutiquier       contre tous les basbleus contre les pâtissières      les parieurs depsom le gin le parlement      la quaterly le roi la pluie et les libraires      dont il ne touche plus hélas un sou dargent       et chaque gentleman lui dit lheureux poète   lheureux poète indeed i question if a poet in this wide world is so happy as m de beauvoir or has made such wonderful discoveries the bath of asia with green jalousies in which the lady dwells the old hotel with copper lions in a lonely squarewere ever such things heard of or imagined but by a frenchman the sailors the negroes the vermin whom he meets in the streethow great and happy are all these discoveries liston no longer makes the happy poet frown and gin cokneys and the quaterly have not the least effect upon him and this gentleman has lived many months amongst us admires williams shakspear the grave et vieux prophète as he calls him and never for an instant doubts that his description contains anything absurd  i dont know whether the great dumas has passed any time in england but his plays show a similar intimate knowledge of our habits thus in kean the stagemanager is made to come forward and address the pit with a speech beginning my lords and gentlemen and a company of englishwomen are introduced at the memorable coal hole and they all wear pinafores as if the british female were in the invariable habit of wearing this outer garment or slobbering her gown without it there was another celebrated piece enacted some years since upon the subject of queen caroline where our late adored sovereign george was made to play a most despicable part and where signor bergami fought a duel with lord londonderry in the last act of this play the house of lords was represented and sir brougham made an eloquent speech in the queens favor presently the shouts of the mob were heard without from shouting they proceeded to pelting and pasteboardbrickbats and cabbages came flying among the representatives of our hereditary legislature at this unpleasant juncture sir hardinge the secretaryatwar rises and calls in the military the act ends in a general row and the ignominious fall of lord liverpool laid low by a brickbat from the mob  the description of these scenes is of course quite incapable of conveying any notion of their general effect you must have the solemnity of the actors as they meess and milor one another and the perfect gravity and good faith with which the audience listen to them our stage frenchman is the old marquis with sword and pigtail and spangled court coat the englishman of the french theatre has invariably a red wig and almost always leather gaiters and a long white upper benjamin he remains as he was represented in the old caricatures after the peace when vernet designed him  and to conclude this catalogue of blunders in the famous piece of the naufrage de la meduse the first act is laid on board an english shipofwar all the officers of which appeared in light blue or green coats the lamplight prevented our distinguishing the color accurately and topboots   let us not attempt to deaden the force of this tremendous blow by any more remarks the force of blundering can go no further would a chinese playwright or painter have stranger notions about the barbarians than our neighbors who are separated from us but by two hours of salt water     meditations at versailles   the palace of versailles has been turned into a bricabrac shop of late years and its timehonored walls have been covered with many thousand yards of the worst pictures that eye ever looked on i dont know how many leagues of battles and sieges the unhappy visitor is now obliged to march through amidst a crowd of chattering paris cockneys who are never tired of looking at the glories of the grenadier français to the chronicling of whose deeds this old palace of the old kings is now altogether devoted a whizzing screaming steamengine rushes hither from paris bringing shoals of badauds in its wake the old coucous are all gone and their place knows them no longer smooth asphaltum terraces tawdry lamps and great hideous egyptian obelisks have frightened them away from the pleasant station they used to occupy under the trees of the champs elysées and though the old coucous were just the most uncomfortable vehicles that human ingenuity ever constructed one cant help looking back to the days of their existence with a tender regret for there was pleasure then in the little trip of three leagues and who ever had pleasure in a railway journey does any reader of this venture to say that on such a voyage he ever dared to be pleasant do the most hardened stokers joke with one another i dont believe it look into every single car of the train and you will see that every single face is solemn they take their seats gravely and are silent for the most part during the journey they dare not look out of window for fear of being blinded by the smoke that comes whizzing by or of losing their heads in one of the windows of the down train they ride for miles in utter damp and darkness through awful pipes of brick that have been run pitilessly through the bowels of gentle mother earth the castiron frankenstein of an engine gallops on puffing and screaming does any man pretend to say that he enjoys the journeyhe might as well say that he enjoyed having his hair cut he bears it but that is all he will not allow the world to laugh at him for any exhibition of slavish fear and pretends therefore to be at his ease but he is afraid nay ought to be under the circumstances i am sure hannibal or napoleon would were they locked suddenly into a car there kept close prisoners for a certain number of hours and whirled along at this dizzy pace you cant stop if you wouldyou may die but you cant stop the engine may explode upon the road and up you go along with it or may be a bolter and take a fancy to go down a hill or into a river all this you must bear for the privilege of travelling twenty miles an hour  this little journey then from paris to versailles that used to be so merry of old has lost its pleasures since the disappearance of the coucous and i would as lief have for companions the statues that lately took a coach from the bridge opposite the chamber of deputies and stepped out in the court of versailles as the most part of the people who now travel on the railroad the stone figures are not a whit more cold and silent than these persons who used to be in the old coucous so talkative and merry the prattling grisette and her swain from the ecole de droit the huge alsacian carabineer grimly smiling under his sandy moustaches and glittering brass helmet the jolly nurse in red calico who had been to paris to show mamma her darling lolo or augustewhat merry companions used one to find squeezed into the crazy old vehicles that formerly performed the journey but the age of horseflesh is gonethat of engineers economists and calculators has succeeded and the pleasure of coucoudom is extinguished for ever why not mourn over it as mr burke did over his cheap defence of nations and unbought grace of life that age of chivalry which he lamented àpropos of a trip to versailles some half a century back  without stopping to discuss as might be done in rather a neat and successful manner whether the age of chivalry was cheap or dear and whether in the time of the unbought grace of life there was not more bribery robbery villainy tyranny and corruption than exists even in our own happy dayslet us make a few moral and historical remarks upon the town of versailles where between railroad and coucou we are surely arrived by this time  the town is certainly the most moral of towns you pass from the railroad station through a long lonely suburb with dusty rows of stunted trees on either side and some few miserable beggars idle boys and ragged old women under them behind the trees are gaunt mouldy houses palaces once where in the days of the unbought grace of life the cheap defence of nations gambled ogled swindled intrigued whence highborn duchesses used to issue in old times to act as chambermaids to lovely du barri and mighty princes rolled away in gilt caroches hot for the honor of lighting his majesty to bed or of presenting his stockings when he rose or of holding his napkin when he dined tailors chandlers tinmen wretched hucksters and greengrocers are now established in the mansions of the old peers small children are yelling at the doors with mouths besmeared with bread and treacle damp rags are hanging out of every one of the windows steaming in the sun oystershells cabbagestalks broken crockery old papers lie basking in the same cheerful light a solitary watercart goes jingling down the wide pavement and spirts a feeble refreshment over the dusty thirsty stones  after pacing for some time through such dismal streets we deboucher on the grande place and before us lies the palace dedicated to all the glories of france in the midst of the great lonely plain this famous residence of king louis looks low and meanhonored pile time was when tall musketeers and gilded bodyguards allowed none to pass the gate fifty years ago ten thousand drunken women from paris broke through the charm and now a tattered commissioner will conduct you through it for a penny and lead you up to the sacred entrance of the palace  we will not examine all the glories of france as here they are portrayed in pictures and marble catalogues are written about these miles of canvas representing all the revolutionary battles from valmy to waterlooall the triumphs of louis xivall the mistresses of his successorand all the great men who have flourished since the french empire began military heroes are most of thesefierce constables in shining steel marshals in voluminous wigs and brave grenadiers in bearskin caps some dozens of whom gained crowns principalities dukedoms some hundreds plunder and epaulets some millions death in african sands or in icy russian plains under the guidance and for the good of that archhero napoleon by far the greater part of all the glories of france as of most other countries is made up of these military men and a fine satire it is on the cowardice of mankind that they pay such an extraordinary homage to the virtue called courage filling their historybooks with tales about it and nothing but it  let them disguise the place however as they will and plaster the walls with bad pictures as they please it will be hard to think of any family but one as one traverses this vast gloomy edifice it has not been humbled to the ground as a certain palace of babel was of yore but it is a monument of fallen pride not less awful and would afford matter for a whole library of sermons the cheap defence of nations expended a thousand millions in the erection of this magnificent dwellingplace armies were employed in the intervals of their warlike labors to level hills or pile them up to turn rivers and to build aqueducts and transplant woods and construct smooth terraces and long canals a vast garden grew up in a wilderness and a stupendous palace in the garden and a stately city round the palace the city was peopled with parasites who daily came to do worship before the creator of these wondersthe great king dieu seul est grand said courtly massillon but next to him as the prelate thought was certainly louis his vicegerent here upon earthgods lieutenantgovernor of the worldbefore whom courtiers used to fall on their knees and shade their eyes as if the light of his countenance like the sun which shone supreme in heaven the type of him was too dazzling to bear  did ever the sun shine upon such a king before in such a palaceor rather did such a king ever shine upon the sun when majesty came out of his chamber in the midst of his superhuman splendors viz in his cinnamoncolored coat embroidered with diamonds his pyramid of a wig his redheeled shoes that lifted him four inches from the ground that he scarcely seemed to touch when he came out blazing upon the dukes and duchesses that waited his risingwhat could the latter do but cover their eyes and wink and tremble and did he not himself believe as he stood there on his high heels under his ambrosial periwig that there was something in him more than mansomething above fate        it is fine to think that in the days of his youth his      majesty louis xiv used to powder his wig with golddust  this doubtless was he fain to believe and if on very fine days from his terrace before his gloomy palace of saint germains he could catch a glimpse in the distance of a certain white spire of st denis where his race lay buried he would say to his courtiers with a sublime condescension gentlemen you must remember that i too am mortal surely the lords in waiting could hardly think him serious and vowed that his majesty always loved a joke however mortal or not the sight of that sharp spire wounded his majestys eyes and is said by the legend to have caused the building of the palace of babelversailles  in the year 1681 then the great king with bag and baggagewith guards cooks chamberlains mistresses jesuits gentlemen lackeys fénélons molières lauzuns bossuets villars villeroys louvois colbertstransported himself to his new palace the old one being left for james of england and jaquette his wife when their time should come and when the time did come and james sought his brothers kingdom it is on record that louis hastened to receive and console him and promised to restore incontinently those islands from which the canaille had turned him between brothers such a gift was a trifle and the courtiers said to one another reverently the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool there was no blasphemy in the speech on the contrary it was gravely said by a faithful believing man who thought it no shame to the latter to compare his majesty with god almighty indeed the books of the time will give one a strong idea how general was this louisworship i have just been looking at one which was written by an honest jesuit and protégé of père la chaise who dedicates a book of medals to the august infants of france which does indeed go almost as far in print he calls our famous monarch louis le grand1 linvincible 2 le sage 3 le conquérant 4 la merveille de son siècle 5 la terreur de ses ennemis 6 lamour de ses peuples 7 larbitre de la paix et de la guerre 8 ladmiration de lunivers 9 et digne den être le maître 10 le modèle dun héros achevé 11 digne de limmortalité et de la vénération de tous les siècles        i think it is in the amusing memoirs of madame de crequi      a forgery but a work remarkable for its learning and      accuracy that the above anecdote is related  a pretty jesuit declaration truly and a good honest judgment upon the great king in thirty years more1 the invincible had been beaten a vast number of times 2 the sage was the puppet of an artful old woman who was the puppet of more artful priests 3 the conqueror had quite forgotten his early knack of conquering 5 the terror of his enemies for 4 the marvel of his age we pretermit it being a loose term that may apply to any person or thing was now terrified by his enemies in turn 6 the love of his people was as heartily detested by them as scarcely any other monarch not even his greatgrandson has been before or since 7 the arbiter of peace and war was fain to send superb ambassadors to kick their heels in dutch shopkeepers antechambers 8 is again a general term 9 the man fit to be master of the universe was scarcely master of his own kingdom 10 the finished hero was all but finished in a very commonplace and vulgar way and 11 the man worthy of immortality was just at the point of death without a friend to soothe or deplore him only withered old maintenon to utter prayers at his bedside and croaking jesuits to prepare him with heaven knows what wretched tricks and mummeries for his appearance in that great republic that lies on the other side of the grave in the course of his fourscore splendid miserable years he never had but one friend and he ruined and left her poor la vallière what a sad tale is yours look at this galerie des glaces cries monsieur vatout staggering with surprise at the appearance of the room two hundred and fortytwo feet long and forty high here it was that louis displayed all the grandeur of royalty and such was the splendor of his court and the luxury of the times that this immense room could hardly contain the crowd of courtiers that pressed around the monarch wonderful wonderful eight thousand four hundred and sixty square feet of courtiers give a square yard to each and you have a matter of three thousand of them think of three thousand courtiers per day and all the chopping and changing of them for near forty years some of them dying some getting their wishes and retiring to their provinces to enjoy their plunder some disgraced and going home to pine away out of the light of the sun new ones perpetually arrivingpushing squeezing for their place in the crowded galerie des glaces a quarter of a million of noble countenances at the very least must those glasses have reflected rouge diamonds ribbons patches upon the faces of smiling ladies towering periwigs sleek shaven crowns tufted moustaches scars and grizzled whiskers worn by ministers priests dandies and grim old commandersso many faces o ye gods and every one of them lies so many tongues vowing devotion and respectful love to the great king in his sixinch wig and only poor la vallières amongst them all which had a word of truth for the dull ears of louis of bourbon        they made a jesuit of him on his deathbed        saint simons account of lauzun in disgrace is      admirably facetious and pathetic lauzuns regrets are as      monstrous as those of raleigh when deprived of the sight of      his adorable queen and mistress elizabeth  quand jaurai de la peine aux carmélites says unhappy louise about to retire from these magnificent courtiers and their grand galerie des glaces je me souviendrai de ce que ces gens là mont fait souffrira troop of bossuets inveighing against the vanities of courts could not preach such an affecting sermon what years of anguish and wrong had the poor thing suffered before these sad words came from her gentle lips how these courtiers have bowed and flattered kissed the ground on which she trod fought to have the honor of riding by her carriage written sonnets and called her goddess who in the days of her prosperity was kind and beneficent gentle and compassionate to all then on a certain day when it is whispered that his majesty hath cast the eyes of his gracious affection upon another behold three thousand courtiers are at the feet of the new divinityo divine athenais what blockheads have we been to worship any but youthat a goddessa pretty goddess forsootha witch rather who for a while kept our gracious monarch blind look at her the woman limps as she walks and by sacred venus her mouth stretches almost to her diamond earrings the same tale may be told of many more deserted mistresses and fair athenais de montespan was to hear it of herself one day meantime while la vallières heart is breaking the model of a finished hero is yawning as on such paltry occasions a finished hero should let her heart break a plague upon her tears and repentance what right has she to repent away with her to her convent she goes and the finished hero never sheds a tear what a noble pitch of stoicism to have reached our louis was so great that the little woes of mean people were beyond him his friends died his mistresses left him his children one by one were cut off before his eyes and great louis is not moved in the slightest degree as how indeed should a god be moved        a pair of diamond earrings given by the king to la      vallière caused much scandal and some lampoons are extant      which impugn the taste of louis xiv for loving a lady with      such an enormous mouth  i have often liked to think about this strange character in the world who moved in it bearing about a full belief in his own infallibility teaching his generals the art of war his ministers the science of government his wits taste his courtiers dress ordering deserts to become gardens turning villages into palaces at a breath and indeed the august figure of the man as he towers upon his throne cannot fail to inspire one with respect and awehow grand those flowing locks appear how awful that sceptre how magnificent those flowing robes in louis surely if in any one the majesty of kinghood is represented  but a king is not every inch a king for all the poet may say and it is curious to see how much precise majesty there is in that majestic figure of ludovicus rex in the frontispiece we have endeavored to make the exact calculation the idea of kingly dignity is equally strong in the two outer figures and you see at once that majesty is made out of the wig the highheeled shoes and cloak all fleursdelis bespangled as for the little lean shrivelled paunchy old man of five feet two in a jacket and breeches there is no majesty in him at any rate and yet he has just stepped out of that very suit of clothes put the wig and shoes on him and he is six feet highthe other fripperies and he stands before you majestic imperial and heroic thus do barbers and cobblers make the gods that we worship for do we not all worship him yes though we all know him to be stupid heartless short of doubtful personal courage worship and admire him we must and have set up in our hearts a grand image of him endowed with wit magnanimity valor and enormous heroical stature  and what magnanimous acts are attributed to him or rather how differently do we view the actions of heroes and common men and find that the same thing shall be a wonderful virtue in the former which in the latter is only an ordinary act of duty look at yonder window of the kings chamberone morning a royal cane was seen whirling out of it and plumped among the courtiers and guard of honor below king louis had absolutely and with his own hand flung his own cane out of the window because said he i wont demean myself by striking a gentleman o miracle of magnanimity lauzun was not caned because he besought majesty to keep his promiseonly imprisoned for ten years in pignerol along with banished fouquetand a pretty story is fouquets too  out of the window the kings august head was one day thrust when old condé was painfully toiling up the steps of the court below dont hurry yourself my cousin cries magnanimity one who has to carry so many laurels cannot walk fast at which all the courtiers lackeys mistresses chamberlains jesuits and scullions clasp their hands and burst into tears men are affected by the tale to this very day for a century and threequarters have not all the books that speak of versailles or louis quatorze told the storydont hurry yourself my cousin o admirable king and christian what a pitch of condescension is here that the greatest king of all the world should go for to say anything so kind and really tell a tottering old gentleman worn out with gout age and wounds not to walk too fast  what a proper fund of slavishness is there in the composition of mankind that histories like these should be found to interest and awe them till the worlds end most likely this story will have its place in the historybooks and unborn generations will read it and tenderly be moved by it i am sure that magnanimity went to bed that night pleased and happy intimately convinced that he had done an action of sublime virtue and had easy slumbers and sweet dreamsespecially if he had taken a light supper and not too vehemently attacked his en cas de nuit  that famous adventure in which the en cas de nuit was brought into use for the sake of one poquelin alias molièrehow often has it been described and admired this poquelin though kings valetdechambre was by profession a vagrant and as such looked coldly on by the great lords of the palace who refused to eat with him majesty hearing of this ordered his en cas de nuit to be placed on the table and positively cut off a wing with his own knife and fork for poquelins use o thrice happy jean baptiste the king has actually sat down with him cheek by jowl had the liverwing of a fowl and given molière the gizzard put his imperial legs under the same mahogany sub iisdem trabibus a man after such an honor can look for little else in this world he has tasted the utmost conceivable earthly happiness and has nothing to do now but to fold his arms look up to heaven and sing nunc dimittis and die  do not let us abuse poor old louis on account of this monstrous pride but only lay it to the charge of the fools who believed and worshipped it if honest man he believed himself to be almost a god it was only because thousands of people had told him sopeople only half liars too who did in the depths of their slavish respect admire the man almost as much as they said they did if when he appeared in his fivehundredmillion coat as he is said to have done before the siamese ambassadors the courtiers began to shade their eyes and long for parasols as if this bourbonic sun was too hot for them indeed it is no wonder that he should believe that there was something dazzling about his person he had half a million of eager testimonies to this idea who was to tell him the truthonly in the last years of his life did trembling courtiers dare whisper to him after much circumlocution that a certain battle had been fought at a place called blenheim and that eugene and marlborough had stopped his long career of triumphs  on nest plus heureux à notre âge says the old man to one of his old generals welcoming tallard after his defeat and he rewards him with honors as if he had come from a victory there is if you will something magnanimous in this welcome to his conquered general this stout protest against fate disaster succeeds disaster armies after armies march out to meet fiery eugene and that dogged fatal englishman and disappear in the smoke of the enemies cannon even at versailles you may almost hear it roaring at last but when courtiers who have forgotten their god now talk of quitting this grand temple of his old louis plucks up heart and will never hear of surrender all the gold and silver at versailles he melts to find bread for his armies all the jewels on his fivehundredmillion coat he pawns resolutely and bidding villars go and make the last struggle but one promises if his general is defeated to place himself at the head of his nobles and die king of france indeed after a man for sixty years has been performing the part of a hero some of the real heroic stuff must have entered into his composition whether he would or not when the great elliston was enacting the part of king george the fourth in the play of the coronation at drury lane the galleries applauded very loudly his suavity and majestic demeanor at which elliston inflamed by the popular loyalty and by some fermented liquor in which it is said he was in the habit of indulging burst into tears and spreading out his arms exclaimed bless ye bless ye my people dont let us laugh at his ellistonian majesty nor at the people who clapped hands and yelled bravo in praise of him the tipsy old manager did really feel that he was a hero at that moment and the people wild with delight and attachment for a magnificent coat and breeches surely were uttering the true sentiments of loyalty which consists in reverencing these and other articles of costume in this fifth act then of his long royal drama old louis performed his part excellently and when the curtain drops upon him he lies dressed majestically in a becoming kingly attitude as a king should  the king his successor has not left at versailles half so much occasion for moralizing perhaps the neighboring parc aux cerfs would afford better illustrations of his reign the life of his great grandsire the grand llama of france seems to have frightened louis the wellbeloved who understood that loneliness is one of the necessary conditions of divinity and being of a jovial companionable turn aspired not beyond manhood only in the matter of ladies did he surpass his predecessor as solomon did david war he eschewed as his grandfather bade him and his simple taste found little in this world to enjoy beyond the mulling of chocolate and the frying of pancakes look here is the room called laboratoire du roi where with his own hands he made his mistresss breakfasthere is the little door through which from her apartments in the upper story the chaste du barri came stealing down to the arms of the weary feeble gloomy old man but of women he was tired long since and even pancakefrying had palled upon him what had he to do after forty years of reignafter having exhausted everything every pleasure that dubois could invent for his hot youth or cunning lebel could minister to his old age was flat and stale used up to the very dregs every shilling in the national purse had been squeezed out by pompadour and du barri and such brilliant ministers of state he had found out the vanity of pleasure as his ancestor had discovered the vanity of glory indeed it was high time that he should die and die he did and round his tomb as round that of his grandfather before him the starving people sang a dreadful chorus of curses which were the only epitaphs for good or for evil that were raised to his memory  as for the courtiersthe knights and nobles the unbought grace of lifethey of course forgot him in one minute after his death as the way is when the king dies the officer appointed opens his chamber window and calling out into the court below le roi est mort breaks his cane takes another and waves it exclaiming vive le roi straightway all the loyal nobles begin yelling vive le roi and the officer goes round solemnly and sets yonder great clock in the cour de marbre to the hour of the kings death this old louis had solemnly ordained but the versailles clock was only set twice there was no shouting of vive le roi when the successor of louis xv mounted to heaven to join his sainted family  strange stories of the deaths of kings have always been very recreating and profitable to us what a fine one is that of the death of louis xv as madame campan tells it one night the gracious monarch came back ill from trianon the disease turned out to be the smallpox so violent that ten people of those who had to enter his chamber caught the infection and died the whole court flies from him only poor old fat mesdames the kings daughters persist in remaining at his bedside and praying for his souls welfare  on the 10th may 1774 the whole court had assembled at the château the oeil de boeuf was full the dauphin had determined to depart as soon as the king had breathed his last and it was agreed by the people of the stables with those who watched in the kings room that a lighted candle should be placed in a window and should be extinguished as soon as he had ceased to live the candle was put out at that signal guards pages and squires mounted on horseback and everything was made ready for departure the dauphin was with the dauphiness waiting together for the news of the kings demise an immense noise as if of thunder was heard in the next room it was the crowd of courtiers who were deserting the dead kings apartment in order to pay their court to the new power of louis xvi madame de noailles entered and was the first to salute the queen by her title of queen of france and begged their majesties to quit their apartments to receive the princes and great lords of the court desirous to pay their homage to the new sovereigns leaning on her husbands arm a handkerchief to her eyes in the most touching attitude marie antoinette received these first visits on quitting the chamber where the dead king lay the duc de villequier bade m anderville first surgeon of the king to open and embalm the body it would have been certain death to the surgeon i am ready sir said he but whilst i am operating you must hold the head of the corpse your charge demands it the duke went away without a word and the body was neither opened nor embalmed a few humble domestics and poor workmen watched by the remains and performed the last offices to their master the surgeons ordered spirits of wine to be poured into the coffin  they huddled the kings body into a postchaise and in this deplorable equipage with an escort of about forty men louis the wellbeloved was carried in the dead of night from versailles to st denis and then thrown into the tomb of the kings of france  if any man is curious and can get permission he may mount to the roof of the palace and see where louis xvi used royally to amuse himself by gazing upon the doings of all the townspeople below with a telescope behold that balcony where one morning he his queen and the little dauphin stood with cromwell grandison lafayette by their side who kissed her majestys hand and protected her and then lovingly surrounded by his people the king got into a coach and came to paris nor did his majesty ride much in coaches after that  there is a portrait of the king in the upper galleries clothed in red and gold riding a fat horse brandishing a sword on which the word justice is inscribed and looking remarkably stupid and uncomfortable you see that the horse will throw him at the very first fling and as for the sword it never was made for such hands as his which were good at holding a corkscrew or a carvingknife but not clever at the management of weapons of war let those pity him who will call him saint and martyr if you please but a martyr to what principle was he did he frankly support either party in his kingdom or cheat and tamper with both he might have escaped but he must have his supper and so his family was butchered and his kingdom lost and he had his bottle of burgundy in comfort at varennes a single charge upon the fatal 10th of august and the monarchy might have been his once more but he is so tenderhearted that he lets his friends be murdered before his eyes almost or at least when he has turned his back upon his duty and his kingdom and has skulked for safety into the reporters box at the national assembly there were hundreds of brave men who died that day and were martyrs if you will poor neglected tenthrate courtiers for the most part who had forgotten old slights and disappointments and left their places of safety to come and die if need were sharing in the supreme hour of the monarchy monarchy was a great deal too humane to fight along with these and so left them to the pikes of santerre and the mercy of the men of the sections but we are wandering a good ten miles from versailles and from the deeds which louis xvi performed there  he is said to have been such a smart journeyman blacksmith that he might if fate had not perversely placed a crown on his head have earned a couple of louis every week by the making of locks and keys those who will may see the workshop where he employed many useful hours madame elizabeth was at prayers meanwhile the queen was making pleasant parties with her ladies monsieur the count dartois was learning to dance on the tightrope and monsieur de provence was cultivating leloquence du billet and studying his favorite horace it is said that each member of the august family succeeded remarkably well in his or her pursuits big monsieurs little notes are still cited at a minuet or syllabub poor antoinette was unrivalled and charles on the tightrope was so graceful and so gentil that madame saqui might envy him the time only was out of joint o cursed spite that ever such harmless creatures as these were bidden to right it  a walk to the little trianon is both pleasing and moral no doubt the reader has seen the pretty fantastical gardens which environ it the groves and temples the streams and caverns whither as the guide tells you during the heat of summer it was the custom of marie antoinette to retire with her favorite madame de lamballe the lake and swiss village are pretty little toys moreover and the cicerone of the place does not fail to point out the different cottages which surround the piece of water and tell the names of the royal masqueraders who inhabited each in the long cottage close upon the lake dwelt the seigneur du village no less a personage than louis xv louis xvi the dauphin was the bailli near his cottage is that of monseigneur the count dartois who was the miller opposite lived the prince de condé who enacted the part of gamekeeper or indeed any other rôle for it does not signify much near him was the prince de rohan who was the aumônier and yonder is the pretty little dairy which was under the charge of the fair marie antoinette herself  i forget whether monsieur the fat count of provence took any share of this royal masquerading but look at the names of the other six actors of the comedy and it will be hard to find any person for whom fate had such dreadful visitations in store fancy the party in the days of their prosperity here gathered at trianon and seated under the tall poplars by the lake discoursing familiarly together suppose of a sudden some conjuring cagliostro of the time is introduced among them and foretells to them the woes that are about to come you monsieur laumônier the descendant of a long line of princes the passionate admirer of that fair queen who sits by your side shall be the cause of her ruin and your own and shall die in disgrace and exile you son of the condés shall live long enough to see your royal race overthrown and shall die by the hands of a hangman you oldest son of saint louis shall perish by the executioners axe that beautiful head o antoinette the same ruthless blade shall sever they shall kill me first says lamballe at the queens side yes truly replies the soothsayer for fate prescribes ruin for your mistress and all who love her and cries monsieur dartois do i not love my sister too i pray you not to omit me in your prophecies        in the diamondnecklace affair        he was found hanging in his own bedroom        among the many lovers that rumor gave to the queen poor      ferscu is the most remarkable he seems to have entertained      for her a high and perfectly pure devotion he was the chief      agent in the luckless escape to varennes was lurking in      paris during the time of her captivity and was concerned in      the many fruitless plots that were made for her rescue      ferscu lived to be an old man but died a dreadful and      violent death he was dragged from his carriage by the mob      in stockholm and murdered by them  to whom monsieur cagliostro says scornfully you may look forward to fifty years of life after most of these are laid in the grave you shall be a king but not die one and shall leave the crown only not the worthless head that shall wear it thrice shall you go into exile you shall fly from the people first who would have no more of you and your race and you shall return home over half a million of human corpses that have been made for the sake of you and of a tyrant as great as the greatest of your family again driven away your bitterest enemy shall bring you back but the strong limbs of france are not to be chained by such a paltry yoke as you can put on her you shall be a tyrant but in will only and shall have a sceptre but to see it robbed from your hand  and pray sir conjurer who shall be the robber asked monsieur the count dartois   this i cannot say for here my dream ended the fact is i had fallen asleep on one of the stone benches in the avenue de paris and at this instant was awakened by a whirling of carriages and a great clattering of national guards lancers and outriders in red his majesty louis philippe was going to pay a visit to the palace which contains several pictures of his own glorious actions and which has been dedicated by him to all the glories of france
