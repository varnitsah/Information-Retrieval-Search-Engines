chancery lane in fleet street and the booksellers of london and westminster price one shilling     to the citizens  of  london and westminster   gentlemen  experience has confirmd you in that everlasting maxim that there is no other way to protect the innocent but by punishing the guilty  crimes ever were and ever must be unavoidably frequent in such populous cities as yours are being the necessary consequences either of the wants or the depravity of the lowest part of the humane species  at this time the most flagrant offences as burning of dwellings burglaries and highway robberies abound and frauds common felonies and forgeries are practicd without number thus not only your properties but even your very lives are every way struck at  the legislative power has not been wanting in providing necessary and wholesome laws against these evils the executive part whereof according to your great privileges is lodged in your own hands and the administration hath at all times applyed proper remedies and regulations to the defects which have happend in the magistracy more immediately under their jurisdiction  through the just and salutary severities of the magistrates publick excessive gaming has been in a manner surpressd and some late examples of divine vengeance have overtaken certain of the most notorious lewd prostitutes of the town which together with the laudable endeavours of the great and worthy societies has given no small check to that enormous and spreading vice  but heres a criminal bids defiance to your laws and justice who declard and has manifested that the bars are not made that can either keep him out or keep him in and accordingly hath a second time fled from the very bosom of death  his history will astonish and is not composd of fiction fable or stories placd at york rome or jamaica but facts done at your doors facts unheard of altogether new incredible and yet uncontestable  he is gone once more upon his wicked range in the world restless vengeance is pursuing and gentlemen tis to be hoped that she will be assisted by your endeavours to bring to justice this notorious offender     the life of  john sheppard c   this john sheppard a youth both in age and person tho an old man in sin was born in the parish of stepney near london in the year 1702 a son grandson and great grandson of a carpenter his father died when he was so very young that he could not recollect that ever he saw him thus the burthen of his maintenance together with his brothers and sisters lay upon the shoulders of the widow mother who soon procured an admittance of her son john into the workhouse in bishopsgatestreet where he continued for the space of a year and half and in that time received an education sufficient to qualifie him for the trade his mother designd him viz a carpenter accordingly she was recommended to mr wood in witchstreet near drurylane as a master capable of entertaining and instructing her son they agreed and bound he was for the space of seven years the lad proved an early proficient had a ready and ingenious hand and soon became master of his business and gave entire satisfaction to his master customers and had the character of a very sober and orderly boy but alas unhappy youth before he had compleated six years of his apprenticeship he commenced a fatal acquaintance with one elizabeth lyon otherwise calld edgworth bess from a town of that name in middlesex where she was born the reputed wife of a foot soldier and who lived a wicked and debauchd life and our young carpenter became enamourd of her and they must cohabit together as man and wife  now was laid the foundation of his ruin sheppard grows weary of the yoke of servitude and began to dispute with his master telling him that his way of jobbing from house to house was not sufficient to furnish him with a due experience in his trade and that if he would not set out to undertake some buildings he would step into the world for better information mr wood a mild sober honest man indulgd him and mrs wood with tears exhorted him against the company of this lewd prostitute but her man prompted and hardend by his harlot d nd her blood and threw a stick at his mistress and beat her to the ground and being with his master at work at mr britts the sun alehouse near islington upon a very trivial occasion fell upon his master and beat and bruised him in a most barbarous and shameful manner such a sudden and deplorable change was there in the behaviour of this promising young man next ensued a neglect of duty both to god and his master lying out of nights perpetual jarrings and animosities these and such like were the consequences of his intimacy with this she lyon who by the sequel will appear to have been a main loadstone in attracting of him up to this eminence of guilt  mr wood having reason to suspect that sheppard had robbd a neighbour began to be in great fear and terror for himself and when his man came not home in due season at nights bard him out but he made a mere jest of the locks and bolts and enterd in and out at pleasure and when mr wood and his wife have had all the reason in the world to believe him lockt out they have found him very quiet in his bed the next morning such was the power of his early magick  edgworth bess having stoln a gold ring from a gentleman whom she had pickd up in the streets was sent to st giless roundhouse sheppard went immediately to his consort and after a short discourse with mr brown the beadle and his wife who had the care of the place he fell upon the poor old couple took the keys from them and let his lady out at the door in spight of all the outcryes and opposition they were capable of making  about july 1723 he was by his master sent to perform a repair at the house of mr bains a piecebroker in whitehorse yard he from thence stole a roll of fustain containing 24 yards which was afterwards found in his trunk this is supposed to be the first robbery he ever committed and it was not long ere he repeated another upon this same mr bains by breaking into his house in the nighttime and taking out of the till seven pounds in money and goods to the value of fourteen pounds more how he enterd this house was a secret till his being last committed to newgate when he confessed that he took up the iron bars at the cellar window and after he had done his business he nailed them down again so that mr bains never believed his house had been broke and an innocent woman a lodger in the house lay all the while under the weight of a suspicion of committing the robbery  sheppard and his master had now parted ten months before the expiration of his apprenticeship a woeful parting to the former he was gone from a good and careful patronage and lay exposd to and complyd with the temptations of the most wicked wretches this town could afford as joseph blake alias blewskins william field doleing james sykes alias hell and fury which last was the first that betrayd and put him into the hands of justice as will presently appear  having deserted his masters service he took shelter in the house of mr charles in mayfair near piccadilly and his landlord having a necessity for some repairs in his house engagd one mr panton a carpenter to undertake them and sheppard to assist him as a journeyman but on the 23rd of october 1723 ere the work was compleat sheppard took occasion to rob the people of the effects following viz seven pound ten shillings in specie five large silver spoons six plain forks ditto four teaspoons six plain gold rings and a cypher ring four suits of wearing apparel besides linnen to a considerable value this fact he confessd to the reverend mr wagstaff before his escape from the condemnd hold of newgate  sheppard had a brother namd thomas a carpenter by profession tho a notorious thief and housebreaker by practice this thomas being committed to newgate for breaking the house of mrs mary cook a linnendraper in clarestreet claremarket on the 5th of february last and stealing goods to the value of between 50 and 60 l he impeachd his brother john sheppard and edgworth bess as being concerned with him in the fact and these three were also chargd with being concernd together in breaking the house of mr william phillips in drurylane and stealing divers goods the property of mrs kendrick a lodger in the house on the 14th of the said february all possible endeavours were usd by mrs cook and mr phillips to get john sheppard and edgworth bess apprehended but to no purpose till the following accident  sheppard was now upon his wicked range in london committing robberies every where at discretion but one day meeting with his acquaintance james sykes alias hell and fury sometimes a chairman and at others a running footman this sykes invited him to go to one redgates a victuallinghouse near the seven dials to play at skettles sheppard complyd and sykes secretly sent for mr price a constable in st giless parish and chargd him with his friend sheppard for the robbing of mrs cook c sheppard was carried before justice parry who orderd him to st giless roundhouse till the next morning for farther examination he was confind in the upper part of the place being two stories from the ground but ere two hours came about by only the help of a razor and the stretcher of a chair he broke open the top of the round house and tying together a sheet and blanket by them descended into the churchyard and escapd leaving the parish to repair the damage and repent of the affront put upon his skill and capacity  on the 19th of may last in the evening sheppard with another robber named benson were passing thro leicesterfields where a gentleman stood accusing a woman with an attempt to steal his watch a mobb was gathered about the disputants and sheppards companion being a master got in amongst them and pickd the gentlemans pocket in good earnest of the watch the scene was surprizingly changd from an imaginary robbery to a real one and in a moment ensued an outcry of stop thief sheppard and benson took to their heels and sheppard was seizd by a serjeant of the guard at leicester house crying out stop thief with much earnestness he was conveyd to st anns round house in soho and kept secure till the next morning when edgworth bess came to visit him who was seizd also they were carried before justice walters when the people in drurylane and claremarket appeared and charged them with the robberies aforementiond but sheppard pretending to impeach certain of his accomplices the justice committed them to newprison with intent to have them soon removed to newgate unless there came from them some useful discoveries sheppard was now a second time in the hands of justice but how long he intended to keep in them the reader will soon be able to judge  he and his mate were now in a strong and well guarded prison himself loaded with a pair of double links and basils17 of about fourteen pounds weight and confined together in the safest appartment calld newgate ward sheppard conscious of his crimes and knowing the information he had made to be but a blind amusement that would avail him nothing he began to meditate an escape they had been thus detained for about four days and their friends having the liberty of seeing them furnishd him with implements proper for his design accordingly mr sheppard goes to work and on the 25th of may being whitson monday at about two of the clock in the morning he had compleated a practicable breach and sawed of his fetters having with unheard of diligence and dexterity cut off an iron bar from the window and taken out a muntin or bar of the most solid oak of about nine inches in thickness by boring it thro in many places a work of great skill and labour they had still five and twenty foot to descend from the ground sheppard fastend a sheet and blanket to the bars and causes madam to take off her gown and petticoat and sent her out first and she being more corpulent than himself it was with great pain and difficulty that he got her through the interval and observing his directions was instantly down and more frighted than hurt the phylosopher followd and lighted with ease and pleasure but where are they escapd to why out of one prison into another the reader is to understand that the new prison and clerkenwell bridewell lye contiguous to one another and they are got into the yard of the latter and have a wall of twentytwo foot high to scale before their liberty is perfected sheppard far from being unprepared to surmount this difficulty has his gimblets and peircers ready and makes a scaleingladder the keepers and prisoners of both places are a sleep in their beds he mounts his bagage and in less than ten minutes carries both her and himself over this wall and compleats an entire escape altho his escape from the condemnd hold of newgate has made a far greater noise in the world than that from this prison hath it has been allowd by all the jaylkeepers in london that one so miraculous was never performd before in england the broken chains and bars are kept at new prison to testifie and preserve the memory of this extraordinary villain  sheppard not warnd by this admonition returns like a dog to his vomit and comes secretly into his master woods neighbourhood in witchstreet and conceits measures with one anthony lamb an apprentice to mr carter a mathematical instrumentmaker for robbing of mr barton a master taylor a man of worth and reputation who lodgd in mr carters house charles grace a graceless cooper was let into the secret and consented and resolved to act his part the 16th of june last was appointed lamb accordingly lets grace and sheppard into the house at midnight and they all go up to mr bartons appartment well armd with pistols and enterd his rooms without being disturbd grace was posted at mr bartons bedside with a loaded pistol and positive orders to shoot him through the head if in case he awakd sheppard being engagd in opening the trunks and boxes the mean while it luckily happend for mr barton that he slept sounder than usual that night as having come from a merrymaking with some friends tho poor man little dreaming in what dreadful circumstances they carried off in notes and bonds guineas cloaths made and unmade to the value of between two and three hundred pounds besides a padesuoy suit of cloaths worth about eighteen or twenty pounds more which having been made for a corpulent gentleman sheppard had them reducd and fitted for his own size and war as designing to appear and make a figure among the beau monde grace and sheppard having disposed of the goods at an alehouse in lewkenors lane a rendezvous of robbers and ruffians took their flight and grace had not been since heard of lamb was apprehended and carried before justice newton and made an ample confession and there being nothing but that against him at his tryal and withal a favourable prosecution he came off with a sentence of transportation only he as well as sheppard has since confirmd all the above particulars and with this addition viz that it was debated among them to have murderd all the people in the house save one person  about the latter end of the same month june mr kneebone a woollendraper near the new church in the strand receivd a caution from the father of anthony lamb who intimated to mr kneebone that his house was intended to be broke open and robbd that very night mr kneebone prepard for the event ordering his servants to sit up and gave directions to the watchman in the street to observe his house at about two in the morning sheppard and his gang were about the door a maidservant went to listen and heard one of the wretches say dan him if they could not enter that night they would another and would have 300l of his meaning mr kneebones money they went off and nothing more was heard of them till sunday the 12th day of july following when joseph blake alias blewskins john sheppard and william field as himself swears came about 12 oclock at night and cut two large oakenbars over the cellarwindow at the back part of the house in littledrurylane and so entered mr kneebone and his family being at rest they proceeded to open a door at the foot of the cellarstairs with three bolts and a large padlock upon it and then came up into the shop and wrenchd off the hasp and padlock that went over the press and arrivd at their desird booty they continud in the house for three hours and carryd off with them one hundred and eight yards of broad woollen cloth five yards of blue bays a light tyewig and beaverhat two silver spoons an handkerchief and a penknife in all to the value of near fifty pounds  the sunday following being the 19th of july sheppard and blewskins were out upon the hampstead road and there stopt a coach with a ladies woman in it from whom they took but halfacrown all the money then about her the footman behind the coach came down and exerted himself but sheppard sent him in hast up to his post again by threat of his pistol  the next night being the 20th of july about nine they robbd mr pargiter a chandler of hamstead near the halfwayhouse sheppard after his being taken at finchley was particularly examind about this robbery the reverend mr wagstaff having receivd a letter from an unknown hand with two questions to be proposd to sheppard viz whether he did rob john pargiter on monday the 20th of july about nine at night between the turnpike and hamstead how much money he took from him whither pargiter was drunk or not and if he had rings or watch about him when robbd which request was complyd with and sheppard affirmd that mr pargiter was very much in liquor having a great coat on neither rings on his fingers or watch and only three shillings in his pocket which they took from him and that blewskins knock him down twice with the buttend of his pistol to make sure work tho excess of drink had done that before but sheppard did in kindness raise him up as often  the next night july 21 they stopt a stagecoach and took from a passenger in it twentytwo shillings and were so expeditious in the matter that not two words were made about the bargain  now mr sheppards long and wicked course seemingly draws towards a period mr kneebone having applyd to jonathan wild and set forth advertisements in the papers complaining of his robbery on tuesday the 22d of july at night edgworth bess was taken in a brandyshop near templebar by jonathan wild she being much terrifyd discoverd where sheppard was a warrant was accordingly issued by justice blackerby and the next day he was apprehended at the house of blewskins mother in rosemarylane by one quilt a domestick of mr wilds though not without great opposition for he clapt a loaded pistol to quilts breast and attempted to shoot him but the pistol missd fire he was brought back to new prison confind in the dungeon and the next day carried before justice blackerby upon his examination he confessd the three robberies on the highway aforementiond as also the robbing of mr bains mr barton and mr kneebone he was committed to newgate and at the sessions of oyer and terminer and goal delivery holden at the oldbaily on the 12th 13th and 14th of august he was tryd upon three several indictments viz first for breaking the house of william philips  john sheppard of the parish of st martin in the fields was indicted for breaking the house of william philips and stealing divers goods the 14th of february last but there not being sufficient evidence against the prisoner he was acquitted  he was also indicted a second time of st clement danes for breaking the house of mary cook the 5th of february last and stealing divers goods but the evidence against the prisoner being defficient as to this indictment also he was acquitted  he was also indicted the third time of st mary savoy for breaking the house of william kneebone in the nighttime and stealing 108 yards of woollen cloth the 12th of july last the prosecutor deposd that the prisoner had some time since been his servant and when he went to bed the time mentioned in the indictment about 11 aclock at night he saw all the doors and windows fast but was calld up about four in the morning and found his house broke open the bars of a cellarwindow having been cut and the bolts of the door that comes up stairs drawn and the padlock wrenchd off and the shutter in the shop broken and his goods gone whereupon suspecting the prisoner he having committed ill actions thereabouts before he acquainted jonathan wild with it and he procurd him to be apprehended that he went to the prisoners in new prison and asking how he could be so ungrateful to rob him after he had shown him so much kindness the prisoner ownd he had been ungrateful in doing so informing him of several circumstances as to the manner of committing the fact but said he had been drawn into it by ill company jonathan wild deposd the prosecutor came to him and desird him to enquire after his goods that had been stolen telling him he suspected the prisoner to have been concernd in the robbery he having before committed some robberies in the neighbourhood that inquiring after him and having heard of him before he was informd that he was an acquaintance of joseph blake alias blewskins and william field whereupon he sent for william field who came to him upon which he told him if he would make an ingenuous confession he believd he could prevail with the court to make him an evidence that he did make a discovery of the prisoner upon which he was apprehended and also of others since convicted and gave an account of some parcels of the cloth which were found accordingly william field deposd that the prisoner told him and joseph blake that he knew a ken where they might get something of worth that they went to take a view of the prosecutors house but disprovd of the attempt as not thinking it easy to be performd but the prisoner perswaded them that it might easily be done he knowing the house he having livd with the prosecutor that thereupon he cut the cellar bar went into the cellar got into the shop and brought out three parcels of cloth which they carried away the prisoner had also confest the fact when he was apprehended and before the justice the fact being plainly provd the jury found him guilty of the indictment  sentence of death was pronouncd upon him accordingly several other prosecutions might have been brought against him but this was thought sufficient to rid the world of so capital an offender he begd earnestly for transportation to the most extream foot of his majestys dominions and pleaded youth and ignorance as the motive which had precipitated him into the guilt but the court deaf to his importunities as knowing him and his repeated crimes to be equally flagrant gave him no satisfactory answer he returnd to his dismal abode the condemnd hold where were nine more unhappy wretches in as dreadful circumstances as himself the court being at windsor the malefactors had a longer respite than is usual during that recess james harman lumley davis and sheppard agreed upon an escape concerted measures and provided instruments to make it effectual but put off the execution of their design on account the two gentlemen having their hopes of life daily renewed by the favourable answers they receivd from some considerable persons but those vanishing the day before their execution and finding their sentence irreversible they two dropt their hopes together with the design they formd for an escape and so in earnest prepard to meet death on the morrow which they accordingly did twas on this day mr davis gave sheppard the watch springs files saws c to effect his own release and knowing that a warrant was hourly expected for his execution with two others on the friday following he thought it high time to look about him for he had waited his tryal saw his conviction and heard his sentence with some patience but finding himself irrespitably decreed for death he could sit passive no longer and on the very day of the execution of the former whilst they were having their fetters taken off in order for going to the tree that day he began to saw saturday made a progress but sunday omitted by reason of the concourse in the lodge edgworth bess having been set at liberty had frequent access to him with others of his acquaintance on monday the death warrant came from windsor appointing that he together with joseph ward and anthony upton should be executed on the friday following being the 4th of september the keepers acquainted him therewith and desired him to make good use of that short time he thankd them said he would follow their advice and prepare edgworth bess and another woman had been with him at the door of the condemnd hold best part of the afternoon between five and six he desird the other prisoners except stephen fowles to remain above while he offerd something in private to his friends at the door they complyd and in this interval he got the spike asunder which made way for the skeleton to pass with his heels foremost by the assistance of fowles whom he most ungenerously betrayd to the keepers after his being retaken and the fellow was as severely punishd for it  having now got clear of his prison he took coach disguisd in a night gown at the corner of the old baily along with a man who waited for him in the street and is supposd to be page the butcher ordering the coachman to drive to blackfryers stairs where his prostitute gave him the meeting and they three took boat and went a shoar at the horseferry at westminster and at the whitehart they went in drank and stayd sometime thence they adjournd to a place in holbourn where by the help of a saw he quitted the chains he had brought with him from newgate and then like a freeman took his ramble through the city and came to spittlefields and there lay with edgeworth bess  it may be easy to imagine what an alarm his escape gave to the keepers of newgate three of their people being at the farther end of the lodge engagd in a discourse concerning his wonderful escape from newprison and what caution ought to be usd lest he should give them the slip at that very instant as he perfected it  on tuesday he sent for william page an apprentice to a butcher in claremarket who came to him and being pennyless he desird page to give him what assistance he could to make his way and being a neighbour and acquaintance he complyd with it but ere he would do any thing he consulted a near relation who as he said encouragd him in it nay put him upon it so meeting with this success in his application to his friend and probable an assistance in the pocket he came to sheppard having bought him a new blue butchers frock and another for himself and so both took their rout to warnden in northamptonshire where they came to a relation of pages who receivd and entertaind them kindly the people lying from their own bed to accommodate them sheppard pretending to be a butchers son in claremarket who was going farther in the country to his friends and that page was so kind as to accompany him but they as well as their friend became tird of one another the butchers having but one shilling left and the people poor and consequently unable to subsist two such fellows after a stay of three or four days they returnd and came for london and reachd the city on tuesday the 8th of september calling by the way at blackmaryshole and drinking with several of their acquaintance and then came into bishopsgate street to one cooleys a brandyshop where a cobler being at work in his stall stept out and swore ther was sheppard sheppard hearing him departed immediately in the evening they came into fleetstreet at about eight of the clock and observing mr martins a watchmakers shop to be open and a little boy only to look after it page goes in and asks the lad whether mr taylor a watchmaker lodgd in the house being answerd in the negative he came away and reports the disposition of the place sheppard now makes tryal of his old masterpeice fixeth a nail peircer into the door post fastens the knocker thereto with packthread breaks the glass and takes out three silver watches of 15 l value the boy seeing him take them but could not get out to pursue him by reason of his contrivance one of the watches he pledgd for a guinea and half the same night they came into watchstreet sheppard going into his masters yard and calling for his fellow prentice his mistress heard knew his voice and was dreadfully frightened he next went to the cock and pye alehouse in drurylane sent for a barber his acquaintance drank brandy and eat oysters in the view of several people page waiting all the while at the door the whole neighbourhood being alarmd yet none durst attempt him for fear of pistols c he had vowd revenge upon a poor man as kept a dairycellar at the end of whitehorseyard who having seen him at islington after his escape and engagd not to speak of it broke his promise wherefore sheppard went to his residence took the door off the hinges and threw it down amongst all the mans pans pipkins and causd a deluge of cream and milk all over the cellar  this night he had a narrow escape one mr ireton a sheriffs officer seeing him and page pass thro drurylane at about ten oclock pursud em and laid hold of page instead of sheppard who got off thus ireton missing the main man and thinking page of no consequence let him go after him  edgworth bess had been apprehended by jonathan wild and by sir francis forbes one of the aldermen of london committed to the poultrycompter for being aiding and assisting to sheppard in his escape the keepers and others terrifyd and purgd her as much as was possible to discover where he was but had it been in her inclination it was not in her power so to do as it manifestly appeard soon after  the people about the strand witchstreet and drurylane whom he had robbd and who had prosecuted him were under great apprensions and terror and in particular mr kneebone on whom he vowd a bloody revenge because he refusd to sign a petition in his behalf to the recorder of london this gentleman was forcd to keep armd people up in his house every night till he was retaken and had the same fortifyd in the strongest manner several other shopkeepers in this neighbourhood were also put to great expence and trouble to guard themselves against this dreadful villian  the keepers of newgate whom the rash world loaded with infamy stigmatizd and branded with the title of persons guilty of bribery for connivance at his escape they and what posse in their power either for love or money did contribute their utmost to undeceive a wrong notiond people their vigilance was remarkably indefatigable sparing neither money nor time night nor day to bring him back to his deservd justice after many intelligences which they endeavourd for and receivd they had one which provd very successful having learnt for a certainty that their haunts was about finchly common and being very well assurd of the very house where they lay on thursday the 10th of september a posse of men both of spirit and conduct furnishd with arms proper for their design went for finchley some in a coach and four and others on horseback they dispersd themselves upon the common aforesaid in order to make their view where they had not been long ere they came in sight of sheppard in company of william page habited like two butchers in new blue frocks with white aprons tuckd round their wastes  upon sheppards seeing langley a turnkey at newgate he says to his companion page i see a stag upon which their courage dropt knowing that now their dealing way of business was almost at an end however to make their flight as secure as they could they thought it adviseable to take to a footpath to cut off the pursuit of the newgate cavalry but this did not prove most successful langley came up with page who was hindermost and dismounting with pistol in hand commands page to throw up his hands which he trembling did begging for life desiring him to fisk him viz search him which he accordingly did and found a broad knife and file having thus disarmd him he takes the chubb along with him in quest of the slippery ele sheppard who had taken shelter in an old stable belonging to a farmhouse the pursuit was close the house invested and a girl seeing his feet as he stood up hid discoverd him austin a turnkey first attachd his person langley seconded him ireton an officer helpd to enclose and happy was the hindermost who aided in this great enterprise he being shockd with the utmost fear told them he submitted and desird they would let him live as long as he could which they did and usd him mildly upon searching him they found a broad knife with two of the watches as he had taken out of mr martins shop one under each armpit and now having gaind their point and made themselves masters of what they had often endeavoured for they came with their lost sheep to a little house on the common that sold liquors with this inscription on the sign i have brought my hogs to a fair market which our two unfortunate butchers under their then unhappy circumstances had too sad reason to apply to themselves sheppard had by this time recoverd his surprize grew calm and easy and desird them to give him brandy they did and were all good friends and company together  they adjournd with their booty to another place where was waiting a coach and four to convey it to town with more speed and safety and mr sheppard arrivd at his old mansion at about two in the afternoon at his alighting he made a sudden spring he declard his intention was to have slipt under the coach and had a race for it he was put into the condemndhold and chaind down to the floor with double basils about his feet c page was carried before sir francis forbes and committed to the same prison for accompanying and aiding sheppard in his escape the prudence of mr pitt causd a separation between him and his brother the first night as a means to prevent any ensuing danger by having two heads which according to our proverbial saying are better than one  the joy the people of newgate conceivd on this occasion is inexpressible te deum was sung in the lodge and nothing but smiles and bumpers were seen there for many days together but jonathan wild unfortunately happend to be gone upon a wrong scent after him to sturbridge and lost a share of the glory  his escape and his being so suddenly retaken made such a noise in the town that it was thought all the common people would have gone mad about him there being not a porter to be had for love nor money nor getting into an alehouse for butchers shoemakers and barbers all engagd in controversies and wagers about sheppard newgate night and day surrounded with the curious from st giless and ragfair and tyburn road daily lind with women and children and the gallows as carefully watchd by night lest he should be hangd incog for a report of that nature obtaind much upon the rabble in short it was a week of the greatest noise and idleness among mechanicks that has been known in london and parker and pettis two lyricks subsisted many days very comfortably upon ballads and letters about sheppard the vulgar continud under great doubts and difficulties in what would be his case and whether the old warrant or a new one must be made for his execution or a new tryal c were the great questions as arose and occasiond various reasonings and speculation till a news paper calld the daily journal set them all to rights by the publication of the account following viz        j sheppard having been convicted of burglary and felony      and received sentence of death and afterwards escapd from      newgate and being since retaken we are assurd that it      must be provd in a regular and judicial way that he is      the same person who was so convicted and made his escape      before a warrant can be obtaind for his execution and that      this affair well be brought before the court at the old      baily the next sessions  this was enough people began to grow calm and easy and got shavd and their shoes finishd and business returned into its former channel the town resolving to wait the sessions with patience  the reverend mr wagstaff who officiated in the absence of the ordinary renewd his former acquaintance with mr sheppard and examind him in a particular manner concerning his escape from the condemnd hold he sincerely disownd that all or any belonging to the prison were privy thereto but related it as it has been describd he declard that edgworth bess who had hitherto passd for his wife was not really so this was by some thought to be in him base and ungenerous in that as she had contributed towards his escape and was in custody on that account it might render her more liable to punishment than if she had been thought his wife but he endeavourd to acquit himself by saying that she was the sole author of all his misfortunes that she betrayd him to jonathan wild at the time he was taken in rosemarylane and that when he was contriving his escape she disobeyd his orders as when being requird to attend at the door of the condemndhold by nine or ten in the morning to facilitate his endeavours she came not till the evening which he said was an ungrateful return for the care he had taken in setting her at liberty from newprison and thus justifyd himself in what he had done and said he card not what became of her  he was also examined about mr martins watches and whether page was privy to that robbery he carefully guarded himself against uttering any thing that might affect him peremptorily declard him innocent of that as well as of being privy to his escape and said that he only out of kindness as being an old companion was resolvd to share in his fortunes after he had escapd  he was again continually meditating a second escape as appeard by his own hardiness and the instruments found upon him on saturday the 12th and wednesday the 16th of september the first time a small file was found conceald in his bible and the second time two files a chisel and an hammer being hid in the rushes of a chair and whenever a question was movd to him when or by what means those implements came to his hands he would passionately fly out and say how can you you always ask me these and such like questions and in a particular manner when he was askd whether his companion page was an accomplice with him either in the affair of the watches or any other he replyd that if he knew he would give no direct answer thinking it to be a crime in him to detect the guilty  it was thought necessary by the keepers to remove him from the condemndhold to a place calld the castle in the body of the goal and to chain him down to two large iron staples in the floor the concourse of people of tolerable fashion to see him was exceeding great he was always chearful and pleasant to a degree as turning almost every thing as was said into a jest and banter  being one sunday at the chapel a gentleman belonging to the lord mayor askd a turnkey which was sheppard the man pointed to him says sheppard yes sir i am the sheppard and all the goalers in the town are my flock and i cannot stir into the country but they are all at my heels baughing after me c  he told mr robins the city smith that he had procurd him a small job and that whoever it was that put the spikes on the condemndhold was an honest man for a better peice of metal says he i never wrought upon in my life  he was loth to believe his frequent robberies were an injury to the public for he usd to say that if they were ill in one respect they were as good in another and that though he card not for working much himself yet he was desirous that others should not stand idle more especially those of his own trade who were always repairing of his breaches  when serious and that but seldom he would reflect on his past wicked life he declard to us that for several years of his apprenticeship he had an utter abhorrence to women of the town and usd to pelt them with dirt when they have fell in his way till a buttonmouldmaker his next neighbour left off that business and set up a victuallinghouse in lewkenhorslane where himself and other young apprentices resorted on sundays and at all other opportunities at this house began his acquaintance with edgworth bess his sentiments were strangely alterd and from an aversion to those prostitutes he had a more favourable opinion and even conversation with them till he contracted an ill distemper which as he said he curd himself of by a medicine of his own preparing  he inveighd bitterly against his brother thomas for putting him into the information for mrs cooks robberry and pretended that all the mischiefs that attended him was owing to that matter he acknowledgd that he was concernd in that fact and that his said brother broke into his lodgings and stole from him all his share and more of the acquird booty  he oftentimes averrd that william field was no ways concernd in mr kneebones robbery but that being a brother of the quill blewskin and himself told him the particulars and manner of the facts and that all he swore against him at his tryal was false and that he had other authority for it than what came out of their sheppard and blewskin mouths who actually committed the fact  and moreover that field being acquainted with their warehouse a stable near the horseferry at westminster which sheppard had hird and usually resposited therein the goods he stole he came one night and broke open the same and carried off the best part of the effects taken out of mr kneebones shop  sheppard said he thought this to be one of the greatest villanies that could be acted for another to come and plunder them of things for which they had so honourably venturd their lives and wishd that field as well as his brother tom might meet with forgiveness for it  he declard himself frequently against the practice of whidling or impeaching which he said had made dreadful havock among the thieves and much lamented the depravity of the brethren in that respect and said that if all were but such tightcocks as himself the reputation of the british thievery might be carried to a far greater height than it had been done for many ages and that there would then be but little necessity for jaylors and hangmen  these and such like were his constant discourses when company went up with the turnkeys to the castle to see him and few or none went away without leaving him money for his support in which he abounded and did therewith some small charities to the other prisoners however he was abstemious and sparing enough in his diet  among the many schemes laid by his friends for the preserving himself after his escape we were told of a most remarkable one proposd by an ingenious person who advisd that he might be expeditiously and secretly conveyd to the palace at windsor and there to prostrate his person and his case at the feet of a most gracious prince and his case being so very singular and new it might in great probability move the royal fountain of unbounded clemency but he declind this advice and followd the judgment and dictates of butchers which very speedily brought him very near the door of the slaughterhouse  on the 4th of september the day as joseph ward and anthony upton were executed there was publishd a whimsical letter as from sheppard to jack ketch which afforded diversion to the town and bread to the author which is as followeth viz        sir       i thank you for the favour you intended me this day i am a      gentleman and allow you to be the same and i hope can      forgive injuries fond nature prompted i obeyd oh      propitious minute and to show that i am in charity i am now      drinking your health and a bon repo to poor joseph and      anthony i am gone a few days for the air but design      speedily to embark and this night i am going upon a mansion      for a supply its a stout fortification but what      difficulties cant i encounter when dear jack you find      that bars and chains are but trifling obstacles in the way of      your friend and servant       john sheppard       from my residence in terra australi incognito       ps pray my service to mr or di y and to mr      app ee  on saturday the 10th of october anthony lamb and thomas sheppard with 95 other felons were carried from newgate on shipboard for transportation to the plantations the last beggd to have an opportunity given him of taking his final leave of his brother john but this was not to be granted and the greatest favour that could be obtaind was that on the sunday before they had an interview at the chapel but at such a distance that they neither saluted or shook hands and the reason given for it was that no implements might be conveyd to sheppard to assist him in making an escape  this caution seemd to be absolutely necessary for it appeard soon after that sheppard found means to release himself from the staples to which he was chaind in the castle by unlocking a great padlock with a nail which he had pickt up on the floor and endeavourd to pass up the chimney but was prevented by the stout iron bars fixd in his way and wanted nothing but the smallest file to have perfected his liberty when the assistants of the prison came as usual with his victuals they began to examine his irons to their great surprize they found them loose and ready to be taken off at pleasure mr pitt the head keeper and his deputies were sent for and sheppard finding this attempt entirely frustrated discoverd to them by what means he had got them off and after they had searchd him found nothing and lockd and chaind him down again he took up the nail and unlocked the padlock before their faces they were struck with the greatest amazement as having never heard or beheld the like before he was then handcuffd and more effectually chaind  the next day the reverend mr purney ordinary of the place came from the country to visit him and complaind of the sad disposition he found him in as meditateing on nothing but means to escape and declining the great duty incumbent upon him to prepare for his approaching change he began to relent and said that since his last effort had provd not successful he would entertain no more thoughts of that nature but entirely dispose and resign himself to the mercy of almighty god of whom he hopd to find forgiveness of his manifold offences  he said that edgworth bess and himself kept a little brandyshop together in lewkenhorslane and once savd about thirty pounds but having such an universal acquaintance amongst theives he had frequent calls to go abroad and soon quitted that business and his shop  on friday the 2d of october his old confederate joseph blake alias blewskin was apprehended and taken at a house in st giless parish by jonathan wild and by justice blackerby committed to newgate william field who was at his liberty appearing and making oath that blewskin together with john sheppard and himself committed the burglary and felony in mr kneebones house for which sheppard was condemnd  the sessions commencing at the oldbailey on wednesday the 14th of october following an indictment was found against blewskin for the same and he was brought down from newgate to the oldbailey to be arraignd in order to his tryal and being in the yard within the gate before the court mr wild being there drinking a glass of wine with him he said to mr wild you may put in a word for me as well as for another person to which mr wild replyd i cannot do it you are certainly a dead man and will be tuckd up very speedily or words to that effect whereupon blewskin on a sudden seizd mr wild by the neck and with a little clasp knife he was provided with he cut his throat in a very dangerous manner and had it not been for a muslin stock twisted in several plaits round his neck he had in all likelyhood succeeded in his barbarous design before ballard the turnkey who was at hand could have time to lay hold of him the villain trumphd afterwards in what he had done swearing many bloody oaths that if he had murderd him he should have died with satisfaction and that his intention was to have cut off his head and thrown it into the sessions houseyard among the rabble and cursd both his hand and the knife for not executing it effectually  mr wild instantly had the assistance of three able surgeons viz mr dobbins mr marten and mr coletheart who sewd up the wound and orderd him to his bed and he has continud ever since but in a doubtful state of recovery  the felons on the common side of newgate also animated by sheppards example the night before they were to be shipt for transporation had cut several iron bars assunder and some of them had sawd off their fetters the rest huzzaing and making noises under pretence of being joyful that they were to be removd on the morrow to prevent the workmen being heard and in two hours time more if their design had not been discoverd near one hundred villians had been let loose into the world to have committed new depredations nothing was wanted here but sheppards great judgment who was by himself in the strong room calld the castle meditating his own deliverance which he perfected in the manner following  on thursday the 15th of this instant october at between one and two in the afternoon william austin an assistant to the keepers a man reputed to be a very diligent and faithful servant went to sheppard in the strong room calld the castle with his necessaries as was his custom every day there went along with him captain geary the keeper of new prison mr gough belonging to the gatehouse in westminster and two other gentlemen who had the curiosity to see the prisoner austin very strictly examined his fetters and his handcuffs and found them very safe he eat his dinner and talkd with his usual gayety to the company they took leave of him and wishd him a good evening the court being sitting at the oldbailey the keepers and most of their servants were attending there with their prisoners and sheppard was told that if he wanted any thing more then was his time because they could not come to him till the next morning he thankd them for their kindness and desird them to be as early as possible  the same night soon after 12 of the clock mr bird who keeps a turnersshop adjoyning to newgate was disturbd by the watchman who found his street door open and calld up the family and they concluding the accident was owing to the carelessness of some in the house shut their doors and went to bed again  the next morning friday at about eight mr austin went up as usual to wait on sheppard and having unlockd and unbolted the double doors of the castle he beheld almost a cartload of bricks and rubbish about the room and his prisoner gone the man ready to sink came trembling down again and was scarce able to acquaint the people in the lodge with what had happend  the whole posse of the prison ran up and stood like men deprivd of their senses their surprize being over they were in hopes that he might not have yet entirely made his escape and got their keys to open all the strong rooms adjacent to the castle in order to trace him when to their farther amazement they found the door ready opend to their hands and the strong locks screws and bolts broken in pieces and scatterd about the jayl six great doors one whereof having not been opend for seven years past were forcd and it appeard that he had descended from the leads of newgate by a blanket which he fastend to the wall by an iron spike he had taken from the hatch of the chapel on the house of mr bird and the door on the leads having been left open it is very reasonable to conclude he past directly to the street door down the stairs mr bird and his wife hearing an odd sort of a noise on the stairs as they lay in their bed a short time before the watchman alarmd the family  infinite numbers of citizens came to newgate to behold sheppards workmanship and mr pitt and his officers very readily conducted them up stairs that the world might be convincd there was not the least room to suspect either a negligence or connivance in the servants every one expressd the greatest surprize that has been known and declard themselves satisfyd with the measures they had taken for the security of their prisoner  one of the sheriffs came in person and went up to the castle to be satisfyd of the situation of the place c attended by several of the city officers  the court being sat at the sessionshouse the keepers were sent for and examind and the magistrates were in great consternation that so horrid a wretch had escapd their justice it being intended that he should have been brought down to the court the last day of the sessions and orderd for execution in two or three days after if it appeard that he was the person condemnd for the breaking mr kneebones house and included in the warrant for execution c  many of the methods by which this miraculous escape was effected remain as yet a secret there are some indeed too evident the most reasonable conjecture that has hierto been made is that the first act was his twisting and breaking assunder by the strength of his hands a small iron chain which together with a great horse padlock as went from the heavy fetters about his legs to the staples confind him to the floor and with a nail opend the padlock and set himself at liberty about the room a large flat iron bar appears to have been taken out of the chimney with the assistance thereof tis plain he broke thro a wall of many foot in thickness and made his way from the castle into another strong room contiguous the door of it not having been opend since several of the preston prisoners were confind there about seven years ago three screws are visibly taken off of the lock and the doors as strong as art could make them forcd open the locks and bolts either wrenchd or broke and the cases and other irons made for their security cut assunder an iron spike broke off from the hatch in the chapel which he fixd in the wall and fastend his blanket to it to drop on the leads of mr birds house his stockings were found on the leads of newgate tis questiond whether sixty pounds will repair the damage done to the jayl  it will perhaps be inquird how all this could be performd without his being heard by the prisoners or the keepers tis well known that the place of his confinement is in the upper part of the prison none of the other felons being kept any where near him and tis supposd that if any had heard him at work they would rather have facilitated than frustrated his endeavours in the course of his breaches he passd by a door on his left belonging to the commonside felons who have since cursd him heartily for his not giving them an opportunity to kiss his hand and lending them a favourable lift when his hand was in but that was not a work proper for mr sheppard to do in his then circumstances  his fetters are not to be found any where about the jayl from whence tis concluded he has either thrown them down some chimney or carried them off on his legs the latter seems to be impracticable and would still render his escaping in such manner the more astonishing and the only answer that is given to the whole at newgate is that the devil came in person and assisted him  he undoubtedly performd most of these wonders in the darkest part of the night and without the least glimpse of a candle a word he has actually done with his own hands in a few hours what several of the most skilful artists allow could not have been acted by a number of persons furnishd with proper implements and all other advantages in a full day  never was there anything better timd the keepers and all their assistants being obliged to a strict attendance on the sessions at the old bailey which held for about a week and blewskin having confind jonathan wild to his chamber a more favourable opportunity could not have presented for mr sheppards purposes  the jaylors sufferd much by the opinion the ignorant part of the people entertaind of the matter and nothing would satisfie some but that they not only connivd at but even assisted him in breaking their own walls and fences and that for this reason too viz that he should be at liberty to instruct and train up others in his method of housebreaking and replenish the town with a new set of rogues to supply the places of those transported beyond sea  this is indeed a fine way of judging the wellknown characters of mr pitt and his deputies are sufficient to wipe of such ridiculous imputations and tis a most lamentable truth that they have oftentimes had in their charge villains of the deepest die persons of quality and great worth for whom no entreaties no sums how large soever have been able to interfere between the doleful prison and the fatal tree  the officers have done their duty they are but men and have had to deal with a creature something more than man a protoeus supernatural words cannot describe him his actions and workmanship which are too visible best testifie him  on saturday the 17th joseph blake alias blewskin came upon his tryal at the old bailey field gave the same evidence against him as he had formerly done against sheppard and the prisoner making but a triffling defence the jury found him guilty of buglary and felony the criminal when the verdict was brought in made his obeysances to the court and thankd them for their kindness  it will be necessary that we now return to the behaviour of mr sheppard some few days before his last flight  mr figg the famous prize fighter comeing to see him in newgate there past some pleasant raillery between them and after mr figg was gone sheppard declared he had a mind to send him a formal challenge to fight him at all the weapons in the strong room and that let the consequence be what it would he should call at mr figgs house in his way to execution and drink a merry glass with him by way of reconciliation  a young woman an acquaintance of his mother who washd his linnen and brought him necessaries having in an affray got her eyes beaten black and blue says sheppard to her how long hast thou been married replyes the wench i wonder you can ask me such a question when you so well know the contrary nay says sheppard again sarah dont deny it for you have gotten your certificate in your face  mr ireton a bailiff in drurylane having pursued sheppard after his escape from the condemndhold with uncommon diligence for the safety of that neighbourhood which was the chief scene of his villainies sheppard when retaken declared he would be even with him for it and if ever he procurd his liberty again he would give all his prisoners an act of grace a gentleman in a jocose way askd him to come and take a dinner with him sheppard replyd he accepted of the invitation and perhaps might take an opportunity to wait on him and there is great reason to believe he has been as good as his word  he would complain of his nights as saying it was dark with him from five in the evening till seven in the morning and being not permitted to have either a bed or candle his circumstances were dismal and that he never slept but had some confusd doses he said he considerd all this with the temper of a philosopher  neither his sad circumstances nor the solemn exhortations of the several divines who visited him were able to divert him from this ludicrous way of expression he said they were all gingerbread fellows and came rather out of curiosity than charity and to form papers and ballads out of his behaviour  a welch clergyman who came pretty often requested him in a particularly manner to refrain drinking tho indeed there was no necessity for that caution sheppard says doctor you set an example and ill follow this was a smart satyr and repartee upon the parson some circumstances considerd  when he was visited in the castle by the reverend mr wagstaff he put on the face only of a preparation for his end as appeard by his frequent attempts made upon his escape and when he has been pressd to discover those who put him upon means of escaping and furnishd him with implements he would passionately and with a motion of striking say ask me no such questions one files worth all the bibles in the world  when askd if he had not put off all thoughts of an escape and entertaind none but those of death would answer by way of question not directly whether they thought it possible or probable for him to effect his release when manackled in the manner he was when movd to improve the few minutes that seemd to remain of his life he did indeed listen to but not regard the design and purport of his admonition breaking in with something new of his own either with respect to his former accomplices or actions and all too with pleasure and gayety of expression  when in chapel he would seemingly make his responses with devotion but would either laugh or force expressions when as an auditor of the sermon be of contempt either of the preacher or of his discourse  in fine he behavd so in word and action since retaken that demonstrated to the world that his escape was the utmost employ of his thoughts whatever face of penitence he put on when visited by the curious        an account of sheppards adventures of five hours immediately      after his escape from newgate in a letter to his friend       dear friend       over a bottle of claret youll give me leave to declare      it that ive fairly put the vowels upon the good folks at      newgate iou when im able i may or may not discharge      my fees tis a feesimple for a man in my condition to      acknowledge and tho im safe out of newgate i must yet      have or at least affect a new gate by limping or turning      my toes in by making a right hand of my feet not to be      long for i hate prolixity in all business in short      after filing defileing sawing when no body saw      climbing this clime in it provd a good turner of my      affairs thro the house of a turner being quite past and      safe from estreat on person or chattels and safe in the      street i thought thanks due to him who coud deliver      hence and immediately for you must know im a catholick      to give thanks for my deliverance i stept amongst the      greyfryers to come an joyn with me in saying a      paternoster or so at amencorner the fryers being      fat began to broil and soon after boild up into a      passion to be disturbd at that time of night but being got      loose and having no time to lose i gave them good words      and so the business was done from thence i soon slipd      through ludgate but was damnably fearful of an old bailey      always lurking thereabout who might have brought me to the      fleet for being too nimble besides i was wonderfully      apprehensive of receiving some unwelcome huggings from the      wn there therefore with a step and a stride i soon got      over fleetditch and as in justice i ought i praisd the      bridge i got over being a batchelor and not being      capable to to manage a bridewell you know i had no business      near st brides so kept the right handside designing to      pop into the alley as usual but fearing to go thro      there and harp too much on the same string it gave an      allay to my intention and on i went to shoelane end but      there meeting with a bully hack of the town he woud have      shovd me down which my spirit resenting tho a brawny      dog i soon collerd him fell souse at him then with his      own cane i strapped till he was force to buckle too and      hold his tongue in so much he durst not say his soul was      his own and was glad to pack of at last and turn his      heels upon me i was glad he was gone you may be sure and      dextrously made a hand of my feet under the      legtavern but the very thoughts of fetterlane calld to      mind some passages which made me avoid the passage at the      end of it next to the coffee house you know so i soon      whipd over the way yet going along two wooden loggerheads      at st dunstans made just them a damnd noise about their      quarters but the sight of me made perfectly hush in a      minute now fearing to goe by chancea wrylane as being      upon the watch my self and not to be debarrd at      templebar i stole up bellyard but narrowly escapd      being clapperclawd by two fellows i did not like in the      alley so was forcd to goe round with a design to sheeroff      into sheerlane but the trumpet sounding at that very      time alarmd me so i was forcd to grope my way back through      hemlockcourt and take my passage by shipyard without      the bar again but there meeting with one of our trusty      friends all ceremonies apart he told me under the rose i      must expect no mercy in st clements parish for the      butchers there on the back ont would face me and with      their cleavers soon bring me down on my marrow bones you      may believe i soon hastened thence but by this time being      fainty and night spent i put forward and seeing a light      near the savoygate i was resolvd not to make light of      the opportunity but calld for an hearty dram of luther and      calvin that is mum and geneva mixd but having fasted      so long before it soon got into my noddle and eer i had      gone twenty steps it had so intirely stranded my reason      that by the time i came to halfmoonstreet end it gave a      newexchange to my senses and made me quite lunatick       however after a little rest i stole down georgepassage      into oafalley in yorkbuildings and thence tho a vile      man into villiersstreet and so into the strand again      where having gone a little way heffordsharp at the sign      of the irishharp put me a jumping and dancing to that      degree that i could not forbear making a somerset or two      before northumberlandhouse i thought once of taking the      windsor coach for my self john sheppard by the name of      crook but fearing to be hookd in before my journeys      end i stept into hedgelane where two harlots were up in      the boughs it seems branching out their respects to one      another through their windows and people beginning to gather      thereabout i ran pelmel to piccadilly where meeting by      meer chance a bakers cart going to turnhamgreen i being      not mealy mouthd nor the man being crusty i wheeld      out of town       i did call at hammersmith having no occasion directly i      shall stay two or three days in that neighbourhood so if you      direct a letter for mr sligh bolt to be left with mrs      tabitha skymmington at cheesewick its safety will bear      water by any boat and come current with the tyde to       dear bob      yours from the top      of newgate to the bottom                     j sheppard       ps if you see blewskin tell him i am well and hope he      receivd my lasti woud write by the post if i durst but      it woud be certainly postpond if i did and it would be      stranger too to trust a line by a stranger who might      palm upon us both and never deliver it to hand       i send this by a waterman i dare trust who is very merry      upon me and says he woud not be in my jacket saturday      octob 17 1724  we shall conclude with what had been often observd by many persons to sheppard viz that it was very imprudent in him to take shelter in the city or the adjacent parts of it after his escape from the condemnd hold and withal to commit a capital offence almost within sight of newgate when his life and all was in such danger his reply was general viz that it was his fate but being askd a particular reason for his not taking a longer rout than the city and the neighbouring parts pleaded poverty as his excuse for confinement within those limits at the same time urging that had he been master at that time of five pounds england should not have been the place of his residence having a good trade in his hands to live in any populated part of the world
