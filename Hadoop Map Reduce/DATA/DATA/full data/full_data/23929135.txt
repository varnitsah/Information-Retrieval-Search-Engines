      66     three sunsets     he saw her once and in the glance     a moments glance of meeting eyes   his heart stood still in sudden trance     he trembled with a sweet surprise   all in the waning light she stood   the star of perfect womanhood    that summereve his heart was light     with lighter step he trod the ground   and life was fairer in his sight     and music was in every sound   he blessed the world where there could be   so beautiful a thing as she    there once again as evening fell     and stars were peering overhead   two lovers met to bid farewell     the western sun gleamed faint and red   lost in a drift of purple cloud   that wrapped him like a funeralshroud    long time the memory of that night     the hand that clasped the lips that kissed   the form that faded from his sight     slow sinking through the tearful mist   in dreamy music seemed to roll   through the dark chambers of his soul    so after many years he came     a wanderer from a distant shore   the street the house were still the same     but those he sought were there no more   his burning words his hopes and fears   unheeded fell on alien ears    only the children from their play     would pause the mournful tale to hear   shrinking in halfalarm away     or step by step would venture near   to touch with timid curious hands   that strange wild man from other lands    he sat beside the busy street     there where he last had seen her face   and thronging memories bittersweet     seemed yet to haunt the ancient place   her footfall ever floated near   her voice was ever in his ear    he sometimes as the daylight waned     and evening mists began to roll   in halfsoliloquy complained     of that black shadow on his soul   and blindly fanned with cruel care   the ashes of a vain despair    the summer fled the lonely man     still lingered out the lessening days   still as the night drew on would scan     each passing face with closer gaze   till sick at heart he turned away   and sighed she will not come today    so by degrees his spirit bent     to mock its own despairing cry   in stern selftorture to invent     new luxuries of agony   and people all the vacant space   with visions of her perfect face    then for a moment she was nigh     he heard no step but she was there   as if an angel suddenly     were bodied from the viewless air   and all her fine ethereal frame   should fade as swiftly as it came    so half in fancys sunny trance     and half in miserys aching void   with set and stony countenance     his bitter being he enjoyed   and thrust for ever from his mind   the happiness he could not find    as when the wretch in lonely room     to selfish death is madly hurled   the glamour of that fatal fume     shuts out the wholesome living world   so all his manhoods strength and pride   one sickly dream had swept aside    yea brother and we passed him there     but yesterday in merry mood   and marveled at the lordly air     that shamed his beggars attitude   nor heeded that ourselves might be   wretches as desperate as he    who let the thought of bliss denied     make havoc of our life and powers   and pine in solitary pride     for peace that never shall be ours   because we will not work and wait   in trustful patience for our fate    and so it chanced once more that she     came by the old familiar spot   the face he would have died to see     bent oer him and he knew it not   too rapt in selfish grief to hear   even when happiness was near    and pity filled her gentle breast     for him that would not stir nor speak   the dying crimson of the west     that faintly tinged his haggard cheek   fell on her as she stood and shed   a glory round the patient head    ah let him wake the moments fly     this awful tryst may be the last   and see the tear that dimmed her eye     had fallen on him ere she passed   she passed the crimson paled to gray   and hope departed with the day    the heavy hours of night went by     and silence quickened into sound   and light slid up the eastern sky     and life began its daily round   but light and life for him were fled   his name was numbered with the dead  nov 1861   illustration     the path of roses     in the dark silence of an ancient room   whose one tall window fronted to the west   where through laced tendrils of a hanging vine   the sunsetglow was fading into night   sat a pale lady resting weary hands   upon a great clasped volume and her face   within her hands not as in rest she bowed   but large hot tears were coursing down her cheek   and her lowpanted sobs broke awefully   upon the sleeping echoes of the night     soon she unclaspd the volume once again   and read the words in tone of agony   as in selftorture weeping as she read    he crowns the glory of his race   he prayeth but in some fit place   to meet his foeman face to face    and battling for the true the right   from ruddy dawn to purple night   to perish in the midmost fight    where hearts are fierce and hands are strong   where peals the bugle loud and long   where blood is dropping in the throng    still with a dim and glazing eye   to watch the tide of victory   to hear in death the battlecry    then gathered grandly to his grave   to rest among the true and brave   in holy ground where yewtrees wave    where from churchwindows sculptured fair   float out upon the evening air   the note of praise the voice of prayer    where no vain marble mockery   insults with loud and boastful lie   the simple soldiers memory    where sometimes little children go   and read in whisperd accent slow   the name of him who sleeps below    her voice died out like one in dreams she sat   alas she sighed for what can woman do   her life is aimless and her death unknown   hemmed in by social forms she pines in vain   man has his work but what can woman do     and answer came there from the creeping gloom   the creeping gloom that settled into night   peace for thy lot is other than a mans   his is a path of thorns he beats them down   he faces death he wrestles with despair   thine is of roses to adorn and cheer   his lonely life and hide the thorns in flowers     she spake again in bitter tone she spake   aye as a toy the puppet of an hour   or a fair posy newly plucked at morn   but flung aside and withered ere the night     and answer came there from the creeping gloom   the creeping gloom that blackened into night   so shalt thou be the lamp to light his path   what time the shades of sorrow close around     and so it seemed to her an awful light   pierced slowly through the darkness orbed and grew   until all passed awaythe ancient room   the sunlight dying through the trellised vine   the one tall windowall had passed away   and she was standing on the mighty hills     beneath around and far as eye could see   squadron on squadron stretched opposing hosts   ranked as for battle mute and motionless   anon a distant thunder shook the ground   the tramp of horses and a troop shot by   plunged headlong in that living sea of men   plunged to their death back from that fatal field   a scattered handful fighting hard for life   broke through the serried lines but as she gazed   they shrank and melted and their forms grew thin   grew pale as ghosts when the first morning ray   dawns from the eastthe trumpets brazen blare   died into silenceand the vision passed   passed to a room where sick and dying lay   in long sad linethere brooded fear and pain   darkness was there the shade of azraels wing   but there was one that ever to and fro   moved with light footfall purely calm her face   and those deep steadfast eyes that starred the gloom   still as she went she ministered to each   comfort and counsel cooled the fevered brow   with softest touch and in the listening ear   of the pale sufferer whispered words of peace   the dying warrior gazing as she passed   clasped his thin hands and blessed her bless her too   thou who didst bless the merciful of old     so prayed the lady watching tearfully   her gentle moving onward till the night   had veiled her wholly and the vision passed     then once again the solemn whisper came   so in the darkest path of mans despair   where war and terror shake the troubled earth   lies womans mission with unblenching brow   to pass through scenes of horror and affright   where men grow sick and tremble unto her   all things are sanctified for all are good   nothing so mean but shall deserve her care   nothing so great but she may bear her part   no life is vain each hath his place assigned   do thou thy task and leave the rest to god   and there was silence but the lady made   no answer save one deeplybreathed amen     and she arose and in that darkening room   stood lonely as a spirit of the night   stood calm and fearless in the gathered night   and raised her eyes to heaven there were tears   upon her face but in her heart was peace   peace that the world nor gives nor takes away  april 10 1856   illustration     the valley of the shadow of death     hark said the dying man and sighed       to that complaining tone   like sprite condemned each eventide       to walk the world alone   at sunset when the air is still   i hear it creep from yonder hill   it breathes upon me dead and chill       a moment and is gone    my son it minds me of a day       left half a life behind   that i have prayed to put away       for ever from my mind   but bitter memory will not die   it haunts my soul when none is nigh   i hear its whisper in the sigh       of that complaining wind    and now in death my soul is fain       to tell the tale of fear   that hidden in my breast hath lain       through many a weary year   yet time would fail to utter all   the evil spells that held me thrall   and thrust my life from fall to fall       thou needest not to hear    the spells that bound me with a chain       sins stern behests to do   till pleasures self invoked in vain       a heavy burden grew   till from my spirits fevered eye   a hunted thing i seemed to fly   through the dark woods that underlie       yon mountainrange of blue    deep in those woods i found a vale       no sunlight visiteth   nor star nor wandering moonbeam pale       where never comes the breath   of summerbreezethere in mine ear   even as i lingered half in fear   i heard a whisper cold and clear       this is the gate of death    o bitter is it to abide       in weariness alway   at dawn to sigh for eventide       at eventide for day   thy noon hath fled thy sun hath shone   the brightness of thy day is gone   what need to lag and linger on       till life be cold and gray    o well it said beneath yon pool       in some still cavern deep   the fevered brain might slumber cool       the eyes forget to weep   within that goblets mystic rim   are draughts of healing stored for him   whose heart is sick whose sight is dim       who prayeth but to sleep    the eveningbreeze went moaning by       like mourner for the dead   and stirred with shrill complaining sigh       the treetops overhead   my guardianangel seemed to stand   and mutely wave a warning hand   with sudden terror all unmanned       i turned myself and fled    a cottagegate stood open wide       soft fell the dying ray   on two fair children side by side       that rested from their play   together bent the earnest head   as ever and anon they read   from one dear book the words they said       come back to me today    like twin cascades on mountainstair       together wandered down   the ripples of the golden hair       the ripples of the brown   while through the tangled silken haze   blue eyes looked forth in eager gaze   more starlike than the gems that blaze       about a monarchs crown    my son there comes to each an hour       when sinks the spirits pride   when weary hands forget their power       the strokes of death to guide   in such a moment warriors say   a word the panicrout may stay   a sudden charge redeem the day       and turn the living tide    i could not see for blinding tears       the glories of the west   a heavenly music filled mine ears       a heavenly peace my breast   come unto me come unto me   all ye that labour unto me   ye heavyladen come to me       and i will give you rest    the night drew onward thin and blue       the evening mists arise   to bathe the thirsty land in dew       as erst in paradise   while over silent field and town   the deep blue vault of heaven looked down   not as of old in angry frown       but bright with angels eyes    blest day then first i heard the voice       that since hath oft beguiled   these eyes from tears and bid rejoice       this heart with anguish wild   thy mother boy thou hast not known   so soon she left me here to moan   left me to weep and watch alone       our one beloved child    though parted from my aching sight       like homewardspeeding dove   she passed into the perfect light       that floods the world above   yet our twin spirits well i know   though one abide in pain below   love as in summers long ago       and evermore shall love    so with a glad and patient heart       i move toward mine end   the streams that flow awhile apart       shall both in ocean blend   i dare not weep i can but bless   the love that pitied my distress   and lent me in lifes wilderness       so sweet and true a friend    but if there beo if there be       a truth in what they say   that angelforms we cannot see       go with us on our way   then surely she is with me here   i dimly feel her spirit near   the morningmists grow thin and clear       and death brings in the day  april 1868   illustration     solitude     i love the stillness of the wood     i love the music of the rill   i love to couch in pensive mood         upon some silent hill    scarce heard beneath yon arching trees     the silvercrested ripples pass   and like a mimic brook the breeze         whispers among the grass    here from the world i win release     nor scorn of men nor footstep rude   break in to mar the holy peace         of this great solitude    here may the silent tears i weep     lull the vexed spirit into rest   as infants sob themselves to sleep         upon a mothers breast    but when the bitter hour is gone     and the keen throbbing pangs are still   oh sweetest then to couch alone         upon some silent hill    to live in joys that once have been     to put the cold world out of sight   and deck lifes drear and barren scene         with hues of rainbowlight    for what to man the gift of breath     if sorrow be his lot below   if all the day that ends in death         be dark with clouds of woe    shall the poor transport of an hour     repay long years of sore distress   the fragrance of a lonely flower         make glad the wilderness    ye golden hours of lifes young spring     of innocence of love and truth   bright beyond all

and soar to her home in the skies       beatrice blessing and blessed to be       beatrice still as i gaze on thee   visions of two sweet maids arise     whose life was of yesterday    of a beatrice pale and stern     with the lips of a dumb despair   with the innocent eyes that yearn       yearn for the young sweet hours of life       far from sorrow and far from strife   for the happy summers that never return     when the world seemed good and fair    of a beatrice glorious bright     of a sainted ethereal maid   whose blue eyes are deep fountains of light       cheering the poet that broodeth apart       filling with gladness his desolate heart   like the moon when she shines thro a cloudless night     on a world of silence and shade    and the visions waver and faint     and the visions vanish away   that my fancy delighted to paint       she is here at my side a living child       with the glowing cheek and the tresses wild   nor deathpale martyr nor radiant saint     yet stainless and bright as they    for i think if a grim wild beast     were to come from his charnelcave   from his junglehome in the east       stealthily creeping with bated breath       stealthily creeping with eyes of death   he would all forget his dream of the feast     and crouch at her feet a slave    she would twine her hand in his mane     she would prattle in silvery tone   like the tinkle of summerrain       questioning him with her laughing eyes       questioning him with a glad surprise   till she caught from those fierce eyes again     the love that lit her own    and be sure if a savage heart     in a mask of human guise   were to come on her here apart       bound for a dark and a deadly deed       hurrying past with pitiless speed   he would suddenly falter and guiltily start     at the glance of her pure blue eyes    nay be sure if an angel fair     a bright seraph undefiled   were to stoop from the trackless air       fain would she linger in glad amaze       lovingly linger to ponder and gaze   with a sisters love and a sisters care     on the happy innocent child  dec 4 1862   illustration     stolen waters     the light was faint and soft the air         that breathed around the place   and she was lithe and tall and fair         and with a wayward grace         her queenly head she bare    with glowing cheek with gleaming eye         she met me on the way   my spirit owned the witchery         within her smile that lay   i followed her i knew not why    the trees were thick with many a fruit         the grass with many a flower   my soul was dead my tongue was mute         in that accursëd hour    and in my dream with silvery voice         she said or seemed to say   youth is the season to rejoice         i could not choose but stay         i could not say her nay    she plucked a branch above her head         with rarest fruitage laden   drink of the juice sir knight she said         tis good for knight and maiden    oh blind mine eye that would not trace     oh deaf mine ear that would not heed   the mocking smile upon her face         the mocking voice of greed    i drank the juice and straightway felt         a fire within my brain   my soul within me seemed to melt         in sweet delirious pain    sweet is the stolen draught she said         hath sweetness stint or measure   pleasant the secret hoard of bread         what bars us from our pleasure    yea take we pleasure while we may         i heard myself replying   in the red sunset far away         my happier life was dying   my heart was sad my voice was gay    and unawares i knew not how     i kissed her dainty fingertips   i kissed her on the lily brow     i kissed her on the false false lips   that burning kiss i feel it now    true love gives true love of the best     then take i cried my heart to thee   the very heart from out my breast     i plucked i gave it willingly     her very heart she gave to me   then died the glory from the west    in the gray light i saw her face     and it was withered old and gray   the flowers were fading in their place     were fading with the fading day    forth from her like a hunted deer     through all that ghastly night i fled   and still behind me seemed to hear         her fierce unflagging tread   and scarce drew breath for fear    yet marked i well how strangely seemed     the heart within my breast to sleep   silent it lay or so i dreamed         with never a throb or leap    for hers was now my heart she said     the heart that once had been mine own   and in my breast i bore instead         a cold cold heart of stone   so grew the morning overhead    the sun shot downward through the trees         his old familiar flame   all ancient sounds upon the breeze         from copse and meadow came         but i was not the same    they call me mad i smile i weep         uncaring how or why   yea when ones heart is laid asleep         what better than to die   so that the grave be dark and deep    to die to die and yet methinks         i drink of life today   deep as the thirsty traveler drinks         of fountain by the way   my voice is sad my heart is gay    when yestereve was on the wane         i heard a clear voice singing   so sweetly that like summerrain         my happy tears came springing   my human heart returned again          a rosy child   sitting and singing in a garden fair       the joy of hearing seeing       the simple joy of being   or twining rosebuds in the golden hair       that ripples free and wild          a sweet pale child   wearily looking to the purple west       waiting the great forever       that suddenly shall sever   the cruel chains that hold her from her rest       by earthjoys unbeguiled          an angelchild   gazing with living eyes on a dead face       the mortal form forsaken       that none may now awaken   that lieth painless moveless in her place       as though in death she smiled          be as a child   so shalt thou sing for very joy of breath       so shalt thou wait thy dying       in holy transport lying   so pass rejoicing through the gate of death       in garment undefiled    then call me what they will i know         that now my soul is glad   if this be madness better so         far better to be mad   weeping or smiling as i go    for if i weep it is that now     i see how deep a loss is mine   and feel how brightly round my brow         the coronal might shine   had i but kept mine early vow    and if i smile it is that now     i see the promise of the years   the garland waiting for my brow

  oh robin thou didst love me well       till on a bitter day   she came the lady isabel       and stole thy heart away   my tears are vain i live again       in days that used to be   when i could meet thy welcome feet       beneath the willowtree    oh willow gray i may not stay       till spring renew thy leaf   but i will hide myself away       and nurse a lonely grief   it shall not dim lifes joy for him       my tears he shall not see   while he is by ill come not nigh       my weeping willowtree    but when i die oh let me lie       beneath thy loving shade   that he may loiter careless by       where i am lowly laid   and let the white white marble tell       if he should stoop to see   here lies a maid that loved thee well       beneath the willowtree  1859     only a womans hair     only a womans hair fling it aside     a bubble on lifes mighty stream   heed it not man but watch the broadening tide         bright with the western beam    nay in those words there rings from other years     the echo of a long low cry   where a proud spirit wrestles with its tears         in loneliest agony    and as i touch that lock strange visions throng     upon my soul with dreamy grace   of womans hair the theme of poets song         in every time and place    a childs bright tresses by the breezes kissed     to sweet disorder as she flies   veiling beneath a cloud of golden mist         flushed cheek and laughing eyes    or fringing like a shadow ravenblack     the glory of a queenlike face   or from a gipsys sunny brow tossed back         in wild and wanton grace    or crownlike on the hoary head of age     whose tale of life is wellnigh told   or last in dreams i make my pilgrimage         to bethany of old    i see the feastthe purple and the gold     the gathering crowd of pharisees   whose scornful eyes are centred to behold         yon woman on her knees    the stifled sob rings strangely on mine ears     wrung from the depth of sins despair   and still she bathes the sacred feet with tears         and wipes them with her hair    he scorned not then the simple loving deed     of her the lowest and the last   then scorn not thou but use with earnest heed         this relic of the past    the eyes that loved it once no longer wake     so lay it by with reverent care   touching it tenderly for sorrows sake         it is a womans hair  feb 17 1862   illustration     the sailors wife     see there are tears upon her face     tears newly shed and scarcely dried   close in an agonised embrace     she clasps the infant at her side    peace dwells in those softlidded eyes     those parted lips that faintly smile   peace the foretaste of paradise     in heart too young for care or guile    no peace that mothers features wear     but quivering lip and knotted brow   and broken mutterings all declare     the fearful dream that haunts her now    the stormwind rushing through the sky     wails from the depths of cloudy space   shrill piercing as the seamans cry     when death and he are face to face    familiar tones are in the gale     they ring upon her startled ear   and quick and low she pants the tale     that tells of agony and fear    still that phantomship is nigh     with a vexed and lifelike motion   all beneath an angry sky     rocking on an angry ocean    round the straining mast and shrouds     throng the spirits of the storm   darkly seen through driving clouds     bends each gaunt and ghastly form    see the good ship yields at last     dumbly yields and fights no more   driving in the frantic blast     headlong on the fatal shore    hark i hear her battered side     with a low and sullen shock   dashed amid the foaming tide     full upon a sunken rock    his face shines out against the sky     like a ghost so cold and white   with a dead despairing eye     gazing through the gathered night    is he watching through the dark     where a mocking ghostly hand   points a faint and feeble spark     glimmering from the distant land    sees he in this hour of dread     hearth and home and wife and child   loved ones who in summers fled     clung to him and wept and smiled    reeling sinks the fated bark     to her tomb beneath the wave   must he perish in the dark     not a hand stretched out to save    see the spirits how they crowd     watching death with eyes that burn   waves rush in she shrieks aloud     ere her waking sense return    the storm is gone the skies are clear     hushd is that bitter cry of pain   the only sound that meets her ear     the heaving of the sullen main    though heaviness endure the night     yet joy shall come with break of day   she shudders with a strange delight     the fearful dream is passd away    she wakes the grey dawn streaks the dark     with early song the copses ring   far off she hears the watchdog bark     a joyful bark of welcoming  feb 23 1857   illustration     after three days         i stood within the gate   of a great temple mid the living stream   of worshipers that thronged its regal state       fairpictured in my dream        jewels and gold were there   and floors of marble lent a crystal sheen   to body forth as in a lower air       the wonders of the scene        such wild and lavish grace   had whispers in it of a coming doom   as richest flowers lie strown about the face       of her that waits the tomb        the wisest of the land   had gathered there three solemn trystingdays   for high debate men stood on either hand       to listen and to gaze        the aged brows were bent   bent to a frown half thought and half annoy   that all their stores of subtlest argument       were baffled by a boy        in each averted face   i marked but scorn and loathing till mine eyes   fell upon one that stirred not in his place       tranced in a dumb surprise        surely within his mind   strange thoughts are born until he doubts the lore   of those old men blind leaders of the blind       whose kingdom is no more        surely he sees afar   a day of death the stormy future brings   the crimson setting of the heraldstar       that led the eastern kings        thus as a sunless deep   mirrors the shining heights that crown the bay   so did my soul create anew in sleep       the picture seen by day        gazers came and went   a restless hum of voices marked the spot   in varying shades of critic discontent       prating they knew not what        where is the comely limb   the form attuned in every perfect part   the beauty that we should desire in him       ah fools and slow of heart        look into those deep eyes   deep as the grave and strong with love divine   those tender pure and fathomless mysteries       that seem to pierce through thine        look into those deep eyes   stirred to unrest by breath of coming strife   until a longing in thy soul arise       that this indeed were life        that thou couldst find him there   bend at his sacred feet thy willing knee   and from thy heart pour out the passionate prayer       lord let me follow thee        but see the crowd divide   mother and sire have found their lost one now   the gentle voice that fain would seem to chide       whispers son why hast thou        in tone of sad amaze   thus dealt with us that art our dearest thing   behold thy sire and i three weary days       have sought thee sorrowing        and i had stayed to hear   the loving words how is it that ye sought   but that the sudden lark with matins clear       severed the links of thought        then over all there fell   shadow and silence and my dream was fled   as fade the phantoms of a wizards cell       when the dark charm is said        yet in the gathering light   i lay with halfshut eyes that would not wake   lovingly clinging to the skirts of night       for that sweet visions sake  feb 16 1861   illustration     faces in the fire     the night creeps onward sad and slow   in these red embers dying glow   the forms of fancy come and go    an islandfarmbroad seas of corn   stirred by the wandering breath of morn   the happy spot where i was born    the picture fadeth in its place   amid the glow i seem to trace   the shifting semblance of a face    tis now a little childish form   red lips for kisses pouted warm   and elflocks tangled in the storm    tis now a grave and gentle maid   at her own beauty half afraid   shrinking and willing to be stayed    oh time was young and life was warm   when first i saw that fairyform   her dark hair tossing in the storm    and fast and free these pulses played   when last i met that gentle maid   when last her hand in mine was laid    those locks of jet are turned to gray   and she is strange and far away   that might have been mine own today    that might have been mine own my dear   through many and many a happy year   that might have sat beside me here    ay changeless through the changing scene   the ghostly whisper rings between   the dark refrain of might have been    the race is oer i might have run   the deeds are past i might have done   and sere the wreath i might have won    sunk is the last faint flickering blaze   the vision of departed days   is vanished even as i gaze    the pictures with their ruddy light   are changed to dust and ashes white   and i am left alone with night  jan 1860   illustration     a lesson in latin     our
