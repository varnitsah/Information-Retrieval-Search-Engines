54288622	sailors knots  by ww jacobs   1909    the head of the family   mr letts had left his ship by mutual arrangement and the whole of the crew had mustered to see him off and to express their sense of relief at his departure  after some years spent in long voyages he had fancied a trip on a coaster as a change and the schooner curlew having no use for a ships carpenter had shipped as cook  he had done his best and the unpleasant epithets that followed him along the quay at dunchurch as he followed in the wake of his seachest were the result  master and mate nodded in grim appreciation of the crews efforts  illustration after some years spent in long voyages  he put his chest up at a seamens lodginghouse and by no means perturbed at this sudden change in his fortunes sat on a seat overlooking the sea with a cigarette between his lips forming plans for his future  his eyes closed and he opened them with a start to find that a middleaged woman of pleasant but careworn appearance had taken the other end of the bench  fine day said mr letts lighting another cigarette  the woman assented and sat looking over the sea  ever done any cooking  asked mr letts presently  plenty was the surprised reply  why  i just wanted to ask you how long you would boil a bit o beef said mr letts  only from curiosity i should never ship as cook again  he narrated his experience of the last few days and finding the listener sympathetic talked at some length about himself and his voyages also of his plans for the future  i lost my son at sea said the woman with a sigh  you favor him rather  mr lettss face softened  sorry he said  sorry you lost him i mean  at least i suppose he would have been like you said the other but its nine years ago now  he was just sixteen  mr lettsafter a calculationnodded  just my age he said  i was twentyfive last march  sailed for melbourne said the woman  my only boy  mr letts cleared his throat sympathetically  his father died a week after he sailed continued the other and three months afterwards my boys ship went down  two years ago like a fool i married again  i dont know why im talking to you like this  i suppose it is because you remind me of him  you talk away as much as you like said mr letts kindly  ive got nothing to do  he lit another cigarette and sitting in an attitude of attention listened to a recital of domestic trouble that made him congratulate himself upon remaining single  since i married mr green i cant call my soul my own said the victim of matrimony as she rose to depart  if my poor boy had lived things would have been different  his father left the house and furniture to him and thats all my second married me for im sure  that and the bit o money that was left to me  hes selling some of my boys furniture at this very moment  thats why i came out i couldnt bear it  praps hell turn up after all said mr letts  never say die  mrs green shook her head  i spose said mr letts regarding heri spose you dont let lodgings for a night or two  mrs green shook her head again  it dont matter said the young man  only i would sooner stay with you than at a lodginghouse  ive taken a fancy to you  i say it would be a lark if you did and i went there and your husband thought i was your son wouldnt it  mrs green caught her breath and sitting down again took his arm in her trembling fingers  suppose she said unsteadilysuppose you came round and pretended to be my sonpretended to be my son and stood up for me  mr letts stared at her in amazement and then began to laugh  nobody would know continued the other quickly  we only came to this place just before he sailed and his sister was only ten at the time she wouldnt remember  mr letts said he couldnt think of it and sat staring with an air of great determination at the sea  arguments and entreaties left him unmoved and he was just about to express his sorrow for her troubles and leave when she gave a sudden start and put her arm through his  here comes your sister she exclaimed  mr letts started in his turn  she has seen me holding your arm continued mrs green in a tense whisper  its the only way i can explain it  mind your name is jack foster and hers is betty  mr letts gazed at her in consternation and then raising his eyes regarded with much approval the girl who was approaching  it seemed impossible that she could be mrs greens daughter and in the excitement of the moment he nearly said so  betty said mrs green in a voice to which nervousness had imparted almost the correct notebetty this is your brother jack  mr letts rose sheepishly and then to his great amazement a pair of strong young arms were flung round his neck and a pair of warm lips after but slight troublefound his then and there mr lettss mind was made up  illustration then and there mr lettss mind was made up  oh jack  said miss foster and began to cry softly  oh jack  said mrs green and moved by thoughts perhaps of what might have been began to cry too  there there said mr letts  he drew miss foster to the seat and sitting between them sat with an arm round each  there was nothing in sight but a sail or two in the far distance and he allowed miss fosters head to lie upon his shoulder undisturbed  an only child and an orphan he felt for the first time the blessing of a sisters love  why didnt you come home before murmured the girl  mr letts started and squinted reproachfully at the top of her hat  then he turned and looked at mrs green in search of the required information he was shipwrecked said mrs green  i was shipwrecked repeated mr letts nodding  and had brainfever after it through being in the water so long and lost his memory continued mrs green  its wonderful what water will dosalt water said mr letts in confirmation  miss foster sighed and raising the hand which was round her waist bent her head and kissed it  mr letts colored and squeezed her convulsively  assisted by mrs green he became reminiscent and in a low voice narrated such incidents of his career as had escaped the assaults of the brainfever  that his head was not permanently injured was proved by the perfect manner in which he remembered incidents of his childhood narrated by his newly found mother and sister  he even volunteered one or two himself which had happened when the latter was a year or two old  and now said mrs green in a somewhat trembling voice we must go and tell your stepfather  mr letts responded but without briskness and with such moral support as an arm of each could afford walked slowly back  arrived at a road of substantial cottages at the back of the town mrs green gasped and coming to a standstill nodded at a van that stood halfway up the road  there it is she exclaimed  what demanded mr letts  the furniture i told you about said mrs green  the furniture that your poor father thought such a lot of because it used to belong to his grandfather  hes selling it to simpson though i begged and prayed him not to  mr letts encouraged himself with a deep cough  my furniture he demanded  mrs green took courage  yes she said hopefully your father left it to you  mr letts carrying his head very erect took a firmer grip of their arms and gazed steadily at a disagreeablelooking man who was eying them in some astonishment from the doorway  with arms still linked they found the narrow gateway somewhat difficult but they negotiated it by a turning movement and standing in the front garden waited while mrs green tried to find her voice  illustration a disagreeablelooking man was eying them in some astonishment from the doorway  jack she said at last this is your stepfather  mr letts in some difficulty as to the etiquette on such occasions released his right arm and extended his hand  goodevening stepfather he said cheerfully  mr green drew back a little and regarded him unfavorably  wewe thought you was drowned he said at last  i was nearly said mr letts  we all thought so pursued mr green grudgingly  everybody thought so  he stood aside as a short hotfaced man with a small bureau clasped in his arms and supported on his knees emerged from the house and staggered towards the gate  mr letts reflected  halloa he said suddenly  why are you moving mother  mrs green sniffed sadly and shook her head  well said mr letts with an admirable stare whats that chap doing with my furniture  eh spluttered mr green  what  i say whats he doing with my furniture  repeated mr letts sternly  mr green waved his arm  thats all right he said conclusively hes bought it  your mother knows  but it aint all right said mr letts  here bring that back and those chairs too  the dealer who had just placed the bureau on the tailboard of the van came back wiping his brow with his sleeve  wots the little game he demanded  mr letts left the answer to mr green and going to the van took up the bureau and walked back to the house with it  mr green and the dealer parted a little at his approach and after widening the parting with the bureau he placed it in the front room while he went back for the chairs he came back with three of them and was not without reason called a porcupine by the indignant dealer  he was relieved to find after mr simpson had taken his departure that mr green was in no mood for catechising him and had evidently accepted the story of his escape and return as a particularly disagreeable fact so disagreeable that the less he heard of it the better  i hope youve not come home after all these years to make things unpleasant  he remarked presently as they sat at tea  i couldnt be unpleasant if i tried said mr letts  weve been very happy and comfortable hereme and your mother and sister continued mr green  havent we emily  yes said his wife with nervous quickness  and i hope youll be the same said mr green  its my wish that you should make yourself quite comfortable heretill you go to sea again  thankee said mr letts but i dont think i shall go to sea any more ships carpenter is my trade and ive been told more than once that i should do better ashore  besides i dont want to lose mother and betty again  he placed his arm round the girls waist and drawing her head on to his shoulder met with a blank stare the troubled gaze of mrs green  im told theres wonderful openings for carpenters in australia said mr green trying to speak in level tones  wonderful  a good carpenter can make a fortune there in ten years so im told  mr letts with a slight wink at mrs green and a reassuring squeeze with his left arm turned an attentive ear  o course theres a difficulty he said slowly as mr green finished a vivid picture of the joys of carpentering in australia  difficulty said the other  money to start with explained mr letts  its no good starting without money  i wonder how much this house and furniture would fetch is it all mine mother  mmmost of it stammered mrs green gazing in a fascinated fashion at the contorted visage of her husband  all except a chair in the kitchen and three stairrods said betty  speak when youre spoke to miss  snarled her stepfather  when we married we mixed our furniture up togethermixed it up so that it would be impossible to tell which is which  nobody could  for the matter o that you could have all the kitchen chairs and all the stairrods said mr letts generously  however i dont want to do anything in a hurry and i shouldnt dream of going to australia without betty  it rests with her  shes going to be married said mr green hastily and if she wasnt she wouldnt turn her poor ailing mother out of house and home that im certain of  shes not that sort  weve had a word or two at timesme and herbut i know a good daughter when i see one  married  echoed mr letts as his left arm relaxed its pressure  who to  young fellow o the name of henry widden replied mr green a very steady young fellow a great friend of mine  oh said mr letts blankly  id got an idea which ive been keeping as a little surprise continued mr green speaking very rapidly of them living here with us and saving houserent and furniture  mr letts surveyed him with a dejected eye  it would be a fine start for them continued the benevolent mr green  mr letts by a strong effort regained his composure  i must have a look at him first he said briskly  he mightnt meet with my approval  eh said mr green starting  why if betty  i must think it over interrupted mr letts with a wave of his hand betty is only nineteen and as head of the family i dont think she can marry without my consent  im not sure but i dont think so anyway if she does i wont have her husband here sitting in my chairs eating off my tables sleeping in my beds wearing out my stairrods helping himself  stow it said miss foster calmly  mr letts started and lost the thread of his discourse  i must have a look at him he concluded lamely he may be all right but then again he mightnt  he finished his tea almost in silence and the meal over emphasized his position as head of the family by taking the easychair a piece of furniture sacred to mr green and subjecting that injured man to a catechism which strained his powers of endurance almost to breaking point  well i shant make any change at present said mr letts when the task was finished  theres plenty of room here for us all and so long as you and me agree things can go on as they are  tomorrow morning i shall go out and look for a job  he found a temporary one almost at once and determined to make a favorable impression worked hard all day  he came home tired and dirty and was about to go straight to the washhouse to make his toilet when mr green called him in  my friend mr widden he said with a satisfied air as he pointed to a slight fair young man with a welltrimmed moustache  mr letts shook hands  fine day said mr widden  beautiful said the other  ill come in and have a talk about it when ive had a wash  me and miss foster are going out for a bit of a stroll said mr widden  quite right agreed mr letts  much more healthy than staying indoors all the evening  if you just wait while i have a wash and a bit o something to eat ill come with you  cocome with us  said mr widden after an astonished pause  mr letts nodded  you see i dont know you yet he explained and as head of the family i want to see how you behave yourself  properly speaking my consent ought to have been asked before you walked out with her still as everybody thought i was drowned ill say no more about it  mr green knows all about me said mr widden rebelliously  its nothing to do with him declared mr letts  and besides hes not what i should call a judge of character  i dare say you are all right but im going to see for myself  you go on in the ordinary way with your lovemaking without taking any notice of me  try and forget im watching you  be as natural as you can be and if you do anything i dont like ill soon tell you of it  the bewildered mr widden turned but reading no hope of assistance in the infuriated eyes of mr green appealed in despair to betty  i dont mind she said  why should i  mr widden could have supplied her with many reasons but he refrained and sat in sulky silence while mr letts got ready  from his point of view the experiment was by no means a success his efforts to be natural being met with amazed glances from mr letts and disdainful requests from miss foster to go home if he couldnt behave himself  when he relapsed into moody silence mr letts cleared his throat and spoke  theres no need to be like a monkeyonastick and at the same time theres no need to be sulky he pointed out theres a happy medium  like you i spose said the frantic suitor  like me said the other gravely  now you watch fall in behind and watch  he drew miss fosters arm through his and leaning towards her with tender deference began a long conversation  at the end of ten minutes mr widden intimated that he thought he had learned enough to go on with  ah thats only your conceit said mr letts over his shoulder  i was afraid you was conceited  he turned to miss foster again and mr widden with a despairing gesture abandoned himself to gloom  he made no further interruptions but at the conclusion of the walk hesitated so long on the doorstep that mr letts had to take the initiative  goodnight he said shaking hands  come round tomorrow night and ill give you another lesson  youre a slow learner thats what you are a slow learner  he gave mr widden a lesson on the following evening but cautioned him sternly against imitating the display of brotherly fondness of which in a secluded lane he had been a wideeyed observer  when youve known her as long as i havenineteen years said mr letts as the other protested thingsll be a bit different  i might not be here for one thing  by exercise of great selfcontrol mr widden checked the obvious retort and walked doggedly in the rear of miss foster  then hardly able to believe his ears he heard her say something to mr letts  eh said that gentleman in amazed accents  you fall behind said miss foster  thatthats not the way to talk to the head of the family said mr letts feebly  its the way i talk to him rejoined the girl  it was a position for which mr letts was totally unprepared and the satisfied smile of mr widden as he took the vacant place by no means improved matters  in a state of considerable dismay mr letts dropped farther and farther behind until looking up he saw miss foster attended by her restive escort quietly waiting for him  an odd look in her eyes as they met his gave him food for thought for the rest of the evening  at the end of what mr letts was pleased to term a months trial mr widden was still unable to satisfy him as to his fitness for the position of brotherinlaw  in a spirit of gloom he made suggestions of a mutinous nature to mr green but that gentleman who had returned one day pale and furious but tamed from an interview that related to his treatment of his wife held out no hopes of assistance  i wash my hands of him he said bitterly  you stick to it thats all you can do  they lost me last night said the unfortunate  i stayed behind just to take a stone out of my shoe and the earth seemed to swallow them up hes so strong  thats the worst of it  strong said mr green  mr widden nodded  tuesday evening he showed her how he upset a man once and stood him on his head he said irritably  i was what he showed her with  stick to it counselled mr green again  a brother and sister are bound to get tired of each other before long its nature  mr widden sighed and obeyed  but brother and sister showed no signs of tiring of each others company while they displayed unmistakable signs of weariness with his  and three weeks later mr letts in a few wellchosen words kindly but firmly dismissed him  i should never give my consent he said gravely so its only wasting your time  you run off and play  mr widden ran off to mr green but before he could get a word out discovered that something unusual had happened  mrs green a picture of distress sat at one end of the room with a handkerchief to her eyes mr green in a condition compounded of joy and rage was striding violently up and down the room  hes a fraud he shouted  a fraud  ive had my suspicions for some time and this evening i got it out of her  mr widden stared in amazement  i got it out of her repeated mr green pointing at the trembling woman  hes no more her son than what you are  what said the amazed listener  shes been deceiving me said mr green with a scowl but i dont think shell do it again in a hurry  you stay here he shouted as his wife rose to leave the room  i want you to be here when he comes in  mrs green stayed and the other two heedless of her presence discussed the situation until the front door was heard to open and mr letts and betty came into the room  with a little cry the girl ran to her mother  whats the matter she cried  shes lost another son said mr green with a ferocious sneera flash bullying ugly chap of the name o letts  halloa said mr letts starting  a chap she picked up out of the street and tried to pass off on me as her son continued mr green raising his voice  she aint heard the end of it yet i can tell you  mr letts fidgeted  you leave her alone he said mildly  its true im not her son but it dont matter because ive been to see a lawyer about her and he told me that this house and half the furniture belongs by law to betty  its got nothing to do with you  indeed  said mr green  now you take yourself off before i put the police on to you  take your face off these premises  mr letts scratching his head looked vaguely round the room  go on  vociferated mr green  or will you have the police to put you out  mr letts cleared his throat and moved towards the door  you stick up for your rights my girl he said turning to betty  if he dont treat your mother well give him back his kitchen chair and his three stairrods and pack him off  henry said mr green with dangerous calm go and fetch a policeman  im going said mr letts hastily  goodby betty goodby mother i shant be long  im only going as far as the postoffice  and that reminds me  ive been talking so much that i quite forget to tell you that betty and me were married yesterday morning  he nodded pleasantly at the stupefied mr green and turning to mr widden gave him a friendly dig in the ribs with his finger  whats mine is bettys he said in a clear voice and whats bettys is mine  dye understand stepfather  he stepped over to mrs green and putting a strong arm around her raised her to her feet  and whats mine is mothers he concluded and helping her across the room placed her in the best armchair  illustration whats mine is mothers
